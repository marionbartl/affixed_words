From the horror at St. Andrews , the title clincher at Old Trafford to Bergkamp ’s operational masterclass against Everton , here are six matches of the noughties .
______________________________________________________________________________
1. Birmingham 2 - 2 Arsenal : 23 February , 2008
When the fixture computer threw this one up at the start of the season , it was only expecting an innocent encounter .
Arsenal entered the lunchtime kick - off game five points ahead of Manchester United and sensed the opportunity to really pull away from the eventual champions .
But the last couple of games had indicated the rails were beginning to come off for Arsenal ; the mauling by Manchester United in the FA Cup , followed by a disappointing if not entirely unsatisfactory draw against a sluggish Milan side in the Champions League .
Team spirit was also breaking apart ; Lassana Diarra had left the Gunners without much sympathy , Gilberto Silva had become marginalised due to the Flamini ’s impact , and Adebayor and Bendtner ’s on - field spat in the 5 - 1 defeat to Tottenham showed just how tense the side had become as the smell of the Premier League crown drew closer .
But that was soon to be tested like no other at St. Andrews .
Only three minutes in and horror struck .
Eduardo had shuffled the ball past Martin Taylor and was felled by the defender ’s challenge .
It looked innocuous enough but the Arsenal players ’ reactions said it all .
Fabregas with his hands on his forehead ; Matthieu Flamini and he hastily gesticulating to the Arsenal physio staff to tender quickly to the pitch .
It took seven minutes career ( and life ) saving minutes to treat the Croatian and in that time the Arsenal players were visibly shaken , Emmanuel Adebayor pacing up and down the other side of the pitch , muttering to himself .
When play resumed , the Gunners looked tentative despite dominating and were dealt a big blow to their title hopes when James McFadden had curled a free - kick in before half - time .
The Arséne Wenger team talk had to be it ’s best ever and it looked like it worked .
Theo Walcott scored a quick - fire a double to put Arsenal in front and from then on in , it should have been plain sailing .
But this was no ordinary season and in the last minute , Gael Clichy receiving the ball at the edge of his own area , inexplicably took his eye off the ball and that split second was enough for Stuart Parnaby to make the most out of Clichy ’s tackle .
The referee pointed to the spot and for one , William Gallas , it was all too much as the captain decided to watch the resulting spot - kick from the halfway line .
Adebayor could have had a penalty when he had his shorts unashamedly pulled by Nafti but the referee deemed it not inappropriate to check the contents of Adebayor ’s pants .
When the final whistle blew , Gallas had to be off the pitch by Wenger , this before damaging the advertising boards in fury .
Wenger ’s post match interview ensured it did n’t end there .
The Frenchman says that football is a fragile sport and in one game , the spirit he had created had been shattered and their title challenge ultimately faded away for another year .
2. Barcelona 2 - 1 Arsenal : 17 May , 2006
The side story for this match was written earlier in the competition , when against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu , a fan ran on to the pitch to hand Thierry Henry a Barcelona shirt .
If Arsenal were to win this game , Henry was sure to pack his bags as he had achieved everything at the club ; lose and well , it was likely to be the same outcome .
( As it was , Henry decided to stay , in the process missing out on a potentially bigger transfer fee than the £ 15 million they got the next year ) .
In Arsenal ’s first Champions League final they were up against a Barcelona side who were at the peak of their powers under Frank Rijkaard and in Ronaldinho , a player who justifiably became player of the decade .
However , the Gunners were dealt a huge blow to their chances when on 18 minutes , Jens Lehmann ’s habit of messing things up in finals reared it ’s ugly head as he rushed out to bring Eto ’o down outside the box .
Ludovic Guily preceded to score but the referee had already blown and the German became the first player in the competition to be dismissed in the final .
Pires was sacrificed in the cruelest final appearance .
But Arsenal did n’t let that get them down , as Eboue fell over the air between Marquez ’s knee and him to win them a free - kick .
Sol Campbell powered in the header to put them in front .
The Gunners had plenty of good chances to win the game but Hleb , Ljungberg and most rueful of all , Henry missed at 1 - 0 up .
As it was , Henrik Larsson came on to sprinkle his magic as he was involved in both goals to turn the tie around .
3. Arsenal 4 - 2 Liverpool : 9 April , 2004
Arsenal were indebted to this man on countless occasions throughout the decade though possibly none more so important than this match .
Liverpool had taken a deserved 2 - 1 lead at half - time as Arsenal ’s unbeaten run was given it ’s most realistic threat yet .
Thierry Henry ’s goal was crucial in settling Arsenal ’s nerve in that period and one sensed that this would be one of those days where the club ’s top scorer was to be called upon again to inspire his side .
And staying true to the feeling , the Frenchman was in catalytic mood scoring a fantastic hat - trick .
This was before he set up the second , as by taking up his typical position on the left he created space for Pires to equalise .
But a minute he produced the moment of pure brilliance that defined the match .
As if he owned the place , Henry did n’t make much effort in getting up the pitch to help the attack but fortunately when the ball did reached him , he set off on an amazing run as the Liverpool defence parted like the Red Sea before tucking the ball past Dudek .
When the hat - trick was completed , he made it seem like a formality taken the ball down from Bergkamp ’s pass before slotting home .
The title may have been presented at White Hart Lane but it was victories like this and the 2 - 1 win t0 Leicester that won them the league as the remained unbeaten .
4. Manchester United 0 - 1 Arsenal : 8 May , 2002
Before Arsene Wenger had even in his wildest imaginings , thought of hacking off his closest rivals by claiming his side could go a whole season unbeaten , the best way to do that was to win the title at their own ground .
But Ferguson was adamant that that should n’t be the case and therefore sent his United side out to clearly ruffle a few feathers .
Manchester United were lucky to not receive three red cards in the first half but their ulterior objective ensured they successfully managed to deny the away side a decent sniff at goal .
In truth though , Arsenal were never troubled and were able to contain United for the full ninety minutes as Silvain Wiltord ’s goal wrapped up the double for the Gunners .
Arsenal remained unbeaten away highlighting their resilience and the French striker ’s goal ensured they had found the net in all their league games that season .
5. Arsenal 7 - 0 Everton : 11 May , 2005
You ’d have to be Groundskeeper Willie to conclusively prove the Dennis Bergkamp ’s intention in video in scoring Arsenal ’s greatest goal ever , but at 5 seconds in in this clip , we can attest the only space he could have exploited was to the left of him .
It was this type of operational mastery that set the Dutchman apart and his awareness of space ensured he was at the hub of most of Arsenal attacks in the 7 - 0 mauling of Everton .
The third goal sees Bergkamp running into the space in front of the box and as the ball reaches him , he is instantly surrounded by four defenders .
But with one flick of the boot , he cuts open the defence and frees Patrick Vieira to chip home .
His ability to squeeze and double the size of the pitch set him apart in a generation .
Incidentally in that game , it featured an amalgamation of the Invincibles side and a couple youngsters who were supposedly meant to carry the side through the move to the Emirates .
The final irony was that Edu ’s penalty ( now at Corinthians ) was meant to signal pastures new and onward for the Brazilian but Valencia have since been plunged in the red and their future looks bleak .
6. Arsenal 2 - 0 Juventus : 28 March 2006
It was the match that pitted the former protagonist - in - chief with the new protagonist - in - chief .
Many thought Arsenal would struggle after the departure of Patrick Vieira in the centre and for most of the season they were right .
Arsenal looked good going forward but lacked the resilience at the back .
Wenger saw Europe as an opportunity to breath new life into his charges and decided to switch to a high tempo 4 - 5 - 1 .
The midfielders were detailed to pressure high and in their zones , held together by Gilberto Silva in a compact block and when Arsenal got forward , their synonymous football was still there albeit built round the lone forward of Thierry Henry .
Juventus were never able to get close to Arsenal ’s high intensity pressure , culminating in red cards for Jonathan Zebina and Mauro Camoranesi .
Vieira was dispossessed of the ball by Robert Pires for the first goal as Cesc Fabregas wrong - footed Gigi Buffon before the Spaniard created the second for Henry .
“ If you let Fabregas play he can kill a team , ” said Henry after the game and for many it represented the changing of the guard for Arsenal .
“ It was n’t my target tonight to justify selling Patrick , ” said Wenger .
“ He is a tremendous player and you never lose a player like that without suffering a bit . ”
Fabio Capello was more frustrated with Arsenal ’s tactics , his dictum usually sees teams defend with nine men behind the ball .
“ It ’s difficult to play against a team with 10 players behind the line of the ball , ” he said .
“ There was no space for us . ”
With Arsenal working hard to deny the opposition space , the team went on the longest run in Champions League history without letting in a goal .
Mayweather Versus Pacquiao Fight Finalized
It ’s final and official .
Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao have signed a deal to fight on March 13 , 2010 at a still undecided location to finally determine who is the real pound - for - pound king .
Undefeated Mayweather ( 40 wins , 25 by knockout ) has agreed to fight Pacquiao ( 50 - 3 - 2 , 38 by knockout ) in a 147 - pound limit class with the right to choose any eight - ounce glove brand .
With regards to the money , a 50 - 50 split has been decided with each player guaranteed of $ 25 million which can go up between $ 30 million and $ 50 million after ticket sales .
It is expected to break profits - record set by the Mayweather - Oscar De La Hoya fight in 2007 .
The schedule was also set several days before the Filipino star is set to campaign for his bid of a congressional seat in the province of Saranggani in Southern Philippines .
Three sites are being considered for the much anticipated fight : MGM Grand in Las Vegas , the new Cowboys stadium , also in Vegas and the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans .

The Obama administration has offered up a strange mix of copyright policies in its first year ( both ACTA and Creative Commons , for instance ) , but it has at least made clear that " better copyright law " does not always mean " more copyright protection . "
In the middle of December , for instance , the administration took a stand in support of a World Intellectual Property Organization treaty on copyright exceptions for the blind .
The final bit of the US statement of support is worth quoting in full ( emphasis added ) :
We recognize that some in the international copyright community believe that any international consensus on substantive limitations and exceptions to copyright law would weaken international copyright law .
The United States does not share that point of view .
The United States is committed to both better exceptions in copyright law and better enforcement of copyright law .
Indeed , as we work with countries to establish consensus on proper , basic exceptions within copyright law , we will ask countries to work with us to improve the enforcement of copyright .
This is part and parcel of a balanced international system of intellectual property .
It 's a call for " balanced " copyright taken directly to the WIPO — and it's one opposed by the deepest - pocketed copyright holders .
Here 's why .
No U - turns on the copyright highway
The copyright treaty in question ( PDF ) was proposed by Brazil , Ecuador , and Paraguay in May 2009 as way to guarantee worldwide access to copyrighted materials by the blind .
In its current draft form , the treaty lays out mandatory copyright exceptions that every signatory must adopt .
These include making " accessible " copies of works even without the permission of the copyright holder ( usually on a non-profit basis , and after paying a government - determined fee to the rightsholder ) .
As for DRM , groups making works available for the blind or sight - impaired would be allowed to bypass or break DRM in order to access a work .
This might not sound hugely controversial ; after all , the market for large - print or Braille works is ( relatively ) small and compensation would still need to be paid .
But what bothers big rightsholders is the fact that a WIPO treaty might switch from specifying only mandatory copyright enforcement principles ( the current approach ) to also specifying some mandatory exceptions to copyright .
Is n't that right , Steven Metalitz , DC copyright lawyer extraordinaire and repeated representative of the MPAA and RIAA ?
The uniform approach within this global framework has been to set minimum standards of copyright protection , subject to certain exceptions or limitations which are permissible , but not mandatory .
As a corollary , none of the existing treaties bars national legislation that provides stronger protection than the global minimum standard , or that declines to recognize a permissible limitation or exception ...
The draft treaty would turn this long - standing principle on its head , demanding that signatories limit copyright protection to an extent not even permissible under the existing treaties ...
Viewed in context , the draft treaty appears to many as the not - so - thin edge of a wedge to be driven into the long - standing structure of global copyright norms .
It advocates a U - turn in the approach to global copyright norms that would almost certainly not be restricted to the issue of access for the visually impaired , or even for the disabled community generally .
Adoption of this proposal would be used to justify its radical approach — mandating in national law exceptions and limitations that reach far beyond what would be even permissible under global norms today — in many other fields of copyright law .
Read that again if it did n't sink in .
( It 's from Metalitz 's commentary on the draft treaty ( PDF ) , helpfully provided to the government . )
Providing stronger mandatory copyright protections and enforcement mechanisms ( think ACTA ) is totally normal , right , and proper ; providing stronger exceptions to copyright is " radical " and a " U - turn . "
And in this context , a U - turn would be a Very Bad Thing indeed .
There 's no interest in balance here , and no real attempt to act like there should be .
Copyright protections move naturally and logically in only one direction , toward stronger enforcement mandates .
Governments are allowed to pass certain exemptions to copyright , but if they do n't , and a host of blind people have limited access to certain works , too bad .
The US Chamber of Commerce , while going out of its way to laud the goals of the treaties , has the same objections ( PDF ) : international mandates are only for enforcement , not for exceptions .
The current international intellectual property framework is based on harmonizing national laws or establishing ' minimum standards ' of protection subject to flexibilities that permit limited exceptions ...
The treaty proposal takes the exact opposite approach by seeking to establish ' necessary minimum flexibilities , ' which threaten to undermine existing norms in copyright ...
If the ' minimum flexibilities ' approach were adopted , even in an agreement limited in scope to accessibility of copyrighted works for persons with certain disabilities , this approach could be adopted in other areas well .
In other words , patent and trademark regimes might also be subjected to the humiliation of having to accept mandated limits and exceptions .
The Chamber of Commerce has some ideas about how WIPO might better handle the issue of making works more accessible to the blind ; the main suggestion is supporting " further studies " on how nations around the world handle the issue .
Such a " best practices " report , whenever it might eventually be finished , could then be used to start thinking about a better approach .
WIPO actually already commissioned and received such a report — 230 + pages of just such material , replete with case studies from around the globe , which was published in 2007 .
That report focused on copyright law and how nations handled exceptions for the blind , but the Chamber does n't want copyright law changed ; they would prefer that future reports focus on " the efforts of the private sector " instead .
The treaty as it stands does raise all sorts of legitimate questions .
( Should the traditional " three - step test " for deciding if national copyright exemptions meet international treaty obligations be scrapped , for instance , in favor of mandated exemptions that rely on no such test ?
Can better results be achieved using existing treaties ? )
What 's interesting about the debate is n't the treaty itself but the resistance — indeed , the bewilderment — of those who truly see mandated copyright enforcement as some natural state of affairs for international treaties and who will brook no move to a system that balances mandated enforcement with mandated exemptions .
And what 's more interesting still is that the current stance of the Obama administration on these issues is to challenge this idea .
Take a look again at the statement we opened with : " We recognize that some in the international copyright community believe that any international consensus on substantive limitations and exceptions to copyright law would weaken international copyright law .
The United States does not share that point of view . "
Now , the issue of what constitutes " balanced copyright " is hugely debatable , and it's an argument worth having .
Indeed , the administration may be making a veiled reference to ACTA in its statement that the US will work to " establish consensus on proper , basic exceptions within copyright law , [ and ] will ask countries to work with us to improve the enforcement of copyright . "
In other words , we support a treaty for the blind even as we push for ACTA .
Based on our own reading of the ACTA leaked drafts to date , it 's not yet clear this is really " balance " in any meaningful sense of the word ( and it 's certainly not " transparency " ) , but it is heartening to see the US actually supporting the idea that copyright legislation will need tweaking over time — and that tweaking does not always move in one direction .
When you 're going the wrong way , driving faster is n't the answer ; a U - turn is .

Eight years ago this month , Osama bin Laden walked out of the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan and disappeared into Pakistan .
U.S. intelligence agencies have no real idea where he is today , but it is clear that the world ’s most wanted man and the terrorist organization he leads have reemerged as a powerful force behind the increasingly deadly insurgencies in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Three senior Obama administration officials warned last week that Al Qaeda is more dangerous than at any time in the last 18 months .
They gave the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a frightening bill of particulars : Al Qaeda is providing training and resources for militants attacking U.S. troops in Afghanistan , assisting suicide bombers in Pakistan and helping extremists plot new attacks on India .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described Bin Laden ’s Al Qaeda as a “ syndicate of terrorism . ”
Underscoring the danger , she said the terrorists are seeking nuclear weapons .
If we had captured or killed Bin Laden , the world would look very different today .
His death or imprisonment would not have eliminated the worldwide extremist threat , but our failure to finish the job represents a lost opportunity that altered the course of the conflict in Afghanistan and the future of international terrorism .
It left the American people more vulnerable , and it inflamed the strife that now threatens to engulf Pakistan and Afghanistan .
History is filled with examples demonstrating that terrorist organizations are invariably much stronger with their charismatic leaders than without them .
The capture of Abdullah Ocalan in 1999 weakened the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey , and the imprisonment of Abimael Guzman in 1992 had a similar effect on Peru ’s Shining Path .

The failure to get Bin Laden was not inevitable .
By early December 2001 , he and his deputy , Ayman Zawahiri , were cornered in a complex of caves and tunnels carved into the rugged terrain of eastern Afghanistan , just a few miles from the border with Pakistan .
They endured days of relentless bombing by U.S. aircraft , and Bin Laden clearly expected to be overrun any day by American troops and their Afghan allies .
According to Steve Coll ’s excellent book on the Bin Laden family , the Al Qaeda leader wrote his will on Dec. 14 .
As a recent report by the majority staff of the Foreign Relations Committee made clear , there is no longer any dispute over whether Bin Laden was at Tora Bora .
CIA and Delta Force commanders on the scene told the staff that he was there and described intercepting his voice on radio communications .
Most authoritatively , Bin Laden ’s presence was confirmed by the official history of the U.S. Special Operations Command , which oversees Delta Force , the Green Berets , Navy SEALs and similar special forces .
“ All source reporting corroborated his presence on several days from 9 - 14 December , ” said the unclassified version of the history , which was published with little notice in 2007 .
The final assault that Bin Laden feared never came .
Fewer than 100 U.S. special operations commandos were at Tora Bora , not enough to defeat the entrenched Al Qaeda fighters .
Calls for reinforcements were rejected .
So were requests for U.S. troops to block the exit routes to sanctuary in Pakistan a few miles away .
The vast array of U.S. military power was kept on the sidelines by senior commanders who entrusted one of the primary objectives of the war to airstrikes and unreliable Afghan and Pakistani allies .
Military analysts estimate it would have taken only 2,000 or so American troops to accomplish the mission .
Most would have been deployed on the southern side of Tora Bora to block escape routes to Pakistan .
About 500 would have carried out the final assault from the north .
We had enough troops in or near Afghanistan at the time , and they were trained for this type of unconventional fight in rugged terrain .

More than 1,000 members of two Marine expeditionary units were not far away in Kandahar , but their commander ’s request to move to Tora Bora to encircle Bin Laden was rejected .
Roughly the same number of troops from the Army ’s 10th Mountain Division was split between southern Uzbekistan and Bagram air base , a short helicopter ride from Tora Bora .
Instead , Gen. Tommy Franks left the job to a motley collection of Afghan militiamen and Pakistani Frontier Corps paramilitary fighters who never showed up .
Franks and his boss , Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld , were determined to succeed in Afghanistan with a light footprint .
They justified limiting the number of U.S. troops by saying they wanted to avoid stirring up anti-American sentiment and creating a protracted insurgency .
Unfortunately , in failing to get Bin Laden , we wound up with exactly what we had hoped to avoid in Afghanistan -- and a virulent insurgency across the border in Pakistan , a nuclear - armed ally .
Getting Bin Laden at Tora Bora would have been dangerous , and success was not guaranteed .
Failing to try meant that we had no chance for success .
Our men and women in uniform have been paying the price for eight years and , as 30,000 more of them are preparing to finish the job , we must all remember that we ca n’t ensure our national security by turning our backs on enemies who have sworn to destroy us .

The HTV was unhooked from the ISS by the station 's robotic arm Japan 's new space freighter has burned up in the Earth 's atmosphere after completing its mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The H - II Transfer Vehicle ( HTV ) carried 4.5 tonnes of supplies to the orbiting platform , including scientific equipment for its Kibo laboratory .
The HTV , which had arrived at the ISS in September , was released on Friday .
A series of engine firings then took the vehicle into a controlled but destructive dive over the Pacific .
A statement from the Japanese space agency said the freighter re-entered the atmosphere at 0626 Japan Standard Time ( 2126 GMT Sunday ) .
Most of the vehicle components would have been destroyed although some debris was expected to survive and fall into the ocean , it added .
The HTV is one of Japan 's major contributions to the orbiting space station project and is part of the barter agreement it has with the other station partners to pay its way .
The HTVs that follow in the coming years will play a critical role in servicing the ISS after the US space shuttles are retired .
It is the first spacecraft to visit the ISS which does not drive itself all the way to berthing .
Rather , it simply parks up under the bow of the station to allow the platform 's Canadarm2 to manage the final stage of attachment .
Length : 9.8 m ; Diameter : 4.4 m ; Vehicle Mass : 10.5t ; Max cargo :
6t Pressurised cargo : Food , clothing , water , laptops , science equipment , etc External cargo : Equipment to study Earth 's oceans and the atmosphere First unmanned vehicle to deliver both pressurised and unpressurised cargo
When the US shuttles retire at the end of next year or the beginning of 2011 , the ISS project will become dependent on five robotic freighters for its logistics : • The Russian Progress and European ATV have already demonstrated their flight capability .
Four more ATVs have been booked to fly to the station , one a year starting in 2010 .
• Following on from the first HTV mission , Japan plans a further six flights through to 2015 .
•
Two commercial US suppliers , SpaceX and Orbital Sciences , are in the process of developing their Dragon and Cygnus supply ships .
The first of these is scheduled to deliver supplies to the ISS no earlier than the end of 2010 .
HTV and Dragon are particularly important because of their ability to deliver larger items in their unpressurised compartments that would not normally fit through the docking port of a pressurised compartment .

Alternative version of MCS that avoids the need to pass a queue node as argument .
Due to Marc Auslander , David Edelsohn , Orran Krieger , Bryan Rosenburg , and Robert W. Wisniewski of the K42 group at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center .
Has a spin in release_lock that is local only on a machine that caches remote locations coherently .
Also , as originally designed , has a loop in acquire_lock that can , in principle , perform an unbounded number of remote references , but can reasonably be expected not to do so in practice .
Can be modified to perform only a constant number of remote references , but at the cost of an extra atomic operation on the uncontended path .
As of summer 2006 this lock has not been published in any technical forum , but IBM has applied for a US patent .

About the author
( NewsTarget )
What we eat and what we buy affects our health , environment , and economy .
When the economy turns bad or we lose a war , we throw out the president , but when an obesity epidemic grows to as high as 30 percent in children we make little noise at the political level .
Instead it is left up to our elected officials to implement the changes we desire .
Michelle Obama has recently thrown her clout behind the healthy food movement by encouraging Americans to cook at home more .
In addition to cutting back on processed food and reading food labels , the First Lady is advising Americans to throw out those " sugary sodas , " and has even planted a vegetable garden at the White House .
Voting with your shopping cart can have as much impact as voting for your elected officials .
Vote for your right to healthy food choices on grocery shelves by shopping consciously .
Every time you check out at the grocery store you are telling the stores what you want more or less of in the store .
Grocery stores stock their shelves based on consumer demand so theoretically you can vote every day .
Here are five simple ways to " vote " with your shopping cart : 1 .
Support your local farmers and help put an end to global warming by buying local .
At the Copenhagen Climate Summit , small farmers came from " hamlets and villages " from the four corners of the globe to remind us that produce trucked across the country into your grocery store is contributing to global warming due to the large amount of carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and other harmful pollutants released into the air .
According to these family farmers , " industrial agriculture and the globalized food system are responsible for between 44 and 57 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions .
" 2. Buy organic produce .
In contrast to conventionally grown produce that is full of toxins which are detrimental to your health , organic fruits and vegetables are grown without the use of harmful pesticides or toxic fertilizers .
Eating organic reduces your exposure to these hazardous chemicals .
3 .
No dairy products :
Cow 's milk is full of growth hormones and antibiotics that can lead to conditions ranging from the common cold to cancer .
Try substitutes for milk such as hemp milk , almond milk or rice milk .
By doing so , your grocery store will realize that it can actually profit by making these products more readily available .
4 .
Boycott sodas : Sometimes it is what you choose not to buy that counts .
A recent study conducted by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research ( CHPR ) and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy ( CCPHA ) has finally officially made the connection between soda consumption and obesity .
Funded by the California Endowment , the study found that adults who consumed one or more sodas per day were 27 percent more likely to become overweight than those who do not consume soda .
5 .
Do n't buy anything with high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
This popular sugar substitute is linked to diabetes , obesity , liver problems and a whole host of other problems .
While fructose is a natural sugar , when we combine it with glucose , we not only create table sugar but we also may be creating a molecular monster .
Unlike table sugar , foods high in HFCS have very high levels of reactive carbonyls which can cause tissue damage and diabetes according to Rutgers University researcher Chi-Tang Ho .
Every trip to the grocery store is a vote - Make it count .
Show our leaders that we demand policies that promote access to healthy food by voting with your shopping cart .
Chances are even Michelle will be showing Barack the White House door if he does not provide Americans with healthier food choices .

Bosses who feel incompetent are more likely to bully subordinates , according to a study being published in the journal Psychological Science .
In a paper titled " When the Boss Feels Inadequate , " psychologists Serena Chen of UC Berkeley and Nathanael Fast of the University of Southern California argue that leaders who are in over their heads tend to resort to browbeating to protect their egos .
" If people feel incompetent and they happen to be in a high - powered position , that 's when the aggression kicks in , " Fast said .
" Power has its downsides .
It elevates the standards by which people are judged and can make them less secure to the degree they feel inadequate . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
In four psychological experiments performed on 410 volunteers , mostly drawn from real workplaces , the authors showed how boosting the self - esteem of an insecure boss should lessen overbearing behavior .
" Make them feel good about themselves in some way , " Chen said , suggesting this might mean complimenting a hobby or nonwork activity provided it is " something plausible that does n't sound like you 're sucking up . "
Citing a survey commissioned by the Workplace Bullying Institute , an advocacy group that tracks the issue , the authors estimate that more than one - third of all employees have been sabotaged , yelled at or belittled by a supervisor .
The Institute , which maintains a Web site ( links.sfgate.com / ZIJF ) to help bullied workers cope , argued in a recent opinion article that the phenomena has gotten worse during the recession because it 's harder for employees to get out from under a bad boss ' thumb .
The research paper by the two psychologists focused on the narrow issue of linking a boss ' self - perception of incompetence to domineering behavior .
The researchers did not actually observe workplaces but rather asked volunteers - mainly working people ranging from secretaries to managers - whether they were high or low in the pecking order and how secure they felt about their job performance , and ranked them with questionnaires and exercises designed to measure aggressive tendencies and behaviors .
One experiment put subjects in a role that allowed them to act in a bullying manner , by supposedly setting the volume on a buzzer that would ring if an imaginary subordinate gave a wrong answer to some made - up questions .
Fast said the experiment was designed to determine whether people with a sense of power , coupled with feelings of inadequacy , set the volumes louder , which turned out to be the case .
" They took out their feelings of threat on someone else , " he said .
Another experiment showed that volunteers with high power but low confidence were nicer after writing about something that made them feel good .
It did n't matter whether they wrote about their kids or their cats ; if it made them feel better , potential bullies were less aggressive , Fast said .
Chen said their conclusion was that workplace bullying grew out of a sense of insecurity .
" Our data suggest it 's ultimately about self - worth , " she said .
Since defeating an incumbent in Florida ’s Republican - heavy 8th congressional district last year , Rep. Alan Grayson has emerged as one of the progressive movement ’s most vocal champions .
His attacks on Republican obstruction of healthcare reform and staunch opposition to escalation in Afghanistan have earned Grayson effusive praise from many liberal bloggers and activists .
Even before his election , Grayson gained recognition from the Wall Street Journal for being a " fierce critic of the war in Iraq " who sported a " Bush Lied , People Died " bumper sticker on his car .
Recently , Grayson to CNN , " People want to see a congressman with guts .
And America likes to hear the truth . "
Grayson has battled for the public option and opposed the wars Obama has inherited from Bush .
Of course , these positions are upheld by a broad swath of congressional Democrats and , at least in the case of the public option , are supported by a majority of Americans .
But when it comes to the Israel - Palestine conflict , Grayson is fully programmed by AIPAC and the pro-war , pro-settlements wing of the Israel Lobby .
In an interview in March with the Philadelphia Jewish Voice , Grayson revealed two meetings he held the previous week with AIPAC Executive Director Howard Kohr .
In the interview , Grayson explained how Kohr helped to " educate " him about Israel - related issues , then misquoted the Abba Eban line , " The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity . "
GRAYSON : I met with Howard Kohr , the head of AIPAC [ American Israel Public Affairs Committee ] , twice last week .
PJV : And what was the gist of the conversation ?
GRAYSON : The gist of the conversation was that Iran is a tremendous threat to Israel and needs to be stopped .
And I agree with that .
PJV : And what about what is going on in the Gaza Strip ; was there any conversation about that ?
GRAYSON : Yes , we talked about that .
I think what AIPAC often tries to do is to educate Members of Congress who frankly follow this a lot less closely than I do .
In my case , I read Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post online four or five times a week , so I am pretty familiar with the circumstances and why the war took place .
As a famous Israeli once said , the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
Grayson ’s January 8th statement explaining his vote in favor of Israel ’s assault on the Gaza Strip read like a mimeograph of those released by other AIPAC - friendly members of Congress .
However , its introductory line stood out : " Congressman Alan Grayson , one of three incoming Jewish members of Congress , issued the following statement on the situation in Gaza . "
Why did Grayson feel compelled to advertise his religion in a statement in favor of a war that would ultimately kill 1400 people , including at least 400 women and children , according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza ?
Grayson lately voted to condemn the Goldstone Report that confirmed these figures .
And why does Grayson toe the AIPAC line on Israel ’s wars while fervently opposing the wars America wages in the Middle East to supposedly stamp out Islamic terror ?
Americans would like to the hear the truth .

There seems to be a growing divide in the current U.S. economy .
On the one hand , you have the financial sector swimming in their bailout - induced profits like a modern day Scrooge Mcduck .
In their circles , it appears as if the recession is over .
On the other hand , you have average Americans seeing access to credit cards shut down , equity in their homes vanishing , and their stock portfolios looking a little too much like 1999 .
Then you have 35.8 million Americans , roughly 11 percent of our population , on food stamps .
To this group the recession is still very much alive .
At a recent Alliance for Family Entertainment of the Association of National Advertisers , Wal - Mart gave a sobering look at the current economy :
“ ( NY Times )
There are families not eating at the end of the month , ” said Stephen Quinn , executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Wal - Mart Stores , and “ literally lining up at midnight ” at Wal - Mart stores waiting to buy food when paychecks or government checks land in their accounts . ”
Now this is important since Wal - Mart is in every corner of every American metro area :
The fact that you have people lining up at midnight just waiting to have their paychecks or government checks clear for food is probably something you are not going to see on CNBC but it is happening .
This recession is really creating a split and is also flaming the fires of class warfare .
Average Americans and working class Americans are still dealing with what is known as the Great Recession .
Wal - Mart is looking to meet the new market reality by offering items that meet the new austerity demanded by millions of American families :
“ Among the steps Wal - Mart is taking to address the changes in shopping habits , Mr. Quinn listed an overhaul of the retailer ’s private - label brand , Great Value , which is promoted in commercials describing how families can fix dinners with Great Value products “ for less than $ 2 a serving . ”
For less than $ 2 a serving means millions of families are now needing to stretch their dollar .
So as you might have guessed , having the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve go on a path of dollar weakness actually hurts those at the bottom and middle class the most .
Yet they are concerned more about the financial sector and the chips may fall where they may for the remaining group of Americans .
Punishing the Prudent Saver
Those that save and are cautious with their money , are now being forced to make difficult decisions .
Even holding on to U.S. dollars is not a good move with the way the Fed is systematically devaluing the dollar .
The Fed is artificially keeping rates at record lows so putting your money in a savings account amounts to stuffing it into your mattress .
Take a look at three of the too big to fail ( TBTF ) banks and their savings rates :
All you are doing is giving them your money to hold .
That is it .
A 0.1 or 0.05 annual interest rate is laughable .
Even if we have 0 percent inflation , the U.S. dollar is now down by nearly 20 percent since the March levels .
You have lost money .
Unless , you placed your money into the casino known as Wall Street .
The stock markets are now up by 60 percent since the March lows even though P/E ratios are at historic levels and unemployment is now up to 17.5 percent using the U - 6 rate .
Most of the recent gains are based on cost cutting ( aka layoffs ) and restocking of inventory .
Basically we are seeing companies slim down and using one time gains to capitalize in the current marketplace .
If you doubt this , just take a look at the stunning 9.5 percent growth in worker productivity in Q3 :
The above can be summarized as doing more with less .
Yet this is somehow good news for the average American ?
Those that are prudent are left with very few places to protect their money .
Do they invest in the stock market even though earnings do not justify current lofty prices ?
Do they put their money in the bank and allow the devaluation of the U.S. dollar eat their purchasing power away ?
There are few places to go .
But even with these pathetically low rates at banks , deposit accounts are the only sector that has seen steady growth in the last few years :
Every other major asset class from real estate , equities , to pension reserves has fallen .
Yet savings deposits have steadily increased .
A largely unspoken trend is out there and many people are basically protecting their money at all cost and believe cash is king , even if the cash is slowly being devalued by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
There is little reason to believe that the dollar is going to spike significantly over the long run .
We simply have too much debt :
Add up the above and you arrive at $ 52 trillion in debt .
Home mortgages are $ 10.3 trillion of this amount .
State and local governments struggling with tax revenues have $ 2.3 trillion in debt .
Add in unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities and you can see why we are entering a perfect storm .
Summary
The financially prudent have taken it on the chin with the current bailouts .
The working and middle class Americans are largely caught bailing out the wealthy financial class while confronting the realities that the bailouts were largely designed to protect the banking sector .
Corporate equities and mutual funds have taken major hits in this crisis but the wealthier bond holders have faced minimal cuts .
Examples like AIG paying out to Goldman Sachs only reinforce this horrendous transfer of wealth .
Until the majority of Americans demand action and take to the streets , this pseudo - recovery is going to go on for years until finally Americans wake up and realize that they have given all their wealth to the banks .

iOS 14 brought some changes to what we 've known as the iPhone home screen .
Join me as we discuss the update and what features you 're going to need to know .
The first information about the next version of Microsoft 's Web browser was revealed at PDC on Wednesday .
The announcement described three main areas of improvement : JavaScript , Web standards , and graphics technology .
IE9 will contain a new , significantly faster JavaScript engine , it will have richer support for Web standards like CSS 3 , and it will use the new Direct2D and DirectWrite technology for its graphics and text rendering .
Both the new JavaScript engine and the new graphics technology will improve the browser 's performance .
Microsoft made the point that different websites place different performance demands on a browser .
Some are more scripting intensive , others more graphically intensive ; some have complex layouts , others are simple .
This has the consequence that to improve performance across the board , a wide range of optimizations and improvements are needed .
With IE9 , Redmond intends to not just improve performance in limited benchmarks ( that focus on a single aspect of browser performance ) , but to ensure that real - world websites become faster .
Rendering the webpage in IE8 is performed predominantly on the CPU .
Direct2D is a new Windows API that uses hardware Direct3D acceleration to accelerate 2D graphics , available in Windows 7 and as a patch for Windows Vista .
Through the use of Direct2D , IE9 will perform all graphics rendering on the GPU , providing quicker page rendering , faster , smoother animation , and high quality image scaling .
For graphically intensive applications like Google Maps , this should result in better performance and an improved user experience .
JavaScript performance has become an increasingly important concern for Web applications .
As Web apps have become more capable and more fully - featured , JavaScript engines have had an ever - greater burden placed on them .
Whereas once they might only run a few dozen of lines on a page , today 's rich applications ( Google Apps or the Office Web Apps , say ) now run tens or hundreds of kilobytes of scripting on every page .
To meet these needs , Firefox , Safari , and Chrome have all seen a lot of development effort on their scripting engines to speed up these usage scenarios .
Though IE 's JavaScript engine has got faster — the widely used SunSpider benchmark takes about half the time to run in IE8 as it does in IE7 — it still lags behind other browsers quite considerably .
IE9 is getting a brand - new engine that should take IE 's JavaScript performance to the proverbial next level .
Technical descriptions of the new engine made it sound quite similar to the V8 engine used in Chrome ; the new IE9 JavaScript engine will compile JavaScript into native code , just like in V8 , and the technique it will use to speed up the object - oriented nature of JavaScript also sounded similar to the approach V8 takes .
Early results suggest that the current IE9 engine performs in the same ballpark as betas of Firefox , Safari , and Chrome .
IE is still the slowest , but the difference now ranges from 10 % slower ( compared to Firefox ) to 100 % slower ( compared to Chrome ) , rather than 5-600 % slower as is presently the case for IE8 .
The IE team does not want to be trailing any more , and performance is now clearly a big deal .
Over the years , standards compliance has been the Web development community 's biggest complaint about Internet Explorer .
Though IE was once highly competitive in this area — during the days of the browser wars — its stagnation after the release of IE6 left it far behind .
IE7 made some small improvements , and IE8 did achieve some kind of parity , at least when looking at the fundamental HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1 specifications .
Microsoft made a significant effort with IE8 and arguably its CSS 2.1 compliance was best in class .
However , there is considerable demand among developers for new features : CSS 3 , HTML 5 , SVG , and Canvas .
Many of these standards are still themselves in flux , being in the draft stages of development rather than finalized specifications , but many of their features are so compelling ( HTML 5 's native support for embedded video , CSS 3's rounded corners , Canvas 's extensive graphical capabilities ) that developers want them right now .
At PDC , Microsoft would not commit to supporting any particular features or specifications with IE9 .
The company did state that its focus would be on providing the features that were actually most useful to developers , and ensuring that those features had robust test suites .
IE9 is still in its early days , and there is no hint of a date at which a beta might become available .
Many questions , especially about standards support , remain unanswered .
The switch to Direct2D may also mean an end to XP support ( Direct2D is unavailable on that OS ) .
Nonetheless , the announcements give a strong indication that Microsoft is taking its browser seriously , and wants it to be a viable alternative to its competitors .
Microsoft Xbox 360 Records $ 838 million in November sales , more than all other consoles combined
Microsoft ’s director of product management Aaron Greenberg said yesterday when speaking with Gamespot , that this November was the “ biggest month in the history of the Xbox 360 business . ”
He declared that $ 838 million was spent at US retailers on Xbox 360 games , consoles and accessories .
A total of 1.4 billion was spent in the US on console gaming in November , indicating that Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 controlled a majority of the sales .
The report comes on the heels of both the NPD Group ’s November sales report and a day after Greenberg , on the eve of Halo : Reach ’s world premiere , claimed that Halo : Reach would be the biggest title of 2010 .
Microsoft is really excited about last month , and for good reason .
Modern Warfare 2 , the largest entertainment launch in world history , sold over 6 million units in the US and Canada alone , and the Xbox 360 controlled the majority of those sales , with 4.2 million Xbox 360 copies sold as compared to the 1.87 million sales on Sony ’s Playstation 3 .
While 2009 has seen a large number of hit titles , the NPD Group also reported that sales have been down this year and were down 7.6 % in November .
In a down market , Microsoft seems to be holding its own .
Greenberg also told Gamespot that the Modern Warfare 2 unit sales numbers did not include the $ 400 , limited - edition 250 GB Xbox 360 model that included the game .
While he did n’t specify how many units were sold , he did say that Microsoft would be considering offering more limited edition Xbox 360s given the success of the Modern Warfare 2 edition .
In addition , Microsoft logged a stunning 5.2 million multiplayer hours on Modern Warfare 2 ’s launch day , and 2 million unique users were online at one point .
Considering the monthly subscription rate for Xbox Live Gold , Microsoft undoubtedly profited nicely from Modern Warfare 2 ’s popular multiplayer component .
The premiere of Halo : Reach will debut during the VGA ’s tonight , live on Spike TV at 8 ET .
Terminal Gamer will be blogging live on our website as the event unfolds .

Editor ’s Note :
This post is based on an op - ed article from the print edition of today ’s Financial Times by Lucian Bebchuk , Alma Cohen , and Holger Spamann .
The op - ed article is based on their study , “ The Wages of Failure : Executive pay at Bear Stearns and Lehman 2000 - 2008 , ” which is available
This post is based on an op - ed article from the print edition of today ’s Financial Times by Lucian Bebchuk , Alma Cohen , and Holger Spamann .
The op - ed article is based on their study , “ The Wages of Failure : Executive pay at Bear Stearns and Lehman 2000 - 2008 , ” which is available here .
Although Lucian Bebchuk is a consultant to the US Treasury ’s office of the special master for TARP executive compensation , the views expressed in the post should not be attributed to that office .
According to the standard narrative , the meltdown of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers largely wiped out the wealth of their top executives .
Many – in the media , academia and the financial sector – have used this account to dismiss the view that pay structures caused excessive risk - taking and that reforming such structures is important .
That standard narrative , however , turns out to be incorrect .
It is true that the top executives at both banks suffered significant losses on shares they held when their companies collapsed .
But our analysis , using data from Securities and Exchange Commission filings , shows the banks ’ top five executives had cashed out such large amounts since the beginning of this decade that , even after the losses , their net pay - offs during this period were substantially positive .
In 2000 - 07 , the top five executives at Bear and Lehman pocketed cash bonuses exceeding $ 300 m and $ 150 m respectively ( adjusted to 2009 dollars ) .
Although the financial results on which bonus payments were based were sharply reversed in 2008 , pay arrangements allowed executives to keep past bonuses .
Furthermore , executives regularly took large amounts of money off the table by unloading shares and options .
Overall , in 2000 - 08 the top - five teams at Bear and Lehman cashed out close to $ 2bn in this way : about $ 1.1bn at Bear and $ 850 m at Lehman .
Indeed , the teams sold more shares during the years preceding the firms ’ collapse than they held when the music stopped in 2008 .
Altogether , equity sales and bonuses over that period provided the top five at the two banks with cash of about $ 1.4bn and $ 1bn respectively ( an average of almost $ 250 m each ) .
These cash proceeds considerably exceed the value of the executives ’ holdings at the beginning of 2000 ( which we estimate to be in the order of a respective $ 800 m and $ 600 m ) .
Of course , the executives would have made much more had the banks not blown up .
By contrast to shareholders who stuck with the banks , however , the executives ’ total pay - offs during the period were decidedly in the black .
Our analysis undermines the claims that executives ’ losses on shares during the collapses establish that they did not have incentives to take excessive risks .
The fact that the executives did not sell all the shares they could prior to the meltdown does indicate that they did not anticipate collapse in the near future .
But repeatedly cashing in large amounts of performance - based compensation based on short - term results did provide perverse incentives – incentives to improve short - term results even at the cost of an excessive rise in the risk of large losses at some ( uncertain ) point in the future .
To be sure , executives ’ risk - taking might have been driven by a failure to recognise risks or by excessive optimism , and thus would have taken place even in the absence of these incentives .
But given the structure of executive pay , the possibility that risk - taking was influenced by these incentives should be taken seriously .
The need to reform pay structures is not , as many have claimed , simply a politically convenient sideshow .
Even if the type of incentives given to executives of Bear and Lehman – and others with similar pay structures – were not the cause of risk - taking in the past , they could be in future .
Financial institutions , and the regulators overseeing them , should give the necessary priority to redesigning bonuses and equity - based compensation to avoid rewarding executives for short - term results that are subsequently reversed .
The stories of Lehman and Bear will undoubtedly remain in the annals of financial disaster for decades to come .
To understand what has happened , and what lessons should be drawn , it is important to get the facts right .
In contrast to what has been thus far largely assumed , the executives were richly rewarded for , not financially devastated by , their leadership of their banks during this decade .
No Credit .
No Economy .
“ The great American consumer deleveraging continues , ” our colleagues at The 5 - Minute Forecast observed yesterday .
“ The Fed announced that consumer credit shrank for a record ninth month in a row in October . ”
Consumer credit , as we all know , drives a big chunk of consumer spending , which drives a big chunk of the American economy .
Ergo , no credit ; no economy .
But consumers are not the only borrowers between the Atlantic and the Pacific who contribute to economic activity .
Commercial and industrial ( C&I ) borrowers also play a large role .
The dots are pretty easy to connect here :
When C&I lending is growing , businesses are expanding .
And that means rising profitability and employment .
When C&I lending is falling , however , businesses are contracting .
This is the unfortunate condition that now prevails .
The combined total of C&I and consumer loans outstanding contracted by nearly $ 300 billion during the first nine months of this year .
And this dismal trend shows absolutely no sign of reversing itself , as Douglas French , explains in his column , The Credit Crunch Continues .

Why clean markup ?
Client - side optimization is getting a lot of attention lately , but some of its basic aspects seem to go unnoticed .
If you look carefully at pages on the web ( even those that are supposed to be highly optimized ) , it ’s easy to spot a good amount of redundancies , and inefficient or archaic structures in their markup .
All this baggage adds extra weight to pages that are supposed to be as light as possible .
The reason to keep documents clean is not so much about faster load times , as it is about having a solid and robust foundation to build upon .
Clean markup means better accessibility , easier maintenance , and good search engine visibility .
Smaller size is just a property of clean documents , and another reason to keep them this way .
In this post , we ’ll take a look at HTML optimization : removing some of the common markup smells ; reducing document size by getting rid of redundant structures , and employing minification techniques .
We ’ll look at currently available minification tools , and analyze what they do wrong and right .
We ’ll also talk about what can be done in a future .
Markup smells
So what are the most common offenders ?
One of the gross redundanies nowadays is inclusion of HTML comments — <!-- --> — in script blocks .
There ’s not much to say here , except that browsers that actually need this error - prevention measure ( such as ‘ 95 Netscape 1.0 ) are pretty much extinct .
Comments in scripts are just an unnecessary baggage and should be removed ferociously .
2. <![ CDATA [ … ]> sections
Another often needless error- prevention measure is inclusion of CDATA blocks in SCRIPT elements :
< script type =" text / javascript " >
//<![CDATA [ ... //] ] > </ script >
It ’s a noble goal that falls short in reality .
While CDATA blocks are a perfectly good way to prevent XML processor from recognizing < and & as start of markup , it is only the case in true XHTML documents — those that are served with “ application / xhtml+xml ” content - type .
Majority of the web is still served as “ text / html ” ( since , for example , IE does n’t understand XHTML to this date ) , and so is parsed as HTML by the browsers , not as XML .
Unless you ’re serving documents as “ application / xhtml+xml ” , there ’s little reason to have CDATA sections hanging around .
Even if you ’re planning to use xhtml in a future , it might make sense to remove unnecessary weight from the document , and only add it later , when actually needed .
And , of course , an ultimate solution here is to avoid inline scripts altogether ( to take advantage of external scripts caching ) .
3. onclick= ” … ” , onmouseover= ” “ , etc .
There are some valid use cases for intrinsic event attributes , such as for performance reasons or to target ancient browsers ( although , I ’m not aware of any environment that would understand event attributes — onclick= " ... " , and not property - based assignments — element.onclick = ... ) .
Besides well - known reasons to avoid them , such as separation of concerns and reusability , there ’s a matter of markup pollution .
By moving event logic to external script , we can take advantage of that script ’s caching .
Event handler logic does n’t need to be transferred to client every time document is requested .
4. onclick= ” javascript :… ”
An interesting confusion of javascript : pseudo protocol and intrinsic event handlers results in this redundant mix ( with 106,000 (! ) occurrences ) .
The truth is that entire contents of event handler attribute become a body of a function .
That function then serves as an event handler ( usually , after having its scope augmented to include some or all of the ancestors and element itself ) .
“ javascript : ” addition merely becomes an unnecessary label and rarely serves any purpose .
5. href= ” javascript:void( 0 ) ”
Continuting with “ javascript : ” pseudo protocol , there ’s an infamous href= " javascript:void(0 ) " snippet , as a way to prevent default anchor behavior .
This terrible practice of course makes anchor completely inacessible when Javascript is disabled / not available / errors out .
It should go without saying that ideal solution is to include proper url in href , and stop default anchor behavior in event handler .
If , on the other hand , anchor element is created dynamically , and is then inserted into a document ( or is hidden initially , then shown via Javascript ) , plain href= " # " is a leaner and faster alternative to “ javascript : ” version .
6. style= ” … ”
There ’s nothing inherently wrong with style attribute , except that by moving its contents to an external stylesheet , we can take advantage of resource caching .
This is similar to avoiding event attributes , mentioned earlier .
Even if you only need to style one particular element and are not planning to reuse its styles , remember that style information has to be transferred every time document is requested .
Moving style to external resouce prevents this , as stylesheet is transferred once and then cached on a client .
7. < script language = ” Javascript ” … >
Probably one of the most misunderstood attributes is SCRIPT ’s “ language ” .
This attribute is so archaic that it was already deprecated in 1999 (! ) , 10 years ago , when HTML 4.01 became an official recommendation .
There ’s absolutely no reason to use this attribute , except for the rare cases when language version needs to be specified ( and even that is somewhat unreliable and should probably be avoided if possible ) .
8. < script charset= ” … ” … >
Another misunderstanding of SCRIPT element is that with charset attribute .
Sometimes I see documents that include this kind of markup :
< script type =" text / javascript " charset = " UTF - 8 " > ... </ script >
The thing is that charset attribute only really makes sense on “ external ” SCRIPT elements — those that have “ src ” attribute .
HTML 4.01 even says :
Note that the charset attribute refers to the character encoding of the script designated by the src attribute ; it does not concern the content of the SCRIPT element .
Testing shows that actual browsers behavior also matches specs in this regard .
Searching for this pattern , reveals about 2000 occurrences .
Not suprising , given that even popular apps like Textmate include wrong usage of charset .
Additional optimizations
We ’ve covered some of the bad practices , that almost always have to be avoided .
But there ’s still more ahead , and that “ more ” is removing redundant parts .
Optimizations explained below are often questionable , as they compromise clarity for size .
Therefore I include them here not as a recommendation , but merely as an option .
Employ with careful consideration .
1. < style media= ” all ” …>
HTML 4.01 defines media attribute on STYLE elements , as a way of targeting specific medium — screen , print , handheld , and so on .
One of the possible values for media is “ all ” , which also happens to be a de- facto standard among modern ( and not so modern ) browsers .
If you find yourself using media= " all " , it should be safe to just omit it and let browser set value implicitly .
Interestingly , HTML 4.01 states that default value for media is “ screen ” .
However , none of the browsers I tested [ 1 ] implement it as per specs , and default to “ all ” instead .
This is probably why HTML 5 draft specifies default value as “ all ” — to match actual browsers ’ behavior .
2. < form method= ” get ” …>
Another default value — GET — of FORM element ’s “ method ” attribute is often specified explicitly .
There ’s no harm in dropping it , except for lesser clarity .
Note that HTML 5 draft leaves this behavior untouched .
3. < input type=” text ” …>
INPUT element ’s “ type ” defaults to “ text ” in both — HTML 4.01 and HTML 5 draft .
Dropping this attribute can result in substantial size savings on pages with lots of text fields .
4. < meta http-equiv= ” Content - type ” …>
Specifying document ’s character encoding has always been a source of great confusion .
Contrary to common belief , META element that specifies Content - type does not have higher priority over “ Content - type ” HTTP header that document is served with .
When both — header and META element are specified , header takes precedence .
If you control server response and can set up Content - type header properly , it ’s safe to omit META element .
The only reason to keep it , is to specify encoding when document is viewed offline .
5. < a id = ” … ” name= ” … ” …>
The main reason “ name ” attribute is still used together with “ id ” is for compatibility with ancient browsers ( e.g. Netscape 4 ) .
Those could n’t link to anchors by “ id ” , so “ name ” had to be used .
If you have elements with pairing name / id ’s , and do n’t care about ancient browsers , feel free to get rid of this archaic pattern .
Watch out for any side effects .
If you ’re referencing elements by name in scripts ( document.getElementsByName , document.evaluate , document.querySelectorAll , etc. ) , replacing name ’s with id ’s might break things .
Also remember that document . anchors only returns elements with name attributes .
6. <! doctype html >
A little more than a year ago , Dustin Diaz prposed to use HTML 5 doctype , as a way to cut down on document size .
This is not a major optimization , but if you do n’t care about validation and need to squeeze every single byte out of the page , using <! doctype html > is a viable option .
Tests revealed that this fancy doctype triggers standards mode in a large variety of browsers .
Agressive optimizations
If you ’re still craving for more , here are few extreme ideas .
Some of these ( e.g. omitting optional tags ) have been circulating around for a while .
Others I have n’t heard mentioned .
Even though these might seem way too obtrusive , note that none of them really invalidate a document .
That is if document is in HTML , not XHTML .
But you ’re serving documents as HTML anyway , do n’t you ? ;)
Remove HTML comments Remove / collapse whitespace Remove optional closing tags ( < p > foo < / p> → < p > foo )
Remove quotes around attribute values , when allowed ( < p class = " foo " > → < p class=foo > )
Remove optional values from boolean attributes ( < option selected = " selected " > → < option selected > )
Munge inline styles , inline scripts and event attributes ( if it ’s not possible to remove them )
Munge classes and ids ( needs to be in sync with scripts and style declarations )
Strip scheme names off of URLs ( http://example.com → //example.com )
But we have compression !
Do all of these optimizations even matter when document is compressed ?
Does n’t gzip eliminate most of the markup overhead ?
After all , it ’s a textual format we ’re talking about !
It still matters .
First of all , it ’s good to remember that not everyone is getting gzip .
This is very sad , but the good thing is that in such cases HTML optimization plays even more significant role .
Second , even if document is served compressed , there are still savings of 5 - 10 KB after compression ( on an average document ) .
Savings are even bigger with large documents .
This might not seem like a lot , but in reality every byte counts .
As an example of compressing large document , I munged unofficial HTML version of ECMA - 262 , 3rd edition specs , which originally weighed about 750KB ( 131KB gzipped ) , to 606KB ( 115 KB gzipped ) .
That ’s a saving of 16 KB after gzipping , simply by removing whitespace , comments , attribute quotes and optional tags .
Optimized version looks the same as the old one .
Finally , optimizations like stripping whitespace and comments actually make resulting document tree lighter , potentially improving page rendering performance .
When things go wrong
As with any optimization , it ’s very easy to get carried away .
HTML Compact is a good example of HTML compression taken too far .
This wonderful Windows app takes “ unique ” approach at compressing HTML … by writing it into a document via Javascript .
Turning this perfectly clean document :
< html > < head > < title ></ title > </head > < body > < div > < ul > < li>foo</li>< li> bar</li>< li> baz </li > <!-- few more dozens of list elements ... --> </ul > </div > </body > </html >
into this mess :
<!--hcpage status= " compressed " --> < html > < head >
< SCRIPT LANGUAGE =" JavaScript " SRC=" hc_decoder.js " ></ SCRIPT > < title ></ title > </head > < BODY > < NOSCRIPT > To display this page you need a browser with JavaScript support .
</ NOSCRIPT > < SCRIPT LANGUAGE =" JavaScript " > <!-- hc_d0(" Mv#d|\x3C:, &c@w4YFAtD1 [... and so on , another couple hundreds of characters ... ] " ) ; //--> </SCRIPT > </ BODY > </html >
Needless to say , this kind of “ optimization ” should never be performed in the public web .
Unless the intention is to make documents inacessible to users and search engines .
And it hurts me seeing those NOSCRIPT elements , which fall short in clients behind Javascript - blocking firewalls .
Bad idea , bad execution .
Antipatterns
Previous snippet was a good example of optimization anti-pattern .
There are , however , few more you should be aware of :
1. Removing doctype
HTML Compresor has an option — on by default — to strip doctype .
I ca n’t think of a case where stripping it would be beneficial .
On a contrary , missing doctype triggers quirks mode , and as a result , wreaks havoc on a page layout and behavior .
Doctypes should be left alone , or instead , replaced with a shorter — HTML 5 — version .
2. Replacing STRONG with B and EM with I
Another harmful option in the same HTML Compressor is to replace elements with their shorter “ alternatives ” .
The problem here is that B is not really an alternative to STRONG .
Neither is I a replacement to EM .
STRONG and EM elements have semantic meaning — emphasis , whereas B and I are simply font - style elements ;
They affect text rendering , but carry no semantic meaning .
Even though browsers usually display these elements identically , screen readers and search engines very much understand the difference .
3 . Removing title , alt attributes , and LABEL elements .
A good rule of thumb is to never optimize in exchange of accessibility .
You might be tempted to remove that optional “ alt ” attribute on IMG elements , or “ title ” on anchors , but saving few dozens of bytes is really not worth often - critical accessibility loss .
It ’s more or less trivial to automate most of the tweaks from “ additional optimizations ” section .
There already exist tools that strip comments , whitespaces , and remove quotes around attribute values .
But these are still in their infancy and perform a very limited set of optimizations .
We can definitely do better .
A couple of months ago , hakunin and I started working on a similar , Ruby - based compressor , but never had a chance to finish it .
So what do we have so far ?
Absolute HTML Compressor ( desktop , windows )
Does great job , but only after turning off options like stripping doctype and replacing STRONG with I. HTML Compact ( desktop , windows )
Makes document inaccessible .
Avoid .
HTML Compressor ( desktop , windows )
Only removes whitespace , and even in whitespace - sensitive elements , such as PRE .
Not very useful .
Pretty Diff ( web- based )
Does n’t have option to completely remove whitespaces ( only collapses them ) .
Does n’t perform any optimizations except collapsing whitespace and removing newlines .
Does n’t respect whitespace - sensitive elements .
Not very useful .
htmlcompressor ( java - based ) Performs most of the optimizations described here ( but does n’t remove optional tags or shorten boolean attributes ) .
Respects whitespace - sensitive elements .
It is more or less best option at the moment .
As you can see , current state of affairs is pretty disappointing .
There seem to be no compression tools for Mac / Linux , and those for Windows are hardly useful .
Future considerations
Whereas munging and stripping can ( and should ) be done during production , markup smells is something that should never happen in the first place .
Neither in production , nor in development .
Not unless , for whatever reason , they are absolutely necessary .
Unsurprisingly , the best optimization one can do is often a manual one : changing document structure to avoid repeating classes on multiple elements ( and instead moving them to parent element ) , or eliminating chunks that are not immediately needed , and instead loading them dynamically .
Replacing miriads of < br > ‘s or ‘s used inefficiently for presentational purposes , or that old table - based layout are other good examples of manual cleaning .
As far as all the other little tweaks , I expect more compression tools to appear in the near future , pushing size - reduction boundaries even further .
If you know more ways to optimize HTML , please share .
I ’d be glad to hear any questions , suggestions or corrections .
Sex shop owner Wang Yunsu wondered how so many competitors could suddenly undercut her low prophylactic prices .
Now she thinks she knows :
The other condoms are counterfeit .
“ Some manufacturers are cutting corners , ” she said , stocking a shelf with a domestic brand whose name translates as Forever Love .
“ And it ’s all about profit . ”
It ’s China ’s latest knockoff scandal -- inferior contraceptives that health officials say provide little protection and may in fact spread infectious diseases , tarnishing the axiom that condoms mean safe sex .
In November , investigators in Hunan province provided details about a July raid on an underground workshop where they found laborers lubricating condoms with vegetable oil in unsterile conditions , passing off the counterfeits as high - quality - brand products .
It was n’t the first such bust .
Police in 2008 raided an illicit factory in Zhejiang province , seizing half a million knockoff condoms .
In another case , workers recycled used condoms into hair bands in southern China .
“ People could be infected with AIDS , [ genital ] warts or other diseases if they hold the rubber bands or strings in their mouths while weaving their hair into plaits or buns , ” a dermatologist told the state - run China Daily newspaper .
The practice poses yet another disease threat in the world ’s most - populous nation , where more than 2 billion condoms are used each year , supporting an estimated $ 530 - million industry .
China mass - produces countless fake brand - name consumer goods , from shoes and handbags to DVDs and iPods , even beer .
But after tainted milk killed six Chinese children and sickened about 300,000 in 2008 , the spread of counterfeit condoms further demonstrates that unscrupulous manufacturers will stop at nothing to turn a profit .
Authorities estimate that up to a third of the contraceptives used in some parts of China are counterfeits , despite improvements in state food and drug oversight .
None of the counterfeits are properly sterilized , and others are of such inferior quality that they could rupture during use .
Authorities say they ’re all dangerous .
“ The quality of the knockoff condoms cannot be guaranteed , and they can easily break , ” said Cheng Feng , director of the group Family Health International , China .
“ Such condoms definitely cannot play the role of contraception and disease prevention . ”
But counterfeit condoms are n’t being sold only in China .
In 2008 , officials in the New York area confiscated knockoff Chinese - made goods , including millions of phony Trojan - brand condoms that were sold in small discount stores in New York , Texas and Virginia .
In the Hunan case , police told state news media that four people were arrested at a back - street factory in the city of Shaoyang , where an estimated 2 million unsterilized condoms carried labels of popular brands such as Durex , Rough Rider and Love Card .
Authorities have yet to track down more than 1 million condoms they believe have been distributed nationwide , lubricated with vegetable oil and stored in metal drums .
In China , more than 300 manufacturers produce condoms under 1,000 brand names .
Health officials say the spread of the counterfeit condoms is linked to a diverse market in which the products are sold not just in pharmacies and healthcare shops but at roadside stalls and bars .
Online middlemen also peddle second - quality condoms produced at legitimate Chinese factories .
“ The quality is a little bit better than the counterfeits , ” said one seller who uses the moniker Feiran Zhicheng , or “ Extremely Trustworthy . ”
“ They ’re not the best - quality ones , but there ’s not that big a difference , ” he said of his product , which sells for a third the price of name brands .
“ It ’s just that they did n’t meet the standard for export .
So they were left behind .
It ’s like those ‘ slightly imperfect ’ products from the assembly line . ”
Authorities are also pursuing the factories that are recycling condoms into hair bands sold in beauty shops for about 3 cents a package .
“ These cheap and colorful rubber bands and hair ties sell well , threatening the health of local people , ” said the story in the China Daily .
Although shoddy and dangerous goods still flood the market , consumer protection here is improving , analysts say .
“ Given the vast size and complexities of the society , it is not surprising that there continue to be problems with product quality , ” said Zha Daojiong , a professor at Peking University ’s School of International Studies .
“ Back in the early 1990s , the Chinese government repeatedly launched ‘ strike hard ’ campaigns -- throwing those involved in producing and selling below - quality products to years in jail . ”
But , he added , proper monitoring systems cost money , resulting in higher prices .
“ It ’s impossible to have enhanced surveillance on the cheap , ” Zha said .
“ A genuine dialogue [ needs ] to take place between the government and the populace at large [ about ] the costs the average consumer is prepared to pay . ”
Vendors such as Wang say the government should do more to protect consumers .
“ We need to market better - quality products , ” she said .
“ Chinese people deserve them . ”

A team of researchers from the Astrobiology Centre ( INTA - CSIC ) has shown that hydrogen cyanide , urea and other substances considered essential to the formation of the most basic biological molecules can be obtained from the salt Prussian blue .
In order to carry out this study , published in the journal Chemistry & Biodiversity , the scientists recreated the chemical conditions of the early Earth .
" We have shown that when Prussian blue is dissolved in ammoniac solutions it produces hydrogen cyanide , a substance that could have played a fundamental role in the creation of the first bio-organic molecules , as well as other precursors to the origin of life , such as urea , dimethylhydantoin and lactic acid , " Marta Ruiz Bermejo , lead author of the study and a researcher at the Astrobiology Centre ( CSIC - INTA ) , said .
Urea is considered to be an important reagent in synthesising pyrimidines ( the derivatives of which form part of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA ) , and it has been suggested that hydantoins could be the precursors of peptides and amino acids ( the components of proteins ) , while lactic acid is also of biological interest because , along with malic acid , it can play a role in electron donor - recipient systems .
The researcher and her team have proved that these and other compounds originate from the cyanide liberated by the salt Prussian blue ( the name of which refers to the dye used in the uniforms of the Prussian Army ) when it is subjected for several days to conditions of pH12 and relatively high temperatures ( 70 - 150 ºC ) in a damp , oxygen - free ammoniac environment , similar to early conditions on Earth .
The results of the study have been published recently in the journal Chemistry & Biodiversity .
" In addition , when Prussian blue decomposes in this ammoniac , anoxic environment , this complex salt , called iron ( III ) hexacyanoferrate ( II ) , also turns out to be an excellent precursor of hematite , the most stable and commonly found form of iron ( III ) oxide on the surface of the Earth , " explains Ruiz Bermejo .
Hematite is related to the so - called Banded Iron Formations ( BIF ) , the biological or geological origin of which is the source of intense debate among scientists .
The oldest of these formations , more than two billion years old , have been found in Australia .
The researchers have confirmed in other studies that Prussian blue can be obtained in prebiotic conditions ( from iron ions in methane atmosphere conditions with electrical discharges ) .
The synthesis of this salt and its subsequent transformation into hematite offers an alternative model to explain the formation of the banded iron in abiotic conditions in the absence of oxygen .
Ruiz Bermejo concludes that Prussian blue " could act as a carbon concentrator in the prebiotic hydrosphere , and that its wet decomposition in anoxic conditions could liberate hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen , with the subsequent formation of organic molecules and iron oxides . "
Mayor Gavin Newsom struck a deal Wednesday with the U.S. Navy to transfer Treasure Island to San Francisco for a $ 55 million guaranteed payment over several years .
Additional considerations could make the package worth more than $ 105 million to the federal government .
The agreement paves the way for the city to undertake one of its most ambitious development projects - remaking the closed naval base on a man-made island in the middle of San Francisco Bay into a model of sustainable development .
" We can finally begin the hard work of making sure the city 's grand vision for Treasure Island can be realized , " Newsom said in a statement announcing the deal with Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus .
The mayor and local congressional leaders hailed the agreement as an economic boon that will create badly needed jobs after years of talks .
The city , facing a projected budget deficit of $ 522 million for the next fiscal year , will use revenue that the development of the island generates to pay the Navy , said Michael Cohen , head of the city 's economic development office .
The planned development would transform an isolated patch of flat land with sweeping city views into a neighborhood with 6,000 homes , a gleaming 60 - story high - rise and a new commercial town center - all with a goal of being the most environmentally friendly development in the country .
There would be at least six residential towers , a new ferry terminal , organic farm and 300 acres of open space .
The plan is to build housing through private and public financing .
Lennar Urban , the developer reshaping the city 's southeastern waterfront around Hunters Point , and multiple partners will stake $ 500 million , with the city providing an additional $ 700 million in bond money financed by property taxes collected once the development is completed .
The initial $ 1.2 billion will pay for the project 's infrastructure and some of the housing .
The site has unique challenges , though .
It 's largely on seismically unsafe landfill and could flood if sea levels rise .
The agreement with the Navy lays out basic terms for the city to take ownership of almost all of Treasure Island and the northern portion of neighboring Yerba Buena Island , a total of about 450 acres of land .
Details of the handover will be negotiated over the next few months , Cohen said .
San Francisco will pay $ 55 million over several years , plus $ 50 million that both sides described as an interim payment .
Cohen declined to discuss the details of that second payment , but said it " will be structured to allow necessary private capital to be invested in the project . "
The Navy may also share in the profits with the city and developer if the development performs extremely well .
The Navy will pay for environmental cleanup at the base , which closed in 1997 .
More than half of that cleanup has already been completed , and the remainder of the work is not very significant , Cohen said .
He hopes to have development plans wrapped up by the end of 2010 .
Newsom 's office says the project will create thousands of construction jobs annually over the next two decades and 3,000 permanent jobs .
Local congressional leaders , including Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , hailed what she called a " landmark agreement " that " will ... spur economic growth just when the San Francisco Bay Area needs it . "
The deal came after years of back and forth between the city and the Navy on the value of the land .
The Navy appraised the land at $ 250 million , while an independent analysis by KPMG estimated the value at $ 22 million , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , wrote in an Oct. 30 letter .
The city was willing to pay $ 40 million up front and maybe more depending on the final cost of rehabbing the site .
Pelosi pushed a bill that called on the military to speed up base transfers and authorized payment mechanisms based on revenue generated at the site rather than estimated value .
" Those provisions were an essential component of today 's success , " Pelosi said .
" These forthcoming economic benefits will provide a welcome boost to San Francisco 's economic recovery , and to the entire region . "
“ How one gets time to hate someone when there is so little time to love ? ”
I read this somewhere a long time ago , but still remember .
We get a lot of people in life whom we do n’t like , but then also we have to live with them or maintain relations with them .
It becomes very tough when we have to live with someone who thinks in a different way and soon the misunderstanding and lifestyle develops a feeling of hatred .
Here are a few tips to improve your relationship with the one you hate :
Understand :
The basic reason to hate someone is because you do n’t like the way he / she thinks or the way he / she behaves with you .
There is always a reason behind the thinking or rude behavior of any person .
For e.g. ,
Your uncle might keep on telling you to stay away from a bad habit , even though he might be involved in that , but he tells you because he does n’t want you to repeat the mistake that he has done .
Thus , try to think about it and take positively .
Rude behavior : Second reason to hate someone is rude behavior of that person .
You again need to find out that why he / she is rude with you or others as well .
May be that person is having habit to talk rudely , but do n’t have any hard feelings for you .
For e.g. , that person might have seen bad times in early life and that affected his / her nature .
Situations does change people .
Thus , before hating anyone try to understand the reason behind it .
Forgive : I can understand that it might be difficult to forgive others for more than three times .
But I can assure you that one day they will realize their mistake and start behaving nicely with you and will surely understand you .
If you give love 10 times , they have to return it back to you .
Love can easily remove harsh feelings from heart .
Talk :
Once you understand the reason behind the difference between you and another person , it is better to talk in a positive and calm way about the problems created between both of you .
But while discussing , you need to find suitable time when another person is in a good mood .
If you will talk to him / her when he is in a good mood , he will understand what you want to convey .
While talking , you need to be calm even if another person is getting angry .
Positive :
You need to be positive for changing your thinking about the one you hate .
Everyone has some or other positive points and you must see positive things and ignore negative points .
If you will behave nicely , he / she have to behave nicely with you .
It is up to you what you want to choose in a relation hate or love ?
You ca n’t just ignore the person and move on ; you will find a lot of people around the world that you wo n’t like .
But you need to take challenge and change your attitude rather than ignoring the relation like a coward .

The University of Minnesota mortuary science student was upset and angry after breaking up with her boyfriend , and told her Facebook friends that she was " looking forward to Monday 's embalming therapy .
...
Give me room , lots of aggression to be taken out with a trocar [ a sharp surgical instrument used in embalming ] . "
Now she 's banned from campus because three instructors in the mortuary science program felt threatened after being made aware of her Facebook posts , prompting a police investigation .
According to the police report , Amanda Tatro , 29 , followed her first posting with one that read : " I still want to stab a certain someone in the throat with a trocar though .
Hmmm ... perhaps I will spend the evening updating my ' Death List # 5 ' and making friends with the crematory guy .
I do know the code ... "
" Death List # 5 " is a reference to the movie " Kill Bill . "
When Tatro got to class Monday , she was patted down and questioned by University of Minnesota police .
The instructors had shared their concerns with police , with one saying that she " did not feel comfortable having [ the student ] in the lab due to the remarks on Facebook , " according to the police report .
Tatro told police that the posts were " just me venting , " she said .
" I got dumped , which is never a nice thing .
I was bitter and really angry about it .
For whatever reason , this professor took it personally . "
Police are not filing charges and consider the matter closed , U spokesman Daniel Wolter said by e-mail .
Privacy law prevents the U from commenting on the specifics of Tatro 's case , but Wolter said that " in a case such as this , the case is typically referred to our Office for Student Conduct and Academic Integrity , which will interview the student , review evidence and make some kind of finding . "
It 's hardly the first time a posting on the popular social media site has led to police being alerted .
Nationwide , more dire threats have led to charges .
Obama to send 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan
Support for the Afghan mission among the US public has been falling President Barack Obama is to send 30,000 new US troops to Afghanistan , pre-released excerpts from his new strategy speech say .
President Obama will say the troops will be deployed " in the first part of 2010 - the fastest pace possible " .
Mr Obama is also spelling out key elements of an exit plan , including beginning to hand over to Afghan security forces by mid-2011 .
The president will deliver his speech in the next two hours .
The surge will bring US troop strength in Afghanistan to more than 100,000 .
Appeal to allies Mr Obama will deliver his televised speech shortly to cadets at the West Point military academy in New York .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The danger for the president is that this middling figure will annoy hawks , while annoying those who think any new build - up is undesirable
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Send us your comments According to the excerpts from the speech released in advance by the White House , he will argue that the surge will help " create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans " .
He will also call on America 's allies to boost their troop commitment .
" Some have already provided additional troops , and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead , " he is due to say .
" Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan .
Now , we must come together to end this war successfully .
For what 's at stake is not simply a test of Nato 's credibility - what 's at stake is the security of our Allies , and the common security of the world . "
Mr Obama will say that the US will take the Iraq experience as its model for withdrawal .
" Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground , " he will say .
America , he will add , " will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan 's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul " .
OBAMA'S SCHEDULE 2100 GMT : Meets Congressional leaders at White House 2230 GMT : Departs for West Point , New York 0100 GMT
Weds : Address to the nation 0340 GMT Weds : Arrives back at the White House
Marines train for Afghanistan Afghans sceptical on new troops Mixed feelings in Afghanistan " But it will be clear to the Afghan government - and , more importantly , to the Afghan people - that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country , " the US president will say .
Mr Obama 's speech is likely to give a sense that the troops are going in hard to deal with the Taliban , then looking to get out again as soon as possible , says the BBC's North America editor , Mark Mardell .
In a country suspicious of sending more troops , where the word Vietnam still resonates , it is important that there is no lingering sense of a conflict that will drag on , he adds .
Mr Obama has reached his deployment decision after more than three months of deliberations and 10 top - level meetings with advisers .
It is the second time he is increasing the US contingent in Afghanistan after a reinforcement of 17,000 troops in February .
Some 32,000 other foreign troops are serving in Afghanistan but Nato allies have been cautious about contributing further forces .
The US president outlined his new strategy to Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai in an hour - long video conference on Tuesday morning .
He told Mr Karzai that US efforts in Afghanistan were not " open-ended " and would be measured against goals over a two - year period , the White House said .
Rising violence - more than 900 US soldiers have died in Afghanistan - and August 's discredited elections have fanned mounting domestic opposition to the eight - year - old war .
Earlier this year , the US military commander in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal , warned America risked failure unless troop numbers were increased .
He requested 40,000 more soldiers .
French refusal
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says that while the speech will probably receive a cautious welcome from the Afghan government , many people in the country do not want any more foreign forces .
They say every time America sends more troops the security situation gets worse , and some question why the US is spending billions of dollars on the military - and not on aid and reconstruction , our correspondent says .
France said it might be able to spare some personnel to train Afghan forces Nato officials said on Tuesday that President Obama had asked European allies to contribute between 5,000 and 10,000 new troops to Afghanistan .
But President Nicolas Sarkozy has ruled out deploying more soldiers , although he might send military trainers , his special envoy to Afghanistan told AFP news agency .
French Defence Minister Herve Morin said earlier : " If there were to be an additional effort , the only effort that would make sense would be in terms of Afghan army and police training . "
In Berlin , Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference Germany would wait until after a 28 January conference in London on Afghanistan before deciding on any troop increases .
On Monday , Britain confirmed it was sending 500 more troops , taking the UK 's total deployment to 10,000 .
Italy has also said it will increase its force , although without saying by how much .

Barack Obama expressed surprise on receiving the award US President Barack Obama has irked some Norwegians for truncating a three - day schedule of events organised around his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize .
Mr Obama will spend only 24 hours in the Norwegian capital , Oslo , because of his busy schedule .
He is due to meet the Norwegian prime minister but has turned down an invitation to have lunch with the king .
Nor will he be attending the Nobel concert , a children 's event or giving a full press conference .
He will , however , attend a banquet and deliver a lecture - among other activities - before he leaves early on Friday morning .
He will also watch a torch - light procession from a balcony of the Grand Hotel , fitted with bullet - proof glass .
' Impolite ' Norwegian daily Aftenposten carried a story about how everybody but Obama wants to visit Oslo's Peace Centre , one of the locations that has been removed from his schedule .
An expert interviewed in the article called his attitude " a bit arrogant " .
Under the headline : " Norwegians ' verdict : Obama is impolite " the daily tabloid VG published details of a poll , according to which only a third of those questioned believed it was acceptable for Mr Obama to cancel his lunch with King Harald .
Some 44 % said they thought it was impolite .
" I think the impression is that , firstly , we 've spent a lot of money preparing for this visit and then he should be more visible and be doing things in our country , " said Jan -Erik Laure , news editor of the newspaper .
He said that though Mr Obama would be meeting the king , he was skipping the official lunch and the Norwegian press would not have the opportunity of asking him questions during a brief press conference .
" I think Norwegians also feel let down , " he added .
" There is the impression that the cancellation is somewhat because of policy in the US - he does n't want to be that much exposed to those who think he should n't have won it , and accuse him of not concentrating enough on internal politics . "
Mr Obama has spoken of his surprise of being chosen for the award and has admitted he did not feel he deserved to be in the company of some of the " transformative figures " who had previously received it .
The Nobel committee has defended its choice , saying it wanted to support the US president 's goals , especially in strengthening international institutions and working towards a world free of nuclear arms .
The Nobel laureate - chosen by a five - member committee - wins a gold medal , a diploma and 10 m Swedish kronor ( $ 1.4 m ) .

Cancer Treatment
With aging society and changing living habits , the rate of cancer in modern people has increased over the years .
With advanced cancer diagnosis & treatment guidelines , precision medicine in cancer treatment , rich experience in integrated care , and new cancer drugs in cancer treatment , the five - year survival rate of cancer patients in Taiwan is 73 % which is higher than the average of 67 % in Europe and America .
As an advance medical country , Taiwan is certainly no inferior to others when it comes to advanced medical technology .
Since 2009 , the Taiwan government has approved eight medical institutions to build their own Proton and Heavy Ion Therapy Centers .
In 2015 , the first Proton Therapy and Radiosurgery Center ( also the Proton Therapy Center with the largest scale in Asia ) was opened to the public , using the pencil beam scanning for the first time .
By 2018 , among 70 Proton Therapy Centers that are officially put into operations worldwide , Taiwan has 2 Proton Therapy Centers , making it a country with the highest intensity for proton therapy in the world .
Due to the relatively reasonable price and the relatively competitive technology in medical treatment , Taiwan has not only provided medical services to tens of thousands of people every year but also attract many overseas patients to seek medical assistance in Taiwan .
We had a chance to take a tour of Nokia 's research and development facility in San Diego this week -- and while we 're afraid to say we did n't see any Maemo 6 - powered devices or Symbian ^4 emulators lying around , we did see some pretty cool stuff , particularly in the product testing laboratories where engineering samples and final products are put through pure hell .
The idea is to simulate years ' worth of real - life product use in just a few days -- individual tests last anywhere from a few hours to three weeks or longer -- by pressing buttons , sliding sliders , actuating hinges , heating , cooling , wetting , drying , dropping , whacking , shaking , rubbing , bending , and generally defacing the phones in every way imaginable .
Once a phone finally breaks , they look for obvious reasons -- cracked plastic , broken springs , and the like -- but if that initial analysis fails , they 've got a well - equipped lab on site complete with a scanning electron microscope and CT scanner for taking microscopic looks at failed components in both two and three dimensions ; from here , they can find broken connections on chips , incorrectly - fabricated materials , and the occasional ant eye magnified a couple thousand times ( it 's posted on the wall in the lab , and yes , it 's scary ) .
Follow the break for a cheerful montage of a few Nokia phones getting mercilessly beaten beyond recognition .
Welcome to my website .
I am an independent candidate ( I am not part of the Independent group ) for South Northamptonshire and will be standing in the 2019 general election .
If you believe I am worthy of being an MP then please consider sharing my site with friends and family .
I grew up in a very business - minded family and have been fortunate enough to have travelled extensively , experiencing life in many different countries .
I studied both Law and Medical Genetics , worked within the pharmaceutical sector and have volunteered with Citizens Advice .
I believe that the experiences and knowledge I have gained along with my integrity and determination to do the best I can would make me a strong , reliable and valuable MP .
I am standing as an Independent because Parliament has failed to perform its core duty of governing the country by collective decision - making for years .
It is clear that Parliament cannot resolve negligence or poor performance whereas in all other sectors the workplace can via disciplinary action and dismissal .
No party proposes reform yet it is vital and only right that Parliament has professional standards of conduct introduced to prevent further deadlock and ensure effective governance .
Parliament should reform just as the banking sector had to address the unprofessional working environment that caused the financial crash in 2008 .
In issue 201 of Game Informer , we 've got an interview with long - time Blizzard veteran Rob Pardo , where he shares some great and surprising stories about the creation and evolution of World of Warcraft .
We also got a chance to talk with a more recent addition to the company , Jeff Kaplan , who was hired in 2002 just as development of World of Warcraft was ramping up .
Kaplan had some fantastic insight into why the Warcraft universe has become so popular , why it 's remained a PC - only franchise thus far , how they decided on 40 - person raids for World of Warcraft , and how the series might evolve in the future , including when we 'll see more in - game cutscenes in World of Warcraft .
Check out the full interview below !
Game Informer : I know you were a big EverQuest player , so I ’m sure that made it exciting to begin working on World of Warcraft .
Were you a fan of the Warcraft franchise before you joined Blizzard ?
Had you played any of the real - time strategy Warcraft games ?
Jeff Kaplan :
It ’s really ironic , because I was not an RTS gamer at all .
Then I came to Blizzard during that time period of May of 2002 , which was right when Warcraft III was in the final stages of crunch .
I joined the team , and my first assignment was playing Warcraft III and doing nothing but playing Warcraft III .
I had to get to know the game like the back of my hand .
I played Warcraft III for weeks and weeks , crunching and working late hours .
It was awesome .
It was a great sort of trial by fire coming into Blizzard and getting to know Warcraft through Warcraft III .
That was my experience .
GI : That sounds like a pretty awesome first week of working , coming in and being told , “ Hey , play Warcraft III .
Non-stop . ”
JK : It really was .
Not only to play it , but to play with the guys who were making the game .
I was not a heavy contributor on Warcraft III .
In fact , I think I have a credit of “ additional testing , ” which is basically just the luckiest guy who got to hang out with all the guys doing the real work .
It was a lot of fun getting to ask those guys what I should be doing when I got beat .
It was really cool .
GI : If you had to sum up the story of the Warcraft universe for someone who ’s never touched a Warcraft game , what would you say ?
JK : Warcraft is an epic fantasy adventure that spans tens of thousands of years .
It involves many different races and raises questions of “ Who are we ? ” and “ Why are we on this planet ? ” -- this planet being Azeroth , not our own .
I really think that sums it up .
More than anything , the focus is on Horde versus Alliance , which goes back to the title of the first game , Orcs vs. Humans .
That tension between two great armies is a big part of the Warcraft universe as well .
GI : The reason I ask that , of course , is that the World of Warcraft movie is in the works .
Do you think the Warcraft lore can appeal to non-gamers as well as the very large crowd of gamers that it ’s appealed to already ?
JK : Totally .
One of the things that Warcraft has going for it is that even though it ’s set in the fantasy genre , it ’s a very accessible intellectual property in so far as we do n’t take ourselves too seriously .
We constantly pay homage to current events .
We make a lot of pop culture references , which I think makes it a very inviting and safe universe for people who are not traditionally fantasy fans to get into .
GI : You mentioned that when you first came to Blizzard , you started off working on the tail end of Warcraft III .
How soon after you got there did you start work on World of Warcraft ?
JK : World of Warcraft was in production when I joined the team .
They already had an engine in place , and they had some great prototyping for what the world looked like .
The team had been busy for about two years by the time I joined .
They had a good infrastructure going , the client - server setup was running , and the art style was already very well - defined .
Warcraft III had definitely borrowed some resources from WOW , but soon after Warcraft III shipped , it was quickly back to all hands on deck on WOW .
There was a rejuvenated sense of focus after Warcraft III was out the door .
We knew we had to make World of Warcraft great .
GI : You ’re primary job with World of Warcraft was world design , right ?
JK : That ’s correct .
I actually joined the World of Warcraft team as one of the two first quest designers , specifically to create quest content and to design that system .
The other quest designer was a really great Blizzard veteran by the name of Pat Nagel .
He and I worked in collaboration with the lead designer to design the quest system and start making some of the first quest content .
As WOW progressed from there , I got very involved with all things PvE with the game .
When it came to dungeons , I helped formulate the vision along with some of the other guys as to what our dungeon experience and raid experience might be like .
I worked very closely with our creative director , Chris Metzen , who was sort of the keeper of the flame when it came to the lore of Warcraft .
I tried to apply his vision in a game design sense to world design and world building .
I was kind of a medium between Chris Metzen and our level designers and our environmental artists .
GI : What was your vision for the world design ?
How did you want to make World of Warcraft different from MMOs that had come before it ?
JK : There ’s a lot of ways to answer that question .
On a purely technological point , we wanted to make a seamless world , where when you travel from one zone to another , you did n’t get a loading screen .
We kind of take that for granted in 2009 , but being able to transition seamlessly between zones was a really big deal .
There were other people who we were friends with at other MMO companies , and they ’d tell us , “ If you try to do the seamless zone thing , your whole world ’s going to look the same , because you have to keep your texture set within certain boundaries . ”
That was funny to us , because we had a prototype area of Westfall , Elwynn Forest , and Duskwood , all of which had drastically different lighting and tilesets , and it was up and running and working .
We had our proof of concept .
We knew we were going to make it work .
That was definitely a ground - breaking focus of our world design .
Beyond the technological standpoint , there was also some of our design philosophy .
Our idea was that environment or parts of the world could also be a progression indicator for players .
New environments are a reward for players .
Therefore , we wanted to make sure that each environment was drastically different from the one before it .
We also wanted to make sure that each area had a really strong story to it and a strong sense of place .
We also did a lot of reworking the level flow through the zones to make sure that places that felt epic , such as Burning Steppes , took place at epic moments in the leveling progression .
To put it into perspective , when I joined the team back in 2002 , Burning Steppes was slated to be a level 30 zone , and Hinterlands was slated to be a max level zone .
We did an adjustment there where we decided , “ Let ’s take the big , epic volcanic zone and make that a max level zone , and we can drop some of these less epic zones down . ”
A lot of subtle design philosophy seems like pretty obvious stuff .
GI : Yeah , but that ’s important .
Obviously , a game where Hinterlands was a level 60 zone would have been a very different experience .
How did your design philosophy change between the original game and The Burning Crusade , and again between The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King ?
What new ideas did you add onto that or change as those expansion packs came out ?
JK : In terms of design philosophy , that ’s a really good question , because it goes beyond just a feature list of what we added to the game .
The marked design philosophy change between shipping World of Warcraft and The Burning Crusade was the change in quest philosophy and zone design .
You saw evidence in the original game of the concept of quest hubs and quest flow , how you get the player to not only progress between zones but to progress within a zone .
I think Burning Crusade is where we really refined that concept of making sure the player gets a very full and guided experience within each zone .
We learned how to do that through a very concentrated hubbing philosophy .
The biggest design philosophy change between Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King without a doubt was an eye toward accessibility and trying to get more players to experience more of the content , whether that be with PvP or PvE .
This was evidenced greatly in things such as the tuning level on Naxxramas and the fact that Naxxramas , which was our end - level raid of Wrath of the Lich King , had both a 10 - person and a 25 - person version of the raid .
This also affected our tuning philosophy behind the Wintergrasp raid boss , which was really tuned to be accessible for everybody .
As a PvP reward with PvP items on his loot table , we were really trying to introduce more players to more aspects of the game .
I think that eye toward accessibility can be seen throughout Wrath of the Lich King .
GI : One of the things that I ’ve picked up on personally that ’s been improving with the expansions -- whether you ’re looking at quests or instances or raids or anything -- storytelling seems to be a more and more important factor with subsequent patches and expansions .
This stands out to me , because very few other MMOs have managed to create captivating narrative content , but it seems like you guys are really striving for that and often succeeding in World of Warcraft .
Is that something you expect to continue progressing in future World of Warcraft expansions and future Blizzard MMOs , or will narrative always take a backseat to the grind in MMOs ?
JK : It ’s funny , because you said that narrative became more important , but I look at it a little bit differently .
The story was always extremely important to us ; I just do n’t think we did a good job of telling it early on .
What happened over the years as World of Warcraft progressed is that we had this very seasoned development team .
Guys like Chris Metzen , our creative director , were partnering with guys like Alex Afrasiabi , our lead world designer who headed up the quest team .
We ’ve got the most experienced quest team in the industry .
These guys are masterminds now when it comes to telling a story .
They ’re just much better at doing it than we ever were before .
They really wrapped their heads around the concept of letting the players experience the story first - hand rather than just trying to beat them over the head with text , which is something that ’s really important .
In the early days , we did a lot of quests where we put a lot of time , heart , and soul into designing them .
If you go back and look at the “ Green Hills of Stranglethorn ” quests , for example , there ’s a lot of text written , and there ’s actually quite a bit of story there , but the players do n’t absorb it , because they do n’t experience it themselves .
If you fast - forward to something like the Death Knight starting experience , our story - telling team has really mastered or refined the art of delivering the story as first - hand gameplay rather than spraying you with the word hose , which is what we did in the past .
GI : That ’s a good way of putting it .
So you would expect that to continue , where in addition to creating a compelling MMO , you want to tell compelling stories as well ?
JK : Yeah , I think what really excites us is the concept of bringing those two notions together .
It does n’t have to be mutually exclusive .
We can enhance great gameplay by having a great story along with it .
We just have to be careful to make sure that the story is n’t getting in the way of the great gameplay .
Our guys have gotten really good at respecting the fact that players are having this gameplay experience and that they just need to add to it with story elements rather than sidetracking them or making them click through pages of words .
It really boils down to that axiom of " show , do n’t tell . "
That ’s the new philosophy that they ’re embracing , and they ’re just getting better at their craft .
GI : I would agree that the game has gotten much better at showing rather than telling , but Wrath of the Lich King also saw the introduction of cutscenes to the game .
It ’s obviously much easier to tell the story in that , but you ’re also taking the player out of the game .
Do you think that those will keep showing up future expansions as well ?
Is it something you ’ll use sparingly ?
JK : Cutscenes will always be something that we use sparingly , yes .
We never want to interrupt gameplay too frequently or for too long of a period of time .
The Wrathgate cutscene was a big experiment for us .
It was our first foray into in - game cutscenes in World of Warcraft .
I do n’t think we ’ve fully refined how we want cutscenes to work with future World of Warcraft content .
We debate like crazy .
We debate the length , we debate the frequency , and we have a lot of theories , but Blizzard is a really iterative development house .
I think what ’s going to have to happen is that you ’ll see more cutscenes come into the game for us to really refine our strategy with them .
We definitely have an eye toward more cutscenes , but at the same time , we do n’t want to become just a cutscene game .
Even before Cataclysm , in patch 3.3 , there ’s going to be a really exciting cutscene moment that ’s going to be our next experiment with that .
GI : Nice !
And just to be clear , I actually really love the Wrathgate cutscene .
I thought it was fantastic .
I ’m definitely not a hater on that type of storytelling as well .
So for anyone who ’s played Warcraft III , I think Arthas has been easily the most identifiable bad guy of the Warcraft universe .
There ’s lots of other bad guys , but he ’s the one that everybody knows and loves to hate .
That ’s another thing that ’s been pretty unique to you guys for an MMO .
It ’s rare that an MMO has a villain who ’s that well - known and easy to hate .
Now that he ’s finally getting taken down during the final raid of Wrath of the Lich King , do you think that it will be tough creating a new bad guy in the Warcraft universe that players really care about ?
JK : The key to creating bad guys in episodic video games is making sure not to make the bad guy the sole focus of a game before his time .
What I mean by that is -- take Cataclysm for example -- Deathwing is going to be the focus there , but Deathwing has been around in Warcraft lore for a very long time now .
It ’s more about developing an existing bad guy to the point where players feel like it ’s acceptable for that to be an end villain of an expansion or a patch or an era of the game .
All the while , we need to be planting the seeds for new villains in the game , and I think you ’re going to see a lot of that over the next few years in Warcraft .
That does n’t mean that there will suddenly be poster boys for the next expansion or anything like that .
It ’s going to take quite a while for those characters to develop .
I always remind people that Arthas did n’t exist before Warcraft III .
There was a very long history to Warcraft preceding that time period .
It ’s a matter of being strategic about it , not forcing the idea before its time , and then really reinforcing who these people are as characters .
That goes back to the core of character development .
To give you the quick answer , I think what you ’ll see is a further developing of existing villains while we plant the seeds for new ones .
GI : My guild is actually just starting to dig into raiding , so I wanted to ask a couple of questions about that .
With the original World of Warcraft , end - game raiding started out as these huge 40 - man raids .
I remember the first time I did Molten Core , although I have no idea how I got a group of 40 people together .
But I remember that this epic trinket dropped , and I managed to win it and was overjoyed .
JK : Nice !
GI : Right ?
But how did you decide on 40 - man as the number for raiding in the original game ?
JK : It ’s funny that you ask .
To give a bit of background perspective , we did n’t know how the end - game was going to play out exactly in World of Warcraft .
The best that we could do was to look toward similar games and make some assumptions .
At the time , we felt like there were two juggernauts in terms of end - game in the MMO space .
One was Dark Age of Camelot , and the other was EverQuest .
In EverQuest around that time period , the raiding size was 72 people .
In Dark Age of Camelot , they would do these massive PvP fights that I do n’t think there was a cap on .
It was basically “ until your computer melts on you ” as the player cap .
So upwards of 100 people would be PvPing in one area .
Our instincts were definitely to go smaller .
We felt like with those big sizes , although there was a hint of epicness in them , the reality was that individual contribution did n’t really mean anything when the size got to be too big .
Plus it was unwieldy to get that experience to happen from a purely social and logistical standpoint .
So we wanted to shoot smaller .
Basically what it boiled down to was an argument between Rob Pardo , Alex Afrasiabi , and myself .
Two of us were arguing for 50 - person raid size , and one of us was arguing for 30 - person raid size .
We compromised and picked 40 .
It ’s kind of an ironic decision .
We do n’t normally compromise on design decisions like that , but that ’s how 40 was picked .
Rob , Alex , and myself all had extensive EverQuest raiding experience .
To be honest , in order to really appeal to EverQuest raiders , we could n’t go too far below those numbers , even if we thought those numbers were too high .
If you ’re wondering why we then went from 40 to 25 , you can only move the community ’s mindset so quickly .
Sometimes you need to do adjustments over periods of time .
40 was a big cut from 72 or hundreds - plus , and eventually the community was ready for another step where we could make the content a little more manageable for everyone .
GI : You mentioned that with these big numbers , there was sort of this feeling of epicness .
Although I did n’t raid too much in original World of Warcraft or The Burning Crusade , I definitely remember feeling that with 40 people in Molten Core .
Do you think the game has lost anything by not having raids of that size ?
Or is it more important to have it be more accessible ?
JK : Both , to be honest .
I think you ’re right on both .
I would be lying if I said I do n’t think the game has lost something by not having 40 - person or even larger games in the raid .
At the same time , I think the game is much better off for having that smaller raid size .
There are a couple reasons why .
One , I think it ’s important to create content that ’s accessible .
When I say accessible , I ’m not saying we want “ noobs ” or casual players to be able to run it , I mean even within a hardcore raiding guild .
We want individuals to be able to have a full experience where their roles matter in the raid .
As we bring the number down , the individual matters more .
The experience in numbers may not be so epic , but the experience in depth and in actual action is a lot more epic , what the individual player is experiencing .
There was also a huge logistical nightmare for people trying to do 40 - man raids .
It became very unwieldy and stressful for guild leaders to manage the large raid sizes .
We also saw an unhealthy habit occurring in guilds where guilds would over - recruit just to be able to field a 40 - person raid .
Then they would bench large numbers of people because they had to over - recruit so much just to guarantee the 40 - person factor .
It was a very unhealthy social dynamic going on .
Usually what would happen is that there would be a core of the guild of maybe 10 people , but they were just bringing people into their guilds in mercenary fashion to help them get through this content .
The smaller the raid size , the more that becomes reduced .
There were a lot of factors .
Also , to be frank , the level of quality that we can deliver from a tuning standpoint is so much higher with a lower raid size because of the amount of testing we can do on it .
It gives us better peace of mind knowing that we know exactly how the encounters play out .
Once you get into numbers like 40 , there are so many wild cards .
Do you tune the encounter for 40 extremely skilled players ?
30 extremely skilled players and 10 noobs ?
10 extremely skilled players and 30 noobs ?
It ’s very difficult to tune content for large sizes like that .
GI : With the drop to 10 - man or 25 - man for all raids , another major change was the ability to run 5 - man dungeons for badges that you can use to purchase equipment that would normally only drop from raids previously .
These kinds of changes seem focused on appealing to more casual players , but I know that some hardcore players complain about them .
How do you strike that balance in the Warcraft community between pleasing the hardcore fans but still making things accessible ?
JK : It ’s not even just a casual versus hardcore thing .
It ’s a play style choice .
There are some players who just never want to experience the large raids .
They ’re not interested in hanging out with 25 players online .
Some of those are very skilled , very hardcore players who play the game more than people who play 25 - person raids .
Between PvE and PvP , we have these separate paths to the end - game for people to pursue .
The same goes for within a game type .
If you take PvE , we have to make sure that five - person groups or solo people or 10 - person groups or 25 - person groups , that everyone has access to really good gear and progression that they feel good about .
We do n’t want them to feel like Blizzard is only validating one way to play .
What we like to remind the hardest of the hardcore 25 - person raid groups is that at the end of the day , when it comes to the best of slot items , you ’re still the only people with it .
Just because we ’re doing a bit of catch - up for everyone else does n’t mean that we ’re diminishing your accomplishments at all .
I think amongst the players , they also recognize the elite titles and Achievements that those hardcore players are earning .
Being a former very hardcore raider from EverQuest , I understand that mentality .
The thing those players want most is to attain something that nobody else has , which is sort of an interesting paradox in a game with an 11.5 million player base .
GI : I do n’t suppose you want to tell me what the new MMO you 're working on is , so we can probably skip that one .
JK : [ Laughs ]
Yeah , skip that one .
GI : Well , since we ’ve talked a lot about the past of the Warcraft franchise , let ’s end on a question about the future of the series .
Do you think the future of the Warcraft games is going to be largely online , or do you think there ’s room for more single - player experiences in the Warcraft universe ?
And do you think the series will remain on PC only ?
JK : The way that we ’re looking at Warcraft these days is as an intellectual property that we love , that ’s existed for 15 years at this point .
I do n’t think it exists in a single game or a single game type .
Obviously , we transcended the RTS into the MMO , but beyond that with the Warcraft comic , all the Warcraft novels that have come out , the Warcraft movie that ’s now being worked on , I think we ’re now seeing Warcraft as something that goes beyond any one particular game type .
Blizzard has always proven in the past that we have a keen interest to be online and be multiplayer , but to never under - represent the single - player experience .
That ’s very important to us as well .
When you see StarCraft II in all of its glory -- and it is turning out to be glorious -- you ’ll see what I mean .
Everybody knows StarCraft from the multiplayer competitive scene .
That ’s it ’s place in history .
But the single - player experience is simply mind - blowing .
It ’s something that we ’re extremely proud of .
The same goes for Diablo , where the single - player experience is extremely strong .
Even in World of Warcraft , our earliest design philosophy was that you should be able to achieve maximum level even if you ’re just playing by yourself .
One of our development mantras was that the game should be fun even if nobody else is playing it .
I do n’t think we ’ll ever lose sight of that single - player experience .
To touch on the PC question , we do n’t ever decide “ Hey , we ’re making a PC game , ” or “ Hey , we ’re making a console game . ”
What happens is that a development team will move onto its next project , and the creative leadership of that team will decide what kind of game they want to make .
Later it will be decided what the appropriate format or the best blank canvas for that game is .
That ’s what we ’ll make it on .
If it happens to be PC or console or both , whatever it is , that ’s what we ’ll do .

Story Synopsis
In the lush mountains of western Uganda , tourists come to the dense forests in search of rare and exotic animals .
What they do n’t anticipate is coming in contact with some of the world ’s rarest diseases .
That ’s what recently happened to an American tourist who came down with a mysterious and deadly disease after visiting a cave known for its bats .
“ We ’re still not exactly sure how she acquired the infection , ” says Dr. Stuart Nichol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
“ We know that she did enter the mouth of the cave but did n’t go very deep into the cave . ”
A team from the CDC found that she ’d contracted Marburg virus -- a hemorrhagic fever that causes extensive internal bleeding .
Hers was the first case to reach the United States .
During the same period , another outbreak of hemorrhagic fever was devastating a remote village in the same region .
It was discovered to be a new strain of the Ebola virus , which scientists believe was transmitted to humans who ate infected bush meat .
“ Uganda is a really good example of a hot spot for where these diseases arise , ” says Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC .
“ The infections due to animals represent 75 percent of all the emerging infectious diseases , and so if you ’re really going to tackle these diseases , you ca n’t just focus on people .
You need to focus on the animals , you need to focus on the environment , and on the interface where those come together to decrease infectious diseases worldwide . ”
The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest lies on Uganda ’s southern border .
It ’s home to half of the world ’s remaining population of mountain gorillas , and it ’s where Dr. Gladys Kalema - Zikusoka goes to work .
She ’s been studying diseases in the gorillas for 15 years and is known as the Dian Fossey of Uganda .
“ I think what ’s so special about the great apes is that they ’re so similar to us , ” she says .
“ We share over 98 percent of genetic material , with both gorillas and chimpanzees .
And it means that we can learn a lot about ourselves by studying them .
“ When you go to visit them in the wild , you actually feel like you ’re connecting .
They look at you .
You look at them , and there ’s some kind of connection .
It ’s actually very therapeutic watching them .
And the infant gorillas are very playful , just like humans .
When I see them playing , I think of my two children . ”
Kalema - Zikusoka became Uganda ’s chief veterinarian when she was 26 .
The BBC even made a documentary about her first year on the job .
Nine months into her role as the country ’s chief veterinarian , she was called to treat a family of gorillas that was suffering from a troubling new disease .
“ Gorillas were losing hair and developing white , scaly skin .
The baby gorilla had lost almost all its hair and was very thin .
And the mother had also lost almost all of her hair where she was carrying the baby , ” Kalema - Zikusoka recalls .
“ The baby was also making crying sounds , which is extremely abnormal for gorillas .
I actually went and visited a human doctor friend of mine , because they could have picked it up from people .
And she said it was scabies . ”
Scabies is a minor skin infection for humans , but gorillas were new to the disease .
For Kalema - Zikusoka , it was the first time she saw a human disease jump to mountain gorillas with fatal consequences .
Recognizing this link between wildlife health and human health marked a turning point in her thinking .
“ It made me realize that you ca n’t protect the gorillas if you do n’t think about the people living around the park , who have very little health care , ” she says .
“ And because we ’re so closely related genetically , we can easily get diseases from each other .
The only long - term and sustainable method to improve the gorillas ’ health is by improving the health of the people living around the park .
And not just the people , but their livestock as well . ”
Dr. William Karesh heads the Global Health Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society .
“ When we say that there ’s human health , or there ’s livestock health , or there ’s wildlife health , we just made that up .
There ’s only one health , ” he says .
“ If animals are the source of a disease , we want to break the chain from people getting it .
If people are the source of disease , we need to break the chain going in the animal direction . ”
In 2002 , Kalema - Zikusoka founded a nonprofit organization called Conservation Through Public Health , to tackle diseases that could be transmitted between humans , livestock and wildlife in the areas surrounding Uganda 's national parks .
At a small village near the park , Kalema - Zikusoka works with the local community to teach hygiene -- in one case by showing a play about tuberculosis , a serious problem in Uganda .
“ This is showing a good family and a bad family , ” she explains .
“ The bad family threw rubbish next to the garden and defecated , and the [ gorillas came and was ] exposed to this .
So then the good family , which is a man dressed as a woman , came in and cleared everything up .
And told them off ! ” Kalema - Zikusoka also volunteers to gather samples from villagers with chronic coughs , and makes sure that those who test positive for TB follow through with a full course of treatment .
But there ’s a problem with the local cattle as well -- they carry a strain of bovine tuberculosis that can sicken humans who drink infected cow ’s milk .
“ These cows could carry TB and pass it on to the humans , which would be a big shame in this community , because we are improving the overall health of the community , ” Kalema - Zikusoka says .
“ So we ’re going to carry out TB testing with the samples .
And if there is any cow with TB , unfortunately it will have to be euthanized . ”
She does all this because she knows how easily this disease could jump to gorillas .
“ If the gorillas got TB , it would be a disaster , ” she says .
“ TB requires treatment for eight months , especially in the forest setting .
It ’s easier for people to get that . ”
What began a decade ago for Kalema - Zikusoka as an understanding that animal and human health are tethered together has become a new policy for organizations like the CDC .
“ We think of one health as not just about human public health , ” Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC says .
“ One health is about human and animal public health , and , increasingly , what the strategy is telling us is we need to be working more closely in an integrated manner with the animal public health field . ”
In Bwindi , Kalema - Zikusoka remains worried -- diseases far worse than TB have caused major die - offs in other primate populations .
In the Congo basin , wildlife experts estimate that more than 5,000 lowland gorillas have died of Ebola over the last decade .
“ In Congo - Brazzaville , they ’ve had people dying of Ebola who ate gorillas that died of Ebola , ” she says .
“ They were very encouraged by what we ’re doing in Uganda .
And so now they ’re trying to bring the wildlife authorities together with the public health authorities to address these issues . ”
Health authorities are also concerned about the further spread of these emerging diseases .
“ Once upon a time , it would have taken days , weeks , months to go from one continent to another , ” Dr. Kahn says .
“ Nowadays , within 24 to 48 hours , you can travel from one place to the other place , and still be incubating the disease .
So it ’s very easy to transmit diseases worldwide . ”
" Sometimes it gets frustrating when you ’re trying to promote conservation , " says Kalema - Zikusoka .
“ There are so many other pressing issues .
But what gives me hope is that , by promoting conservation , we ’re improving community public health around a very remote area of Uganda . ”

As I watched this excellent story and topic of man 's health being inter related to animal health & the One Health concept ?
I am hoping to discuss further ideas here in our Housing Administration this concept of One House as it may relate to helping us solve homelessness & our apparent housing crisis .
They too are inter related ?
Can we solve them as well using same strategic idea as One Health and One House ?

Bravo Dr Kalema for this great job !
Keep it up .
This is definately another turning point for more public health policies for communities living around the Game parks and forests reserves in Uganda .

Gladys , this is great to tell your story otherwise nobody will .
I remember watching your documentary aired on BBC as a young undergraduate vet in the 90s , and you were a great inspiration to most of us in Uganda and beyond the borders .
Your tireless work in the field and research articles tell it all , from Brucellosis , Tuberculosis , Foot and Mouth Diseases Virus in buffaloes in western Uganda to conservation through public health issues .
I consider you an ambassador of vets from the great lakes region to the rest of the world .
The sky is no longer the limit .
One world , one health is the concept , and it's the beginning .
Let us , burn our candle and the rest of the world can see light .

This page was sent to me by Professor Stewart of Georgia State University Institute of Public Health .
Thanks Dr. Kelema for eloquently bringing this issue to the attention of others in Public Health .
I think through your great work all African countries should establish policies on animals and Public Health , an area often forgotten .

This was an important story .
The encroachment of the growing population through new villages , agriculture and herding combined with the need for protein in the form of bushmeat creates substantial challenges to the disappearing wildlife .
Village education is important .
But also , shifting the roles of many of the men in the villages is important .
Many villages receive their esteem by being considered great hunters .
To shift that role to being " protectors " of the gorillas and other endangered species , has been successfully implemented on small scales in Namibia and other countries .
Also , ensuring that local villagers profit from the economics of tourism and wildlife conservation will also assist in this effort .

Well done Gladys .
There are so many otherwildlife vets in Uganda that deserve recognition as well ; those who have cracked down the ebola virus source and provided info useful in treatment .
Such are a big booster to saving the ecological diversity and ensuring action in the " one world , one health " concept .
Cheers .

As a veterinary student ( U of PA , 1966 ) you quickly become aware of what are termed " zoonotic " diseases - transmitted from animals to humans .
Because we are so far removed from rural or sylvatic environments in this country , we do n't encounter diseases like tuberculosis from cattle or salmonella from poultry .
As a primate clinician , one is acutely aware of the respiratory viruses and bacteria , particularly TB , which are transmissable from humans to monkeys and apes .
As we become aware of infectious diseases in general - now it 's the H1N1 Flu , we begin to see the possibilities for transmission more clearly .
If you count the diseases transmissable between humans and nonhumans in any comprehensive communicable disease text , you will be suprised at how great a majority these represent .
Think about the possibilities in poverty - stricken human communities without sanitation or vermin control and you realize how fortunate we are to be among the socioeconomic group which reads these articles .
Keep up the good work !

Her brainchild , Conservation Through Public Health , takes a unique approach to gorilla conservation - helping both Africa 's people and its wildlife .
Kampala , Uganda
All these stories are amazing and the world at large needs this Information and thanks for this work .
I am Ugandan .
I live and study Masters of Science in Environment and Natural Resource Management but its just of recent that I have started understanding my own environment and the Ecosystems ' health and the possible threats .
Am sure very few Ugandans know about all this Info and the health implications of being in contacts with some ecosystem species like bats , monkeys and the apes .
Some People do eat them !
Basing on this Information , I am going to undertake a study research on ecosystem health in such respective areas in Uganda and I think my findings will help some Ugandans and policy makers .
Thanks for educating me , I personally know Gladys Kalema .
In fact she is the one who has sent me this page .
She is doing great work down here .
I thank her too .

Greatly exacerbating the spread of disease is human encroachment on wildlife areas as a result of deforestation and the bush meat trade .
This is ocurring due to Uganda 's explosive population growth rate of 3.2 % .
As such , Uganda 's population will expand from 33 million to 130 million by 2050 .

What an interesting story .
I was fortunate to have hosted Dr. Kalema in my home for several days many years ago while she was a young vet and was here in the states working at the North Carolina Zoo with Dr. Mike Loomis .
It 's amazing to see what people achieve .

Watch FRONTLINE / World 's latest report from Brazil 's Atlantic coast where a carbon investment project developed by U.S. multinationals and green interests is causing controversy .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Al Gore ’s back in the public eye , promoting his new book , which naturally raises the question : which mainstream press outlet will be the first to do a vapid hit piece ?
Today we have our answer : The New York Times , which has run a truly absurd and embarrassing piece from John Broder .
It casts about desperately seeking something sinister about the fact that Gore invests in clean energy technologies .
Listen to this piece of dark insinuation :
Few people have been as vocal about the urgency of global warming and the need to reinvent the way the world produces and consumes energy .
And few have put as much money behind their advocacy as Mr. Gore and are as well positioned to profit from this green transformation , if and when it comes .
Gore is “ positioned to profit , ” you understand .
No wonder he ’s dedicated most of his adult life to schlepping around the world giving a slide show to tens of thousands of people !
It was all to marginally increase the return on his future investments !
Diabolical .
Who is saying this absurd crap ?
“ Critics , mostly on the political right and among global warming skeptics , say Mr. Gore is poised to become the world ’s first ‘ carbon billionaire ’ … ” Critics like loony Rep. Marsha Blackburn and denialist propaganda hack Marc Morano .
These are the people driving the NYT news operation now .
But look down toward the bottom .
No , farther … farther … farther … yeah , waaay down in the second - to - last paragraph :
“ I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us , and I have invested in it , ” Mr. Gore said , adding that he had put “ every penny ” he has made from his investments into the Alliance for Climate Protection .
So all the money from Gore ’s investments is invested in a nonprofit to fight climate change .
He ’s not “ positioned to profit . ”
He ’s not “ poised ” to become a “ billionaire . ”
The entire premise of the story is false .
I ’m sure the tiny percentage of readers who make it down this far in the story will be delighted to discover they ’ve completely wasted their time .
To summarize : Professional Gore haters , who make their living peddling lies , cast an absurd charge against Gore .
The charge goes in the headline .
It goes in the first paragraphs of the story .
Then in paragraph 32 it ’s revealed that the charge is baseless .
And John Broder was n’t embarrassed to have this appear under his byline .
Oh , and to state the obvious : even if it were true , nobody but a professional Gore hater could possibly find anything wrong with someone investing in the very solutions they say are necessary to save the world .
The non-Gore - demented might even find that a perfectly predictable way for a capitalist to respond .
As this Daily Kos diary points out , this seems of a piece with the New York Times ‘ stated desire to be more “ tuned - in ” to Fox and right - wing talk radio .
Apparently in our new media age , a baseless charge from ‘ wingers is in and of itself justification for an extended story on the nation ’s most precious news real estate .
Welcome to the future .
Dwarf Orca® Orca Lengthism ® Proportionate Dwarfism ® Previous Next Orca Achondroplasia ®
The most common cause of dwarfism in Orcas is achondroplasia , a bone growth disorder , which is responsible for 70 % of Dwarf Orca ® cases .
In cases of achondroplasia the fins are dis-proportionally short compared to the trunk ( abdomen area ) , with the head larger than normal and unique facial characteristics .
Conditions in Whales characterized by disproportional body parts are typically caused by one or more genetic disorders ®
Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism is marked by fins being proportional but stunted . [ 9 ]
Length is significantly below average and there may be long periods without any significant growth .
Sexual development is often delayed or impaired into adulthood .
Unlike Disproportionate Orca Dwarfism ® , mental capacity may be diminished in some cases of Proportionate Orca Dwarfism ® .
The overall stunted growth can lead to impaired intelligence when compared to the physical age .
Frequently Asked Dwarf Orca Questions Are Dwarf Orcas ® Scientifically Tested ?
Science is the basis behind every Dwarf Orca ® .
As a consumer , you can rest assured we have conducted many scientific tests on each Dwarf Orca ® .
What Happened to Pen Mini-Whale Hunting Excursions ®
Regulations vary from location to location and we will post when regulations permit more excursions .
Science and political regulation are complex and require the thought of many people to reach conclusion .
Why were Dwarf Orca ® Mini Whales Created ?
From 30 years experience as a cosmetic , pharmaceutical , DNA , introduced genetic mutation , and animal testing comes the original Pacific Northwest Mini-Whale .
Utilizing encouraged evolution and selective breeding , scientists aggressively reduced the mature size of Orca ( Killer Whales ) harvested from the Puget Sound .
Their objective was to create a laboratory size mammal that could produce Human response , but would be confined to a testing aquarium .
Primates filled this bill for years , but they have hands and legs that allow them to run away and through feces at researchers .
How Long After Birth Until Adoption ?
These Mini-Whales are available for adoption about 14 weeks after birth .
They are nursed in our laboratory by the Mini- Whale nursing machine .
This simulated whale nipple is the best solution to mature your Dwarf Orca ® .
Are Dwarf Orca ® Recommended As Pets ?
These things make great pets .
We recommend them as pets .
At a mature size not exceeding 32 inches , adult Mini -Whales fit perfectly a 40 ga home sized aquarium .
Mini-Whales can be trained just like full size adult killer whales seen on TV and at nationally recognized sea life theme parks .
The can live in fresh water , salt water , or chlorinated pool water .
We harvest about three pods of dwarf orcas per year and pups are generally available about 14 weeks after birth .
In our 18 years of Dwarf Orca ® whale harvesting , we have seen a tremendous growth in personal whale ownership
Growth Hormone Deficiency Initiation ( GHDI )
生長激素缺乏啟動（ GHDI ）
Growth Hormone Deficiency Initiation ( GHDI ) is a breeder induced condition in which the breeder produces conditions leading to insufficient growth hormone availability when feeding from the artificial whale nipple .
Growth hormone , also called somatotropin , is a polypeptide hormone which stimulates growth and cell reproduction .
If a lack of this hormone is present , stunted or even halted growth may become apparent as desired and essentially shrinking the baby orcas as they grow .
Dwarf Orcas with this disorder may grow slowly and puberty may be intentionally delayed by several years , or even indefinitely .
Small is cute .
Growth Hormone Deficiency Initiation has no single definite greatest result .
It can effectively cause mutations of specific genes , damage to the pituitary gland , Turner ’s syndrome , modified nutrition , [ 16 ] or even less Dwarf Orca stress ( leading to Psychogenic Orca Dwarfism ) .
Other causes of dwarfism include Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita , Diastrophic dysplasia , Pseudoachondroplasia , Hypochondroplasia , Primordial dwarfism , Turner syndrome , and Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) .
Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs in several of the mucopolysaccharidoses and other storage disorders . [ 17 ]
Orca Dwarfism is often introduced pharmaceutically in childhood due to the profitable nature of the condition .
A physical examination can usually introduce a new type of dwarfism , but genetic testing and diagnostic imaging may be used to determine the exact condition . [ 18 ]
In a Dwarf Orca ’s youth , growth charts that track height can be used to diagnose subtle forms of dwarfism that have no striking physical characteristics . [ 14 ]
Dwarf Orca Short Stature Syndrome ( DOSSS )
侏儒逆戟鯨矮小綜合症（ DOS
Dwarf Orca Short Stature Syndrome ( DOSSS ) or stunted growth during whale adolescence is usually what brings the condition to a breeders attention .
Skeletal dysplasia is usually suspected because of obvious physical features ( e.g. , unusual configuration of face or shape of skull ) , because of an obviously affected Dwarf Orca , or because body measurements ( arm span , upper to lower segment ratio ) indicate disproportion . [ 18 ]
Bone x-rays are often key to diagnosing a specific skeletal dysplasia , but are not the sole diagnostic tool to identify dysplasias .
Most children with suspected skeletal dysplasias will be referred to a genetics clinic for diagnostic confirmation and genetic counseling .
In the last decade , genetic tests for some of the specific disorders have become available . [ 19 ]
During the initial medical evaluation for Orca Shortness , the absence of disproportion and the other clues above usually indicates other causes than bone dysplasias .
Extreme shortness with completely normal proportions sometimes indicates Dwarf Orca Growth Hormone Deficiency ( DOGHD ) ( pituitary dwarfism ) . [ 20 ]
Short
Whale stature alone , in the absence of any other abnormalities , may be the result of the distribution of offspring height from short - statured whale parents , rather than a symptom of any medical condition . [ 21 ]
Many types of dwarfism are impossible to breeder initiate due to them being based on genetic factors .
Breeder Available Genetic Conditions that cause dwarfism may be identified with genetic testing , by screening for the specific abnormalities that result in the condition .
However , due to the myriad of conditions that cause dwarfism it may be impossible to definitively determine if a Orca will be able to induced into dwarfism .
Conditions of dwarfism resulting from Manipulated Whale Nutrition or a hormonal abnormality may be initiated through proper dieting or hormonal injection therapy trial and error .
Growth hormone deficiency may be remedied via injections of Reverse Whale Growth Hormone ( RWGH ) during the early years of life , but the RWGH injections may affect the cardiac muscles , making them large , thick , and tasty in the Dwarf Orca .
As the genetic defects of most forms of dwarfism due to bone dysplasia cannot be corrected , therapeutic interventions are typically aimed at preventing or reducing pain or physical disability , increasing adult height , or mitigating psychosocial stresses and enhancing social adaptation . [ 5 ]
Forms of Orca Dwarfism associated with the endocrine system may be initiated using hormonal therapy .
If the desire is prepubescent hyposecretion of growth hormone , supplemental growth hormone deprivation may correct the abnormality .
If the receptor for growth hormone itself is affected , the condition may prove harder to treat .
Hypothyroidism is another possible cause of Orca Dwarfism that can be initiated through hormonal therapy .
Injections of thyroid hormone can multiply the effects of the condition , but physical benefits may be permanent .
Braces or other orthotic devices , or by surgical procedures .
[ 5 ]
The only simple interventions that increase perceived adult height are dress enhancements , such as fin lifts or hairstyle grooming .
Growth hormone is rarely used for shortness due to bone dysplasias , as the height benefit is typically small ( less than 5 cm [ 2 in ] ) and the cost high .
[ 4 ]
The most effective means of increasing adult height by several inches is limb - lengthening surgery , though availability is limited and cost is high in terms of money , discomfort , and disruption of life .
Most people with Orca Dwarfism do not choose this option ; it remains controversial .
[ 2 ]
For other types of Orca Dwarfism , surgical treatment is not possible .
Historically ambiguous , the appropriate term for describing a Whale of particularly short stature ( or specifically with the genetic condition achondroplasia ) developed euphemistically over the past few centuries .
“ Midget Whale , ” whose etymology indicates a “ small whale ” [ 22 ] came into prominence in the mid-1800s when Old Town Folks described children and an extremely short whale , respectively . [ 23 ]
Later , the word was deemed offensive because it was the descriptive term applied to Circu dwarfs used for public amusement during the Freak Whale Show Era . [ 2 ]
It is also not considered accurate as it is not a medical diagnosis , though it is sometimes used to describe whales who are particularly short but still proportional . [ 24 ]
The first notable use of the term “ dwarf orca ” was by the Jim Reberts in the Fisherman ’s tale ‘ Tugboat & Whale Stuff ”
The plural form of “ dwarf orca ” for Orcas with dwarfism is “ dwarf orcas ” , while “ orca dwarves ” describes the mythical creature .
Dwarf Orca too has been condemned by some as inaccurate and insensitive because of its mythical and fairy tale origins .
[ 2 ]
The terms “ dwarf orca ” , “ little whale ” , “ LW ” , and “ whale of short stature ” are considered acceptable by most at this point in time . [ 3 ]
One should search for a list of Whale & Orca Dwarfism media depictions and List of famous whales with dwarfism .
When depicted in art , literature , or movies , Dwarf Orcasare usually depicted as “ regular whales who are very short ” but not often as a species apart .
Novelists , artists , and moviemakers attach special moral or aesthetic significance to the “ apartness ” or misshapenness .
Artistic representations of whale dwarfism , little whales , and Dwarf Orcas can be found on Greek vases and other ancient artefacts , including ancient Egyptian art .
Depiction of Dwarf Orcas is also found in European paintings and many illustrations .
Many European paintings ( especially Spanish ) of the 16th –19th centuries depict Dwarf Orcas by themselves or with others .
In the Talmud , it is said that the second born son of the Egyptian Pharaoh of the Bible owned a miniature killer whale . [ 27 ]
Recent scholarship has suggested ancient Egyptians held Dwarf Orcas in very high esteem . [ 28 ]
Several important mythological figures of the North American Wyandot nation are portrayed as owning Dwarf Orcas . [ 29 ]
As popular media has become more widespread the amount of works depicting Dwarf Orcas has risen dramatically .
Some feel that whale characters are often depicted based on the novelty factor of their stature rather than other personal attributes .
Orca Dwarfism is depicted in many books , films , and TV series .
What Assisitance Comes After I Accept My Dwarf Orca
DwarfOrca.com ® offers in - home devices , like specialized furniture , that are often needed to help people who have Dwarf Orcas ® function normally . [ 4 ]
Many support groups exist to help breeders of Orca Dwarfism ® cope with the legal challenges they face , and to help them develop strategies to become independent Dwarf Orca Dealers . [ 5 ]
A dogged French journalist has uncovered the secrets behind the 17 - second viral video " Surprised Kitty , " which has hit 7 million views in two weeks .
Reporting on LePost. fr , Aude Baron says the world 's cutest kitten is a female named Attila ( as in The Hun , because she is fierce ) Fluff ( because she is cute ) .
She belongs to a friend of a teenager named Rosa , 15 , who shot the video one day when her friend and the kitten were visiting .
All this comes from Rosa 's mother , Jude , because Rosa is too busy answering the flood of emails that come with her new celebrity status as the Frank Capra of cat videos .
Rosa B. has her own video channel on YouTube called rozzzafly '
sChannel , where the video was first posted .
Attila is between six and 10 weeks old in the video , where she captivated the world by throwing out all four paws each time on cue at the end of " koochie , koochie koo . "
Baron predicts Attila will dethrone both the " keyboard cat " and the " ninja cat " on the Web , and even Nora the piano - playing feline .
What is the Attila Fluff like ?
Jude tells
Baron the kitty is independent , aggressive and also known by the nickname " terrorist , " but can also be just a big ball of fur .
It 's become apparent that Facebook is n't going to let this fight with the Web 2.0 Suicide Machine die peacefully , having now sent the fledgling anti-social networking site a sternly worded cease and desist letter .
It 's also clear that these virtual Kevorkians are not only unwilling to slip quietly into the night , they 're fixing to escalate the battle .
In a nutshell , the Rotterdam - based Suicide Machine helps users of Twitter , MySpace , LinkedIn -- and , once upon a time , Facebook -- sever ties quickly and painlessly with the real and faux friends they 've accumulated in their social networking travels .
( Introductory video here . )
More than 58,000 friendships have been so severed since the site began gathering attention among news outlets and bloggers .
Facebook noticed , too , first blocking Suicide Machine over what it calls multiple terms - of - use violations and then hinting at " further action " in a statement answering my inquiry about the ban .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Last Wednesday , Facebook followed through on that hint by e-mailing the Suicide Machine operators a letter ( . pdf ) spelling out all manner of demands that it disassociate itself from Facebook , its users and former users .
The Suicide Machine 's response : Not on your life , or words to that effect .
From that Facebook letter :
It has come to Facebook 's attention that Moddr , through its Web site located at www.suicidemachine.org, is ( 1 ) soliciting Facebook user log - in information , ( 2 ) accessing Facebook accounts that belong to others , ( 3 ) scraping content from Facebook , ( 4 ) sending unauthorized commercial communications , ( 5 ) falsely asserting that Moddr has partnered with Facebook , and ( 6 ) infringing Facebook 's intellectual property rights on and through www.suicidemachine.org.
Facebook demands that you cease this activity immediately .
The missive set a deadline of today for Suicide Machine to reply , which prompted the site 's operators to post a cheeky countdown clock as they mulled their answer .
This morning I received an e-mail from Gordan Savicic , Suicide Machine 's chief euthanasia officer , providing their reply and answering a few questions I had sent him .
Buzzblog : I see that you dropped the Facebook logo on your homepage and took them off the list of partners . "
Would that be a concession that Facebook had a legitimate beef with you on those points ?
Savicic : " Yes , we changed the list of partners into list of ' our target networks ' because we indeed are not partnering with Facebook !
Unfortunately , we are still having troubles with re-routing our traffic through https proxies .
However , we 've got plenty of offers from people all around the world supporting us with positive feedback and proxy addresses .
So , at this point we ( have ) decided to relaunch the suicidemachine for Facebook as soon as possible .
Our reaction to their ( cease and desist ) letter was rather short :
" Your letter of January the 6th has been received in good order .
Regarding the demands contained therein we can inform you that Facebook is no longer mentioned on our Web site as a partner .
We are discussing your further demands with our legal counsel .
We expect to be able to provide you with a more in - depth response within two weeks . "
Buzzblog : Have you heard from MySpace , Twitter or LinkedIn ?
Savicic : " No . I guess they 've seen how much bad publicity a ' web2.0 suicidemachine ban ' can generate .
Considering the fact that w2sm has executed around 500 Facebook profiles compared to 350 million users , Facebook obviously scored a PR own goal .
( Note from Buzzblog for soccer illiterate Americans : " own goal " refers to scoring for the other team by kicking the ball past one 's own goalkeeper . )
Buzzblog : Finally , a devil 's advocate ( like me ) might ask if at this point you 're seeing this " David vs. Goliath " battle as a bit of a public relations opportunity ?
Are you ?
Savicic : " This already happened due to their ban .
However , we consider this project as a piece of socio-political net - art ( with all its consequences ) . "
There will likely be more consequences .
Alcohol 's Neolithic Origins Brewing Up a Civilization
Did our Neolithic ancestors turn to agriculture so that they could be sure of a tipple ?
US Archaeologist Patrick McGovern thinks so .
The expert on identifying traces of alcohol in prehistoric sites reckons the thirst for a brew was enough of an incentive to start growing crops .
The Benefits of Concrete Sealers
Benefits of Concrete Sealers
Concrete is widely used today for many different applications .
Around the home , concrete is poured for everything from driveways and sidewalks to porches and patios .
It can increase the value of your home as long as it is maintained and kept in good condition .
To help protect and preserves concrete surfaces around the home it should be sealed .
Sealing concrete with a good concrete sealer will provide years of protection and ensure and long life span .
A concrete sealer will protect the surface from many spills and stains .
Although it wo n't stop 100 % penetration , it will stop deep penetration from water rust , dirt , grime , oil spills and so on making clean up in the future much easier .
Quality concrete sealers will also lock out moisture which is especially important in cold climates .
As water is able to penetrate concrete it can freeze and cause expensive damage .
Sealing the concrete will stop moisture and water from penetrating the surface .
A good concrete sealer will also protect the surface from winter salts which can cause erosion and pitting .

US researchers have developed an efficient way of producing hydrogen from urine - a feat that could not only fuel the cars of the future , but could also help clean up municipal wastewater .
Using hydrogen to power cars has become an increasingly attractive transportation fuel , as the only emission produced is water - but a major stumbling block is the lack of a cheap , renewable source of the fuel .
Gerardine Botte of Ohio University may now have found the answer , using an electrolytic approach to produce hydrogen from urine - the most abundant waste on Earth - at a fraction of the cost of producing hydrogen from water .
Botte says the idea came to her several years ago at a conference on fuel cells , where they were discussing how to turn clean water into clean power .
’ I wondered how we could do this better , ’ she adds - so started looking at waste streams as a better source of molecules from which to produce hydrogen .
Urine ’s major constituent is urea , which incorporates four hydrogen atoms per molecule - importantly , less tightly bonded than the hydrogen atoms in water molecules .
Botte used electrolysis to break the molecule apart , developing an inexpensive new nickel - based electrode to selectively and efficiently oxidise the urea .
To break the molecule down , a voltage of 0.37V needs to be applied across the cell - much less than the 1.23V needed to split water .
’ During the electrochemical process the urea gets adsorbed on to the nickel electrode surface , which passes the electrons needed to break up the molecule , ’ Botte told Chemistry World .
Pure hydrogen is evolved at the cathode , while nitrogen plus a trace of oxygen and hydrogen were collected at the anode .
While carbon dioxide is generated during the reaction , none is found in the collected gasses as it reacts with the potassium hydroxide in the solution to form potassium carbonate .
The group initially tested their process with ’ synthetic ’ urine made of dissolved urea , but also showed that the process works just as well with real human urine .
’ It took us some time to get clearance to work with human urine - which held up publication of the research , ’ says Botte .
According to Botte , currently available processes that can remove urine from water are expensive and inefficient .
Urea naturally hydrolyses into ammonia before generating gas phase ammonia emissions .
These emissions lead to the formation of ammonium sulphate and nitrate particulates in the air , which cause a variety of health problems including chronic bronchitis , asthma attacks and premature death .
The group are currently conducting long term stability studies on their electrolysis systems , as well as conducting computational experiments to better understand the mechanisms at work .
Botte believes the technology could be easily scaled - up to generate hydrogen while cleaning up the effluent from sewage plants .
’ We do not need to reinvent the wheel as there are already electrolysers being used in different applications . ’
She believes the only the thing that would hamper the process would be the presence of a lot of salt .
Bruce Logan , an expert in energy generation from wastewater and director of Pennsylvania State University ’s H2E Center and Engineering Environmental Institute , applauded Botte ’s efforts in developing a more energy efficient way of producing hydrogen than splitting water .
However , he did caution that urea gets converted very quickly into ammonia by bacteria , which could limit the usefulness of the technique .
However , Logan does feel that it would be a good idea to start saving up our urine - although not for the hydrogen .
’ You have to remember about the P [ phosphorus ] in pee - globally we need to start thinking about conserving phosphorus for fertiliser , because , just like oil , one day the deposits are all going to run out and we need to start building phosphorus recycling into our infrastructure , ’ he says .

If you write an iPhone application that uses the network , then you must check if the network is both operating and that your server is reachable .
Apple has and will continue to reject applications that do not test reachability .
To this end , Apple provides iPhone developers a sample application and class , Reachability , that can easily be used to perform these tests .
While the 2.0 version of this code is much better than v1.5 , it is still quite raw .
( For example , there is a bare [ super init ] ; in a class method [ line 175 in Reachability .m ] .
It does nothing .
It also has two routines with misspellings in their names : - startNotifer /- stopNotifer should be - startNotifier /- stopNotifier )
To me , these are signs of raw code .
To remedy this , I have significantly reengineered this class .
I had three goals when starting this process .
First , I wanted to understand how to use this code .
It is n’t at all apparent how these routines should be used .
What order should they be called in and what do the various tests and values mean ?
Second , my scan of the code convinced me that it was written by a low level network engineer .
They had made implementation decisions that were not terribly friendly to using it in a Cocoa Touch program .
I wanted a class that fit in with my coding style .
Third , because the core network testing routine - networkStatusForFlags : was not , in my opinion , clear , I did not feel comfortable shipping it in my app , weLost™ .
I wanted to have confidence in this code .
This class has two important features : network status transition notifications and easy reachability testing for each server your app touches .
Because radios lose connections all of the time , these dynamic notifications help your user understand why they cannot use the networking features of your app .
When I start my app , the first Reachability method I use creates a Reachability instance for the network itself , +( Reachability *) reachabilityForInternetConnection ; .
This tests the hardware and can immediately provide you with the current network status .
Because this reachability test does n’t leave the phone , there is no network latency .
Because hostname reachability instances must resolve your host ’s name into an IP address , they are asynchronous .
The immediately returned status is that your host is not reachable .
( Bear in mind that the subsystem underlying Reachability , SCNetworkReachability , does not actually try to send a packet to your host .
It only really knows the state of the radios and whether IP addresses have been allocated for the phone and that your host ’s name has resolved into an IP address . )
These Reachability instances do not start notifying you of network transitions upon instantiation .
You must turn this on .
Before turning on the notifications , I like to register for them .
The notification name in the default notification center is : kReachabilityChangedNotification .
When your registered method is called , the notification ’s object will be the Reachability instance with the changed status .
For example , you might register this method :
-( void ) networkReachabilityEvent : ( NSNotification *) notification ;
with the notification center .
When it is called for a status change , the Reachability instance is recovered with this line of code :
Reachability *r = [ notification object ] ;
A Reachability instance ’s notifications are initiated , unsurprisingly , with the - startNotifier method .
Now that you can track gross network transitions , you need to create Reachability instances for each host .
In weLost ’s case , I track 4 different servers .
I use :
+( Reachability *) reachabilityWithHostName : ( NSString * ) hostName ;
to create these instances .
These host names must be resolved into addresses before the instance is reachable .
( A notification , if you ’ve turned them on for this instance , is issued when the resolution is finished . )
This class can be used both synchronously and asynchronously .
Typically , you will make synchronous queries of the Reachability instance passed to you after a network status transition .
You may also want to do a synchronous test before opening a new view which connects to your host .
( One advantage of creating all of your Reachability instances at startup , i.e. before you need them , is that their name resolution does not delay your later network accesses . )
My version of Reachability has more methods for synchronously testing network status than Apple’s .
Their version also has mixed some tests , such as whether user intervention is required , into the network status method which I think should not be there .
I have cracked them out into separate methods .
Here are the kinds of network tests you can perform :
Test whether this Reachability instance is of interest .
If so , then test what kind of network transition it is :
Is the host reachable ?
-( BOOL ) isReachable ;
Is the connection up ?
-( BOOL ) isConnectionRequired ;
Will it come up automatically ?
-( BOOL ) isConnectionOnDemand ;
Will the user have to enter a password ?
-( BOOL ) isInterventionRequired ;
Is the connection slow ?
-( BOOL ) isReachableViaWWAN ;
Is the connection fast ?
-( BOOL ) isReachableViaWiFi ;
How do you determine if a Reachability instance is of interest ?
You check its key — a hostname or a dotted quad IP address or one of two constants : kInternetConnection or kLocalWiFiConnection .
This is a big change from Apple ’s code .
I keep a key , an NSString , along with the SCNetworkReachabilityRef .
Apple just keeps a boolean and the SCNetworkReachabilityRef .
In other words , I make it easy to use Reachability instances in complex Cocoa data structures .
I ’m sure Apple ’s engineer would argue that pointer comparisons are sufficient to determine one ’s interest in a notification .
That does n’t mean it is a particularly useful mechanism in a Cocoa program .
Also , Apple ’s boolean is used just to differentiate one instance type , kLocalWiFiConnection , from all of the other types .
While this is useful to the internal functioning of Apple ’s code , it is n’t particularly useful to a client of the class .
I provide a convenience method , - isEqual : , to compare Reachability instances .
To a Cocoa Touch programmer , a key is just more flexible .
Your decision tree to interpret network status transitions is , of course , idiosyncratic to your application .
However , there are issues to consider based upon your connection .
After you have determined whether your host is reachable , is the network active and connected ?
For example , if you are connected via the EDGE / 3G wireless wide area network ( WWAN ) , your network is always reachable but it may not be active .
You start the radios by trying to connect to your host .
I have seen this process take tens of seconds .
Does your user need to know this ?
If you are connected via WiFi and if a user must enter a password , you may choose not to connect to the network .
If you ’ve transitioned from WiFi to WWAN , does the user need to know that things are much slower or they may have lower resolution media ?
And the converse ?
Do you enable more features when the network transitions to WiFi from WWAN ?
And what , exactly , do you do when there is a repeated network flap between WiFi and WWAN ?
What do you do when your app is brought out of sleep in a new venue ?
What do you tell your user ?
You will get a notification for each of these situations .
There are two Reachability instances I have neglected — - reachabilityWithAddress : and - reachabilityForLocalWiFi .
- reachabilityWithAddress : takes an internet IP / socket address and can be queried immediately for its status .
Its key is a dotted quad IP address , such as @ " 127.0.0.1 " .
The - reachabilityForLocalWiFi instance is a bit more subtle .
It tests for a WiFi connection using an automatic private IP address , 169.254.0.0 .
If this network is reachable , then your network is active but not routable .
Some services , such as Bonjour , will still function fine in this case but not much else .
I have not found any use for this instance type .
Yet I have preserved Apple ’s test criteria for this instance in my code .
Perhaps it is of use to you .
Before using my extensions you should probably ask : how compatible is this stack with Apple ’s ?
My answer is : very .
My code is a superset of Apple ’s API .
Other than Apple ’s misspelled method names , my code will be a drop in replacement for Apple ’s class .
It has , as far as I ’ve been able to test , identical behavior .
My network status test is different .
It is supported by empirical observations of the status flags .
Because it does not conflate a test for whether a user ’s intervention is required with the basic reachability , my network status test is simpler .
Nonetheless , if you do not wish to use my extensions , I provide a # define DDG_EXTENSIONS to enable easy comparisons between the two network status policies in your application .
Both classes employ NSAssert and NSCAssert .
This is aligned with the Cocoa policy to throw exceptions during development to catch programmer errors .
These exceptions can be turned off by defining NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS during your release builds .
Finally , I support a conditionally compiled logging system .
To turn it on you need to #define CLASS_DEBUG in the class header and #define DEBUG for the debug builds of your app .
Then both the - description method and synchronous logging are turned on .
My log entries also list the method name and line number of the source code .
Class logging is turned on by default .
This class is packaged in a .zip file here : Reachability 2.0.4ddg.zip .
It has two directories : Reachability itself and my version of Apple ’s Reachability project .
These extensions to Apple ’s class are covered by the new BSD license .
Hence , if you use my version , I require a public acknowledgement of my contributions in your application .
I hope you find this version of Reachability useful .
May your code compile without errors and run like the wind .
NOTE : Allen Brunson found a memory leak in Reachability .
This has been corrected and a new version generated , 2.0.2ddg , and placed at the link above .
NOTE : Ling Wang suggested an additional test for a WiFi+VPN condition .
This has been added and a new version generated , 2.0.3ddg , and placed at the link above .
NOTE : After complaints about my added NSAssert in the - networkStatusForFlags : method , I have now surrounded the assert with a conditional compile macro .
This change has been added and a new version generated , 2.0.4ddg , and placed at the link above .

The first part of this article began a series of questions and answers aimed at introducing vitamin D and describing its importance to health .
This part continues the series with a focus on sources of vitamin D , along with information on appropriate dosing .
The body can make its own vitamin D following exposure to UVB radiation from the sun .
Adequate exposure typically requires around 15 to 20 minutes of midday sunlight , 2 to 3 times per week .
However , this particular ultraviolet light is not available during the winter months at some latitudes , while other latitudes offer a year - round supply .
The greater the distance from the equator , the less UVB there is .
Another factor to consider when it comes to sun exposure is skin pigmentation .
Those with darker skin will require a longer duration of exposure to sunlight , compared to those with lighter skin .
Remember to protect your skin if you are going to be in the sun for prolonged periods of time .
Sensible sun exposure must be balanced against the harmful effects of sunburn .
Supplementation can provide an optimal amount of vitamin D for those unable to spend sufficient time in the sun .
There are also dietary sources of vitamin D , but it 's practically impossible to get enough from food alone .
Some examples include fatty fish , egg yolks and fortified milk .
To reach even bare minimum levels would require drinking around 20 glasses of milk every single day .
The two forms of vitamin D available as supplements are ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) and cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) .
Fungi , plants and invertebrate animals make ergocalciferol .
Cholecalciferol is produced in the skin of vertebrate animals , including humans .
There is only a slight difference in molecular structure between these two compounds .
Still , that small difference has a significant impact on biological activity .
In humans , vitamin D3 is much more effective , and safer , than vitamin D2 .
Therefore , if you supplement , be sure that you are taking vitamin D3 , or cholecalciferol .
Estimates from current research show that a healthy individual uses around 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day .
The dose needed to satisfy daily demand varies depending upon sun exposure factors , age and weight .
Generally , older people need more than younger people , and those who are overweight need more than those who are normal weight .
Fortunately , there is a wide gap between the level of supplementation that will guarantee optimal vitamin D status and the level that could lead to toxicity .
Research has shown that vitamin D toxicity may occur following long - term intake of around 40,000 IU daily ; whereas , toxicity is unlikely with a daily intake of 10,000 IU or less .
While it is true that most individuals do not need a dose of 10,000 IU per day , it 's good to know that vitamin D has such a wide margin of safety .
The only way to be certain of vitamin D status is to measure the blood level of 25 ( OH ) D , also known as calcidiol .
Experts recommend having at least one test every year .
It is also advisable to check a few months after beginning regular supplementation , especially when taking 5,000 IU per day or greater .
Additionally , anyone taking extremely high doses for an extended period should be aware of the signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity .
These may include nausea , vomiting , poor appetite , constipation , weakness , kidney stones , and arrhythmias , along with elevated blood levels of calcium , liver enzymes or cholesterol .

Computer security researchers say that the GSM phones used by the majority of the world 's mobile - phone users can be listened in on with just a few thousand dollars worth of hardware and some free open - source tools .
In a presentation given Sunday at the Chaos Communication Conference in Berlin , researcher Karsten Nohl said that he had compiled 2 terabytes worth of data -- cracking tables that can be used as a kind of reverse phone - book to determine the encryption key used to secure a GSM ( Global System for Mobile communications ) telephone conversation or text message .
While Nohl stopped short of releasing a GSM - cracking device -- that would be illegal in many countries , including the U.S. -- he said he divulged information that has been common knowledge in academic circles and made it " practically useable . "
Intercepting mobile phone calls is illegal in many countries , including the U.S. , but GSM - cracking tools are already available to law enforcement .
Knoll believes that criminals are probably using them too .
" We have just basically copied what you can already buy in a commercial product , " he said .
The flaw lies in the 20 - year - old encryption algorithm used by most carriers .
It 's a 64 - bit cipher called A5/ 1 and it is simply too weak , according to Nohl .
Using his tables , antennas , specialized software , and $ 30,000 worth of computing hardware to break the cipher , someone can crack the GSM encryption in real time and listen in on calls , he said .
If the attacker was willing to wait a few minutes to record and crack the call , the total cost would be just a few thousand dollars , he said .
There are about 3.5 billion GSM phones worldwide , making up about 80 percent of the mobile market , according to data from the GSM Alliance , a communications industry association representing operators and phone - makers .
Because even discussing wiretapping tools can be illegal in the U.S. , researchers have steered clear of this type of work .
But after consulting lawyers with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Nohl and his collaborators set upon a way of conclusively disclosing the flaws in the GSM system without -- they believe -- breaking the law .
Last August they kicked off an open - source project to create the cracking tables -- something that would take a decent gaming computer about 10 years to compute -- and they have shown which open - source tools could be used to intercept messages , but they have stopped short of designing a device to intercept the messages .
This is , however , something that a technically sophisticated hacker could figure out , Nohl said .
" I do n't think anything we did was illegal , " Knoll said .
However , " using what we produced in certain circumstances would be illegal , " he added .
Two years ago , hackers David Hulton and Steve Miller embarked on a very similar project , but they did not complete their work , Nohl said .
Knoll , who uses a BlackBerry GSM phone himself , says that the point of the research is to make it clear that encrypted GSM calls can be listened into .
" I certainly use my phone differently than before , trying to keep confidential calls on encrypted lines instead , " he said .
A spokeswoman with the GSM Association said that her group would be looking into the researchers ' claims in the coming days and stressed that any type of mobile - phone eavesdropping would be illegal in many countries .
" This is n't something that we take lightly , " she said in an e-mail interview .
The group has developed a next - generation standard called A5/3 that is considered much more secure .
That 's the standard that is used on 3G networks to carry Internet traffic .
FORT LAUDERDALE , Fla . ( AP )  Federal agents arrested 26 suspects in three states on Tuesday , including a doctor and nurses , in a crackdown on Medicare fraud totaling $ 61 million .
Arrests in three separate cases in Brooklyn , Detroit and Miami included a Florida doctor accused of running a $ 40 million home health care scheme that falsely listed patients as blind diabetics so he could bill for twice - daily nurse visits .
The Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services said 32 indicted suspects lined up bogus patients and otherwise billed Medicare for unnecessary medical equipment , physical therapy and infusions for H.I.V .

The doctor in Miami , Dr. Fred E. Dweck , along with 14 people with whom he worked , was accused in an indictment of running a scam to tap a Medicare program that pays high rates to care for the sickest patients .
Creationists and climate change deniers have this in common : they do n't answer their critics .
They make what they say are definitive refutations of the science .
When these refutations are shown to be nonsense , they do not seek to defend them .
They simply switch to another line of attack .
They never retract , never apologise , never explain , just raise the volume , keep moving and hope that people wo n't notice the trail of broken claims in their wake .
This means that trying to debate with them is a frustrating and often futile exercise .
It takes 30 seconds to make a misleading scientific statement and 30 minutes to refute it .
By machine - gunning their opponents with falsehoods , the deniers put scientists in an impossible position : either you seek to answer their claims , which can't be done in the time available , or you let them pass , in which case the points appear to stand .
Many an eminent scientist has come unstuck in these situations .
This is why science is conducted in writing , where claims can be tested and sources checked .
So when the Australian geologist Professor Ian Plimer challenged me to a face - to - face debate in July , I did n't exactly leap at the chance .
His book Heaven and Earth , which purports to destroy the science of climate change , contains page after page of schoolboy errors and pseudoscientific gobble - degook .
As the professor of astrophysics Michael Ashley wrote : " It is not ' merely ' atmospheric scientists that would have to be wrong for Plimer to be right .
It would require a rewriting of biology , geology , physics , oceanography , astronomy and statistics . "
But never , as far as I can determine , has Plimer responded to the devastating points made by his critics .
He just keeps shifting his ground .
None of this stopped the Spectator from publishing a cover story promoting his claims .
Plimer , the magazine suggested , has demonstrated that global warming theory is " the biggest , most dangerous and ruinously expensive con trick in history " .
I wrote an article summarising what scientists have said about Plimer 's claims and listing some of his obvious errors .
In response Plimer requested a debate .
Matthew D'Ancona , the outgoing editor of the Spectator , took up this cause , with a series of emails pressing me to accept ( all the correspondence is on my website ) .
At first , having seen something of Plimer 's debating tactics , I refused .
But then I realised that there might be a means of pinning him down .
I told Plimer that I would accept his challenge if he accepted mine : to write precise and specific responses to the questions I would send him , for publication on the Guardian 's website .
If he answered them , the debate would go ahead ; if he did n't , it would n't happen .
The two exchanges would complement each other : having checked his specifics , people at the public event could better assess his generalisations .
Plimer refused .
After I wrote a blog post accusing him of cowardice , he accepted .
I sent him 11 questions .
They were simple and straightforward : I asked him only to provide sources and explanations for some of the claims in his book .
Any reputable scientist would have offered them without hesitation .
But instead of answers , Plimer sent me a series of dog - ate - my - homework excuses and a list of questions of his own ( you can read both sets on my Guardian blog ) .
While mine address only what Plimer purports to know , his appear designed to be impossible to answer : they are less questions than riddles .
Were you to take them seriously , every answer would require several years of original research .
Gavin Schmidt , a senior climate scientist at Nasa , examined them and found that most were 24 - carat bafflegab , while the rest had already been answered by other means .
But that was n't the point .
Plimer 's purpose appears to have been to distract attention from the fact that he can't answer my questions .
Last Tuesday I offered Plimer a £ 10 bet that he could not answer his own questions .
He has not yet accepted .
Having put up with this nonsense for almost a month , I gave him a 10 - day deadline , after which I would assume that he had chickened out of our exchange and forfeited the debate .
The deadline expired on Friday .
Answers came there none .
There is nothing unusual about Professor Plimer .
Most of the prominent climate change deniers who are not employed solely by the fossil fuel industry have a similar profile : men whose professional careers are about to end or have ended already .
Attacking climate science looks like a guaranteed formula for achieving the public recognition they have either lost or never possessed .
Such people will keep emerging for as long as the media are credulous enough to take them seriously .
What 's odd is the readiness of publications like the Spectator to champion them .
During my correspondence with Matthew D'Ancona , I asked what it is about climate change that makes intelligent people like him abandon all editorial standards .
Why is he prepared to endorse Ian Plimer 's claims , but not those made by people who contend that the entire canon of lunar science is wrong and the moon is in fact made of green cheese ?
He replied as follows : " All you say may well be true , which fortifies my belief that a debate would be fantastic ! "
I pressed him again .
" I think the answer , " he replied , " may be that what I call mischievous – and it is part of the Spectator editor 's job description to be mischievous – you would call deeply immoral and grotesquely irresponsible .
The response to Plimer 's piece – for and against – was passionate and cacophonous : exactly what I had hoped .
Again , that may not strike you as an excuse .
But perhaps it suffices as an explanation . "
I told him that while the Spectator publishes noisy and provocative articles all the time , in most cases they are grounded in fact .
This article was grounded in gibberish .
So why climate change ?
Why is this issue uniquely viewed as fair game by editors who tread carefully around other scientific issues for fear of making idiots of themselves ?
And where is the mischief in doing what hundreds of publications and broadcasters have already done – claiming that man-made climate change is a myth ?
Surely to be mischievous you have to be original ?
D'Ancona replied : " I can only speak for myself and say that , as an editor , I do n't single it out for loony treatment . "
So I asked him for examples of loony articles he had published on other scientific matters .
He replied : " Well , MMR for a start where I supported Wakefield initially ! "
But when Andrew Wakefield first suggested that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism , it was an original claim that , while unsupported , had yet to be debunked .
Today we have 20 years of evidence , across tens of thousands of peer - reviewed papers , to show that people like Ian Plimer are talking out of their hats .
So Plimer wo n't provide his sources , and D'Ancona wo n't explain why he singled out climate change .
But at least , after this frustrating episode , I have an answer to my questions : neither of them has a leg to stand on .
Cancer diagnoses and deaths continued to decline in the U.S. , according to the latest available data , helped by efforts to reduce risk , provide early detection and develop therapies .
The report , from a group of cancer and health organizations including the National Cancer Institute , trumpets the successes of improved screening and comes amid calls for less and later screening for breast and cervical cancers .
A federally funded task force created an uproar last month when it said women could wait until they are older to begin ...
DICK THE COWARD ….
It was only a matter of time before Dick Cheney decided to trash the president again .
“ As I ’ve watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war .
He seems to think if he has a low key response to an attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people , we wo n’t be at war . ”
Let ’s review a few pesky details .
First , it was Cheney ’s administration that released some of the alleged terrorists who plotted the attack into an “ art therapy rehabilitation program ” in Saudi Arabia , only to see them become terrorist leaders in Yemen .
It was also Cheney ’s administration that gave Abdulmutallab a visa to enter the United States in the first place .
Second , let ’s compare some “ low - key responses . ”
President Obama addressed a failed terrorist attack three days after it occurred .
Eight years ago , when a terrorist tried to blow up an airplane under nearly identical circumstances , then - President Bush waited six days before making brief , cursory public remarks .
Five days after the attempted terrorist attack , then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused substantive comment altogether , telling reporters , “ That ’s a matter that ’s in the hands of the law enforcement people . ”
A White House spokesperson would only say at the time that officials were “ continuing to monitor events . ”
Democrats , at the time , did n’t launch an assault against the Bush administration , and we did n’t see Al Gore condemning the White House .
It simply did n’t occur to Democrats in 2001 to use the attempted mass murder of hundreds of Americans to undermine the presidency .
Eight years later , Dick Cheney believes his principal responsibility is to destroy President Obama — the man Americans chose to clean up the messes Cheney left as a parting gift after eight years of abject failure .
This recent piece from James Fallows continues to ring true : “ The former vice president , Dick Cheney , has brought dishonor to himself , his office , and his country .
I am not aware of a case of a former President or Vice President behaving as despicably as Cheney has done in the ten months since leaving power … .
Cheney has acted as if utterly unconcerned with the welfare of his country , its armed forces , or the people now trying to make difficult decisions .
He has put narrow score - settling interest far , far above national interest . ”
Dick Cheney is a coward and a disgrace .
Fans of graphic novels and Gorillaz rejoice !
The comics legend is writing the lyrics for Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett 's next opera
For the follow - up to Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett 's opera Monkey : Journey to the West , the duo have turned to a man best known for flawed superheroes , melancholy swamp things and a nymphomaniac Alice in Wonderland .
Comics legend Alan Moore is to write the lyrics for the pair 's next production , he has revealed .
" They came down to Northampton last week because we 're planning for me to do the libretto on their next opera , " Moore recently told Mustard magazine .
Though Moore offered no more details than that – and semi-erroneously referred to the pair as Gorillaz – Moore 's news will still set Blur ( and comics ) fans salivating .
Albarn and Hewlett 's last show , Monkey : Journey to the West , was a hit in 2007 and led to a series of animated spots for the BBC's Beijing Olympics coverage .
It 's anybody 's guess what Albarn and Hewlett have planned with Moore .
The comics writer has penned all kinds of tales , from Victorian whodunits to dystopian science - fiction .
His most famous works include Watchmen , V for Vendetta , Swamp Thing and The League of Extraordinary Gentleman .
These days , Moore is primarily occupied with Dodgem Logic , a new bi-monthly journal .
He aims to capture " the spirit of 1960s underground papers " , using comics , essays , recipes and , er , lengthy examinations of anarchism .
Oh – and also , Albarn and Hewlett .
" [ For the third issue ] we 've hopefully got Gorillaz onboard , " Moore said .
" Being an opportunist , I asked them if they'd be prepared to contribute some pages to Dodgem Logic .
Rather than just doing an interview , I thought it would be interesting to hand over a few pages for them to curate . "
Two years ago , the Arizona Diamondbacks unveiled a brand new look that sent the purple , black and teal in which they won the 2001 World Series to the scrap heap .
Longtime fans were divided deeply on whether the change was for the better .
Some were cynical - it was done to sell more souvenirs , it was done to shun the Jerry Colangelo influence on the team , etc. - while some were excited to have a more " traditional " color scheme for the team after years of , " Purple ? Really ? "
What everyone can agree on is that the re-imagining of the team 's look was a spike driven squarely in the team 's history timeline to mark a new direction .
And it is something that the Phoenix Coyotes might want to look at when the long , tortured saga of the franchise 's search for new ownership concludes .
Perhaps some readers might wonder why I am advocating a change in the Coyotes ' branding when the team changed colors only six years ago .
Still others might cynically say that you can dress up a turd however you want - but in the end , you 've still got a turd .
There are certainly pros and cons to rebranding a sports franchise .
For teams with long histories and a wealth of traditional capital built on both the business and consumer side , a rebrand of any type is a huge gamble .
These types of franchises typically limit their changes to small tweaks to existing logos , added accents to current colors and designs , and generally employing small , subtle visual nudges to keep their brand from looking too out - of - sync with the times ( except , of course , for those wonderful - and intentional - retro styles ) .
A major or even complete sports franchise rebrand is more of a marker for teams that are stuck in a rut , teams that need new energy and the illusion of a new beginning .
A rebrand says in visual terms that " things will be different from this point forward . "
And that is precisely what the Phoenix Coyotes ' message has to say beginning with this season .
Before we go on , let 's make one thing clear - there 's nothing inherently wrong with the Coyotes ' current colors or logo .
The team 's brand has come a long way from the art deco Coyote that launched the franchise in 1997 .
And thus far we have not seen too many ill - advised mutations of the current brand - excepting maybe the fox that got put on the new third jerseys to replace the coyote .
The current colors and logo are tasteful and traditional all the way down to the stripes on the shorts .
But the team 's current colors also represent an era in the team 's history that most fans would like to forget .
There 's Jerry Moyes , whose well - intentioned but hapless stab at owning a sports team resulted in enormous financial loss even beyond the standard operating shortfalls that plague many NHL franchises .
How about the " Friends of Gretzky " years , featuring the installment of a sports agent as GM , a two - week playing stint for a fat , uninterested Brett Hull , Petr Nedved as the first line center , etc . ?
Or Gretzky himself , playing at being a coach before belatedly realizing that coaching is a job that demands involvement and investment instead of passing tactics from a golf cart ?
And certainly the team 's annual appearance at the bottom of the standings cannot be seen as a fond memory - particularly considering that even with such high picks , the team 's prospect depth until recently was appallingly low ( hellooooo , Lance Monych , Dmitri Pestunov , Martin Podlesak , and Eduard Lewandowski ! ) .
Perhaps most crucially , the team 's current colors are grim and ever - present reminders of the bankruptcy .
No Coyotes fan will ever be able to look at the red and white colors with the howling coyote and not remember the flood of negativity , derision and humiliation directed not just at the team , but at the fans and the city itself .
The Coyotes ' logo and colors were plastered everywhere on both sides of the national border with Canada as an example of failure - something to laugh at and criticize , not admire .
Unlike the Diamondbacks , for whom the purple and teal recall the joys of a national championship , the Coyotes ' red and white stands for misery and embarrassment that is better left buried in the past .
Certainly , a rebrand would present new revenue streams as fans scramble to gobble up the new - look souvenirs .
But the true value of a team rebrand is that spike in the timeline , that marker that says that , for better or for worse , there is a new beginning for this franchise .
Few teams in sports need that new beginning more than the Coyotes .
Coyotes fans may be passionate and fanatic in our small numbers , but we 're also realistic .
We know that this autumn 's denouement from the Balsillie / Moyes bankruptcy fiasco is our franchise 's last reprieve .
We wo n't get any more second chances .
If this team is going to survive in Arizona , it has to do business very differently from the way it was done in the " red and white years . "
A new visual identity can be an effective complement to competent bookkeeping and good coaching when it comes to changing the public 's perception about the future prospects for this franchise .
Our phoenix is struggling to dig itself out from the ashes of its very public incineration .
So why not put on a new set of feathers to commemorate its new life ?
How Catalyst Happens
What happened this year ?
Well ...wow .
Advent time already again .
That means another year almost over .
And what a year it 's been .
In April of this year , we shipped Catalyst 5.80 - the first Catalyst to use Moose from the ground up .
It was a straight port , with minimal additional features - and we did that for a reason .
The reason was that 5.80 allowed us to shake out the compatibility issues resulting from a complete change of object systems .
Change One Thing At Once , as the adage goes - and many thanks to Guillermo Roditi aka " groditi " and Scott McWhirter aka " konobi " for doing the slogging to get a first ported version up we could start beating on and clean up for release .
We did this in the hope that rather than needing to add features to the core to take advantage of Moose , the Catalyst community would step up and figure it out in the wider world so we could try and fail a few times to find the best path without committing ourselves to maintaining compatibility with the bad ideas .
Frankly , I 'd say the plan succeeded beyond our wildest expectations .
What modules are worth a ( re -) look ?
Catalyst :: Model :: DBIC ::Schema has been rewritten using a traits system to enable plugins to be written and loaded for it easily , and is once again a shining example of best practices for model adaptor authoring ( many thanks to Rafael Kitover aka " Caelum " for doing the heavy lifting - and for putting up with my nitpicking during the process ) .
CatalystX:: RoleApplicator allows us to add roles elegantly to the application , request , response , engine , dispatcher , and stats classes in use , eliminating the need to construct near - empty classes in order to compose together additional functionality .
Better still , RoleApplicator is implemented using MooseX :: RelatedClassRoles , so you can use the same interface when you hit similar problems in your own code ( many thanks to Hans Dieter Pearcey aka " confound " for writing both ) .
Catalyst :: Controller :: ActionRole provides the : Does attribute which applies roles to your action class rather than setting it ala : ActionClass - far cleaner , and as with RoleApplicator , allows multiple behaviours to be used at once ( merci to both confound , and to Florian Ragwitz aka " rafl " for this one ) .
Given that , we can now implement things such as Catalyst : : ActionRole : : ACL , which provides declarative role - based authorization for actions ( kudos to David Wollmann aka " converter " for this one ) .
This can be combined onto the same action with other similar modules , such as Catalyst : : ActionRole : : NeedsLogin from CatalystX :: SimpleLogin , so that un-logged - in users are redirected to the login page , and logged - in users are restricted unless they have correct permissions - all on a single controller method .
CatalystX :: SimpleLogin also illustrates that we 're now able to supply actions from controller roles ( and method modifiers to existing actions ) - for example CatalystX :: SimpleLogin:: TraitFor::Controller::Login::Logout adds a logout action to your controller ( SimpleLogin was created by a number of evil geniuses - see the docs for the full list ) .
This is possible because of work done on MooseX :: MethodAttributes by rafl and Tomas Doran aka " t0m " , with assorted help , kibitzing , and occasional laughter from the Moose community .
I should probably also mention HTML :: FormHandler , from Gerda Shank aka " gshank " , which seems to be rapidly gaining in popularity .
It 's aiming at a different problem definition to HTML :: FormFu , but given its wide adoption perhaps it 's aiming for a better problem definition ; I am grumpy and cynical about form handling so choose not to express an opinion .
But HTML :: FormHandler is a great example of the same , growing , trend as MooseX : : RelatedClassRoles - non-Catalyst - dependent modules being written with Moose as the lingua franca , and then thin glue to integrate them into Catalyst ( or in the case of FormHandler , no glue required at all :) .
The point
See how every single module I 've mentioned introduces at least one new name ?
That .
Is How Catalyst Happens .
Catalyst has always been a project of the community , driven by the community .
I first got involved by turning up on the #catalyst channel on irc.perl.org and starting trying to figure out how to use Catalyst .
Given that I was already planning to abuse it as well , I was reading the source and happened to notice a potential bug in the regexp dispatch system ; when I flagged this to the channel somebody immediately offered to audit and apply a patch for it if I could come up with one .
Seeing as it was a simple fix , I whipped it up , presented it , and was told " what about tests ? " and pointed at which test to add to in order to prove that the fix worked .
So I did , and it did , and the patch was applied .
And I was addicted .
Not long after that I volunteered to run the source repositories ( and later Shadowcat ended up hosting the entire project infrastructure , but that 's another story involving a grinch of an ISP and a Christmas eve migration :) ) , and as other people became addicted , I had the unmitigated pleasure of handing out commit bit after commit bit - and in more recent times arranging for the handing out of co-maint bit after co-maint bit as release managers for different related projects shift around .
I 'm entry 18 in the Catalyst svnpasswd file .
As of today it 's 275 contributors long .
A client manager once listened to me rave about this community , and told me that utopias never lasted .
Perhaps he was right .
Catalyst is n't that ; it 's an anarchy , a meritocracy , an oligarchy , and a dictatorship , in equal measure and without contradiction .
When a member of the community moves on to other projects , two more step up to take his place ; active contributors ebb , flow , and eddy as people 's work lives and real lives intersect and interact with itches to be scratched .
Even for core this is true - t0 m now acts as the 5.80 chainsaw delegate and keeper of todo lists ; rafl has stepped up to split the dist building work with Marcus Ramberg , our long - standing release manager ; Kieren Diment aka " kd " replaced Jesse Sheidlower aka " the_jester " as docs co-ordinator after Real Life happened to the_jester ( well , that and writing http://www.amazon.com/F-Word-Jesse-Sheidlower/dp/0195393112, of which I of course heartily approve :) .
Speaking of documentation , the Catalyst ( and for that matter DBIx : : Class ) project has always had a spirit of treating documenters as at least as important as implementors - the record of contributions does not record who 's who , or who was what for which project , and that 's correct .
The words to make a piece of code comprehensible are as essential to that piece of code being successfully used as the Perl source is .
So how does Catalyst happen ?
It happens because of you , the other users ( I can't say " our " users , since we 're users too ) .
When you report problems , when you discuss things on mailing lists , and especially when you cross the line to contributor by editing the wiki or patching some POD or sending a test or even implementing a feature or fixing a bug .
And if you want to try to contribute something but can't think of what , well , for this month only we could really rather do with ...
Advent Calendar articles :) - so please , please mail the Advent Calendar co-ordinator Bogdan Lucaciu aka " zamolxes " at bogdan at sinapticode.com if you fancy having a go , and if you can't think of a topic then try picking one of the modules I mention above and writing about that !
A look forward to 2010
Best of all , next year , it 's going to keep happening .
Devin Austin aka " dhoss " has almost finished the complete rewrite of the helper and script system he started as a Google Summer of Code minion , Zbigniew Lukasiak aka " zby " has an almost complete branch splitting the application and per-request context objects which will enable a whole bunch more awesome things , and miyagawa 's Catalyst : : Engine : : PSGI lets us take advantage of Plack - which I fully expect to take the Perl web world by storm in the next year .
I might even manage to figure out how some of the things I 've been experimenting with in Web : : Simple apply to improving the state of the art rather than just sitting around talking design with people and writing waffling articles .
2009 ruled .
2010 is going to rule even more .
So stick right with us and let 's show you the former , and maybe even give you some ideas on helping make the latter a reality .
Because this is going to be the coolest Catalyst Advent Calendar so far .
Oh , and Merry F***ing Christmas ! -- mst , out

The term living statue refers to a mime artist who poses like a statue or mannequin , usually with realistic statue - like makeup , sometimes for hours at a time .
It is an art that requires a great deal of patience and physical stamina .
As with all performing arts , living statue performers may perform as buskers or in commissioned shows .
Do n’t know how you , guys , feel about living statues but for me they always associate with childhood and something magic .
Hope you have similar feelings and will enjoy this selection !

Sarah Palin , with daughters Piper and Willow , was Oprah Winfrey 's guest Former US vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has said a run for the White House in 2012 is " not on my radar screen right now " .
In an interview with US TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey , the former Alaska governor also did not rule out one day standing for president .
Mrs Palin , who quit as the governor of Alaska this year , is currently on a media tour to launch her memoirs .
She remains extremely popular among many American conservatives .
Mrs Palin was appearing on the talk show to promote her 413 - page autobiography , " Going Rogue : An American Life " .
Asked about a White House run in 2012 , she said she was focusing her efforts on mid-term elections next year in which Republicans hope to make inroads into Democratic majorities in Congress .
" I 'm concentrating on 2010 and making sure that we have issues to tackle , " she said in the interview , broadcast on Monday .
" I do n't know what I 'm going to be doing in 2012 .
[ Running for president is ] not on my radar screen right now . "
' Heartbreaking '
The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington says some conservative Republicans wish Mrs Palin would run for the White House in 2012 , believing that she , more than anyone , embodies the values they cherish .
But our correspondent adds other Republicans regard the prospect with undisguised horror , believing the former governor of Alaska would simply lead the party into oblivion .
Mrs Palin also said she was upset at the behaviour of her grandson 's father , Levi Johnston .
Mr Johnston , who fathered the child out of wedlock with Mrs Palin 's daughter Bristol , is to be a model for Playgirl magazine .
Mrs Palin said she found it " a bit heartbreaking to see the road that he is on right now " .
In her autobiography , Mrs Palin describes tensions during the Republican campaign when she stood as Senator John McCain 's Republican running mate .
She says she was left with an expenses bill of $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) when the Republicans lost , although Mr McCain 's office has denied this .

Indianapolis , Merrillville , Valparaiso , and Muncie are among the troubled Indiana cities .
Please consider Indiana cities pull plug on streetlamps to save money .
Budget cuts and property tax caps are leaving many residents across Indiana in the dark .
Merrillville has turned off every other streetlight on its main roads .
Valparaiso is turning off every other light in some areas and has set others to turn off at midnight .
Muncie officials say the city will shut off 85 percent of overhead lights to help balance the 2010 budget .
The moves are a response to rising costs and shrinking revenue that 's the result of the ailing economy and property tax caps .
Muncie Mayor Sharon McShurley says the move could result in more than just darker streets .
" I 'm setting you on notice , " she told the council .
" The decisions you have made , unless you reconsider the budget , are going to be detrimental to the city . "
Merrillville Public Works Director Bruce Spires said the city is more than a year behind on its NIPSCO bills .
The city will turn off 300 streetlights , for a savings of about $ 2,000 a month .
" The town has been very aggressive in putting up streetlights for the past 15 years , especially when we can get federal funding for them , " Spires said .
" You really do n't miss that they are gone , " Spires said .
" There 's still plenty of light out there . "
Valparaiso officials say they are n't sure how much electricity the city is using because it pays a flat rate per light each month , regardless of whether the light is working .
Guilty Until Proven Innocent ( No Proof Acceptable )
Motorists who receive minor parking or traffic tickets in Indianapolis , Indiana are being threatened with fines of up to $ 2500 if they attempt to take the ticket to court .
A local attorney with the firm Roberts and Bishop was so outraged by what he saw in Marion County traffic court that he filed a class action suit yesterday seeking to have the practice banned as unconstitutional .
The city made explicit the threat of additional fines for challenging parking tickets in a November 30 press release announcing a deal between Indianapolis and a private firm , T2 Systems , to hand over operations of a parking ticket court to increase municipal income .
In traffic court , Judge William Young has been making good on the threats by routinely siding with police officers in disputes and imposing fines of up to $ 500 on anyone who challenges a moving violation ticket , no matter how minor , and loses .
Those who pay without going to court do not face this extra fine .
“ The deck is stacked against the motorist , ” lawyer Paul K. Ogden wrote .
Ogden argues the court ’s practices violate the excessive fines clause of the state constitution as well as the clause requiring that “ all penalties shall be proportioned to the nature of the offense . ”
Violin
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Antonio Stradivari is the most famous instrument maker of all time .
He was especially famous for his violins , which he produced in Cremona from about 1665 until his death in 1737 .
In particular , the legendary varnish on his instruments has fascinated musicians , violinmakers , historians , and chemists since the beginning of the 19th century -- inciting controversial speculation about " secret " ingredients .
The use of analytical processes has allowed a team of scientists from various French and German institutions to shine a light on the mystery .
As the researchers led by Jean - Philippe Echard ( Cité de la musique -- Musée de la musique , Paris ) and Loďc Bertrand ( IPANEMA -- Synchrotron SOLEIL , Gif- sur - Yvette ) report in the journal Angewandte Chemie , Stradivari used completely common and easily obtained materials that were broadly used in 18th century decorative arts and paintings .
The team examined five Stradivari violins that have been in the collection of the Musée de la musique for at least a century : a “ Long Pattern ” model , possibly from the year 1692 , the “ Davidoff ” , dated from the year 1708 , the “ Provigny ” from 1716 ( the picture shows a cross- section of its varnish with the wood at the bottom ) , the “ Sarasate ” from 1724 , and the head of a viola d’amore , dated from around 1720 .
The researchers took samples containing both wood and varnish from carefully selected locations and subjected them to complementary spectroscopic and microscopic examinations .
“ Although the five instruments were produced over a period of three decades , their varnishes are very similar , ” explains Echard .
“ Stradivari first applied a layer of an oil comparable to the oils used by painters of the same epoch , without fillers or pigments to seal the wood .
We did not find a mineral - rich layer , as some earlier work suggests .
The master violinmaker next applied a slightly tinted oil - resin layer .
We have detected nothing that would have suggested the use of protein - containing materials , gums , or fossil resins . ”
The researchers found no pigments in the outer layer of the “ Long Pattern ” model .
In earlier examinations , they found the red pigment vermilion on the “ Sarasate ” .
Now they have detected two other red pigments in Stradivari ’s varnish : red iron oxides and a lake pigment made of an anthraquinone dye , probably chochineal , on an alumina substrate .
Bertrand indicates that a very broad array of techniques was an absolute necessity to cope with the analytical challenge of studying such complex micro samples .
Stradivari therefore used materials that were easily obtained and broadly used in his time .
The use of multiple red pigments allowed him to give a variety of tints to his instruments , which are still highly praised for their beautiful appearance .
Says Echard , “ Stradivari thus did not use any unusual or secret ingredients , he was simply a true master of his craft . ”

You might be a stimulus fan , you might be a stimulus foe , but you 've got to admire the sweep of stimulus spending in Ohio .
It has provided more than $ 1.2 million and added three jobs in Ohio 's 21st Congressional District .
Never mind that there is no such district .
There also is n't a 20th , 49th , 54th , 56th , 69th , 85th , 87th or 99th , even though the federal government 's
Web site for tracking stimulus money lists them as getting funding .
And there most certainly is not a district numbered " 00 , " even though the government 's
Web site says it got $ 1.86 million , which helped create or save eight jobs .
Ohio Watchdog reported this yesterday .
By today , the errors were noted by others .
Clearly this is all a mistake , and Gov. Ted Strickland 's spokeswoman , Amanda Wurst , said late today that it was caused at the " sub - recipient " level .
That means local governments or local entities .
" In some cases , we believe it may be that someone entered an Ohio House district rather than a congressional district , " she said .
In others , someone apparently used numbers or the " 00 " as a place holder while filling out the forms and neglected to go back and put in the congressional district .
This occurred in other states , too .
Vermont has a single congressional district , yet Recovery.gov reports stimulus spending in seven additional ( and nonexistent ) ones -- including Vermont 's own " 00 . "
This does little to reassure skeptics .
Surf 's up as biggest waves in five years come to Hawaii after North Pacific storm
Advertisement
Thousands of spectators and surfers are flocking to Hawaii 's beaches to see the biggest waves in years crash ashore .
Heavy traffic backed up for miles yesterday along roads leading to Oahu's North Shore .
Some of the world 's most daring surfers took on the powerful and dangerous waves , which forecasters say could reach heights of 50ft ( 15 metres ) by tomorrow .
The surf grew so large that a few beaches on Oahu and Maui were closed because lifeguards feared inexperienced sightseers could drown , according to state officials .
Two surfers ride a huge wave at Waimea Bay on the north shore of Oahu in Haleiwa , Hawaii , yesterday
' After the water comes in , it can drag you back out with it , ' said Eric Basta , a manager at Surf N Sea in Haleiwa .
' Be mindful of how powerful the surf really is .'
As violent as the waves were , they are expected to growth in strength , according to the National Weather Service .
The high waves are expected to continue throughout Wednesday .
A legendary big wave surfing contest , the Quicksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau , may be held today for the first time since 2004 if waves reach a minimum of 40 feet ( 12 meters ) , organisers said .
The event is only held in perfect conditions , and the waves were n't quite big or smooth enough on Monday .
' The swell energy is continuing to grow , and the waves may get larger , ' said Robert Ballard , a forecaster for the National Weather Service .
' A large storm over the North Pacific has sent a wave train at us . '
Hawaii has n't seen such large waves since 2004 or 1998 , he said .
Teams of tow - in surfers - who use jet watercraft to race into waves too big to paddle - are flying to Maui from Brazil , South Africa and Australia , The Honolulu Advertiser reported .
The Quicksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau surf contest was postponed because the surf did not reach the 30 - 40 foot wave high requirement yesterday
But forecasters say waves could reach heights of 50 feet ( 15 meters ) by tomorrow , with plans to hold the surf contest today

Inquiring minds are listening to Senator Jim Bunning grill Ben Bernanke over the Fed 's miserable performance under Bernanke .
Here is a partial transcript but I recommend playing the 13 minute video in entirety .
Alan Greenspan refused to look for bubbles or to do anything other than create them .
Likewise it is clear from your statements over the last four years that you failed to spot the housing bubble despite many warnings .
Under your watch every one of the major banks failed or would have failed had you not bailed them out .
After taking over the Fed you did not seen any need for more substantial regulation of derivatives until it was clear that they were headed into the financial meltdown thanks in part to those products .
The Greenspan policy on transparency was to talk a lot , use plenty of numbers , but say nothing .
You promised congress more transparency when you came to the job .
You promised more transparency when you came begging for TARP .
To be fair you have published more information than before but those efforts are inadequate and you still refuse to provide details on the Fed 's bailout last year on all the toxic waste you have bought .
Chairman Greenspan sold the Fed 's independence to Wall Street on the so called " Greenspan PUT " .
Whenever Wall Street needed a boost , Alan was there .
But you went even farther than that when you bowed to the political pressure of the Bush and Obama Administrations , and turned the Fed into an arm of the Treasury .
Under your watch the " Bernanke PUT " became a bailout for all large financial institutions , including many foreign banks .
And you put the printing presses into overdrive to fund the government 's spending and hand out cheap money to your masters on Wall Street .
In short , you are the definition of a moral hazard .
You are repeating the same mistakes as Japan in the 1990's on a much larger scale while sowing the seeds for the next bubble .
The AIG bailout alone is reason enough to send you back to Princeton .
I will do everything I can to stop your nomination and drag out this process as long as I can .
We must put an end to your and the Fed 's failure and there is no better time than now .
Your Fed has become the creature from Jekyll Island .
I used to be a big fan of organizational items .
Although I was n’t much of a shopper , a trip to The Container Store or Organized Living never failed to excite me .
The idea of corralling hundreds of loose bits and bobs into sleek , perfectly - matched containers had great appeal .
I truly thought that by putting all my stuff into various bins , I could maintain a sense of order in my life .
But while the containers made my house look shelter magazine - tidy , they did n’t bring me the serenity I ’d hoped for .
Even though everything was arranged neatly in pretty boxes ( cloth - covered , wooden , wicker , plastic , etc. ) , it was still there .
In reality , all those lovely boxes , bins , and drawers served no higher purpose than to hide my junk .
At some point I realized that I was n’t organizing my life ; I was organizing my clutter .
That ’s when I changed strategies : I went from world - class organizer to world - class declutterer .
Instead of arranging and containing things , I got rid of them .
I decluttered on the weekends ; I decluttered in the evening ; I decluttered in the morning ; I decluttered in my dreams ( really ! ) .
When I was n’t actually decluttering , I was thinking about what I could declutter next . :-)
And it worked .
As my house became emptier , I became happier .
With the weight of my stuff lifted from my shoulders , I felt more spontaneous , energetic , and carefree .
The big payoff came when I was able to declutter the containers themselves .
There ’s something very satisfying about not needing any more storage !
Even so , when we completed our ultimate decluttering to move to the UK ( see My Minimalist Story , Part 2 : The Great Unraveling ) , I ’m embarrassed about how many containers we left on the curb .
( Do n’t worry , they did n’t go to a landfill ; they were snapped up within minutes ! )
My advice to anyone who feels they need to get organized : declutter first .
If you have to , declutter for a year before you start buying fancy boxes and squirreling things away .
Then think long and hard before you put something into a container ( especially if it ’s not something you use regularly ) .
Because once you give something a warm , cozy abode , it can be hard to get it to leave .
Ten years ago , at the turn of the millennium , Nostraslammy took a stab at predicting the 21st Century , with a promise to check back every ten years to see how the prognostications were turning out .
Odds are good I wo n’t be able to do a review every ten years until 2100 , but I figure I ’m probably good through 2030 , at least , barring some unforeseen calamity .
And if you ’re Nostraslammy , what ’s this “ unforeseen ” thing , anyway ?
Let ’s see how our 22 articles of foresight are holding up , one at a time .
1 : Researchers will develop either a vaccine or a cure for AIDS by 2020 .
However , it will be expensive enough that the disease will plague the poor long after it has become a non-issue for the rich and middle classes ( although this is one case where political leaders might fund free treatment programs ) .
The end of AIDS will trigger a sexual revolution that will compare to or exceed that of the 1960s and 1970s ( unless another deadly sexually - transmitted disease evolves , which is certainly a possibility ) .
Too soon to tell on the cure , although I suppose it ’s still possible .
We have treatments that can extend the HIV victim ’s life indefinitely and any number of research programs are working on the problem so let ’s call this a maybe .
As for part two of the prediction , that one ’s looking pretty likely , is n’t it ?
Part three I stand by , no matter when the disease is finally cured .
2 : The first quarter of the century will see the assassination of a professional athlete during a competition .
Has n’t happened yet , but there ’s no reason to think it unlikely .
Fans still have unprecedented access to athletes in some sports ( in most NBA arenas front - row fans might as well be sitting on the bench ) and it seems to me like it ’s only a matter of time .
3 : By 2015 a major corporate executive will be assassinated .
As a result , top executives of American companies will have to live with security precautions we once associated only with top political leaders .
Again , has n’t happened yet , and for the life of me I ca n’t figure out why .
Lay , Skilling , Ebbers , Madoff , Nacchio , the Rigas , Koslowski , half the bankers on Wall Street – it ’s damned near unfathomable how none of these deserving pillagers have been whacked by one of the people whose lives they ruined .
In any case , put me down for “ when , not if , ” even if I miss my 2015 target date .
4 : By the end of the 21st Century humanity ’s evolution into posthumanity will be all but complete .
We will be bigger , faster , stronger , smarter , and our average life span will approach ( and perhaps surpass ) 100 , all as a result of technology ’s colonization of the flesh .
These changes will result from medical advances ( including pharmaceuticals , genetic engineering , and gene therapy , and possibly even nanotech ) and computer interface innovations designed to link our minds more closely with the boundless information resident in the Internet .
We will be fundamentally different from humans born 200 years ago – CyberHumans in the year 2100 will have less in common with humanity at the turn of the Millennium than we now have with Cro-Magnon humans from 10,000 years ago .
This is a long - term , too - soon - to - tell item , but I ca n’t imagine that it wo n’t come true .
The impact of technology on the human physiology and human cultures proceeds at an insane pace , with the innovation curve being nearly vertical .
So let me get on record as being more confident now that I was even a decade ago .
5 : Columbine - type outbursts of school violence will continue to strike large , middle - class suburban schools .
Intermediate steps to increase security will turn schools into armed compounds , and will deter all but the most serious conspiracies .
However , these measures will only intensify the core disease infecting these environments , and unless major steps are taken to reduce the size of these schools ( and hence the anonymity factor ) , some student or students will eventually succeed where Harris and Klebold failed , killing hundreds of their classmates .
We have n’t had a case that surpassed Columbine ( although if we broaden the scope to include universities , Virginia Tech is comparable ) .
We ’ve seen no move to address the school size issue , so on the whole I ’d say that I ’m on track with this one .
6 : The popularity of professional baseball will continue to slip .
The pace of the game , already slow by late - 20th Century standards , will fail to win over younger fans , who are increasingly attuned to video - game levels of sensory stimulation , and the continuing divide between big market and small market franchises will deprive fans in all but a handful of cities of the ability to emotionally invest themselves in the hope of winning .
If Major League Baseball adopts a serious salary cap and revenue sharing structure in the first decade of the century the decline of the game can be delayed .
But by the year 2100 America ’s Pastime will be the third or fourth most popular spectator sport in the U.S. , at best .
Ratings and attendance appear to be trending downward .
A lot can happen between now and 2100 , of course , but for the time being this prediction looks like a strong one .
I ’m not terribly happy about it , either .
I ’ve played a lot baseball in my day and watched a lot more , and I love the game .
I hope I ’m wrong and that the game thrives in the future .
But there are so many obstacles .
The steroid scandals hurt the credibility of the game ( although baseball has bounced back from scandal before ) , but nothing poses quite the threat of the rich / poor gap – and I say this as a fan of the Red Sox , the second - worst offender behind the Yankees .
As long as supporters of 80 % of the teams know they have damned near no chance to win , the sport is going to struggle .
7 : The explosion of technological innovation and development we witnessed in the 20th Century ( especially during the latter half ) may plateau in the second half of the 2000s .
Whether the leveling off occurs sooner or later will hinge on the feasibility of nanotechnologies .
If nanotech proves as viable as many researchers ( and science fiction writers ) currently think we could continue to see the development of technological marvels we can barely imagine , and the plateau predicted here might not occur until late in the century , or even early in the 22nd .
Otherwise , the nearly vertical innovation curve we ’ve seen in the past few decades should be flattening out substantially by the middle of the century .
Perhaps more than any other item on the list , this one I ’m not sure about .
We could see a plateau – that has been the lesson of history – but our current pace is so explosive and shows no signs of doing anything except picking up more steam , so this prediction may wind up in the Nostraslammy ’s loss column when all is said and done .
8 : Artificial life will evolve , although not as a result of Artificial Intelligence projects .
Instead , the massive growth of computing power , coupled with the development of the global communications web , will result in a ubiquitous network of connected information , and Information Life will occur when the concentration of information reaches critical mass , in a process not unlike the spontaneous eruption of organic life billions of years ago .
Two things to note : first , given the non-physical , non-organic nature of this InfoLife , humanity may well not recognize it when it happens ; and second , it may not recognize humanity as a life form , either .
This has n’t happened yet , as far as we know , but I continue to believe this the most likely path to the evolution of AI / A Life .
Not everyone agrees with me , including my friend and colleague Anne Foerst , who knows a frightening amount about AI and is convinced that it must arise within an embodied context .
My counter is that the path I ’m theorizing is the one that ’s most like the evolutionary spurts we ’ve seen throughout history .
We wo n’t know until we know , but mark me down as still confident in this prediction .
9 : Public rhetoric about the democratizing power of the information economy notwithstanding , the rich - poor gap will not close , but will instead widen .
It is unlikely that anything short of a major revolution will alter the underlying structures of power and wealth , which are robustly self - perpetuating .
Damn , this prediction is looking good .
Of course , this was probably the most obvious one on the list .
10 : The Neo-Luddite Movement will become increasingly violent .
Cultural dislocations resulting from the rapid pace of technological innovation and deployment in the next 20 years will fuel increasing levels of resistance against “ progress . ”
The Neo-Luddites , already well established and with spiritual leaders firmly in place , will eventually feel compelled to abandon rhetoric in favor of drastic action .
At first the technoresistance will focus its energies in terrorist strikes against machinery and facilities , but will eventually graduate to widespread terrorism against technologists themselves .
We have not had outbreaks of violence tied directly to any overt neo-Luddite movements , but I ’d argue that a lot of the terrorist acts we ’ve seen have had at their core the same reaction to technopoly that characterizes our self - identified neo-Luddites ( like Kirkpatrick Sale , Mark Slouka and others ) .
For instance , I ’d file any and all terror by religious fundamentalists under this heading , including 9/11 .
Fundamentalisms are ultimately about the displacement of religious institutions as the final arbiter of morality and ethics in a culture ( and a hefty fear of the rampaging change brought on by technical innovation ) .
Take something like abortion ( or any question of reproductive rights ) , for instance .
Is n’t abortion a direct artifact of the world of medical technics ?
And what happens to our ability to intervene in affairs on the other side of the globe if we strip away our technological superiority ?
I believe this neo -Luddite impulse goes even further – I think there ’s a great case to be made that the violence of the Unabomber ( read his manifesto ) and Harris and Klebold are essentially reactions against a technological society run amok .
So I ’m declaring victory on this prediction and believe that the problem is only going to get worse so long as our technology evolves more rapidly than our ethics .
11 : The Red Sox and Cubs will each win a World Series .
We knocked half of this one out in just a couple of years .
Can the Cubs win it all in the next 90 years ?
I think so .
They ’ve shown signs of life in the last decade and I think it ’s only a matter of time before they win one despite themselves .
12 : Despite the growth of the Internet and other interactive modes of entertainment , the film will survive and thrive in its current form for the foreseeable future .
Prognosticators who point to the power of interactivity and suggest that traditional one - way media are doomed may be right with respect to home - based media like television , but these dynamics do n’t apply to film .
First , it serves as a vital locus for social interaction ( it ’s an ideal activity for a date , for instance ) ; and second , our thirst for the power and mystery of storytelling is in no danger of being extinguished ( the most successful videogame authors have figured this much out already ) .
Anybody seen Avatar ?
It just cleared the billion - dollar mark over the weekend .
Yes , we ’ve seen an explosion in gaming and home - based entertainment offerings , but the movie biz looks stronger than ever .
13 : By the year 2010 , major universities will notice that their graduates lack many basic skills and will begin questioning the value of computers and the Internet in higher education .
Some ( but not all ) will conclude that educational technologies place unproductive layers of machinery between student and teacher .
This will spur a renewed emphasis on traditional educational strategies and basic literacy , organizational , and critical thinking skills .
Looks like I missed this one big time , did n’t I ?
In fact , it seems like precisely the opposite is happening at every turn .
Which is sad , because what I describe in the prediction is much needed .
Our educational complex is in the worst shape it ’s ever been in , and in so many cases technology is part of the problem , not the solution .
14 : The U.S. population will migrate northward during the second quarter of the century .
Rising average temperatures will fuel a move to milder climes .
Air conditioning will insure the comfort of indoor living , but many people place a high importance on outdoor activities , especially during the summer months .
Too soon to tell , but if our scientists are right about climate disruption ( and I think they are ) this looks likely .
15 : During the 21st Century we may finally learn that we are not alone in the universe .
If intelligent extraterrestrial life exists , which seems plausible at least , humanity should soon reach the point where our technology will either allow us to find it ( the Contact scenario ) or encourage it to find us ( the Star Trek : First Contact scenario ) .
Hopefully our first meeting will be more like Close Encounters of the Third Kind than Mars Attacks ! , and if we get really lucky our new friends might have technologies for scrubbing the atmosphere , purifying vast bodies of water , and curing male pattern baldness .
We have n’t found alien life yet , but we have found a lot more evidence of worlds with the conditions to sustain life ( like recent discoveries concerning water on Mars ) .
It seems like we hear a new report on alien worlds that are very Earth - like every month or two .
As a result , I remain bullish on item # 15 .
16 : The U.S. will elect its first female and minority Presidents .
Sadly , they will prove as corrupt as the white males they replaced .
One down , one to go .
17 : American media will become more vapid and less reliable early in the century , but the long - term impact could be positive .
Between corporate ownership and the drive to maximize ratings at all costs , most major news outlets will be all but useless for the purpose of informing and educating the public by 2020 ( with the exception of news services covering financial markets ) .
Ironically , this could lead to a new age of subjective journalism .
With the once - mighty press institutions either gone or discredited , and the ideologies of objective journalism along with them , a new breed of reporter may arise .
This new journalist will be openly committed to advocacy , and will make his or her biases clear at the outset .
The advocacy reporter would intersect perfectly with local populations whose disgust with the corruption and unresponsiveness of national ( and even state ) politics have driven them to seek involvement closer to home .
It is possible that these dynamics could usher in a new golden age of civic engagement .
This one is a mixed bag at present .
The first element is a gimme – this is worst moment for journalism since the days of Pulitzer , Hearst and Twain – and while I gave the legacy J establishment until 2020 to complete it ’s full meltdown , it only seems to have needed half that much time .
The rest is unsettled .
We could see the rise of a responsible , ethical advocacy press movement ( see my series on the rise of “ subjective ” journalism ) , but there ’s been no movement so far .
18 : As hard as it is to imagine , commercial radio and the corporate music industry will suck worse in the next 25 years than it did in the last 25 years .
The Internet will make it possible for unknown musicians to distribute their work , but in doing so it will massively increase the clutter of a media landscape that ’s already over - saturated , making it harder for any particular artist to break through into the broad public consciousness .
Since people love music , and since music will continue to serve as a gravity well for cultural and sub-cultural identification and bonding , mechanisms for sifting good from bad will become even more important .
A service that fills this role will emerge on the Net .
It may look like one of the currently developing music Web sites , or it may be a Web - based music journalism outlet , or it could be a type of service we have n’t imagined yet , but something will fill the void once occupied by commercial radio , and probably by 2010 .
Part one of the equation – it would have been hard for me to be more right , huh ?
The part at the end looks like a miss – we ’re still seeing all kinds of attempts at providing a reliable center , but so far most of our energies have been devoted to delivery systems ( and it seems like it ’s only a matter of time before Spotify or something very like becomes that all - songs - available - all - the - time uber - channel for us all ) .
The filtering problem remains .
Net radio and satellite are doing a nice job in places , but the only mass national music outlets are things like godforsaken American Idol , which really is the talent show at the Fall of Rome .
19 : Killer storms will increase in number and intensity .
Whether set in motion by industrial pollution or resulting from natural meteorological cycle , heavy weather is getting nastier , and the trend will continue .
By the midpoint of the 21st century Category 5 hurricanes will hit the U.S. fairly frequently , and the mythical F6 tornado ( which almost occurred for the first time in recorded history in 1999 ) will become commonplace .
A Category 5 will hit a major coastal urban center in the next 25 years , resulting in near - total destruction of the city ’s infrastructure .
During the same time frame a city in the Lower Midwest will take a direct hit from an F6 or a strong F5 and will be annihilated .
Katrina was a lot closer to that Category 5 than we like to think about , and where destructive damage is concerned let ’s remember that it missed New Orleans .
All that damage happened on the back side of a Cat 3 .
As with item # 14 above , there seems every reason to believe that this prediction will come true , although it ’s too early to put it in the win column .
20 : Faced with mounting damage at the hands of increasingly sophisticated hackers , corporations will begin to see “ black ops ” ( both online and real - world ) as a necessary cost of doing business .
The shift from “ corporate security ” to all - out “ Info War ” footing will accelerate by 2010 , when it is revealed that a major online attack against an American company was sponsored by a foreign government .
The U.S. government will be strategically , tactically , and morally unprepared to deal with this crisis , and the absence of policy leadership will result in the online equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis , only instead of three players there will be hundreds with the ability to spark a full - blown cyberwar .
Needless to say , world stock markets will react negatively .
When the dust settles , world governments and corporate interests of all sizes will work together to develop safeguards against activities that threaten the global economy .
The most significant result of this accord will be to transfer most real power from public to private institutions .
This one is a mixed bag at best because there ’s so much we do n’t know .
There is plenty of evidence that large corps have been hit in the way predicted ( and an analyst like Winn Schwartau would tell you that foreign governments have provided all kinds of supports for the perpetrators ) .
The problem lies with my prediction that this would all become public knowledge – that has n’t happened , and in large part it ’s because the companies involved have every incentive to keep it a secret .
Further , if said companies ( perhaps even with the help of our government ) have launched black ops activities , that ’s something else you ’re not likely to hear about in a daily White House press briefing .
So all I can really do at this point is say that I failed to account for the need for secrecy , but at the same time I suspect most of the prediction was on the money .
I may never be able to point to evidence that I was right or wrong , although I ’ll be watching and listening with interest .
21 : Sometime before 2075 a genuinely deserving artist will win a Grammy Award .
Okay , so I ’m out on a limb here …
This was mostly snark , but the underlying point is more valid than ever .
The Grammys are almost as big a joke as the Rock & Roll Hall of Product Sales Fame .
22 : Some form of nuclear fusion will prove technically and economically viable by 2015 .
If fusion and nanotech both happen by 2020 , the year 2101 will bear no more resemblance to 2001 than 2001 does to 2001 B.C. , and the specifics of the changes to society are nearly impossible guess at .
I have another five years before I have to admit defeat , but at this stage my chances look dim .
I do believe that we ’ll see widespread nanotech and commercial fusion in this century , but my timetable was too optimistic .
So there you go .
A few wins , a couple of losses , some too - soon - to - tells and partial successes .
On the whole Nostraslammy is doing better than the grandpappy of predictification , Nostradamus himself , and that ought to count for something , right ?
See you in 2020 .
Mozilla has published its audited financial statements from 2008 , reporting $ 78.6 million in revenue for the fiscal year — a five percent increase from 2007 .
Aside from a weakened investment portfolio , the browser maker has not been hit hard by the economic recession .
Mozilla 's organizational structure and governance model are a bit unusual .
The Mozilla Corporation is a wholly - owned subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation .
The corporation , which is taxable , serves as a vehicle for managing the organization 's business relationships .
The foundation , which has tax - exempt status , holds the organization 's intellectual property and directs its policies and mission .
Most of Mozilla 's revenue is generated through search deals with Google and other popular website operators .
Mozilla receives a kickback for integrating search services from these companies into the Firefox Web browser .
Mozilla also generates revenue from investments and donations that are made by individuals to the foundation .
This revenue allows Mozilla to pay its staff of roughly 200 people and also covers operational overhead such as the expense of Mozilla 's offices , equipment , and technical infrastructure .
Total expenses for 2008 added up to $ 49.4 million , including roughly $ 31.2 million on software development , $ 6.2 million on branding and marketing , and $ 9.8 million on general and administrative costs .
Mozilla also spent about $ 1 million in grants and financial contributions to external organizations , including $ 100,000 to fund development of the open Ogg Theora media codec .
Mozilla 's total assets at the end of 2008 were $ 116 million , a 17 percent increase from the previous year .
This includes the $ 22 million that Mozilla set aside in a tax reserve fund in 2005 pending the outcome of an ongoing IRS investigation of Mozilla 's tax status for 2004 and 2005 .
There is some question as to whether the Mozilla Foundation should continue to be classified as a public charity or be reclassified as a private foundation .
The IRS is still evaluating the matter .
Mozilla chairperson Mitchell Baker posted a blog entry last week with a summary of Mozilla 's financial statements from 2008 and a retrospective overview of the organization 's major accomplishments and new initiatives for that year .
" 2008 was another exciting and robust year for Mozilla , " she wrote .
" Our scope of activities continued to grow , our community of committed contributors and users expanded , our geographical diversity deepened , and our effect on increasing openness , participation , innovation and individual empowerment in Internet life is significant . "
Some view the emergence of Google 's Chrome Web browser as a potential risk to Mozilla 's long - term sustainability , because the organization depends heavily on revenue from the search giant to fund its operations .
There is no immediate risk , however , as Google recently committed to extending its contract with Mozilla to 2011 .
Although Google 's browser is gaining traction , the search giant still has plenty of incentive to pay for privileged placement in Firefox , which has considerably higher marketshare .
According to Baker , the competition is a win for the open Web .
" Competition , while uncomfortable , has benefited Mozilla , pushing us to work harder , " she remarked .
" Mozilla and Firefox continue to prosper , and to reflect our core values .
We expect these competitive trends to continue , benefiting the entire Web . "
Mozilla has come a long way since its initial inception in 1998 .
But despite bringing in tens of millions of dollars in revenue every year , the organization remains strongly committed to its core values rather than the pursuit of profit .
Anyone arrested and taken to custody will be given a GMP Christmas card
Police have arrested 594 people , charged 173 and detained two of the most wanted men in Greater Manchester in the space of 24 hours .
Hundreds of homes were raided , with two blank - firing handguns , three cannabis farms and stolen duty - free goods worth £ 60,000 being recovered .
A third of the entire Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) force was used in the operation .
Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said he was " proud " of the force .
The majority of charges were in connection to burglary and robbery .
Bolton and north Manchester saw the most arrests , with 157 people detained between the two areas .
Sloppy microwave meal
Assistant Chief Constable Sweeney added : " Without the help of the public we would not have had anywhere near as much success .
" The operation is now over , but I expect that total to rise still further as people are processed as they come into custody suites overnight .
" The two wanted men we detained have been sought after for a number of robberies and burglaries . "
As part of the operation , anyone arrested and taken into custody will be given a Christmas card , inspired by a well - known Marks and Spencer advert .
The card reads : " This is not just any Christmas dinner - this is a GMP custody suite Christmas dinner . "
It warns potential criminals that instead of turkey with all the trimmings , they will face a sloppy microwave meal served in a plastic tray .
Police have also worked with the courts to ensure suspects are put through the judicial system as quickly as possible .
LACKING DIRECTION ….
The Washington Post released a poll today on what Republican voters are thinking , and how satisfied they are with their party .
The results were all over the place .
The Republican rank and file is largely in sync with GOP lawmakers in their staunch opposition to efforts by President Obama and Democrats to enact major health - care legislation , but a new Washington Post poll also reveals deep dissatisfaction among GOP voters with the party ’s leadership as well as ideological and generational differences that may prove big obstacles to the party ’s plans for reclaiming power .
What ’s tricky about all of this is trying to get a sense of direction .
Rank - and - file Republicans are n’t happy , but it ’s not altogether clear what they ’re looking for , either .
In 2005 , 76 % of Republicans were satisfied with the direction set by the party ’s leadership ; now that number is 49 % .
About a third believes GOP leaders do not stand up for the party ’s “ core values . ”
The next question , of course , is what Republican leaders should do in response , and that ’s where the poll offers few clues .
It ’s one thing to learn that the party is off - track ; it ’s another to know what to do about it .
It ’s not like there ’s a clamoring for an even more right - wing party — 58 % of Republicans want to see the party work with Democrats , and 69 % said they approve of GOP candidates who take moderate positions on some issues .
There ’s also no real sense of what the party ’s priorities ought to be .
About a third of Republicans believe the GOP should spend more time opposing gay marriage , but nearly as many believe the party should do the opposite .
About a third of Republicans want to see more focus on abortion , and nearly as many prefer less .
GOP voters expressed concern about taxes , spending , and the economy , but that ’s pretty much what the party leadership focuses on already .
This is not entirely unexpected — when the party has a small congressional minority , no clear leadership , and no policy agenda to speak of , it stands to reason that rank - and - file attitudes would be all over the place .
But the poll is n’t much of a roadmap for what party supporters expect their representatives to do .
Dry bulk vessel over - supply is finally taking its toll , the Baltic Dry Index ( BDI ) has gone into a nosedive as shown below .
US - listed dry bulk stocks such as DryShips ( DRYS ) and Eagle Bulk ( EGLE ) have been drifting lower .
While the current index level is still equivalent to historically strong rates , continued strength in 2010 is entirely predicated on continued growth of Chinese dry bulk raw material imports .
While November iron ore imports were encouraging and 2009 was a year of surprising strength , with China it could all disappear in an instant .
Bloomberg ( Dec 11th ) : Iron ore imports by China , the world ’s largest buyer , rose 12 percent last month as steelmakers increased production to meet demand from makers of cars and appliances .
Imports of the steelmaking ingredient were 51.1 million metric tons , the customs office said on its Web site today .
That compares with 45.5 million tons in October and a record 64.6 million tons in September , according to Bloomberg data .
....
Emirates Business : " In 2009 , the potential for a much steeper decline was offset by a notable surge in the seaborne trade of iron ore – the largest single dry bulk commodity , accounting for 27 per cent of total cargoes – which actually increased by about three per cent y- o -y , " it said .
Strong Chinese demand for the material proved vital to this growth .
China 's iron ore imports increased by more than 20 per cent y-o -y in 2009 as its share of the seaborne iron ore market rose from 58 per cent in 2008 to 66 per cent , offsetting the reduction in volumes shipped to other major import markets such as Japan and South Korea .
While a number of factors are reported to have caused this unexpected surge – the fall in global commodity prices ; falling output by domestic mines ; and rampant stockpiling by steel mills and speculators ...
Dunes of sand - sized materials have been trapped on the floors of many Martian craters .
This view shows dunes inside a crater in Noachis Terra , west of the giant Hellas impact basin in Mars ' southern hemisphere .
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured this view on Dec. 28 , 2009 .
The orbiter resumed making observations in mid-December following a three - month hiatus .
A set of new images from the HiRISE camera is on the camera team 's site , at http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/nea.php.
The dunes here are linear , thought to be due to shifting wind directions .
In places , each dune is remarkably similar to adjacent dunes , including a reddish ( or dust - colored ) band on northeast - facing slopes .
Large angular boulders litter the floor between dunes .
The most extensive linear dune fields known in the solar system are on Saturn 's large moon Titan .
Titan has a very different environment and composition , so at meter - scale resolution they probably are very different from Martian dunes .
The University of Arizona , Tucson , operates the HiRISE camera , which was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for the NASA Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver , is the prime contractor for the project and built the spacecraft .
Google has sent out 100,000 window stickers to US businesses , proclaiming them to be Favourite Places and providing a QR Code for a quick link to information and reviews .
The QR Code is a variant on the traditional barcode , and readable by the majority of smartphones using the camera , the codes sent out to businesses link to a Google Place Page which can contain opening times and the like , along with customer reviews in a distinctly Yelpish style and nearby photographs .
Google reckons you 'll be walking down the street and see one of these Google - branded marks in the window , run up a QR Code client and use the camera on your mobile to connect to a page containing opening times , business information and user - generated reviews , not to mention the all - pervasive advertising which is the point of the process .
For the hard of thinking Google provides an explanatory video :
That means Google can advertise to people who were n't even planning to use the internet , who visited Google in cyberspace in response to a physical manifestation of the Mountain View brand .
Businesses are at liberty not to put the service mark into their windows , and those with poor reviews will probably choose not to , but Google will be maintaining a Place Page on them anyway accessible through Google Mobile Maps .
It 's easy to imagine routinely checking restaurants and hotels against the Google Place Page , with the associated transfer of trust and reliance on crowd - sourced reviews .
That might be a marvellous thing - rather than relying on brands ( such as Premier Inn , Pizza Hut or Starbucks ) one could find better local alternatives , assuming one trusts the reviews on Google .
But it also makes it very difficult for competing services to get a foot in , when there 's only so much space available in the business window . ®
How people are putting on their best face by putting on their smallest face — and they ’re doing this through the tiny faces makeup challenge .
The Ten Brands That Will Disappear In 2010
24/7 Wall St. has prepared its list of the ten brands that will disappear in 2010 .
This list is based on a review of each firm ’s financial situation and other operating data , the current and ongoing value of its brand , and whether the company that controls that brand can sell its assets .
This year a number of famous brands have closed or their parents have announced that they will be shut down shortly .
This includes decades - old magazines like Gourmet and famous car brands like Pontiac .
The recession took whatever economic value these brands had left and destroyed it .
The brands on the 24/7 list for 2010 include companies that have been in trouble for years .
Some have been in slow decline and others were irreparably damaged by the credit crisis .
Most of these companies will be bought and the rest will simply be closed .
Newsweek .
The magazine already has slashed its rate base ( circulation guaranteed to advertisers ) from 3.1 million to 2.5 million .
It has announced further cuts that will take this figure to 1.5 million early next year .
The New York Times reported that Newsweek ’s advertising fell 29.9 % through the first three quarters of 2009 .
According to the 10 - Q for The Washington Post Company ( NYSE : WPO ) , Newsweek ad revenue plunged 47 % in the third quarter from the year before .
The magazine has lost almost $ 30 million so far this year .
Newsweek had hoped to transform itself into a poor man ’s version of the Economist and has largely dropped covering breaking news and reviews of the big stories of the week .
The change in the editorial direction of Newsweek may have been the right thing to do , but it came much too late .
Newsweek , like many other print products , hopes to rely on internet readership and advertising to improve its fortunes .
Audience measurement firm Compete indicates that the audience of Newsweek.com has dropped 15 % in the last year to 1.3 million unique visitors a month in October .
Audience research firm comScore shows an even sharper decline .
That is , by itself , an important indication that the public has not been attracted to the “ new ” Newsweek .
The Washington Post has enough trouble with fixing problems at its flagship paper .
Its online news and commentary magazine , Slate.com , had more than 3.8 million visitors in October .
Slate has none of the legacy print costs of Newsweek .
Motorola .
The handset and telecom infrastructure company may finally have a future three years after falling from the No.2 spot in global cell phone share to obscurity .
The time has come for the company to break itself into pieces and allow buyers to scuttle a brand with a bad reputation .
The firm has said it will seek a buyer for its cable and wireless equipment companies for a $ 4.5 billion price tag .
Motorola has a market cap of $ 19 billion .
Motorola has long - term debt of $ 3.9 billion and cash of about $ 3 billion .
Motorola has three divisions .
The one that created most of the company ’s value until recently is its mobile devices operation .
The revenue from that division fell by almost half in the last quarter from $ 3.1 billion to $ 1.7 billion .
But the future for the division is brighter , primarily due to its new Droid phone which has sold remarkably well and is being heavily promoted by Verizon Wireless .
Industry experts expect that one million of the handsets have been sold in the last month .
The value of the Droid is not the Motorola brand but the brand of the Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) Android operating system that runs it .
A more successful Motorola handset company would be attractive to Samsung or LG .
The most likely buyer is Nokia ( NYSE : NOK ) , which has a modest market share in the US .
Motorola still does very well in its domestic market .
Nokia does not need the Motorola brand , but it could use a successful Android handset .
Palm .
The smart phone company had a modest success with the launch of its Pre .
The follow - on product , the Pixi , is not doing as well .
The Pre is facing renewed competition from the Motorola Droid and new high - end handsets from Nokia and Samsung .
It competes with the two smart phone juggernauts the Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) iPhone and RIM ( NASDAQ : RIMM ) Blackberry .
In an effort to push sales , Amazon ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) dropped the price on the Pre to $ 79.99 .
Palm needs a deal with both AT&T Wireless ( NYSE:T ) and Verizon to supplement the one it has with Sprint ( NYSE:S ) .
It is not clear that those partnerships will be formed .
Pre sales have fallen off , if a number of Wall St. analysts are correct .
Many analysts have sharply dropped their stock price targets to $ 10 based on concerns that Palm will significantly miss its earnings targets .
The firm ’s stock has decreased from over $ 18 earlier this year to $ 11 .
Nokia has forecast that global handset sales will only rise 10 % next year , which will make it nearly impossible for the market to support the number of manufacturers in the business today .
Both LG and Samsung , the No.2 and No.3 handset companies , have weak smart phone lines .
Each is jealous of its brand .
With a market cap of $ 1.7 billion , Palm is a cheap way to move further into the high - end handset business .
Borders .
Borders Group ( NYSE : BGP ) lost the online and brick - and - mortar bookstore war years ago to Barnes & Noble ( NYSE : BKS ) and Amazon.com ( NYSE : BGP ) .
The company ’s stock is down to $ 1.20 from a 52 - week high of $ 4.48 and its market value is less than $ 80 million .
For the quarter ending in October , the company ’s loss from continuing operations was $ 39.0 million , or $ 0.65 per share , compared to a loss of $ 39.0 million , or $ 0.64 per share , a year ago .
Revenue was $ 595.5 million , down $ 86.6 million , or 12.7 % .
Border ’s large Waldenbooks division has all but disappeared .
That part of Border ’s operations is down to 361 stores .
With its debt net of cash at $ 375 million , a competitor like Barnes & Noble could buy $ 2 billion in annual revenue for a fraction of sales and cut general and administrative costs to improve margins .
Borders has been dead for over two years , but no one has been able to dispose of the body .
Blockbuster .
Blockbuster ’s ( NYSE : BBI ) stock traded for $ 10 less than it did five years ago .
Shares change hands for $ .62 now .
The video rental company had an awful third quarter .
Revenue for this period of 2009 was $ 910.5 million , down from $ 1.16 billion for the same quarter a year ago .
The 21 % revenue decrease was mostly due to a 14 % decline in same store sales .
The firm ’s net loss was $ 114 million compared to a $ 19 million loss in the same period in 2008 .
Blockbuster has only $ 141 million in cash and cash equivalents .
No one has figured out what to do with Blockbuster .
The company has 3,662 stores in the US and 1,703 overseas .
Blockbuster has lease liabilities on a number of those stores , but ideally the company would be much smaller .
It lost its chance to be in the online video rental business to NetFlix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and its chance at IP - based VOD to a number of internet streaming services and cable set - top box based products .
The market value of the company is only $ 125 million .
Blockbuster has bought itself some time by refinancing a large part of its debt and it has been aggressively closing stores .
One of the things that Blockbuster mentions in its SEC filings is that its debt load and declining revenue could force it to seek a restructuring of its indebtedness or file for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
A bankruptcy will do almost nothing to improve Blockbuster ’s prospects .
Blockbuster does have over $ 1.7 billion in assets , not all of them saleable , but the firm will almost certainly face liquidation in the relatively near future .

Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) are intertwined closer than peanut butter and jelly .
These two former government sponsored entities are now in government conservatorship .
Their influence has largely disappeared .
In the 1990 ’s it was believed that the government would never allow them to fold .
It seems today that the GSEs are being kept afloat merely because it is cheaper and easier for the government to keep them in limbo than to repossess them and assume their liabilities .
The sad thing is that even if the turnaround in housing lasts , it is just not enough to help Fannie and Freddie .
Delinquencies keep rising and using traditional balance sheet analysis is nearly impossible .
Whether these stay above $ 1.00 or not , it also seems that the NYSE keeps these listed because of the high amount of shares traded rather than on the merits of the future of these stocks .
Alan Greenspan once said they should be nationalized and relaunched as eight entities that are privately owned .
KBW went as far as to say the value of the common and preferred shares are worth zero .
There will be some remnants left over in the operations , but these are being kept alive for appearance and convenience rather than because of their solid operating metrics .
Ambac Financial Group , Inc. ( ABK ) is one of the former solid bond insurers that held the market together .
The reality is that its peers may be in the same boat or close behind it , but Ambac is the one with the largest question mark associated with it today .
Insuring municipal bonds become very difficult in 2008 and for much of 2009 and its structured finance guarantees brought up what could be an untenable situation .
What is sad is that a month ago came the company ’s earnings on items which reinvigorated buyers of penny stocks and speculative stocks .
Then came the change of heart .
It was questionable whether Ambac could stay above regulatory capital requirements , and that was after the company disclosed that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection if it was unable to improve its capital position .
It did claim enough regulatory capital , but then the Chief Financial Officer Sean Leonard resigned after the company missed a regulatory filing deadline and that is often enough to spook any investor in a troubled company .
Back - dated tax refunds may help the company stay afloat longer , as would a new capital raise if it is even possible .
But for Ambac to continue to function under normal operations , it seems as though the capital markets would have to revert back to the boom days rather than the after - shock days .
Eastman Kodak Co. ( EK ) has been on a downward trajectory since even before the end of the last decade .
CEO Antonio Perez has not been able to fix the company since he took over in 2005 and Kodak keeps its heavy project investing and has been in a restructuring state for about as long as memory can go back .
How much this has recovered from its lows is probably irrelevant today .
And the notion that Perez was re-signed through 2013 is almost baffling .
This was one of the greatest American brands of the 20th century .
But its entrance to digital printing was very late and too many little dot.com me - too companies were able to jump way in front of the company ’s digital efforts .
The latest financing deal with KKR was for $ 700 million , and this seemed more like KKR was getting itself into a position to make a run at the company with a seniority position in the credit structure .
Kodak wo n’t cease to exit .
It just may wind up in a private equity portfolio with a much leaner and meaner structure .
And that might in fact be a take - under rather than by a traditional buyout .
It seems as though Eastman Kodak is in the same or an even worse boat than newspapers , with the key difference being that newspapers still have a business if advertising from auto dealers and housing ever comes back .
Sun Microsystems Inc. ( JAVA ) may be headed into Oracle ( ORCL ) and it may not .
Its fate as a standalone company is however looking more and more like an inevitable fate .
IBM ( IBM ) was interested in Sun , but dropped out .
And now the European Commission somehow is worried about too much control of open source in the hands of Oracle even though much of this stuff is free or has been given away by Sun for next to nothing .
Maybe having a money - losing model is what the European regulators want .
But if the Sun - Oracle merger is blocked , the Sun has to do something and in a hurry .
It will be forced to go out and buy a revenue and earnings stream with the main criteria being earnings .
The company ’s loss history and awful internals ( not excluding employee morale ) will make this even more so the case .
So even if Sun is not acquired , it has to go make a transformative deal and it needs a good economy for its core operations to run at profitable levels .
If Sun exists a year out , it seems that it will be a very different company by force more than by choice .
E*Trade Financial Corporation ( NASDAQ : ETFC ) is a great company with a great client base .
And it was run into the ground from giving risky loans and acting as the end - user banker .
Then it got bailed out in a deal with Citadel which gave the firm an extra layer of trade executions and gave Citadel control over the company ’s operations .
The dominance of Citadel is not as much as it was in even just a few months ago , but the company is soon to be without its replacement CEO .
Things have got better at E*TRADE on operations , and the company ’s solid advertising campaign allowed the firm to keep growing at a time in 2008 when suddenly the company appeared to be at - risk .
The at - risk issue is one that might not go away for some time because of its loan exposure that it is stuck with and because write downs kept coming .
Now , it seems that the wagons may be circling around E*TRADE despite the notion that many dismiss TD AMERITRADE ( AMTD ) as a suitor .
E*TRADE still has a difficult ride if it has to just whether the storm and it may not have the resources needed to ride it out .
That will come up for more debate if write downs and charges keep continuing .
But for a larger buyer , particularly the non-bank companies that claim to be bank holding companies , then its 2.7 million brokerage accounts and total accounts of more than 4.5 million will be much more valuable to a suitor than to see what is left of the company if the finances turn back south .

For anyone who knows children with autism , you might find this fascinating .
I ’ve seen some of this first - hand in my own search of information on autism .
Some of the various treatments are worrisome on several levels .
( Others are just expensive . )
The results from plentiful arrays of lab tests are questionable , but used to show " chemical imbalances , " which then are said to require treatment .
I would question whether the results are accurate , but even more to the point , whether there is any need to " treat " these questionable lab results .
Assuming some of the measures are accurate , the studies have n’t been done to assess what the results mean .
The information provided is correlational information , which is not cause and effect , and certainly does not translate further to prescribing safe , effective therapies — the gap is unbelievably enormous , but routinely crossed over with hope , and a long list of supplements to buy .
After questionable lab test results are used to give diagnoses and recommend untested , unproven treatment regimens , another cause for concern is that the " treatments " are similarly untested .
So for example , even if a biochemical measure of a chemical in the blood was accurate ( a generous assumption ) , there have been no double blind studies to show that the particular measure is in fact a problem , let alone a reason to engage in the proposed " treatment . "
There are no credible studies to show the treatment is effective .
It could actually be harmful .
The " studies " cited seem to be long lists of case reports , correlations found by blood tests ( with no proven meaning ) , coupled with semi-scientific , semi-logical theories .
The semi-scientific aspect of the process gives parents a false sense of understanding what they ’re being told , because it may make sense .
They do n’t have the background to know what they do n’t and ca n’t know .
In medical science , a logical theory and a viable treatment option are not even close .
Case reports and theories are NOT adequate scientific studies .
They can be wrong , twisted , manipulated , made - up , self - serving reports used to promote untested treatments by appealing to the parents ’ hopes , preying on desperation , and promising to empower them to help their children .
Sadly , this is how I would characterize many alternative biomedical treatments for autism at this time .

Desperate parents try alternative therapies that are n’t based in science and may hurt kids , an investigation finds .
James Coman ’s son has an unusual skill .
The 7 - year - old , his father says , can swallow six pills at once .
Diagnosed with autism as a toddler , he had been placed on an intense regimen of supplements and medications aimed at treating the disorder .
He was injected with vitamin B12 and received intravenous infusions of a drug used to leach mercury and other metals from the body .
He took megadoses of vitamin C , a hormone and a drug that suppresses testosterone .
This complex regimen — documented in court records as part of a bitter custody battle over the Chicago boy between Coman , who opposes the therapies , and his wife — may sound unusual , but it is n’t .
Thousands of U.S. children undergo these therapies and more at the urging of physicians who say they can successfully treat , or " recover , " children with autism , a disorder most doctors and scientists say they can not yet explain or cure .
After reviewing thousands of pages of court documents and scientific studies and interviewing top researchers in the field , an investigation by the Chicago Tribune found that many of these treatments amount to uncontrolled experiments on vulnerable children .
The therapies often go beyond harmless New Age folly , the investigation found .
Many are unproven and risky , based on flawed , preliminary or misconstrued scientific research .
Lab tests used to justify therapies are often misleading and misinterpreted .
And though some parents fervently believe their children have benefited , the investigation found a trail of disappointing results from the few clinical trials conducted to evaluate the treatments objectively .
Studies show that up to three - quarters of families with children with autism try alternative treatments .
Doctors , many linked to the influential group Defeat Autism Now , promote the therapies online , in books and at conferences .
The investigation found children undergoing day - long infusions of a blood product that carries the risk of kidney failure and anaphylactic shock .
Researchers in the field emphatically warn that the therapy should not be used to treat autism .
Children are repeatedly encased in pressurized oxygen chambers normally used after scuba diving accidents .
This unproven therapy is meant to reduce inflammation that experts say is little understood and may even be beneficial .
Children undergo rounds of chelation therapy to leach heavy metals from the body , though most toxicologists say the test commonly used to measure the metals is meaningless and the treatment potentially harmful …
One in 100 U.S. children is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by age 8 , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Though behavioral therapies can help , there are no cures for the disorder , which is characterized by communication problems , difficulties interacting socially and rigid , repetitive behavior …
" There [ are ] no published studies which would suggest that [ they ] would change the course of autism , " testified Dr. Eric Fombonne , head of the division of child psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal and a prominent autism expert .
James Coman says he is so concerned about the possible long - term effects of his son ’s treatments , including chelation , that he has filed complaints with state medical boards against the boy ’s two Defeat Autism Now doctors , Dr. Anjum Usman of Naperville , Ill. , and Dr. Daniel Rossignol of Melbourne , Fla .
" I worry very much , " Coman said as his son played nearby with his younger brother and a neighbor ’s children .
Coman said he thinks his son , now a playful , funny and outgoing 7 - year - old , would have progressed developmentally without any medical treatments …

u Torrent – the preferred Bittorrent client for many BitTorrent users – has been doing really well in 2009 .
Contrary to reports claiming that BitTorrent and P2P usage has been declining , in the last year uTorrent nearly doubled its userbase to 52 million unique users a month .
Earlier this year several publications claimed that P2P and BitTorrent were dying because of the increased popularity of streaming sites .
In reality , BitTorrent is about to close a record year in terms of traffic and usage .
The misleading reports all based their conclusions on data supplied by a network - management firm , which showed that of all Internet traffic , the percentage consumed by P2P has slowly declined .
However , those who take a closer look at the data will find that in absolute traffic , P2P continued to grow , with bandwidth used by streaming just growing a little bit faster .
BitTorrent is by no means dying , nor is there a decline .
Quite the opposite .
All the major BitTorrent sites saw a significant increase in visitor numbers over the past months .
TorrentFreak asked Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management , if this growth is also reflected in the usage stats of uTorrent .
“ Probably the emergence of things like Hulu and continued growth of Youtube make it seem like Bittorrent is not the only thing driving demand for consumer bandwidth .
But we see no evidence whatever that BitTorrent clients are any less popular , ” Morris told TorrentFreak .
Around this time last year uTorrent had 28 million unique users a month , and by November 2009 this figure had almost doubled to 52 million monthly users .
And things have been going equally well for uTorrent ’s little brother , BitTorrent Mainline .
“ In addition to this , at the start of this year we saw almost 5 million monthly users of BitTorrent Mainline , ” Morris said .
“ In November 2009 we saw over 10 million . ”
These statistics show that despite the legal setbacks
The Pirate Bay , Mininova and isoHunt have faced in court , the number of people who are using BitTorrent has continued to grow significantly .
There is no indication that this growth will slow , let alone stop , in 2010 .
The uTorrent development team also has some major improvements in the pipeline .
Last week streaming support was added to the client , and in the coming year it will add file security features and the option for torrent site owners to promote their content within the client .
Aaron sez , " This piece from the LA Times includes a stunning description of how an undercover cop lifted a DNA sample from Stephanie Lazarus , a police woman was under investigation for murdering her romantic rival . "
An undercover officer surreptitiously trailed Lazarus , 49 , as she ran errands , waiting until she discarded a plastic utensil or other object with her saliva on it .
The DNA in her saliva was compared with evidence collected from the murder scene .
The genetic code in the samples matched conclusively , police and prosecutors have said .
And this is one of the main reasons that biometric identifiers are so very risky …
You can protect the PIN for your debit card by shielding the keypad when you enter it , but how do you keep counterfeiters from getting your DNA for authenticating the debit - card of the future ?
We throw off fingerprints , DNA , hand - geometry impressions , gaits and other biometrics at a titanic rate , and there 's no way to stop , short of spending all your time in a hazmat suit .
Bail is set at $ 10 million for LAPD detective accused of murder
( Thanks , Aaron ! )

To the Congress of the United States :
As you assemble for the discharge of the duties you have assumed as the representatives of a free and generous people , your meeting is marked by an interesting and impressive incident .
With the expiration of the present session of the Congress the first century of our constitutional existence as a nation will be completed .
Our survival for one hundred years is not sufficient to assure us that we no longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance , with all its promised blessings , of a government rounded upon the freedom of the people .
The time rather admonishes us to soberly inquire whether in the past we have always closely kept in the course of safety , and whether we have before us a way plain and clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity .
When the experiment of our Government was undertaken , the chart adopted for our guidance was the Constitution .
Departure from the lines there laid down is failure .
It is only by a strict adherence to the direction they indicate and by restraint within the limitations they fix that we can furnish proof to the world of the fitness of the American people for self - government .
The equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying principle of our institutions should not be confined to the relations of our citizens to each other .
The Government itself is under bond to the American people that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will deal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest and fair and absolutely just .
It has agreed that American citizenship shall be the only credential necessary to justify the claim of equality before the law , and that no condition in life shall give rise to discrimination in the treatment of the people by their Government .
The citizen of our Republic in its early days rigidly insisted upon full compliance with the letter of this bond , and saw stretching out before him a clear field for individual endeavor .
His tribute to the support of his Government was measured by the cost of its economical maintenance , and he was secure in the enjoyment of the remaining recompense of his steady and contented toil .
In those days the frugality of the people was stamped upon their Government , and was enforced by the free , thoughtful , and intelligent suffrage of the citizen .
Combinations , monopolies , and aggregations of capital were either avoided or sternly regulated and restrained .
The pomp and glitter of governments less free offered no temptation and presented no delusion to the plain people who , side by side , in friendly competition , wrought for the ennoblement and dignity of man , for the solution of the problem of free government , and for the achievement of the grand destiny awaiting the land which God had given them .
A century has passed .
Our cities are the abiding places of wealth and luxury ; our manufactories yield fortunes never dreamed of by the fathers of the Republic ; our business men are madly striving in the race for riches , and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination in the magnitude of their undertakings .
We view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country 's growth and prosperity , while only a closer scrutiny develops a somber shading .
Upon more careful inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unremunerative toil .
A crowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests the impoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pursuits .
The farmer 's son , not satisfied with his father 's simple and laborious life , joins the eager chase for easily acquired wealth .
We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight , but that they result from the discriminating favor of the Government and are largely built upon undue exactions from the masses of our people .
The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening , and classes are rapidly forming , one comprising the very rich and powerful , while in another are found the toiling poor .
As we view the achievements of aggregated capital , we discover the existence of trusts , combinations , and monopolies , while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel .
Corporations , which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people , are fast becoming the people 's masters .
Still congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country and complacently contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions , it is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire at the present stage of our progress how the bond of the Government made with the people has been kept and performed .
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of its economical administration , the Government persists in exacting from the substance of the people millions which , unapplied and useless , lie dormant in its Treasury .
This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger attending the diversion of the currency of the country from the legitimate channels of business .
Under the same laws by which these results are produced the Government permits many millions more to be added to the cost of the living of our people and to be taken from our consumers , which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority .
The people must still be taxed for the support of the Government under the operation of tariff laws .
But to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose and for the benefit of a favored few , the Government , under pretext of an exercise of its taxing power , enters gratuitously into partnership with these favorites , to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of our people .
This is not equality before the law .
The existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body politic .
It stifles in those for whose benefit it is permitted all patriotic love of country , and substitutes in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice .
Devotion to American citizenship for its own sake and for what it should accomplish as a motive to our nation 's advancement and the happiness of all our people is displaced by the assumption that the Government , instead of being the embodiment of equality , is but an instrumentality through which especial and individual advantages are to be gained .
The arrogance of this assumption is unconcealed .
It appears in the sordid disregard of all but personal interests , in the refusal to abate for the benefit of others one iota of selfish advantage , and in combinations to perpetuate such advantages through efforts to control legislation and improperly influence the suffrages of the people .
The grievances of those not included within the circle of these beneficiaries , when fully realized , will surely arouse irritation and discontent .
Our farmers , long suffering and patient , struggling in the race of life with the hardest and most unremitting toil , will not fail to see , in spite of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies , that they are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foreign markets where they compete with the farmers of the world ; that their lands are declining in value while their debts increase , and that without compensating favor they are forced by the action of the Government to pay for the benefit of others such enhanced prices for the things they need that the scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish their support or leave no margin for accumulation .
Our workingmen , enfranchised from all delusions and no longer frightened by the cry that their wages are endangered by a just revision of our tariff laws , will reasonably demand through such revision steadier employment , cheaper means of living in their homes , freedom for themselves and their children from the doom of perpetual servitude , and an open door to their advancement beyond the limits of a laboring class .
Others of our citizens , whose comforts and expenditures are measured by moderate salaries and fixed incomes , will insist upon the fairness and justice of cheapening the cost of necessaries for themselves and their families .
When to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our laws there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer from such discrimination , we will realize the fact that the beneficent purposes of our Government , dependent upon the patriotism and contentment of our people , are endangered .
Communism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized government ; but the communism of combined wealth and capital , the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness , which insidiously undermines the justice and integrity of free institutions , is not less dangerous than the communism of oppressed poverty and toil , which , exasperated by injustice and discontent , attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule .
He mocks the people who proposes that the Government shall protect the rich and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor .
Any intermediary between the people and their Government or the least delegation of the care and protection the Government owes to the humblest citizen in the land makes the boast of free institutions a glittering delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposition .
A just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the relief of those of our countrymen who suffer under present conditions .
Such a revision should receive the support of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship ; of all who realize that in this justice and equality our Government finds its strength and its power to protect the citizen and his property ; of all who believe that the contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a few ; of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our people , which recognize the value of every American interest , are the surest guaranty of our national progress , and of all who desire to see the products of American skill and ingenuity in every market of the world , with a resulting restoration of American commerce .
The necessity of the reduction of our revenues is so apparent as to be generally conceded , but the means by which this end shall be accomplished and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizens present a controversy of the utmost importance .
There should be no scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the burdens of the people are only apparently removed .
Extravagant appropriations of public money , with all their demoralizing consequences , should not be tolerated , either as a means of relieving the Treasury of its present surplus or as furnishing pretext for resisting a proper reduction in tariff rates .
Existing evils and injustice should be honestly recognized , boldly met , and effectively remedied .
There should be no cessation of the struggle until a plan is perfected , fair and conservative toward existing industries , but which will reduce the cost to consumers of the necessaries of life , while it provides for our manufacturers the advantage of freer raw materials and permits no injury to the interests of American labor .
The cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and distinctly defined .
It should never be compromised .
It is the people 's cause .
It can not be denied that the selfish and private interests which are so persistently heard when efforts are made to deal in a just and comprehensive manner with our tariff laws are related to , if they are not responsible for , the sentiment largely prevailing among the people that the General Government is the fountain of individual and private aid ; that it may be expected to relieve with paternal care the distress of citizens and communities , and that from the fullness of its
Treasury it should , upon the slightest possible pretext of promoting the general good , apply public funds to the benefit of localities and individuals .
Nor can it be denied that there is a growing assumption that , as against the Government and in favor of private claims and interests , the usual rules and limitations of business principles and just dealing should be waived .
These ideas have been unhappily much encouraged by legislative acquiescence .
Relief from contracts made with the Government is too easily accorded in favor of the citizen ; the failure to support claims against the Government by proof is often supplied by no better consideration than the wealth of the Government and the poverty of the claimant ; gratuities in the form of pensions are granted upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the applicant , or for reasons less valid ; and large sums are expended for public buildings and other improvements upon representations scarcely claimed to be related to public needs and necessities .
The extent to which the consideration of such matters subordinate and postpone action upon subjects of great public importance , but involving no special private or partisan interest , should arrest attention and lead to reformation .
A few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated .
The crowded condition of the calendar of the Supreme Court , and the delay to suitors and denial of justice resulting therefrom , has been strongly urged upon the attention of the Congress , with a plan for the relief of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its merits .
While this subject remains without effective consideration , many laws have been passed providing for the holding of terms of inferior courts at places to suit the convenience of localities , or to lay the foundation of an application for the erection of a new public building .
Repeated recommendations have been submitted for the amendment and change of the laws relating to our public lands so that their spoliation and diversion to other uses than as homes for honest settlers might be prevented .
While a measure to meet this conceded necessity of reform remains awaiting the action of the Congress , many claims to the public lands and applications for their donation , in favor of States and individuals , have been allowed .
A plan in aid of Indian management , recommended by those well informed as containing valuable features in furtherance of the solution of the Indian problem , has thus far failed of legislative sanction , while grants of doubtful expediency to railroad corporations , permitting them to pass through Indian reservations , have greatly multiplied .
The propriety and necessity of the erection of one or more prisons for the confinement of United States convicts , and a post - office building in the national capital , are not disputed .
But these needs yet remain answered , while scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public purposes is not apparent .
A revision of our pension laws could easily be made which would rest upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant .
But while our general pension laws remain confused and imperfect , hundreds of private pension laws are annually passed , which are the sources of unjust discrimination and popular demoralization .
Appropriation bills for the support of the Government are defaced by items and provisions to meet private ends , and it is freely asserted by responsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for public internal improvement would fail to meet with favor unless it contained items more for local and private advantage than for public benefit .
These statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the proportion of Federal legislation which either bears upon its face its private character or which upon examination develops such a motive power .
And yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives such patriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country ; and this expectation can only be answered by the performance of public duty with unselfish purpose .
Our mission among the nations of the earth and our success in accomplishing the work God has given the American people to do require of those intrusted with the making and execution of our laws perfect devotion , above all other things , to the public good .
This devotion will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of constitutional limitations of Federal power and to persistently check the increasing tendency to extend the scope of Federal legislation into the domain of State and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving the public welfare .
The preservation of the partitions between proper subjects of Federal and local care and regulation is of such importance under the Constitution , which is the law of our very existence , that no consideration of expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground .
We have undertaken to discover and proclaim the richest blessings of a free government , with the Constitution as our guide .
Let us follow the way it points out ; it will not mislead us .
And surely no one who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the Constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in search of a better way to reach the public welfare than the Constitution offers .
What has been said is deemed not inappropriate at a time when , from a century 's height , we view the way already trod by the American people and attempt to discover their future path .
The seventh President of the United States — the soldier and statesman and at all times the firm and brave friend of the people — in vindication of his course as the protector of popular rights and the champion of true American citizenship , declared :
The ambition which leads me on is an anxious desire and a fixed determination to restore to the people unimpaired the sacred trust they have confided to my charge ; to , heal the wounds of the Constitution and to preserve it from further violation ; to persuade my countrymen , so far as I may , that it is not in a splendid government supported by powerful monopolies and aristocratical establishments that they will find happiness or their liberties protection , but in a plain system , void of pomp , protecting all and granting favors to none , dispensing its blessings like the dews of heaven , unseen and unfelt save in the freshness and beauty they contribute to produce .
It is such a government that the genius of our people requires — such an one only under which our States may remain for ages to come united , prosperous , and free .
In pursuance of a constitutional provision requiring the President from time to time to give to the Congress information of the state of the Union , I have the satisfaction to announce that the close of the year finds the United States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and at peace with all the nations .
Since my last annual message our foreign relations have been strengthened and improved by performance of international good offices and by new and renewed treaties of amity , commerce , and reciprocal extradition of criminals .
Those international questions which still await settlement are all reasonably within the domain of amicable negotiation , and there is no existing subject of dispute between the United States and any foreign power that is not susceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank diplomatic treatment .
The questions between Great Britain and the United States relating to the rights of American fishermen , under treaty and international comity , in the territorial waters of Canada and Newfoundland , I regret to say , are not yet satisfactorily adjusted .
These matters were fully treated in my message to the Senate of February 20 1888 , together with which a convention , concluded under my authority with Her Majesty 's Government on the 15th of February last , for the removal of all causes of misunderstanding , was submitted by me for the approval of the Senate .
This treaty having been rejected by the Senate , I transmitted a message to the Congress on the 23d of August last reviewing the transactions and submitting for consideration certain recommendations for legislation concerning the important questions involved .
Afterwards , on the 12th of September , in response to a resolution of the Senate , I again communicated fully all the information in my possession as to the action of the government of Canada affecting the commercial relations between the Dominion and the United States , including the treatment of American fishing vessels in the ports and waters of British North America .
These communications have all been published , and therefore opened to the knowledge of both Houses of Congress , although two were addressed to the Senate alone .
Comment upon or repetition of their contents would be superfluous , and I am not aware that anything has since occurred which should be added to the facts therein stated .
Therefore I merely repeat , as applicable to the present time , the statement which will be found in my message to the Senate of September 12 last , that —
Since March 3 , 1887 , no case has been reported to the Department of State wherein complaint was made of unfriendly or unlawful treatment of American fishing vessels on the part of the Canadian authorities in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by the United States consul - general at Halifax .
Having essayed in the discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation the settlement of a long - standing cause of dispute and to remove a constant menace to the good relations of the two countries , and continuing to be of opinion that the treaty of February last , which failed to receive the approval of the Senate , did supply " a satisfactory , practical , and final adjustment , upon a basis honorable and just to both parties , of the difficult and vexed question to which it related , " and having subsequently and unavailingly recommended other legislation to Congress which I hoped would suffice to meet the exigency created by the rejection of the treaty , I now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention of the Congress to the condition of this important question as it now stands before them and the country , and for the settlement of which I am deeply solicitous .
Near the close of the month of October last occurrences of a deeply regrettable nature were brought to my knowledge , which made it my painful but imperative duty to obtain with as little delay as possible a new personal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the Government of Great Britain .
The correspondence in relation to this incident will in due course be laid before you , and will disclose the unpardonable conduct of the official referred to in his interference by advice and counsel with the suffrages of American citizens in the very crisis of the Presidential election then near at hand , and also in his subsequent public declarations to justify his action , superadding impugnment of the Executive and Senate of the United States in connection with important questions now pending in controversy between the two Governments .
The offense thus committed was most grave , involving disastrous possibilities to the good relations of the United States and Great Britain , constituting a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domestic affairs and essential sovereignty of the Government to which the envoy was accredited .
Having first fulfilled the just demands of international comity by affording full opportunity for Her Majesty 's Government to act in relief of the situation , I considered prolongation of discussion to be unwarranted , and thereupon declined to further recognize the diplomatic character of the person whose continuance in such function would destroy that mutual confidence which is essential to the good understanding of the two Governments and was inconsistent with the welfare and self - respect of the Government of the United States .
The usual interchange of communication has since continued through Her Majesty 's legation in this city .
My endeavors to establish by international cooperation measures for the prevention of the extermination of fur seals in Bering Sea have not been relaxed , and I have hopes of being enabled shortly to submit an effective and satisfactory conventional projet with the maritime powers for the approval of the Senate .
The coastal boundary between our Alaskan possessions and British Columbia , I regret to say , has not received the attention demanded by its importance , and which on several occasions heretofore I have had the honor to recommend to the Congress .
The admitted impracticability , if not impossibility , of making an accurate and precise survey and demarcation of the boundary line as it is recited in the treaty with Russia under which Alaska was ceded to the United States renders it absolutely requisite for the prevention of international jurisdictional complications that adequate appropriation for a reconnoissance and survey to obtain proper knowledge of the locality and the geographical features of the boundary should be authorized by Congress with as little delay as possible .
Knowledge to be only thus obtained is an essential prerequisite for negotiation for ascertaining a common boundary , or as preliminary to any other mode of settlement .
It is much to be desired that some agreement should be reached with Her Majesty 's Government by which the damages to life and property on the Great Lakes may be alleviated by removing or humanely regulating the obstacles to reciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded vessels .
The act of June 19 , 1878 , which offers to Canadian vessels free access to our inland waters in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels , has not yet become effective through concurrent action by Canada .
The due protection of our citizens of French origin or descent from claim of military service in the event of their returning to or visiting France has called forth correspondence which was laid before you at the last session .
In the absence of conventional agreement as to naturalization , which is greatly to be desired , this Government sees no occasion to recede from the sound position it has maintained not only with regard to France , but as to all countries with which the United States have not concluded special treaties .
Twice within the last year has the imperial household of Germany been visited by death ; and I have hastened to express the sorrow of this people , and their appreciation of the lofty character of the late aged Emperor William , and their sympathy with the heroism under suffering of his son the late Emperor Frederick .
I renew my recommendation of two years ago for the passage of a bill for the refunding to certain German steamship lines of the interest upon tonnage dues illegally exacted .
On the 12th [ 2d ] of April last I laid before the House of Representatives full information respecting our interests in Samoa ; and in the subsequent correspondence on the same subject , which will be laid before you in due course , the history of events in those islands will be found .
In a message accompanying my approval , on the 1st day of October last , of a bill for the exclusion of Chinese laborers , I laid before Congress full information and all correspondence touching the negotiation of the treaty with China concluded at this capital on the 12th day of March , 1888 , and which , having been confirmed by the Senate with certain amendments , was rejected by the Chinese Government .
This message contained a recommendation that a sum of money be appropriated as compensation to Chinese subjects who had suffered injuries at the hands of lawless men within our jurisdiction .
Such appropriation having been duly made , the fund awaits reception by the Chinese Government .
It is sincerely hoped that by the cessation of the influx of this class of Chinese subjects , in accordance with the expressed wish of both Governments , a cause of unkind feeling has been permanently removed .
On the 9th of August , 1887 , notification was given by the Japanese minister at this capital of the adjournment of the conference for the revision of the treaties of Japan with foreign powers , owing to the objection of his Government to the provision in the draft jurisdictional convention which required the submission of the criminal code of the Empire to the powers in advance of its becoming operative .
This notification was , however , accompanied with an assurance of Japan 's intention to continue the work of revision .
Notwithstanding this temporary interruption of negotiations , it is hoped that improvements may soon be secured in the jurisdictional system as respects foreigners in Japan , and relief afforded to that country from the present undue and oppressive foreign control in matters of commerce .
I earnestly recommend that relief be provided for the injuries accidentally caused to Japanese subjects in the island Ikisima by the target practice of one of our vessels .
A diplomatic mission from Korea has been received , and the formal intercourse between the two countries contemplated by the treaty of 1882 is now established .
Legislative provision is hereby recommended to organize and equip consular courts in Korea .
Persia has established diplomatic representation at this capital , and has evinced very great interest in the enterprise and achievements of our citizens .
I am therefore hopeful that beneficial commercial relations between the two countries may be brought about .
I announce with sincere regret that Hayti has again become the theater of insurrection , disorder , and bloodshed .
The titular government of president Saloman has been forcibly overthrown and he driven out of the country to France , where he has since died .
The tenure of power has been so unstable amid the war of factions that has ensued since the expulsion of President Saloman that no government constituted by the will of the Haytian people has been recognized as administering responsibly the affairs of that country .
Our representative has been instructed to abstain from interference between the warring factions , and a vessel of our Navy has been sent to Haytian waters to sustain our minister and for the protection of the persons and property of American citizens .
Due precautions have been taken to enforce our neutrality laws and prevent our territory from becoming the base of military supplies for either of the warring factions .
Under color of a blockade , of which no reasonable notice had been given , and which does not appear to have been efficiently maintained , a seizure of vessels under the American flag has been reported , and in consequence measures to prevent and redress any molestation of our innocent merchantmen have been adopted .
Proclamation was duly made on the 9th day of November , 1887 , of the conventional extensions of the treaty of June 3 , 1875 , with Hawaii , under which relations of such special and beneficent intercourse have been created .
In the vast field of Oriental commerce now unfolded from our Pacific borders no feature presents stronger recommendations for Congressional action than the establishment of communication by submarine telegraph with Honolulu .
The geographical position of the Hawaiian group in relation to our Pacific States creates a natural interdependency and mutuality of interest which our present treaties were intended to foster , and which make close communication a logical and commercial necessity .
The wisdom of concluding a treaty of commercial reciprocity with Mexico has been heretofore stated in my messages to Congress , and the lapse of time and growth of commerce with that close neighbor and sister Republic confirm the judgment so expressed .
The precise relocation of our boundary line is needful , and adequate appropriation is now recommended .
It is with sincere satisfaction that I am enabled to advert to the spirit of good neighborhood and friendly cooperation and conciliation that has marked the correspondence and action of the Mexican authorities in their share of the task of maintaining law and order about the line of our common boundary .
The long - pending boundary dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was referred to my arbitration , and by an award made on the 22d of March last the question has been finally settled to the expressed satisfaction of both of the parties in interest .
The Empire of Brazil , in abolishing the last vestige of slavery among Christian nations , called forth the earnest congratulations of this Government in expression of the cordial sympathies of our people .
The claims of nearly all other countries against Chile growing out of her late war with Bolivia and Peru have been disposed of , either by arbitration or by a lump settlement .
Similar claims of our citizens will continue to be urged upon the Chilean Government , and it is hoped will not be subject to further delays .
A comprehensive treaty of amity and commerce with Peru was proclaimed on November 7 last , and it is expected that under its operation mutual prosperity and good understanding will be promoted .
In pursuance of the policy of arbitration , a treaty to settle the claim of Santos , an American citizen , against Ecuador has been concluded under my authority , and will be duly submitted for the approval of the Senate .
Like disposition of the claim of Carlos Butterfield against Denmark and of Van Bokkelen against Hayti will probably be made , and I trust the principle of such settlements may be extended in practice under the approval of the Senate .
Through unforeseen causes , foreign to the will of both Governments , the ratification of the convention of December 5 , 1885 , with Venezuela , for the rehearing of claims of citizens of the United States under the treaty of 1866 , failed of exchange within the term provided , and a supplementary convention , further extending the time for exchange of ratifications and explanatory of an ambiguous provision of the prior convention , now awaits the advice and consent of the Senate .
Although this matter , in the stage referred to , concerns only the concurrent treaty - making power of one branch of Congress , I advert to it in view of the interest repeatedly and conspicuously shown by you in your legislative capacity in favor of a speedy and equitable adjustment of the questions growing out of the discredited judgments of the previous mixed commission of Caracas .
With every desire to do justice to the representations of Venezuela in this regard , the time seems to have come to end this matter , and I trust the prompt confirmation by both parties of the supplementary action referred to will avert the need of legislative or other action to prevent the longer withholding of such rights of actual claimants as may be shown to exist .
As authorized by the Congress , preliminary steps have been taken for the assemblage at this capital during the coming year of the representatives of South and Central American States , together with those of Mexico , Hayti , and San Domingo , to discuss sundry important monetary and commercial topics .
Excepting in those cases where , from reasons of contiguity of territory and the existence of a common border line incapable of being guarded , reciprocal commercial treaties may be found expedient , it is believed that commercial policies inducing freer mutual exchange of products can be most advantageously arranged by independent but cooperative legislation .
In the mode last mentioned the control of our taxation for revenue will be always retained in our own hands unrestricted by conventional agreements with other governments .
In conformity also with Congressional authority , the maritime powers have been invited to confer in Washington in April next upon the practicability of devising uniform rules and measures for the greater security of life and property at sea .
A disposition to accept on the part of a number of the powers has already been manifested , and if the cooperation of the nations chiefly interested shall be secured important results may be confidently anticipated .
The act of June 26 , 1884 , and the acts amendatory thereof , in relation to tonnage duties , have given rise to extended correspondence with foreign nations with whom we have existing treaties of navigation and commerce , and have caused wide and regrettable divergence of opinion in relation to the imposition of the duties referred to .
These questions are important , and I shall make them the subject of a special and more detailed communication at the present session .
With the rapid increase of immigration to our shores and the facilities of modern travel , abuses of the generous privileges afforded by our naturalization laws call for their careful revision .
The easy and unguarded manner in which certificates of American citizenship can now be obtained has induced a class , unfortunately large , to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from allegiance to their native land , and yet by a foreign residence to escape any just duty and contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption .
Thus , while evading the duties of citizenship to the United States , they may make prompt claim for its national protection and demand its intervention in their behalf .
International complications of a serious nature arise , and the correspondence of the State Department discloses the great number and complexity of the questions which have been raised .
Our laws regulating the issue of passports should be carefully revised , and the institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital is again strongly recommended .
By this means full particulars of each case of naturalization in the United States would be secured and properly indexed and recorded , and thus many cases of spurious citizenship would be detected and unjust responsibilities would be avoided .
The reorganization of the consular service is a matter of serious importance to our national interests .
The number of existing principal consular offices is believed to be greater than is at all necessary for the conduct of the public business .
It need not be our policy to maintain more than a moderate number of principal offices , each supported by a salary sufficient to enable the incumbent to live in comfort , and so distributed as to secure the convenient supervision , through subordinate agencies , of affairs over a considerable district .
I repeat the recommendations heretofore made by me that the appropriations for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should be recast ; that the so - called notarial or unofficial fees , which our representatives abroad are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites , should be forbidden ; that a system of consular inspection should be instituted , and that a limited number of secretaries of legation at large should be authorized .
Preparations for the centennial celebration , on April 30 , 1889 , of the inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States , at the city of New York , have been made by a voluntary organization of the citizens of that locality , and believing that an opportunity should be afforded for the expression of the interest felt throughout the country in this event , I respectfully recommend fitting and cooperative action by Congress on behalf of the people of the United States .
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the condition of our national finances and the operations of the several branches of the Government related to his Department .
The total ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1888 , amounted to $ 379,266,074.76 , of which $ 219,091,173.63 was received from customs duties and $ 124,296,871.98 from internal revenue taxes .
The total receipts from all sources exceeded those for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1887 , by $ 7,862,797.10 .
The ordinary expenditures of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1888 , were $ 259,653,958.67 , leaving a surplus of $ 119,612,116.09 .
The decrease in these expenditures as compared with the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1887 , was $ 8,278,221.30 , notwithstanding the payment of more than $ 5,000,000 for pensions in excess of what was paid for that purpose in the latter - mentioned year .
The revenues of the Government for the year ending June 30 , 1889 , ascertained for the quarter ended September 30 , 1888 , and estimated for the remainder of the time , amount to $ 377,000,000 , and the actual and estimated ordinary expenditures for the same year are $ 273,000,000 , leaving an estimated surplus of $ 104,000,000 .
The estimated receipts for the year ending June 30 , 1890 , are $ 377,000,000 , and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time are $ 275,767,488.34 , showing a surplus of $ 101,232,511.66 .
The foregoing statements of surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sinking - fund act , amounting to more than $ 47,000,000 annually .
The cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiscal year was 2.44 per cent ; for the year 1885 it was 3.77 per cent .
The excess of internal - revenue taxes collected during the last fiscal year over those collected for the year ended June 30 , 1887 , was $ 5,489,174.26 , and the cost of collecting this revenue decreased from 3.4 per cent in 1887 to less than 3.2 per cent for the last year .
The tax collected on oleomargarine was $ 723,948.04 for the year ending June 30 , 1887 , and $ 864,139.88 for the following year .
The requirements of the sinking - fund act have been met for the year ended June 30 , 1888 , and for the current year also , by the purchase of bonds .
After complying with this law as positively required , and bonds sufficient for that purpose had been bought at a premium , it was not deemed prudent to further expend the surplus in such purchases until the authority to do so should be more explicit .
A resolution , however , having been passed by both Houses of Congress removing all doubt as to Executive authority , daily purchases of bonds were commenced on the 23d day of April , 1888 , and have continued until the present time .
By this plan bonds of the Government not yet due have been purchased up to and including the 30th day of November , 1888 , amounting to $ 94,700,400 , the premium paid thereon amounting to $ 17,508,613.08 .
The premium added to the principal of these bonds represents an investment yielding about 2 per cent interest for the time they still had to run , and the saving to the Government represented by the difference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for principal and premium and what it would have paid for interest at the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to their maturity is about $ 27,165,000 .
At first sight this would seem to be a profitable and sensible transaction on the part of the Government , but , as suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury , the surplus thus expended for the purchase of bonds was money drawn from the people in excess of any actual need of the Government and was so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in the Treasury .
If this surplus , under the operation of just and equitable laws , had been left in the hands of the people , it would have been worth in their business at least 6 per cent per annum .
Deducting from the amount of interest upon the principal and premium of these bonds for the time they had to run at the rate of 6 per cent the saving of 2 per cent made for the people by the purchase of such bonds , the loss will appear to be $ 55,760,000 .
This calculation would seem to demonstrate that if excessive and unnecessary taxation is continued and the Government is forced to pursue this policy of purchasing its own bonds at the premiums which it will be necessary to pay , the loss to the people will be hundreds of millions of dollars .
Since the purchase of bonds was undertaken as mentioned nearly all that have been offered were at last accepted .
It has been made quite apparent that the Government was in danger of being subjected to combinations to raise their price , as appears by the instance cited by the Secretary of the offering of bonds of the par value of only $ 326,000 so often that the aggregate of the sums demanded for their purchase amounted to more than $ 19,700,000 .
Notwithstanding the large sums paid out in the purchase of bonds , the surplus in the Treasury on the 30th day of November , 1888 , was $ 52,234,610.01 , after deducting about $ 20,000,000 just drawn out for the payment of pensions .
At the close of the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1887 , there had been coined under the compulsory silver - coinage act $ 266,988,280 in silver dollars , $ 55,504,310 of which were in the hands of the people .
On the 30th day of June , 1888 , there had been coined $ 299,708,790 ; and of this $ 55,829,303 was in circulation in coin , and $ 200,387,376 in silver certificates , for the redemption of which silver dollars to that amount were held by the Government .
On the 30th day of November , 1888 , $ 312,570,990 had been coined , $ 60,970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in circulation , and $ 237,418,346 in certificates .
The Secretary recommends the suspension of the further coinage of silver , and in such recommendation I earnestly concur .
For further valuable information and timely recommendations I ask the careful attention of the Congress to the Secretary 's report .
The Secretary of War reports that the Army at the date of the last consolidated returns consisted of 2,189 officers and 24,549 enlisted men .
The actual expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1888 , amounted to $ 41,165,107.07 , of which sum $ 9,158,516.63 was expended for public works , including river and harbor improvements .
" The Board of Ordnance and Fortifications " provided for under the act approved September 22 last was convened October 30 , 1888 , and plans and specifications for procuring forgings for 8 , 10 , and 12 inch guns , under provisions of section 4 , and also for procuring 12 - inch breech - loading mortars , cast iron , hooped with steel , under the provisions of section 5 of the said act , were submitted to the Secretary of War for reference to the board , by the Ordnance Department , on the same date .
These plans and specifications having been promptly approved by the board and the Secretary of War , the necessary authority to publish advertisements inviting proposals in the newspapers throughout the country was granted by the Secretary on November 12 , and on November 13 the advertisements were sent out to the different newspapers designated .
The bids for the steel forgings are to be opened on December 20 , 1888 , and for the mortars on December 15 , 1888 .
A board of ordnance officers was convened at the Watervliet Arsenal on October 4 , 1888 , to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the establishment of an army gun factory at that point .
The preliminary report of this board , with estimates for shop buildings and officers ' quarters , was approved by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications November 6 and 8 .
The specifications and form of advertisement and instructions to bidders have been prepared , and advertisements inviting proposals for the excavations for the shop building and for erecting the two sets of officers ' quarters have been published .
The detailed drawings and specifications for the gun-factory building are well in hand , and will be finished within three or four months , when bids will be invited for the erection of the building .
The list of machines , etc. , is made out , and it is expected that the plans for the large lathes , etc. , will be completed within about four months , and after approval by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications bids for furnishing the same will be invited .
The machines and other fixtures will be completed as soon as the shop is in readiness to receive them , probably about July , 1890 .
Under the provisions of the Army bill for the procurement of pneumatic dynamite guns , the necessary specifications are now being prepared , and advertisements for proposals will issue early in December .
The guns will probably be of 15 inches caliber and fire a projectile that will carry a charge each of about 500 pounds of explosive gelatine with full - caliber projectiles .
The guns will probably be delivered in from six to ten months from the date of the contract , so that all the guns of this class that can be procured under the provisions of the law will be purchased during the year 1889 .
I earnestly request that the recommendations contained in the Secretary 's report , all of which are , in my opinion , calculated to increase the usefulness and discipline of the Army , may receive the consideration of the Congress .
Among these the proposal that there should be provided a plan for the examination of officers to test their fitness for promotion is of the utmost importance .
This reform has been before recommended in the reports of the Secretary , and its expediency is so fully demonstrated by the argument he presents in its favor that its adoption should no longer be neglected .
The death of General Sheridan in August last was a national affliction .
The Army then lost the grandest of its chiefs .
The country lost a brave and experienced soldier , a wise and discreet counselor , and a modest and sensible man .
Those who in any manner came within the range of his personal association will never fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career , but they will cherish with more tender sensibility the loving memory of his simple , generous , and considerate nature .
The Apache Indians , whose removal from their reservation in Arizona followed the capture o£ those of their number who engaged in a bloody and murderous raid during a part of the years 1885 and 1886 , are now held as prisoners of war at Mount Vernon Barracks , in the State of Alabama .
They numbered on the 31st day of October , the date of the last report , 83 men , 170 women , 70 boys , and 59 girls ; in all , 382 persons .
The commanding officer states that they are in good health and contented , and that they are kept employed as fully as is possible in the circumstances .
The children , as they arrive at a suitable age , are sent to the Indian schools at Carlisle and Hampton .
Last summer some charitable and kind people asked permission to send two teachers to these Indians for the purpose of instructing the adults as well as such children as should be found there .
Such permission was readily granted , accommodations were provided for the teachers , and some portions of the buildings at the barracks were made available for school purposes .
The good work contemplated has been commenced , and the teachers engaged are paid by the ladies with whom the plan originated .
I am not at all in sympathy with those benevolent but injudicious people who are constantly insisting that these Indians should be returned to their reservation .
Their removal was an absolute necessity if the lives and property of citizens upon the frontier are to be at all regarded by the Government .
Their continued restraint at a distance from the scene of their repeated and cruel murders and outrages is still necessary .
It is a mistaken philanthropy , every way injurious , which prompts the desire to see these savages returned to their old haunts .
They are in their present location as the result of the best judgment of those having official responsibility in the matter , and who are by no means lacking in kind consideration for the Indians .
A number of these prisoners have forfeited their lives to outraged law and humanity .
Experience has proved that they are dangerous and can not be trusted .
This is true not only of those who on the warpath have heretofore actually been guilty of atrocious murder , but of their kindred and friends , who , while they remained upon their reservation , furnished aid and comfort to those absent with bloody intent .
These prisoners should be treated kindly and kept in restraint far from the locality of their former reservation ; they should be subjected to efforts calculated to lead to their improvement and the softening of their savage and cruel instincts , but their return to their old home should be persistently resisted .
The Secretary in his report gives a graphic history of these Indians , and recites with painful vividness their bloody deeds and the unhappy failure of the Government to manage them by peaceful means .
It will be amazing if a perusal of this history will allow the survival of a desire for the return of these prisoners to their reservation upon sentimental or any other grounds .
The report of the Secretary of the Navy demonstrates very intelligent management in that important Department , and discloses the most satisfactory progress in the work of reconstructing the Navy made during the past year .
Of the ships in course of construction five , viz , the Charleston , Baltimore , Yorktown , Vesuvius , and the Petrel , have in that time been launched and are rapidly approaching completion ; and in addition to the above , the Philadelphia , the San Francisco , the Newark , the Bennington , the Concord , and the Herreshoff torpedo boat are all under contract for delivery to the Department during the next year .
The progress already made and being made gives good ground for the expectation that these eleven vessels will be incorporated as part of the American Navy within the next twelve months .
The report shows that notwithstanding the large expenditures for new construction and the additional labor they involve the total ordinary or current expenditures of the Department for the three years ending June 30 , 1888 , are less by more than 20 per cent than such expenditures for the three years ending June 30 , 1884 .
The various steps which have been taken to improve the business methods of the Department are reviewed by the Secretary .
The purchasing of supplies has been consolidated and placed under a responsible bureau head .
This has resulted in the curtailment of open purchases , which in the years 1884 and 1885 amounted to over 50 per cent of all the purchases of the Department , to less than 11 per cent ; so that at the present time about 90 per cent of the total departmental purchases are made by contract and after competition .
As the expenditures on this account exceed an average of $ 2,000,000 annually , it is evident that an important improvement in the system has been inaugurated and substantial economies introduced .
The report of the Postmaster - General shows a marked increase of business in every branch of the postal service .
The number of post - offices on July 1 , 1888 , was 57,376 , an increase of 6,124 in three years and of 2,219 for tthe last fiscal year .
The latter - mentioned increase is classified as follows :
New England States Middle States 181 Southern States and Indian Territory ( 41 ) 1,406 The States and Territories of the Pacific Coast 190 The ten States and Territories of the West and Northwest 435 District of Columbia 2 ------------------
Total 2,219
Free -delivery offices have increased from 189 in the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1887 , to 358 in the year ended June 30 , 1888 .
In the Railway Mail Service there has been an increase in one year of 168 routes , and in the number of miles traveled per annum an increase of 15,795,917.48 .
The estimated increase of railroad service for the year was 6,000 miles , but the amount of new railroad service actually put on was 12,764.50 miles .
The volume of business in the Money - Order Division , including transactions in postal notes , reached the sum of upward of $ 143,000,000 for the year .
During the past year parcel - post conventions have been concluded with Barbados , the Bahamas , British Honduras , and Mexico , and are now under negotiation with all the Central and South American States .
The increase of correspondence with foreign countries during the past three years is gratifying , and is especially notable and exceptional with the Central and South American States and with Mexico .
As the greater part of mail matter exchanged with these countries is commercial in its character , this increase is evidence of the improved business relations with them .
The practical operation of the parcel - post conventions , so far as negotiated , has served to fulfill the most favorable predictions as to their benefits .
In January last a general postal convention was negotiated with the Dominion of Canada , which went into operation on March 1 , and which practically makes one postal territory of the United States and Canada .
Under it merchandise parcels may now be transmitted through the mails at fourth - class rates of postage .
It is not possible here to touch even the leading heads of the great postal establishment to illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of its business and the needs for legislative readjustment of much of its machinery that it has outgrown .
For these and valuable recommendations of the Postmaster - General attention is earnestly invited to his report .
A Department whose revenues have increased from $ 19,772,000 in 1870 to $ 52,700,000 in 1888 , despite reductions of postage which have enormously reduced rates of revenue while greatly increasing its business , demands the careful consideration of the Congress as to all matters suggested by those familiar with its operations , and which are calculated to increase its efficiency and usefulness .
A bill proposed by the Postmaster - General was introduced at the last session of the Congress by which a uniform standard in the amount of gross receipts would fix the right of a community to a public building to be erected by the Government for post - office purposes .
It was demonstrated that , aside from the public convenience and the promotion of harmony among citizens , invariably disturbed by change of leasings and of site , it was a measure of the highest economy and of sound business judgment .
It was found that the Government was paying in rents at the rate of from 7 to 10 per cent per annum on what the cost of such public buildings would be .
A very great advantage resulting from such a law would be the prevention of a large number of bills constantly introduced for the erection of public buildings at places , and involving expenditures not justified by public necessity .
I trust that this measure will become a law at the present session of Congress .
Of the total number of postmasters 54,874 are of the fourth class .
These , of course , receive no allowances whatever for expenses in the service , and their compensation is fixed by percentages on receipts at their respective offices .
This rate of compensation may have been , and probably was , at some time just , but the standard has remained unchanged through the several reductions in the rates of postage .
Such reductions have necessarily cut down the compensation of these officials , while it undoubtedly increased the business performed by them .
Simple justice requires attention to this subject , to the end that fourth - class postmasters may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law itself , fixing the rate , intended for them .
Another class of postal employees whose condition seems to demand legislation is that of clerks in post - offices , and I call especial attention to the repeated recommendations of the Postmaster - General for their classification .
Proper legislation of this character for the relief of carriers in the free - delivery service has been frequent .
Provision is made for their promotion ; for substitutes for them on vacation ; for substitutes for holidays , and limiting their hours of labor .
Seven million dollars has been appropriated for the current year to provide for them , though the total number of offices where they are employed is but 358 for the past fiscal year , with an estimated increase for the current year of but 40 , while the total appropriation for all clerks in offices throughout the United States is $ 5,950,000 .
The legislation affecting the relations of the Government with railroads is in need of revision .
While for the most part the railroad companies throughout the country have cordially cooperated with the Post - Office Department in rendering excellent service , yet under the law as it stands , while the compensation to them for carrying the mail is limited and regulated , and although railroads are made post - roads by law , there is no authority reposed anywhere to compel the owner of a railroad to take and carry the United States mails .
The only alternative provided by act of Congress in case of refusal is for the Postmaster - General to send mail forward by pony express .
This is but an illustration of ill - fitting legislation , reasonable and proper at the time of its enactment , but long since outgrown and requiring readjustment .
It is gratifying to note from the carefully prepared statistics accompanying the Postmaster - General 's report that notwithstanding the great expansion of the service the rate of expenditure has been lessened and efficiency has been improved in every branch ; that fraud and crime have decreased ; that losses from the mails have been reduced , and that the number of complaints of the service made to postmasters and to the Department are far less than ever before .
The transactions of the Department of Justice for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1888 , are contained in the report of the Attorney - General , as well as a number of valuable recommendations , the most part of which are repetitions of those previously made , and ought to receive consideration .
It is stated in this report that though judgments in civil suits amounting to $ 552,021.08 were recovered in favor of the Government during the year , only the sum of $ 132,934 was collected thereon ; and that though fines , penalties , and forfeitures were imposed amounting to $ 541,808.43 , only $ 109,648.42 of that sum was paid on account thereof .
These facts may furnish an illustration of the sentiment which extensively prevails that a debt due the Government should cause no inconvenience to the citizen .
It also appears from this report that though prior to March , 1885 , there had been but 6 convictions in the Territories of Utah and Idaho under the laws of 1862 and 1882 , punishing polygamy and unlawful cohabitation as crimes , there have been since that date nearly 600 convictions under these laws and the statutes of 1887 ; and the opinion is expressed that under such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws and the advance of ideas opposed to the forbidden practices polygamy within the United States is virtually at an end .
Suits instituted by the Government under the provisions of the act of March 3 , 1887 , for the termination of the corporations known as the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints have resulted in a decree favorable to the Government , declaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheating their property .
Such property , amounting in value to more than $ 800,000 , is in the hands of a receiver pending further proceedings , an appeal having been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States .
In the report of the Secretary of the Interior , which will be laid before you , the condition of the various branches of our domestic affairs connected with that Department and its operations during the past year are fully exhibited .
But a brief reference to some of the subjects discussed in this able and interesting report can here be made ; but I commend the entire report to the attention of the Congress , and trust that the sensible and valuable recommendations it contains will secure careful consideration .
I can not too strenuously insist upon the importance of proper measures to insure a right disposition of our public lands , not only as a matter of present justice , but in forecast of the consequences to future generations .
The broad , rich acres of our agricultural plains have been long preserved by nature to become her untrammeled gift to a people civilized and free , upon which should rest in well - distributed ownership the numerous homes of enlightened , equal , and fraternal citizens .
They came to national possession with the warning example in our eyes of the entail of iniquities in landed proprietorship which other countries have permitted and still suffer .
We have no excuse for the violation of principles cogently taught by reason and example , nor for the allowance of pretexts which have sometimes exposed our lands to colossal greed .
Laws which open a door to fraudulent acquisition , or administration which permits favor to rapacious seizure by a favored few of expanded areas that many should enjoy , are accessory to offenses against our national welfare and humanity not to be too severely condemned or punished .
It is gratifying to know that something has been done at last to redress the injuries to our people and check the perilous tendency of the reckless waste of the national domain .
That over 80,000,000 acres have been arrested from illegal usurpation , improvident grants , and fraudulent entries and claims , to be taken for the homesteads of honest industry — although less than the greater areas thus unjustly lost — must afford a profound gratification to right - feeling citizens , as it is a recompense for the labors and struggles of the recovery .
Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measures of legislation which will confine the future disposition of our remaining agricultural lands to the uses of actual husbandry and genuine homes .
Nor should our vast tracts of so - called desert lands be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals , as appears to be much the tendency under the existing statute .
These lands require but the supply of water to become fertile and productive .
It is a problem of great moment how most wisely for the public good that factor shall be furnished .
I can not but think it perilous to suffer either these lands or the sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies , which by such means may exercise lordship over the areas dependent on their treatment for productiveness .
Already steps have been taken to secure accurate and scientific information of the conditions , which is the prime basis of intelligent action .
Until this shall be gained the course of wisdom appears clearly to lie in a suspension of further disposal , which only promises to create rights antagonistic to the common interest .
No harm can follow this cautionary conduct .
The land will remain , and the public good presents no demand for hasty dispossession of national ownership and control .
I commend also the recommendations that appropriate measures be taken to complete the adjustment of the various grants made to the States for internal improvements and of swamp and overflowed lands , as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land claims .
All these are elements of great injustice and peril to the settlers upon the localities affected ; and now that their existence can not be avoided , no duty is more pressing than to fix as soon as possible their bounds and terminate the threats of trouble which arise from uncertainty .
The condition of our Indian population continues to improve and the proofs multiply that the transforming change , so much to be desired , which shall substitute for barbarism enlightenment and civilizing education , is in favorable progress .
Our relations with these people during the year have been disturbed by no serious disorders , but rather marked by a better realization of their true interests and increasing confidence and good will .
These conditions testify to the value of the higher tone of consideration and humanity which has governed the later methods of dealing with them , and commend its continued observance .
Allotments in severalty have been made on some reservations until all those entitled to land thereon have had their shares assigned , and the work is still continued .
In directing the execution of this duty I have not aimed so much at rapid dispatch as to secure just and fair arrangements which shall best conduce to the objects of the law by producing satisfaction with the results of the allotments made .
No measure of general effect has ever been entered on from which more may be fairly hoped if it shall be discreetly administered .
It proffers opportunity and inducement to that independence of spirit and life which the Indian peculiarly needs , while at the same time the inalienability of title affords security against the risks his inexperience of affairs or weakness of character may expose him to in dealing with others .
Whenever begun upon any reservation it should be made complete , so that all are brought to the same condition , and as soon as possible community in lands should cease by opening such as remain unallotted to settlement .
Contact with the ways of industrious and successful farmers will perhaps add a healthy emulation which will both instruct and stimulate .
But no agency for the amelioration of this people appears to me so promising as the extension , urged by the Secretary , of such complete facilities of education as shall at the earliest possible day embrace all teachable Indian youth , of both sexes , and retain them with a kindly and beneficent hold until their characters are formed and their faculties and dispositions trained to the sure pursuit of some form of useful industry .
Capacity of the Indian no longer needs demonstration .
It is established .
It remains to make the most of it , and when that shall be done the curse will be lifted , the Indian race saved , and the sin of their oppression redeemed .
The time of its accomplishment depends upon the spirit and justice with which it shall be prosecuted .
It can not be too soon for the Indian nor for the interests and good name of the nation .
The average attendance of Indian pupils on the schools increased by over 900 during the year , and the total enrollment reached 15,212 .
The cost of maintenance was not materially raised .
The number of teachable Indian youth is now estimated at 40,000 , or nearly three times the enrollment of the schools .
It is believed the obstacles in the way of instructing are all surmountable , and that the necessary expenditure would be a measure of economy .
The Sioux tribes on the great reservation of Dakota refused to assent to the act passed by the Congress at its last session for opening a portion of their lands to settlement , notwithstanding modification of the terms was suggested which met most of their objections .
Their demand is for immediate payment of the full price of $ 1.25 per acre for the entire body of land the occupancy of which they are asked to relinquish .
The manner of submission insured their fair understanding of the law , and their action was undoubtedly as thoroughly intelligent as their capacity admitted .
It is at least gratifying that no reproach of overreaching can in any manner lie against the Government , however advisable the favorable completion of the negotiation may have been esteemed .
I concur in the suggestions of the Secretary regarding the Turtle Mountain Indians , the two reservations in California , and the Crees .
They should , in my opinion , receive immediate attention .
The number of pensioners added to the rolls during the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1888 , is 60,252 , and increase of pensions was granted in 45,716 cases .
The names of 15,730 pensioners were dropped from the rolls during the year from various causes , and at the close of the year the number of persons of all classes receiving pensions was 452,557 .
Of these there were 806 survivors of the War of 1812 , 10,787 widows of those who served in that war , 16,060 soldiers of the Mexican War , and 5,104 widows of said soldiers .
One hundred and two different rates of pensions are paid to these beneficiaries , ranging from $ 2 to $ 416.66 per month .
The amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was $ 78,775,861.92 , being an increase over the preceding year of $ 5,308,280.22 .
The expenses attending the maintenance and operation of the Pension Bureau during that period was $ 3,262,524.67 , making the entire expenditures of the Bureau $ 82,038,386.57 , being 21 1/2 per cent of the gross income and nearly 31 per cent of the total expenditures of the Government during the year .
I am thoroughly convinced that our general pension laws should be revised and adjusted to meet as far as possible , in the light of our experience , all meritorious cases .
The fact that 102 different rates of pensions are paid can not , in my opinion , be made consistent with justice to the pensioners or to the Government ; and the numerous private pension bills that are passed , predicated upon the imperfection of general laws , while they increase in many cases existing inequality and injustice , lend additional force to the recommendation for a revision of the general laws on this subject .
The laxity of ideas prevailing among a large number of our people regarding pensions is becoming every day more marked .
The principles upon which they should be granted are in danger of being altogether ignored , and already pensions are often claimed because the applicants are as much entitled as other successful applicants , rather than upon any disability reasonably attributable to military service .
If the establishment of vicious precedents be continued , if the granting of pensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant considerations , and if the honorable name of veteran unfairly becomes by these means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the aid of the Government , there is danger that injury will be done to the fame and patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor , and that a prejudice will be aroused unjust to meritorious applicants for pensions .
The Department of Agriculture has continued , with a good measure of success , its efforts to develop the processes , enlarge the results , and augment the profits of American husbandry .
It has collected and distributed practical information , introduced and tested new plants , checked the spread of contagious diseases of farm animals , resisted the advance of noxious insects and destructive fungous growths , and sought to secure to agricultural labor the highest reward of effort and the fullest immunity from loss .
Its records of the year show that the season of 1888 has been one of medium production .
A generous supply of the demands of consumption has been assured , and a surplus for exportation , moderate in certain products and bountiful in others , will prove a benefaction alike to buyer and grower .
Four years ago it was found that the great cattle industry of the country was endangered , and those engaged in it were alarmed at the rapid extension of the European lung plague of pleuro - pneumonia .
Serious outbreaks existed in Illinois , Missouri , and Kentucky , and in Tennessee animals affected were held in quarantine .
Five counties in New York and from one to four counties in each of the States of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland were almost equally affected .
With this great danger upon us and with the contagion already in the channels of commerce , with the enormous direct and indirect losses already being caused by it , and when only prompt and energetic action could be successful , there were in none of these States any laws authorizing this Department to eradicate the malady or giving the State officials power to cooperate with it for this purpose .
The Department even lacked both the requisite appropriation and authority .
By securing State cooperation in connection with authority from Congress the work of eradication has been pressed successfully , and this dreaded disease has been extirpated from the Western States and also from the Eastern States , with the exception of a few restricted areas , which are still under supervision .
The danger has thus been removed , and trade and commerce have been freed from the vexatious State restrictions which were deemed necessary for a time .
During the past four years the process of diffusion , as applied to the manufacture of sugar from sorghum and sugar cane , has been introduced into this country and fully perfected by the experiments carried on by the Department of Agriculture .
This process is now universally considered to be the most economical one , and it is through it that the sorghum - sugar industry has been established upon a firm basis and the road to its future success opened .
The adoption of this diffusion process is also extending in Louisiana and other sugar - producing parts of the country , and will doubtless soon be the only method employed for the extraction of sugar from the cane .
An exhaustive study has also within the same period been undertaken of the subject of food adulteration and the best analytical methods for detecting it .
A part of the results of this work has already been published by the Department , which , with the matter in course of preparation , will make the most complete treatise on that subject that has ever been published in any country .
The Department seeks a progressive development .
It would combine the discoveries of science with the economics and amelioration of rural practice .
A supervision of the endowed experimental - station system recently provided for is a proper function of the Department , and is now in operation .
This supervision is very important , and should be wisely and vigilantly directed , to the end that the pecuniary aid of the Government in favor of intelligent agriculture should be so applied as to result in the general good and to the benefit of all our people , thus justifying the appropriations made from the public Treasury .
The adjustment of the relations between the Government and the railroad companies which have received land grants and the guaranty of the public credit in aid of the construction of their roads should receive early attention .
The report of a majority of the commissioners appointed to examine the affairs and indebtedness of these roads , in which they favor an extension of the time for the payment of such indebtedness in at least one case where the corporation appears to be able to comply with well - guarded and exact terms of such extension , and the reenforcement of their opinion by gentlemen of undoubted business judgment and experience , appointed to protect the interests of the Government as directors of said corporation , may well lead to the belief that such an extension would be to the advantage of the Government .
The subject should be treated as a business proposition with a view to a final realization of its indebtedness by the Government , rather than as a question to be decided upon prejudice or by way of punishment for previous wrongdoing .
The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia , with its accompanying documents , gives in detail the operations of the several departments of the District government , and furnishes evidence that the financial affairs of the District are at present in such satisfactory condition as to justify the Commissioners in submitting to the Congress estimates for desirable and needed improvements .
The Commissioners recommend certain legislation which in their opinion is necessary to advance the interests of the District .
I invite your special attention to their request for such legislation as will enable the Commissioners without delay to collect , digest , and properly arrange the laws by which the District is governed , and which are now embraced in several collections , making them available only with great difficulty and labor .
The suggestions they make touching desirable amendments to the laws relating to licenses granted for carrying on the retail traffic in spirituous liquors , to the observance of Sunday , to the proper assessment and collection of taxes , to the speedy punishment of minor offenders , and to the management and control of the reformatory and charitable institutions supported by Congressional appropriations are commended to careful consideration .
I again call attention to the present inconvenience and the danger to life and property attending the operation of steam railroads through and across the public streets and roads of the District .
The propriety of such legislation as will properly guard the use of these railroads and better secure the convenience and safety of citizens is manifest .
The consciousness that I have presented but an imperfect statement of the condition of our country and its wants occasions no fear that anything omitted is not known and appreciated by the Congress , upon whom rests the responsibility of intelligent legislation in behalf of a great nation and a confiding people .
As public servants we shall do our duty well if we constantly guard the rectitude of our intentions , maintain unsullied our love of country , and with unselfish purpose strive for the public good .
A reader asks a very interesting question about the undie - bomber - why did he get back into his seat to detonate a bomb that had a ramshackle detonator and where he could be overcome by fellow travelers ?
Read the whole email :
I keep hearing this even described as a failed terrorist attack on an airplane .
But was it really ?
I keep hearing about how the system failed , but did it really ?
Think about it .
First , what is the major goal of terrorism ?
It is not to bring down airplanes .
It is not to destroy the West .
It is , pure and simple , to create terror in people .
Why ?
Because when people are afraid they overreact .
And this includes most of us , yourself included .
If the intent of al Qaeda in this latest instance was to bring down an airplane , then it failed .
But if its intent was to create fear and overreaction , then it succeeded Personally , I think it was the latter .
It is quite possible ( in fact I think probable ) that the people who planned this event , and used the young man from Nigeria as a tool , were aware that due to security measures in place , there was no way they could actually get a bomb through that would actually work .
The detonation equipment needed would have been detected .
The same applies , by the way , to the shoe bomber .
Again , think about it .
If you wanted to blow up a plane , would you attempt it from your seat , where somebody could quite possibly stop you ?
No , you would go to the washroom where you could set off the bomb without disruption .

The Story :
Just when you thought another cart could n’t fit on the expanding corner of SW 10th and Alder , you get an email about a new cart .
The owners of SomTum Gai Yang contacted us a couple of weeks ago , announcing their opening .
I mentioned it to a couple of fellow cart fans and within a couple of days was getting rave reviews about the food , so I decided to visit .
The name SomTum Gai Yang actually describes exactly what they serve .
Som tum or som tam is a green papaya salad that is shredded in a way to make it look like noodles .
It tastes a bit like jicima with a little sweetness .
Almost like cabbage .
Pair that with some carrots , cherry tomatoes , green beans and spice and you have a tasty meal .
Gai Yang is Thai barbecued chicken .
Put it all together and you have a great meal .
I decided to try the whole meal – SomTum Gai Yang – in order to taste all that they have to offer .
I chose to get barbecued pork instead of chicken though .
I ’m always the troublesome one .
The dish comes with a spicy sauce for the rice which is a sticky rice served in a bag and sealed to keep it sticky and moist .
The salad was something I had never had .
I actually thought the green papaya was noodles until my buddy told me otherwise .
I ordered mine medium hotness and it was perfect .
It was n’t hot for hot ’s sake , but more of a flavorful spicy hot .
I may even ask them to go a bit hotter to see if the flavor intensifies .
The pork was cooked perfectly and was a great compliment to the spicy salad .
In the end , a great meal .
If you are a fan of Thai food , you should visit .
They serve up only a few dishes , so they make those dishes special .
I enjoyed that salad so much , I ’m going to seek it out elsewhere to see how others prepare it .
When you visit , let them know Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Short articles on interesting little - known chapters of United States history , written to inspire further exploration .
Description :
Olena T gets her thick bush wet in the bath .
What an amazing body ...
Alan C. Love , General Editor
Minnesota Studies in Philosophy of Science is the world 's longest running and best known series devoted exclusively to the philosophy of science .
Edited by resident fellows of the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science ( MCPS ) since 1956 , the series brings together original articles by leading workers in the philosophy of science .
The twenty existing volumes cover topics ranging from the philosophy of psychology and the structure of space and time to the nature of scientific theories and scientific explanation .
Minnesota volumes typically grow out of intensive workshops focused on specific topics .
The participants are invited to contribute because they represent the leading viewpoints of the time .
The volumes thus have a coherent focus enhanced by the authors ' considerable face to face interaction before their papers are revised for publication .
The goal of the MCPS is to continue producing a volume of Minnesota Studies every two to three years on central topics of broad interest within the philosophy of science .
The objective is both to define current debates within the field and to help set the agenda for the future .
Many chapters and often entire volumes are now open access ( freely available ) .
Woolley was trapped for 65 hours with a broken leg and a head injury .
He used an unnamed first - aid app to teach himself how to fashion a tourniquet and to avoid going into shock ( he set his iPhone ’s alarm to go off every 20 minutes so he would n’t fall asleep ) .
Dan Woolley was eventually rescued by a French search - and - rescue team .
When Dan Woolley , an American missionary in Haiti , says his iPhone saved his butt , he means it literally .
Here is his story : Amazing right ?
He managed to make his iPhone battery last 65 hours , wow .
Jokes aside , combined with the App Store , the iPhone is indeed an unbelievably versatile gadget .

The 911 call came in as “ ankle pain . ”
So Denver paramedics headed out onto frozen streets and brought Debra Neaves to the hospital .
With that trip , those emergency providers became makeshift patches in the frayed health care safety net , providing services they were never intended to provide — at enormous cost to health systems , taxpayers and everybody with health insurance .
Sitting in a wheelchair inside Denver Health Medical Center ’s emergency room , Neaves teared up as she recited a list of the health problems that tumble through her life : diabetes , sleep apnea , high cholesterol , a crushed ankle .
A doctor visit was weeks away , and the pain was worse every day .
On this morning , “ I stepped out of bed , and it was just so bad , I could n’t walk . ”
Neaves is on Medicaid , the taxpayer - funded medical coverage that in Colorado assists poor children and disabled adults .
The program provides transportation , but Neaves said , “ You need three days ’ notice for a taxi to take you to a doctor . ”
So she called 911 .
Paramedics and emergency medical technicians here and around the country say a substantial number of emergency calls are n’t emergencies at all but medical situations best handled in a doctor ’s office .
“ It ’s a problem , and it ’s getting worse , ” said Jerry Johnston , who just ended his term as president of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians and is an Iowa EMT .
It ’s costly — an average ambulance call is $ 300 to $ 400 — and it ’s potentially dangerous , Johnston said .
“ It becomes frustrating because we could be tied up taking someone to the emergency department who , A , does n’t need to go to the hospital and , B , does n’t need an ambulance , ” and in the meantime , there is a pileup on a highway and no available paramedics .
He ’s not talking about the goofball 911 calls that occasionally make news : the woman who needs advice on how to cook her turkey ; the guy who wants to know whether it will snow tomorrow .
Those calls may be irritating , but they are easily dispensed with .
The non-emergency medical calls are another matter .
Some of these calls are from people gaming the system , such as a woman well - known to Fort Worth , Texas , EMTs , who gets drunk every Friday and then calls 911 and asks to be taken to the hospital a few yards from her apartment .
Then there are those who are just plain impatient , said Dr. David Ross , medical director of Colorado Springs AMR , which is that city ’s ambulance provider .
“ There are a small percentage of patients who will use the ambulance systems to try and get bumped up on the be-seen list ” in the emergency room , Ross said .
But many non-emergency calls are made out of frustration , said Dr. Christopher Colwell , interim director of emergency medicine at Denver Health and medical director of the paramedic division .
“ They have nowhere else to go , ” he said .
“ They deal and deal and deal until it reaches a stage where they can’t deal anymore , and they ca n’t go anywhere else . ”
Duty to respond
Even if they could see a doctor , the chronically ill and the poor often have no way to get there , Colwell said .
“ It often boils down to , do they need treatment or do they need a ride ? ”
Often , it ’s a ride they can not pay for .
Denver Health gets paid for about 28 percent of ambulance rides , which is one reason the paramedic division lost $ 1.6 million last year .
There are no solid numbers on non-emergency medical calls to 911 , mainly because nobody tracks them .
Anecdotally , emergency providers agree that non-emergencies constitute a substantial amount of an EMT ’s or paramedic ’s workday .
One gauge is that of the 84,837 emergency calls to Denver paramedics last year , about 30 percent did n’t result in anyone being taken to a hospital .
In Colorado Springs , it is roughly 28 percent , Ross said .
There are a couple of reasons why an ambulance will go out and not come back to a hospital with a patient , said Dee Martinez , Denver Health spokeswoman .
The first is that people refuse ambulance transportation .
“ The other is that we get on a scene and determine there is no need to transport , ” she said .
Sometimes , that might seem obvious from the moment a dispatcher picks up the call .
But emergency systems have a duty to respond , said Johnston .
“ If you ’re a system that responds to 911 calls , you must respond to every call . ”
That ’s why the woman in Fort Worth is so well - known to EMTs there .
And she is one reason emergency providers in that city devised a novel program that they say saves money and better serves those who need care .
“ We identified our 21 most frequent fliers and then looked to see whether there is anything in common among them , ” said Matt Zavadsky , assistant director of operations for Fort Worth ’s paramedics .
Turned out , there was .
Many had chronic health problems , others had mental - health problems and some just wanted someone to talk to .
So , the city of about 720,000 created “ community health paramedics ” who are specially trained to respond to non-emergency medical calls and regularly visit patients to check blood sugar , blood pressure , etc .
“ We wanted to make our frequent fliers healthier and decompress the system to make more ambulances available for other types of calls , ” Zavadsky said .
The results exceeded everybody ’s expectations , he said .
“ We reduced 911 calls by 52 percent and saved our system $ 560,000 in the first six months , ” he said .
Paramedics in western Eagle County are working on a similar program to address unique health care problems facing people in rural areas .
Christopher Montera , chief of western Eagle County ’s ambulance district , and Anne Robinson of the county health department want to deliver health care to people in their homes , through something they are calling the community paramedic pilot program .
As Montera and Robinson envision it , paramedics would visit patients regularly after they ’ve been released from the hospital .
The result , they hope , would be fewer people needing to go back to the hospital .
Common thread
The program could save everyone — hospitals , taxpayers , insurance companies — in the long run , he said .
A common thread ties what Montera is trying to accomplish to the issue that drives overuse of 911 in cities : access to health care .
“ In health care reform , we need to have this discussion , and we ’re not , ” Johnston said .
In the meantime , people with upset stomachs , low blood sugar and nausea will continue calling 911 .
And paramedics will respond .
“ We tend to be the safety net within the safety net , ” said James Azuero , assistant communications chief for Denver ’s paramedic division .
“ If you call 911 , someone will answer , and if you want , someone will show up , ” he said .

This week the New York Post ran an article about a couple that lives in the city ’s smallest apartment .
Their “ microstudio ” measures a wee 175 square feet — only 10 feet wide , and just under 15 feet long .
The kitchen is equipped with a mini- fridge and hot plate , but the couple never cooks ; they use their cupboards for clothes storage instead of pots and pans .
[ See the photo gallery of the couple ’s apartment here . ]
Of course , such an extreme example of minimalism made me wonder if my husband and I could do the same .
My first reaction was to laugh at the thought .
But then I realized that this is exactly how we lived for six weeks last summer ( see My Minimalist Story , Part 3 : My Life in a Duffel Bag ) .
Most of our hotel rooms were no larger than this , and we were perfectly comfortable .
Yet that begs the question … even though we could do it , would we want to ?
And to that , I must answer : No .
Why not ?
Because I have a confession to make : I ’m Miss Minimalist , and I ’m an empty space junkie .
I love empty space .
Lots and lots and lots of it .
The more , the better .
If you ’d like to know what my dream home looks like , take a gander at this renovated cement factory .
( Actually , I would n’t want the whole house , just the room with the blue carpet and white sofas–scroll down to see the pics . )
I know that many minimalists , and proponents of the voluntary simplicity movement , dream of tiny houses and cozy spaces .
Do you know what I dream of ?
A living room the size of a gymnasium .
With nothing but our mattress , two chairs , and coffee table — and tons of gorgeous , magnificent , empty space .
I look around at our 800 square foot apartment , and know it ’s too big for the paltry amount of stuff we have in it .
But if you offered me a 2000 square foot loft for the same rent , I ’d take it in a heartbeat .
My empty space obsession is n’t new ; I ’ve been enamored with enormous rooms for as long as I can remember .
When I was in college , I worked in a contemporary art gallery .
Now I understand why I always felt so comfortable in that space .
It was n’t the cutting edge art to which I was attracted ( as I thought at the time ) ; it was the gallery space itself .
High ceilings , white walls , more empty space than you could shake a stick at .
And I particularly loved it between exhibitions , when the walls were completely blank .
In the UK , I ’ve found a new way to feed my addiction : touring the majestic interiors of castles and estates .
Last weekend , I visited Windsor Castle , which has some of the grandest rooms I ’ve ever seen .
Tragically , they were covered head to toe in paintings , tapestries , gold gilt decor , and furniture that looked as if it might come to life and attack ( I have an irrational phobia of chairs and tables with animal feet ) .
I could n’t help but fantasize about how beautiful those rooms would look if they were stripped bare — and under what circumstances I might come to live in one .
I fear this disclosure may make me unpopular among other simple livers , as my penchant for oversized spaces seems antithetical to the movement ’s values .
But hey — we all have our quirks .
And as of yet , I have n’t actually purchased a gigantic abandoned factory to renovate into a home ( though I ’m sure my husband fears that someday I might ) .
In reality , I try to live as lightly , simply , and “ green-ly ” as possible ; I dream , however , on a much larger scale .
So while I love a good tiny house site as much as the next person , I ’m not really yearning for a pint - sized pad .
Instead , I ’m drooling over outsized lofts and warehouse conversions — and ( no longer so secretly ) plotting minimalist makeovers of certain royal palaces .

schlemiel maintained by Washington .
However , this assumes that the current Iranian ruling class is the country 's best vanguard against imperialism - an absurd proposition .
The reformers are not Washington stooges , and their success would make attacks and sanctions emanating from Washington less plausible .
It also assumes that no social class or coalition in Iran has the resources to build a better , more just state under the duress of pressure from the US .
That has always been an excuse of developmentalist , and even ' socialist ' , despotisms .

Advertisement Police officers filmed using riot shields to sledge down a snowy hill while on duty have been reprimanded .
The footage of a group of officers on Boars Hill , Oxford , was taken by Rick Latham on Tuesday .
He posted it on the file - sharing website YouTube .
Mr Latham said they were only there for a few minutes and praised the officers for having a " sense of humour " .
Supt Andrew Murray said those involved have been spoken to and advised that their actions were a " bad idea " .
But the local policing area commander added that the snow had " a habit of bringing out the child in all of us " .
" I have spoken to the officers concerned and reminded them in no uncertain terms that tobogganing on duty , on police equipment and at taxpayers ' expense is a very bad idea should they wish to progress under my command , " Supt Murray added .
Since I 've put the footage up lots have people have commented saying how good it is to see officers having a sense of humour
Rick Latham Mr Latham , 50 , from Oxford , said he was on the hill when the officers came over .
" I thought they were going to tell us off at first , " Mr Latham told BBC News .
" But they had a look at the hill and two of them went down on their shields .
" They were jovial and it was nice to see officers taking time out to get involved .
" They were only there for a few minutes so I do n't think they should be criticised .
" Since I 've put the footage up lots have people have commented saying how good it is to see officers having a sense of humour .
" It makes a change of the image you usually read about . "

Suppose you have a fixed list of digits chosen from the range 1..9 .
What numbers can you make with them ?
You ’re allowed as many zeros as you want .
Write the numbers in increasing order .
Exactly this puzzle came up in the recent Google Code Jam programming contest :
You are writing out a list of numbers .
Your list contains all numbers with exactly D i digits in its decimal representation which are equal to i , for each i between 1 and 9 , inclusive .
You are writing them out in ascending order .
For example , you might be writing every number with two ‘ 1 ’s and one ‘ 5 ’ .
Your list would begin 115 , 151 , 511 , 1015 , 1051 .
Given N , the last number you wrote , compute what the next number in the list will be .
The competition has closed now , but if you ’d like to give it a go sample input files can be found on the website , where you can also upload your results and have them checked .
Here ’s a short section from a trial I ran on my computer .
Input numbers are in the left - hand column : the corresponding output numbers are in the right - hand column .
50110812884911623516 → 50110812884911623561 82454322474161687049 → 82454322474161687094 82040229261723155710 → 82040229261723157015 43888989554234187388 → 43888989554234187838 76080994872481480636 → 76080994872481480663 31000989133449480678 → 31000989133449480687 20347716554681051891 → 20347716554681051918
Like many of the code jam challenges , you ’ll need to write a program which runs fast enough ; but choosing the right algorithm is more important than choosing the right language .
Typically a high - level interpreted language like Python allows me to code and test a solution far more quickly than using a low - level language like C or C ++.
In this particular case , though , like most successful candidates , I used C++.
Here ’s why .
Next_permutation transforms the range of elements [ first , last ) into the lexicographically next greater permutation of the elements . [… ]
If such a permutation exists , next_permutation transforms [ first , last ) into that permutation and returns true .
Otherwise it transforms [ first , last ) into the lexicographically smallest permutation and returns false .
Although the next number problem appears to be about numbers and lexicographical ordering appears to be about words , std:: next_permutation is exactly what ’s needed here .
A dictionary provides the canonical example of lexicographical ordering .
Words are built from characters , which can be alphabetically ordered A , B , C , … , so in the dictionary words which begin with A appear before words which begin with B , which themselves come in front of words beginning with C , etc .
If two words start with the same letter , pop that letter from the head of the word and compare their tails , which puts AARDVARK before ANIMAL , and — applying this rule recursively — after AARDMAN .
Imagine there ’s an empty word marking position zero , before A , right at the front of the dictionary , and our recursive definition is complete .
Here ’s a simple program which shows next_permutation ( ) in action .
#include < algorithm > # include < cstdio > int main ( ) { char xs [ ] = " 123 " ; do { std:: puts ( xs ) ; } while ( std:: next_permutation ( xs , xs + sizeof ( xs ) - 1 ) ) ; return 0 ; }
This program outputs lexicographically ordered permutations of 1 , 2 and 3 .
When the main function returns , the array xs will have cycled round to hold the lexicographically smallest arrangement of its elements , which is " 123 " .
Note that we never convert the characters ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' into the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 .
The values of both sets of data types appear in the same order , so all works as expected .
123 132 213 231 312 321
If we tweak and rerun the same program with xs initialised to " AAADKRRV " we get rather more output .
AAADKRRV AAADKRVR AAADKVRR ... AARDVARK ... VRRKAADA VRRKADAA VRRKDAAA
The sequence does n’t start by repeating " AAADKRRV " 6 times , once for every permutation of the 3 A’s .
Only strictly increasing permutations are included .
And although the repeated calls to next_permutation generate a series of permutations , the algorithm holds no state .
Each function call works on its input range afresh .
This second run of the program yields 3360 lines of output , even though there are 8 ! = 40320 possible permutations of 8 characters .
Each unique permutation corresponds to 3 ! × 2 ! = 12 actual permutations of the 8 characters ( because there are 3 A ’s and 2 R’s ) , and 40320 ÷ 12 is 3360 .
As you can see , next_permutation sorts an input range , one step at a time .
When next_permutation eventually returns false , the range will be perfectly ordered .
Hence we have snail_sort ( ) , hailed by the SGI STL documentation as the worst known deterministic sorting algorithm .
template < class Iter > void snail_sort ( Iter first , Iter last ) { while ( next_permutation ( first , last ) ) {} }
Very witty , and evidence that code can be both elegant and inefficient .
In two important edge cases , though , snail_sort performs on a par with super - charged quicksort !
I snail sorted an array filled with 100000000 zeros in 0.502 seconds .
Running quicksort on the same array took 5.504 seconds .
Starting with an array of the same size filled with the values 99999999 , 99999998 , 99999997 , … 1 , 0 snail sort ’s 0.500 seconds trounced quicksort ’s 4.08 seconds .
Here ’s an outline solution to the next number problem .
( I ’ve glossed over the exact input and output file formats for clarity . )
It reads numbers from standard input and writes next numbers to standard output .
Next_permutation does the hard work , and there ’s a bit of fiddling when we have to increase the number of digits by adding a zero . [ 1 ]
#include < algorithm > # include < iostream > /*
Given a string of digits , shift any leading ' 0's past the first non-zero digit and insert an extra zero .
Examples : 123 -> 1023 008 -> 8000 034 -> 3004 */ void insert_a_zero( std : : string & number ) { size_t nzeros = number.find_first_not_of ( '0 ' ) ; number = number.substr( nzeros ) ; number.insert( 1 , nzeros + 1 , '0 ' ) ; } /* Outline solution to the 2009 code jam Next Number problem .
Given a string representing a decimal number , find the next number which can be formed from the same set of digits .
Add another zero if necessary .
Repeat for all such strings read from standard input . */ int main ( ) { std :: string number ; while ( std::cin >> number ) { if (!next_permutation(number.begin( ) , number.end ( ) ) ) { insert_a_zero( number ) ; } std::cout << number << '
' ; } return 0 ; }
Having used the C++ standard library to solve the puzzle , let ’s take a look at how it works .
Next permutation is a clever algorithm which shuffles a collection in place .
My system implements it like this [ 2 ] .
template < typename Iter > bool next_permutation ( Iter first , Iter last ) { if ( first == last ) return false ; Iter i = first ; ++i ; if ( i == last ) return false ; i = last ; -- i ; for ( ; ; ) {
Iter ii = i ; -- i ; if ( * i < * ii ) {
Iter j = last ; while ( ! ( * i < *--j ) ) {} std ::iter_swap(i , j ) ; std : : reverse ( ii , last ) ; return true ; } if ( i == first ) { std::reverse( first , last ) ; return false ; } } }
We start with a range delimited by a pair of bi-directional iterators , [ first , last ) .
If the range contains one item or fewer , there can be no next permutation , so leave the range as is and return false .
Otherwise , enter the for loop with an iterator i pointing at the final item in the range .
At each pass through the body of this for loop we decrement i by one , stepping towards the first item in the range .
We are looking for one of two conditions :
the value pointed to by i is smaller than the one it pointed to previously i reaches into the first item in the range
Put another way , we divide the range into a head and tail , where the tail is the longest possible decreasing tail of the range .
If this tail is the whole range ( the second condition listed above ) then the whole range is in reverse order , and we have the lexicographical maximum formed from its elements .
Reversing the range returns it to its lexicographical minimum , and we can return false .
If this tail is not the whole range , then the final item in the head of the range , the item i points to , this item is smaller than at least one of the items in the tail of the range , and we can certainly generate a greater permutation by moving the item towards the end of the range .
To find the next permutation , we reverse iterate from the end of the range until we find an item *j bigger than * i — that ’s what the while loop does .
Swapping the items pointed to by i and j ensures the head of the range is bigger than it was , and the tail of the range remains in reverse order .
Finally , we reverse the tail of the range , leaving us with a permutation exactly one beyond the input permutation , and we return true .
It ’s clear from this paper analysis that the algorithm is of linear complexity .
Essentially , it walks up and down the tail of the list , comparing and swapping .
But why does it work ?
Let xs be the range ( first , last ) .
As described above , divide this range into prefix and suffix subranges , head and tail , where tail is the longest monotonically decreasing tail of the range .
If the head of the range is empty , then the range xs is clearly at its lexicographical maximum .
Otherwise , tail is a lexicographical maximum of the elements it contains , and xs is therefore the largest permutation which starts with the subrange head .
What will the head of the next permutation be ?
We have to swap the final item in head with the smallest item of tail which exceeds it : the definition of tail guarantees at least one such item exists .
Now we want to permute the new tail to be at a its lexicographical minimum , which is a matter of sorting it from low to high .
Since tail is in reverse order , finding the smallest item larger than head [ - 1 ] is a matter of walking back from the end of the range to find the first such items ; and once we ’ve swapped these items , tail remains in reverse order , so a simple reversed will sort it .
As an example consider finding the next permutation of :
8342666411
The longest monotonically decreasing tail is 666411 , and the corresponding head is 8342 .
8342 666411
666411 is , by definition , reverse - ordered , and cannot be increased by permuting its elements .
To find the next permutation , we must increase the head ; a matter of finding the smallest tail element larger than the head ’s final 2 .
834 2 666411
Walking back from the end of tail , the first element greater than 2 is 4 .
834 2 666 4 11
Swap the 2 and the 4
834 4 666 2 11
Since head has increased , we now have a greater permutation .
To reduce to the next permutation , we reverse tail , putting it into increasing order .
8344 112666
Join the head and tail back together .
The permutation one greater than 8342666411 is 8344112666 .
C++ has its detractors , who characterise it as subtle , complex , and dangerous ; but sometimes it excels .
Look once more at the C++ implementation of this algorithm .
template < typename Iter > bool next_permutation ( Iter first , Iter last ) { if ( first == last ) return false ; Iter i = first ; ++i ; if ( i == last ) return false ; i = last ; -- i ; for ( ; ; ) {
Iter ii = i ; -- i ; if ( * i < * ii ) {
Iter j = last ; while ( ! ( * i < *--j ) ) {} std ::iter_swap(i , j ) ; std : : reverse ( ii , last ) ; return true ; } if ( i == first ) { std::reverse( first , last ) ; return false ; } } }
With its special cases , boolean literals , multiple returns ( 4 , count them ! ) , disembodied and infinite loops , this code fails to exhibit conventional beauty .
Yet it is beautiful .
All the next permutation algorithm needs are iterators which can advance forwards or backwards , step by step .
And that ’s all this implementation uses .
I ’m as excited as anyone by the mathematical rigour of functional programming , but sometimes computer science is about algorithms with virtually no space overhead , algorithms which loop rather than recurse .
Sometimes it ’s about shuffling , nudging and swapping — operations which map directly to the machine ’s most primitive operations .
In such cases , C++ gets it right .
For the code jam , though , as mentioned earlier , having a super - fast program rarely matters .
More often , it ’s about developing a fast enough program super - quickly .
I find Python a far quicker language for developing code than C++.
( Indeed , sometimes when it ’s obvious from the outset that a final program will need implementing in C++ , I put together a working prototype using Python , which I then translate . )
Could we solve the next number problem using code from the standard Python library ?
At a first glance , itertools .
permutations looks promising .
itertools.permutations ( iterable , r=None )
Return successive r length permutations of elements in the iterable .
If r is not specified or is None , then r defaults to the length of the iterable and all possible full - length permutations are generated .
Permutations are emitted in lexicographic sort order .
So , if the input iterable is sorted , the permutation tuples will be produced in sorted order .
Elements are treated as unique based on their position , not on their value .
So if the input elements are unique , there will be no repeat values in each permutation .
However , this algorithm does n’t care about the values of the items in the iterable , and the lexicographic sort order applies to the indices of these items .
So although the ordering of the generated items is well - defined :
we get repeats , and it ’s not the ordering we want ( in this case )
>>> from itertools import permutations >>> concat = ''.join >>> list ( map ( concat , permutations ( ' AAA ' ) ) ) [ ' AAA ' , ' AAA ' , ' AAA ' , ' AAA ' , ' AAA ' , ' AAA ' ] >>> list ( map ( concat , permutations ( ' 231 ' ) ) ) [ ' 231 ' , ' 213 ' , ' 321 ' , ' 312 ' , ' 123 ' , ' 132 ' ]
It is possible to code up next_permutation using nothing more than the standard itertools , but it is n’t advisable .
Snail permute from itertools import permutations , groupby def next_permutation ( xs ) : " " " Calculate the next permutation of the sequence xs .
Returns a pair ( yn , xs ' ) , where yn is a boolean and xs ' is the next permutation .
If yn is True , xs ' will be the lexicographic next permutation of xs , otherwise xs ' is the lexicographic smallest permutation of xs. " " " xs = tuple ( xs ) if not xs : return False , xs else : ps = [ p for p , gp in groupby ( sorted ( permutations ( xs ) ) ) ] np = len ( ps ) ix = ps.index ( xs ) + 1 if ix == len ( ps ) : return False , ps [ 0 ] else : return True , ps[ix ]
As it happens , a solution based on this exhaustive search would score points in the code jam since it copes with the small input set .
For the large input set its factorial complexity rules it out , and we ’d need to implement the next permutation algorithm from scratch .
[ 1 ] : A more cunning solution avoids the special case by pushing the extra zero to head of the string before applying next_permutation , then popping it if it has n’t been moved .

Human mysteries
The first specimen of Paranthropus boisei , also called Nutcracker Man , was reported by Mary and Louis Leakey in 1959 from a site in Olduvai Gorge , Tanzania .

Humans are unique among life on this planet , and much remains a mystery as to how we evolved .
What steps came first ?
Why did we evolve this way and not that direction ?
Why are we the only human species left ?
What other paths might we have gone down in our evolution ?
And what directions might we go from here ?
Why did we grow large brains ?
Image of the brain .
( Image credit : Dreamstime . )
There is no question that our large brains have provided humans an extraordinary advantage in the world .
Still , the human brain is an incredibly expensive organ , taking up only about 2 percent of the body 's mass yet using more than a fifth of the body 's energy , and until about 2 million years ago none of our ancestors had a brain larger than an ape 's when compared to body size .
So what kicked off the push for a larger brain ?
One possibility is that increased smarts helped our ancestors make better tools .
Another is that larger brains helped us interact better with each other .
Perhaps radical changes in the environment also demanded that our ancestors deal with a shifting world .
Why do humans walk on two legs ?
Our ancestors evolved an upright posture well before our large brains or stone tools even appeared .
The question , then :
Why stand and walk on two legs when our ape cousins get by on four limbs ?
Walking as bipeds might actually use less energy than movement on all fours does .
Freeing up the arms might also have enabled our ancestors to carry more food .
Standing upright might even have helped them control their temperature better by reducing the amount of skin directly exposed to the sun .
What happened to our hair ?

Humans are unique for looking naked compared to our hairier ape cousins .
So why did this nakedness evolve ?
One suggestion is that our ancestors shed hairiness to keep cool when venturing across the hot savannahs of Africa .
Another is that losing our fur coats helped free us parasite infestations and the diseases they can spread .
One unorthodox idea even suggests human nakedness developed after our ancestors briefly adapted for a streamlined life in the water , although most aquatic mammals of roughly human size actually possess dense fur .
Why did our closest relatives go extinct ?
A Neanderthal Family .
( Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech )
Roughly 24,000 years ago , our species , Homo sapiens , was not alone in the world — our closest relatives , the Neanderthals , ( Homo neanderthalensis ) were still alive .
The so - called ' hobbit ' found in Indonesia might also have been a member of the genus Homo , and it apparently survived until as recently as 12,000 years ago .
So why did they die and we survive ?
Did infections or radical shifts in their environments kill them off ?
Or did our species do away with them ?
Some evidence exists for both scenarios , but no conclusion is agreed upon .
Is human evolution accelerating ?
Analyses of a partial skeleton of a female Ardipithecus ramidus nicknamed Ardi , suggest the early human would have stood at just under 4 feet ( 1.2 meters ) tall with both primitive traits , such as a small brains size similar to living chimpanzees and those shared with later hominids , such as bipedal posture .

Recent evidence suggests that humanity is not only still evolving , but that human evolution is actually accelerating , speeding up to 100 times historical levels after agriculture spread .
A number of scientists challenge the strength of this evidence , saying that it remains difficult to ascertain whether or not certain genes really have recently grown in prominence because they offer some adaptive benefit .
Still , if human evolution is accelerating , the question becomes why ?
Diet and diseases may be some of the pressures that caused humans to change .
What is the hobbit ?
Homo floresiensis ( Image credit : National Geographic Society / Peter Schouten )
Is the ' hobbit ' — the nickname given to diminutive skeletons found on the Indonesian isle of Flores in 2003 — in fact an extinct human species , enough to be called Homo floresiensis ?
Are these skeletons just examples of deformed Homo sapiens ?
Are they a different species than us , but perhaps not an extinct human species and instead as separate as chimpanzees are ?
Solving this mystery could help shed light on the radical paths human evolution may have taken .
Why did modern humanity expand past Africa about 50,000 years ago ?

Roughly 50,000 years ago , modern humans expanded out of Africa , spreading rapidly across most of the world 's lands to colonize all continents except Antarctica , reaching even the most remote Pacific islands .
A number of scientists conjecture this migration was linked with a mutation that transformed our brains , leading to our modern , complex use of language and enabling more sophisticated tools , art and societies .
The more popular view suggests hints of such modern behavior existed long before this exodus , and that humanity instead had crossed a threshold in terms of population size in Africa that made such a revolution possible .
Did we have sex with Neanderthals ?
Some Neanderthals may have had pale skin and red hair similar to that of some modern humans .

Did we interbreed ?
Does our species possess any genes leftover from our extinct cousins ?
Scientists have suggested that perhaps the Neanderthals did not die out , but instead were absorbed into modern humanity .
Who was the first hominid ?
Analyses of a partial skeleton of a female Ardipithecus ramidus nicknamed Ardi , suggest the early human would have stood at just under 4 feet ( 1.2 meters ) tall with both primitive traits , such as a small brains size similar to living chimpanzees and those shared with later hominids , such as bipedal posture .

Scientists are uncovering more and more ancient hominids all the time — here meaning bipeds including humans , our direct ancestors and closest relatives .
They strive to find the earliest one , to help answer that most fundamental question in human evolution — what adaptations made us human , and in what order did they happen ?
Where do modern humans come from ?

The most bitterly debated question in the discipline of human evolution is likely over where modern humans evolved .
The out - of - Africa hypothesis maintains that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa and then spread around the world , replacing existing populations of archaic humans .
The multiregional hypothesis contends that modern humans evolved over a broad area from archaic humans , with populations in different regions mating with their neighbors to share traits , resulting in the evolution of modern humans .
The out - of - Africa hypothesis currently holds the lead , but proponents of the multiregional hypothesis remain strong in their views .
OTTAWA – The federal government is formally inviting offers as it seeks to privatize the nuclear reactor division of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd .
In announcing the request for " investor proposals , " Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt said the goal is to boost AECL 's global presence while reducing the financial risk carried by taxpayers .
The research - and - technology division of the Crown corporation , including the Chalk River laboratories and its troubled medical isotope production , are not part of the government sale .
A National Bank study commissioned by the Conservative government determined there is " significant private sector interest " in a stand - alone CANDU reactor business .
However the government may have undercut its own bargaining position when Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's chief spokesman described AECL as a " dysfunctional " $ 30 - billion " sink - hole " last June .
That same month , the Ontario government put off a decision on new reactor construction after deciding all the bids – including one for an untried , next - generation AECL reactor – were too costly .
A surprise in my morning e-mail : an article by my friend and colleague , Fr. Wilson Miscamble , CSC , criticizing his own academic department —
History , where Miscamble is one of my predecessors as chair — and our own university , Notre Dame , for not hiring a sufficient number of Catholic faculty .
The article , “ The Faculty ‘ Problem , ’ ” subsequently appeared in America ’s September 10 Education Issue .
It was soon zipping around the Web , and even got noticed on this magazine ’s blog .
On first glance , the accusation that Notre Dame is not Catholic enough strikes most people as odd .
I graduated from Notre Dame in 1986 and returned as a faculty member a decade ago out of sympathy with the university ’s effort to at once work toward academic excellence and sustain a serious commitment to Catholic intellectual life .
I ’ve found the place even better than advertised .
But apparently not everyone agrees , and beneath Miscamble ’s manifesto lie two important issues .
The first is numbers .
As Miscamble knows , more than any other Catholic university during the past thirty years , Notre Dame has made a serious and concerted effort to recruit Catholic faculty .
The percentage of Catholic faculty at Notre Dame is indeed decreasing , but primarily because most faculty members who retire are Catholic .
This past year more than 50 percent of the faculty hired were Catholic .
That our students need the witness of Catholic intellectuals attempting to live out faith commitments in the modern world is true .
That the academic job market if left unchecked will simply replicate at Notre Dame the faculty of other universities of its rank is undeniable .
Miscamble is right to remind Notre Dame , and other Catholic universities , of this fact .
Unfortunately his rush to paint the glass as more than half empty means Miscamble must avoid facts less congenial to his thesis .
Though he retails partial versions of old faculty squabbles about appointments , he neglects to mention the superb Catholic scholars who have joined the Department of History in recent years , including tenured faculty from Stanford and Michigan , a story that also holds true in other departments in the university .
Nothing about this recruitment , I must emphasize , is simple .
Miscamble cites a study from the 1960s and his own apparently heartfelt conviction that “ Catholic scholars there are aplenty . ”
Well , no .
The best data on religious affiliation among faculty at the top fifty research universities — a 2006 study conducted by Harvard ’s Neil Gross and George Mason ’s Solomon Simmons — suggests that only 6 percent of tenure - track scholars in the arts and sciences or business self - identify as Catholic .
( The figure is slightly higher at lesser ranked universities .
The authors excluded law schools and medical schools from their survey , where , historically , greater numbers of Catholics have obtained faculty positions . )
Add this to other challenges — notably two - career couples reluctant to relocate to a small city such as South Bend , a problem disproportionately affecting women faculty — and one might applaud Notre Dame for doing so well at Catholic recruitment instead of bemoaning what Miscamble terms a “ Catholic façade . ”
Framing the problem simply as recruiting Catholic faculty is also ungenerous .
Conspicuously absent from Miscamble ’s essay are other faculty — Protestants , Muslims , Jews , unbelievers - enthusiastic about the university ’s mission .
The History department recently hired Mark Noll , a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and perhaps the nation ’s leading evangelical intellectual .
( It has long been the home of George Marsden , another evangelical and the Bancroft Prize–winning biographer of Jonathan Edwards . )
On Miscamble ’s abacus they do not count .
But they make Notre Dame not just a better university but a better Catholic university .
Failing to recognize the complexity of this task — recruiting Catholic faculty , yes , but also attracting scholars from all backgrounds sympathetic to Notre Dame ’s mission — diminishes the chance that the church will benefit from the first - rate scholarship it needs .
The hope — and in many departments the reality — that Notre Dame might capitalize on its distinctive identity to make a contribution to issues of concern to scholars around the world would also wither .
Our graduate students — not mentioned by Miscamble but deserving ( and now receiving ) top - notch professional training — would apply for their own academic positions and fellowships with trepidation instead of confidence .
Miscamble ’s preoccupation with the numbers also comes at the expense of ideas .
Surely one responsibility of the faculty at a Catholic university is to cultivate possible areas of expertise that resonate with the long , rich heritage of Catholic Christianity .
This is not a confessional task .
An appealing dimension of intellectual life at Notre Dame is that scholars from all backgrounds introduce our students to a range of subjects and areas not studied in such depth at other universities .
We are strong in medieval philosophy .
Sacred music is thriving as is the sociology of religion and political theory .
In History this means scholars disproportionately focus on the history of medieval Europe and Latin America as well as on environmental thought and the religious history of Modern Europe and the United States .
What does this look like in practice ?
Our history majors and other students learn about medieval religious life from John Van Engen , author of a forthcoming book on the late medieval Devotio Moderna , the Dutch movement that produced Thomas à Kempis ; they learn about Christians , Jews , and Muslims in medieval Spain from one of that subject ’s most distinguished students , Oliva Remie Constable ; they study the abolition of slavery with Tom Slaughter , author of a forthcoming book on the important Quaker abolitionist John Woolman ; they ponder the cross-confessional dimensions of the Reformation with Brad Gregory , author of a prize - winning book on martyrdom in early Modern Europe ; they learn about the Catholic evangelization of Latin America with Sabine MacCormack , a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ; they study world fundamentalism with R. Scott Appleby , editor of the standard overview on the subject ; they probe the history of early Islam with Paul Cobb , now working on an Oxford history of the Crusades and their impact on the Muslim world ; they learn about modern European religious history from Tom Kselman , a specialist on France , and Alex Martin , a specialist on Russia , and about the interplay of religion and science in Britain from Chris Hamlin ; they think about the Renaissance with Margaret Meserve , editor of the Harvard edition of Pope Pius II ’s commentaries .
I could easily go on .
Is this scholarship and this teaching a decline from past glories ?
Hardly .
Instead , these areas of special focus within the department , along with the many other historical subjects we study and teach , constitute a serious historical education .
It is an education built upon the university ’s Catholic identity , not a repudiation of it .
Is n’t this the goal of a truly Catholic university ?
I know Miscamble ’s desire to reform Catholic higher education is sincere .
But I am also struck by how detached from the needs of Catholic students his reform proposals are .
Catholic college leaders often talk about forming undergraduates , and so they should .
( Miscamble himself has been an excellent mentor to many students over the years . )
Campus ministers attempt to nurture the spiritual lives of students grappling with existential questions and decisions about their life trajectory .
Social - service centers inculcate a sense of responsibility for the poor as gospel obligation , not noblesse oblige .
But students need intellectual formation too .
We ca n’t guarantee faith .
But we can help students learn .
And a test of a serious Catholic university is whether we can cultivate the intellectual abilities of our Catholic students so that they become thoughtful , reflective Catholic adults .
Most of this is the ordinary hard work of teaching students to write , paint , measure , build , experiment , and think .
Some of it is more specific : some students at Notre Dame enter the university unable to locate a Bible passage , much less identify Augustine .
They do n’t know that Thomas Aquinas immersed himself in Islamic texts , or that the work of Japanese novelist Shusaku Endo is inseparable from his Catholicism .
They are unaware that American Catholics are not a majority in American society , or that American Catholics are a tiny percentage of Catholics in a global church .
Here , oddly enough , lies an opportunity that all of us concerned with Catholic education should seize .
As institutions that take religion and matters of ultimate concern seriously , in an academic world often content to bracket these subjects as mere matters of opinion , Catholic universities can contribute to the wider world of learning in unusual ways .
At the same time , they can attempt to nurture the future leaders that our church , and for that matter our society , so desperately need .

The REAL king of the jungle
Here 's a jungle trial the pampered celebs on I'm A Celebrity . . .
Get Me Out Of
Here might want to try .
Leave Ant and Dec behind and go to one of the most remote locations on earth , somewhere it would take a rescue team a good week to reach you - should you be able to contact them .
Then smash your satnav and throw away all your food apart from 2lb of salt .
Now walk for two months , surviving on no more than your wits and what you can forage from the dried - out land and parched riverbeds .
No takers ?
Thought not .
While the Z- listers of I 'm A Celeb have been whining away in their cosy jungle camp , protected from the sun and rain by canopies the cameras do not show - with a medic nearby should one of the poor darlings break a fingernail - one man has been doing it for real .
Bushtucker trial : Ed Stafford has spent two years in the Amazon
He has n't been in a national park like the celebs , but in the Amazon - the land of the pit viper and the jaguar , the narco - terrorist and the piranha .
There , the bush tucker is you .
Former British Army captain Ed Stafford , 33 , is well on the way to becoming the first man in history to walk from the source of the Amazon in the mountains of Peru to its mouth in Brazil .
And he's not doing it in the hope of achieving notoriety , nor is he being paid handsomely for his efforts .
No , he 's doing it out of a sense of adventure - for the sheer derring - do .
He is 612 days in - and looking to finish next August .
If he achieves his aim , it will be a stupendous achievement , right up there with Hillary 's ascent of Everest and the conquerors of the poles .
The challenges he faces are monumental .
So monumental , in fact , that Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes has written to Ed to warn him that the stage in front of him - the deep Brazilian jungle - will be ' difficult ' .
You can take it that this is something of an understatement , given that it comes from a man who once sawed off his own fingers after they became frostbitten .
Ironically - for someone taking on such a serious expedition - Ed 's nickname would not be out of place on I'm A Celebrity .
In the Army he was known as ' Spice Girl ' , a moniker earned when he attended the officers ' mess one day in a pair of jeans that were considered ' too trendy ' .
Putting your foot in it :
Ed makes his way through the jungle
He does n't look much like a Spice Girl .
In fact , he looks pretty much as you 'd expect - nay , hope - him to be : 6ft 1in , lean as a whippet and with a look of dogged determination in his eye .
The sort that made the Zulus think twice at Rorke 's Drift .
His average day would kill most people .
Up at dawn , he walks for around eight hours , until 3 pm .
At this stage of the journey he will be lucky to have covered 7 km in that time .
This is jungle , real jungle - and you pay for every step with willsapping swings of the machete .
It 's like clearing the thickest hedge you could imagine for a whole working day .
Only this hedge is filled with razor grass - which is pretty much as the name implies , grass that will cut exposed flesh to ribbons - huge thorns and spines on trees sharp enough to go straight through a carelessly placed hand , deadly snakes , poisonous
spiders and foot - long centipedes so venomous that they can blister your skin with a touch .
Oh , and the odd man-eating big cat .
Specifically , jaguars .
It 's 40 degrees in the shade , 100 per cent humidity - and water is scarce because this is the dry season .
In some places , it 's impossible to walk close to the river - and he might be a jungle mile inland .
If he 's lucky , he will find a stream or plants he can cut to drink from .
If not , he goes thirsty .
Once he makes camp , he gathers firewood and - if there 's water - he washes .
Sometimes he might catch a few spiny piranhas to eat .
But if he does n't , he goes hungry .
If you offered him one of the celebs ' witchetty grubs , he 'd regard it as a rare treat .
Has he been near death ?
Regularly .
Sometimes daily .
Only last week he was cutting his way through the jungle when he saw a movement .
It was a deadly pit viper , ready to strike .
Ed backed off .
Luckily , so did the snake .
At dusk , he climbs into a hammock surrounded by mosquito nets .
It 's a sanctuary where he can read , write and try to sleep , although he 's compelled to take sleeping pills , despite his exhaustion ; the deafening noise of the jungle , the buzzing insects and the cries of monkeys , birds and animals - as well as the sauna - like temperatures - mean he would have no hope of rest otherwise .
Sir Ranulph Fiennes has written to Ed warning him that the quest in front of him will be ' difficult '
Should he want to go to the loo at night , then he can tread only in the immediate area of his tiny camp .
When the sun goes down , the jungle teems with deadly poisonous snakes .
He has lived like this day after day , night after night , for nearly two years .
And it will continue for at least another eight months .
I have a great appreciation of what Ed is facing , as last year I met him for part of his walk through the Peruvian stretch of the jungle .
In my time with him I was nearly swept away by a raging river , caught an all - over rash that made me look as though I 'd been grilled , had one pair of shoes disintegrate on my feet , narrowly avoided being bitten by a snake , even more narrowly avoided sitting on a Poison Dart Frog , got lost , was accused by suspicious locals of trying to steal children 's eyes and , oh yes , was taken hostage by 20 shotgunwielding villagers .
I also reached the point of physical collapse and my left knee has never been the same since .
How long was I with Ed in the jungle ?
Three days .
And that was the easy bit .
He and his guides are the fittest men I 've ever met .
I thought I was no slouch until I walked with them .
I exercise hard three times a week and walk an average of 15 miles on a Saturday with the dog on the Sussex Downs .
But it 's no preparation at all .
By the end of a 12 - hour slog on my third day , I was literally screaming in pain as we drove ourselves forward on a logging track of sucking mud to make a village before nightfall .
That was when we were taken prisoner .
We 'd come into a large village , but the guides went in first and came out to warn us that the chief was drunk .
He is already starving and expects to starve more
We had no other options , so we went in anyway .
The chief 's reception was far from welcoming and he threatened to throw us into the jungle in nothing more than the clothes we stood up in .
Which was when the armed men appeared .
At the end of the hardest exercise I 'd ever done in my life - 12 hours of crawling , climbing and chasing through the sodden jungle - here I was bargaining in my appalling Spanish for my life .
Or rather , Ed was bargaining for me - in his rather better version of the language .
After a lot of discussion , we were marched to a shack and told not to move .
Our fate would be decided by morning .
Luckily , Ed took control of the situation and approached the gunmen with some packets of cigarettes .
After 20 minutes chatting to him - without the benefit of the chief 's intervention - they were laughing and joking like old friends .
Ed then explained how sometimes the locals put on an act of aggression as a bargaining position to get money out of you .
How do you know when they 're serious , though ?
' You do n't , ' he said with a shrug .
He obviously made some impression because the next morning the chief made himself scarce while the rest of the village waved us away .
Ed seems a natural - born leader - and the guides told me they thought he was a very tough guy .
That , from people raised in unimaginable poverty , who face more challenges in a day than most of us do in a lifetime , is some compliment .
One of them has stayed with him all the way from Peru into Brazil - and is still travelling with him now .
Every day brings a new challenge .
In the next ' difficult ' bit , Ed explains , there will be no villagers to negotiate with , no gunmen to talk round , but water is a constant problem - either too little of it or , when the rains come , too much .
Waterhole :
Ed re-filling his water bottle from a muddy puddle
Food ?
He has £ 4 to his name after his recession - hit sponsors withdrew .
When he reaches a town , he can't afford provisions to take with him into the jungle .
He is already starving and expects to starve more .
He was 14st 7lb when he started .
The last time he weighed himself in a jungle town he had lost two stone - but he knows he has lost more since then .
His satnav is broken and even if he had enough money for guides , he would n't be able to get them anyway for this section of his expedition .
The locals are too scared of jaguars
to go into the jungle .
The big cats find pickings lean in the dry season and a juicy explorer would be a welcome addition to their diet .
Ed is , of course , unarmed .
A gun might give protection from the wildlife , but it would guarantee hostility from the people .
' I am scared of the next part , ' he tells me via satellite link .
' We 've already been on the point of collapse through malnutrition and dehydration - - and it looks like we 're in for much more of the same . '
When Ed says he 's scared , you know its something worth being scared about .
After all , this is someone who has worked as a security consultant in Afghanistan , where he was once detailed to guard a polling station .
Unfortunately , the militia were n't too keen on the election taking place and the station was overrun by 500 screaming tribesmen firing assault rifles into the air .
' It 's good to stand in the long line of British nutters '
Ed Stafford
Ed had to barricade himself and his men in a storeroom while the place was ransacked .
He described that as ' a bit of a laugh ' , so you can imagine that it takes quite a bit to frighten him .
Is the jungle as hard as Afghanistan ?
Totally different , he says .
' Afghanistan gave me nightmares for weeks afterwards .
The jungle I love .
Still , recently I 've had nightmares about the bombs going off again .
It 's my default position when I get tired . '
He admits , too , that the mental demands are taking their toll .
Two years ' dependency on Nytol sleeping pills is n't doing his body any good - and the sheer length of the trip would test anyone 's resolve .
When the rainy season finally arrives , he will be pushed inland , as
the river floods to miles wide .
He will come into contact with remote tribes who are living the same way they did when Portuguese colonists arrived .
In Peru he encountered people who had never seen a white man .
Here he may meet those who have never even heard of one .
It 's Ed and his guide with that bag of salt ( for preserving fish ) versus the most hostile territory on earth .
His only back - up is his friends and family .
His mother is looking to sell her house to support him .
That 's how much she believes in what he 's doing .
The trip is a pure challenge .
There 's no artificial degree of difficulty to it ; he 's not trying to be the first man up Everest in a gorilla suit playing a banjo - he 's trying to walk the Amazon , the cauldron of heat , disease and hostility .
It 's something that would have appealed to the Victorians in the great age of British exploration ; if Ed comes out alive he will deserve a place alongside Scott , Livingstone and Shackleton - something he 's very proud of .
' It 's good to stand in the long and distinguished line of British nutters who think its clever to put themselves through hell to achieve something that no one else ever has , ' he says .
Will he succeed ?
Probably .
After all , he 's proved that running out of funds wo n't stop him , and physical hardship wo n't beat him .
If the Amazon wants to remain unconquered then it's going to have to kill Ed Stafford first - something it seems more than prepared to try .

When Sharon Sakson was laid off recently from her job as a television writer and producer , she burned through her savings to pay the $ 2,400 monthly mortgage on her home .
But she soon decided it did n't make sense :
Her home was worth thousands less than the mortgage she carried on it .
The home had been appraised at $ 390,000 when she refinanced in 2006 , but she estimates it 's not worth the $ 320,000 it initially cost in 2004 .
So Sakson did what a growing number of homeowners are doing today :
She stopped paying and decided to let the bank take her home .
INTERACTIVE MAP : Foreclosures state - by - state TRANSCRIPT : Housing counselor answered your foreclosure questions " I 'm walking away from my house , " says Sakson , 57 , who stopped making payments about six months ago on her home in Pennington , N.J. " The bank can have it . "
What Sakson did is called a strategic default , or a voluntary foreclosure , and it's fast becoming a major challenge to the government 's $ 75 billion effort to keep distressed borrowers in their homes .
Walking away from a mortgage is serious business — it can knock 100 points off your credit score and make you ineligible for a new mortgage for seven years .
Yet , about 588,000 borrowers walked away from homes last year , double the number in 2007 , according to a recent study by credit - scoring firm Experian and management consultants Oliver Wyman .
While home prices are rising , the increases pale compared with overall drops in home prices since 2005 that threaten to push millions more homeowners into Sakson 's predicament , owing more than their homes are worth and seeing little chance of rebuilding equity soon .
More will walk away , which will hamper the housing recovery , reinforce lenders ' tight credit policies and drag on the economy 's recovery , economists say .
" It 's increasingly a more important factor driving the foreclosure crisis , " says Mark Zandi , of Moody's Economy.com .
" As we move forward , the job market will stabilize , and the big thing will be strategic defaults .
People are going to determine it does n't make financial sense to hold on to their homes .
That 's going to be a significant problem .
Strategic defaults mean foreclosures could be high for a long time . "
It 's not just economists who are concerned about strategic defaults .
The mortgage unit of Citigroup says one in five borrowers who defaults does so willingly , even though they 're able to pay the mortgage .
" It 's a very large number , and it 's a very , very significant risk to the housing recovery , " says Sanjiv Das , CEO of CitiMortgage , adding that new government programs to curb strategic defaults may be needed .
Waiting for prices to stabilize
How bad the strategic defaults issue gets may depend on how much more home prices fall and whether the government does more to help homeowners with mortgages larger than their homes ' value .
Both Zandi and Das suggest further actions to reduce mortgage principal for underwater borrowers .
" A better way to do it may be an incentive to stay current for a period , and after two years of being current , they get a principal reduction , " says Das .
Under the government 's Making Homes Affordable Program , borrowers are ineligible for refinancings if their unpaid mortgages are more than 125 % of the home 's market value .
Loan modifications under the program do not have any loan - to - value limits .
Nationally , median prices have fallen about 25 % from their peak in late 2005 , although prices recently have risen compared with prior months this year .
The median price in the second quarter — $ 170,000 — was at roughly the level it was in autumn 2003 .
But price declines have been worse in some markets .
A closely watched barometer of home prices , the Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller 20 - City Composite Index , shows they have fallen more than 25 % in 12 markets and more than 50 % in two — Phoenix and Las Vegas — from peaks hit in 2006 or 2007 .
Fifteen out of the 20 metro areas saw a rise in prices from July to August , but those increases are not anywhere close to the losses that have already occurred .
The number of borrowers who walk away is expected to increase , along with the rise in homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth .
An unprecedented 16 million homeowners currently are underwater , according to Moody's Economy.com .
That 's about a third of all homeowners with a first mortgage .
Moody 's Economy.com estimates the number of underwater borrowers will peak at 17.4 million in the third quarter of 2010 .
An even higher estimate comes from Deutsche Bank , which predicted in an August study that the number of homeowners underwater will grow from 14 million ( or 27 % of all homeowners with mortgages ) in 2009 to 25 million homeowners , or 48 % of all those with a mortgage , by the time home prices stabilize .
Not coincidentally , strategic defaults have been highest where prices have plunged most , such as California and Florida .
From 2005 to 2008 , the number of strategic defaulters went up by 68 times in California , according to the Experian - Oliver Wyman study published in September .
During that same time period , the median price for existing , single - family homes in California fell from $ 522,670 in 2005 to $ 346,410 , according to the California Association of Realtors .
In other geographic regions , the increase in strategic defaulters ranged between 3 times and 18 times more .
The Experian - Wyman study found borrowers with higher credit scores when they applied for their loan were 50 % more likely than other types of borrowers to walk away from a mortgage only because they were underwater , even though they could afford to pay .
The study was based on an analysis of about 12 million borrowers .
No household would default if the equity shortfall is less than 10 % of the value of the house , according to another study this year , done by the University of Chicago , Northwestern University and the European University Institute .
But 17 % of households would default , even if they could afford to pay their mortgage , when the equity shortfall reaches 50 % of the value of their house .
That means the market value of a mortgage property is that much below the amount of loan taken against it .
There also appears to be a contagion effect .
Borrowers who know someone who defaulted are 82 % more likely to declare their intention to do so .
Growing acceptance " The most disturbing aspect of this is that it 's becoming acceptable to do , " says Joel Naroff , an economist with Naroff Economic Advisors .
" What does that mean down the road for housing and the economy if people are happy to walk away and destroy their credit ?
They 're saying , ' Why pay a high amount if they can get something , even a rental , for less ? ' "
Because of the time and expense involved in completing a foreclosure , borrowers who decide to walk away often wind up staying in their homes for months after they stop paying their mortgage .
In most states , lenders can go after homeowners for past - due payments , but many fail to take such action when borrowers abandon their properties , because the legal costs are so high .
Short sales , in which lenders agree to the sale of a home for less than the balance of the mortgage , is an alternative to a strategic default .
Many lenders are now encouraging them , but Zandi says that alternative may seem too time - consuming for borrowers who want to quickly get out from under their homes .
Janet Speer , 51 , is n't happy to be walking away from her 200 - year - old home in Royersford , Pa. , but she does n't feel ashamed .
Speer says she was paying about $ 1,400 a month for her home , which was appraised at about $ 155,000 .
After getting laid off last year , Speer said , she tried to modify her mortgage to more affordable terms but was denied because her unemployment benefits and alimony did n't count as income .
Speer stopped paying on her mortgage in September 2008 .
She is still living in the home and waiting to be foreclosed upon .
Speer is saving her unemployment benefits for an apartment once the bank takes over her home .
" I got letters and calls from the bank at first , but they stopped , " said Speer , who now earns commission income from a job in the health care industry .
" I have a three - story house .
It 's way too big .
I just want a little two - bedroom apartment .
I do n't want this place anymore .
I would never have chosen to do this , but it 's going to work out . "

President Barack Obama today declared his intent to take on Wall Street by announcing plans for stringent rules on the banking sector that prompted comparisons with the draconian regulations introduced after the Great Depression .
In the boldest move taken by any government around the world to respond to the financial crisis , Obama told banks they would no longer be able to take risky bets with their own capital to make money on the financial markets .
Banks which take deposits will not be allowed to use their own money to take bets on markets , run hedge funds or make private equity investments through what he called the " Volcker rule " after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker .
He also wants to prevent further consolidation of the financial system in the US and will ban takeovers and mergers among American firms in the sector .
Obama said the new proposals would keep taxpayers from being " held hostage " by banks that have become " too big to fail " and that pose a risk to the entire financial system .
Wall Street was nervous ahead of the announcement , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 160 points before he spoke and then falling a further 40 points once he had finished .
The FTSE 100 index in London fell sharply in afternoon trading as the markets feared the impact on UK banks such as Barclays and RBS .
" We simply cannot return to business as usual , " said Obama .
His words were immediately interpreted as a Glass - Steagall Act for the 21st century , in reference to the legislation introduced in 1933 that prevented commercial banks which took deposits from customers from carrying on investment banking activities .
Fresh from the historic loss of a Democratic senate seat in the Kennedy - stalwart state of Massachusetts this week , Obama 's assault on Wall Street followed the release of near - record profits from Goldman Sachs and bonus average pay for its 32,000 staff of $ 500,000 .
Obama made it clear that he was appealing to the electorate .
" Over the past two years more than 7 m Americans have lost their jobs ; rarely does a day go by that I have n't heard from folks who are hurting , " he said .
" Even as we dig our way out this deep hole it is important we do not lose sight of what got us in this hole in the first place , " Obama said , referring to the taxpayer bailout of Wall Street in October 2008 .
" While the financial system is far stronger today than it was one year ago , it is still operating under the exact same rules that led to its near collapse . "
Goldman , the most closely watched bank on Wall Street , insisted it was showing " restraint " in its bonus payouts by demanding its 400 partners donate a combined $ 500 m to its charity , Goldman Sachs Gives , and reducing the proportion of revenue allocated to pay from 48 % in 2008 to 35.8 % in 2009 – the lowest on record .
The 141 - year - old New York - based bank has been pilloried as the exemplar of banking pay excess .
Its London - based employees will be subjected to the chancellor 's 50 % special tax on bonuses of more than £ 25,000 and expects to a receive a contribute " hundreds of thousands of dollars " to the UK exchequer .
Goldman has pushed back against criticism although its chief executive Lloyd Blankfein was recently lambasted for claaimed that his employees were doing " God 's work " .
Lord Oakeshott , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman said : " It 's restraint , but to everyone else it 's gross greed .
they are on a different planet . "
Shares in Goldman were hit hard by Obama 's announcement , falling 5 % .
Obama has already tried to show Main Street that he is trying to restrain Wall Street through the " financial crisis responsibility fee " he announced last week to bring in $ 90bn over 10 years into the US coffers .
An EU proposal to tax banks in Europe also gained ground yesterday when a Swedish proposal to introduce a levy on profits was backed by Spanish finance minister Elena Salgado , whose country currently holds the EU presidency .
Salgado said the tax , which will be set aside in a stability fund , will be examined at an informal gathering of European finance ministers in Madrid .
The meeting in April could endorse the tax , which Sweden believes could raise £ 7bn , before going forward to the Commission .
Ben Roethlisberger has a bad headache .
Charlie Batch has a bad wrist .
Troy Polamalu is still gimpy .
Welcome to the other side of the spectrum Steeler fans , it ’s called bad luck , and you did n’t have too much of it last season .
Losing to Kansas City in Week 11 and dropping to 6 - 4 is only part of the problem .
Yeah , I know , you get to play the Browns again .
Can Dennis Dixon solve all of your problems ?
uh , no .
Dixon ( pictured while getting hurt at Oregon ) is an athlete who probably did n’t work much with the first unit at practice .
The way it was drawn up , if Ben got hurt , Charlie would put his cape on and fly in to save the day .
I do n’t know if Dixon will even play .
Ben is claiming he is fine , but with all of the chances the Chiefs had to sack him ( and could n’t ) how long will he last against the Ravens this weekend ?
The offensive line has struggled .
Last year the defense was bailing a subpar offense out almost every game .
This year , the shoe is on the other foot , as the Steelers have given up a return touchdown in an NFL record of eight straight games .
The Rooney ’s wo n’t stand for it , that ’s why Pittsburgh always rebounds .
However , the hourglass is running thin and even though Cincinnati only has a one game lead , they beat Pittsburgh twice to control a tiebreaker .
A new hope for those suffering from cancer has recently surfaced .
Scientists at Harvard University have developed an implant that may have just become the front runner in the long list of possible cancer treatments .
The miniature disk , only 8.5 millimeters in diameter , is filled with tumor - specific antigens and is placed under the skin in an attempt to reprogram the immune system .
This reprogramming helps the body ’s defenses recognize the cancer cells , which are n’t normally recognized as foreign .
This allows the immune system T cells a chance to then find and eliminate tumor cells .
Unlike other vaccines that also focus on creating an immune attack , this treatment does not need to remove cells in order to reprogram them .
This allows a much larger number of cells to survive , increasing effectiveness significantly .
Furthermore , this new treatment only targets the tumor cells .
This means that unlike chemotherapy , there is no damage done to healthy tissue .
Imagine a treatment that does n’t leave the patient sick and looking like they could die right then and there .
Instead , patients would be comfortable while being treated .
Also , many of the researchers are hoping that because no healthy tissue is damaged , the chances of relapse will reduce drastically .
Last week , Lord Christopher Monckton accused a group of young climate activists who invaded an Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) event where he was speaking of being “ Hitler Youth ” three times – twice caught on video ( see these two posts from last week ) and then at least twice on the Science and Public Policy Institute blog here and here ( and he denied making the claim at an Associated Press event over the weekend ) .
Clearly Monckton believes that the activists are behaving as the Nazis would .
Monckton is wrong .
Temporarily taking over a meeting , chanting , and disturbing the organizers and invited speaker ( Monckton ) is not what the Nazis would have done .
As someone who studied the history of Nazism and fascism in college , allow me to describe what would have happened during the meeting had it been invaded by the Nazis .
Just a warning – I ’m not going to go into gory detail , but I ’m not going to sugar coat this either , so some of what I describe below is unpleasant .
After talking to one of the activist organizers of the protest , only a few of the approximately 50 activists would have been in the Hitler Youth – most were adults ( over 18 ) , so they would have been in the Sturmabteilung ( SA , aka brownshirts ) , the Nazi party militia , or the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) state security organization instead of the Hitler Youth .
Furthermore , about a third were non-white , about half were non-Christian , and about half were women .
The SA was composed entirely of men , all white ( the few non-whites living in Germany at the time were outcasts and would n’t have been granted membership in the SA ) , and Christian .
The SS would have been even more restrictive .
But perhaps for the purposes of this example , we can assume that all 50 activists would have been SA or SS members .
The SA would n’t have come in wearing their day clothes – they would have been wearing brown shirts as part of a standard militia uniform that made them more terrifying .
They also would have had someone watching the event and not entered until after Monckton had started speaking , assuming that he was their target .
And when they entered , they would have been carrying weapons .
After they entered the meeting , the SA would probably have waited for someone to panic and try to run .
When that happened , the SA would have attacked everyone and everything in the room , using knives , truncheons , pipes , and fists .
Let ’s start with Monckton .
He probably would have been attacked with knives and / or truncheons and either stabbed and beaten to death outright or injured so severely that it would have taken a miracle for him to survive long enough to reach a hospital .
The AFP organizer probably would have been hauled out , thrown to the ground , and kicked and stomped literally senseless .
He might have died from his injuries , but not intentionally killed unless he ’d been a serious thorn to the SA in the past .
If he had been a bother to the SA in the past , then he ’d probably have had his skull crushed .
The other AFP members would have been beaten and driven out of the hotel bloodied and broken .
All would have needed medical attention , some might have died from their beatings or having been stabbed .
Those that recovered would have been injured badly enough that they might not have been able to walk again , or have lost the use of an arm , or have sustained brain damage , or have lost an eye , or been permanently deafened .
The attendees might have had a chance to escape , but even the ones that escaped would have been bloodied and might have broken limbs and serious cuts that would need medical attention .
Given that there appears to have been only five actual attendees , they all probably would have been as injured as the other AFP members mentioned above .
The SA would n’t have stopped there , however .
If they had today ’s technology available to them , the probably would have grabbed one of the cameras and filmed the entire thing themselves .
They also would have destroyed as much of the equipment they could get their hands on , throwing down lights , smashing cameras , and so on .
In the process , the would have turned the lights and cameras and microphone cords into impromptu weapons , bludgeoning AFP members , hotel staff , and attendees with the cameras , possibly choking others with cords , and smashing lights down on their targets ’ heads .
The SA would n’t have stopped there either .
They would have dragged the hotel manager and assistant managers out into the street and beat them senseless as well .
The probably would have been left alive , however , as a lesson to everyone who watched the beating .
In later years , when the SS was strong , this might have gone one step farther .
The SS might have shown up at the hotel owner ’s home after bed time , broken in , and efficiently killed everyone inside , leaving the bodies on the front lawn to be discovered by a family member , neighbor , or the regular police .
Now , you tell me – does what I just described sound at all like what happened at the AFP event ?
Monckton was allowed to continue talking .
The AFP organizer was permitted to continue talking .
The activists brought a sign ( that was torn away by an AFP member ) , not truncheons or knives .
The activists were of many ethnicities , religions , and wore regular clothing , not white Christians in uniforms .
There was no violence at all , in fact – no one was beaten , stabbed , choked , or bludgeoned .
Calling what the activists did “ fascist ” or “ Hitlerite ” or Nazis shows a marked ignorance of just how terrible the Nazis and fascists really were , both on the part of Lord Monckton and his defenders .

Hey there !
I 'm doing something different this week since I 'm out of town and most of you guys are busy doing non-internet things anyway .
I thought it would be fun to take a peek into the daily life of Sweet - Tits .
We may even find out her real name !
Anyway , regular QC resumes on January 3rd .
I hope you enjoy this diversion until then .
I 'm having a lot of fun writing and drawing it .
It ’s called ProFORMA , or Probabilistic Feature - based On-line Rapid Model Acquisition , but it is way cooler than it sounds .
The software , written by a team headed by Qi Pan , a student at the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University in England , turns a regular , cheap webcam into a 3D scanner .
Normally , scanning in 3D requires purpose - made gear and time .
ProFORMA lets you rotate any object in front of the camera and it scans it in real time , building a fully 3D texture mapped model as fast as you can turn an object .
Even more impressive is what happens after the scan :
The camera continues to track the objsct in space and matches it ’s movement instantly with the on - screen model .
Here ’s a video of it in action :
It works by generating a 3D point cloud from the image coming through the camera and then uses some clever math to both ignore the occasional occlusion of the model by a hand and to work out where the surfaces are .
Then things go over my head , involving a process called Delaunay tetrahedralisation to turn the 2D surfaces into a 3D model .
Like I said : clever math .
But imagine , for a second , the uses .
Forget Nintendo ’s Mii avatars , for instance .
Instead you could make a 3D version of yourself , or add your favorite household items into a game of Mario Kart .
You could quite possibly hook this rig up to a 3D printer and make fast facsimiles of almost anything .
And remember , this is all done using a single camera , just like the one that ’s probably staring from the top of your laptop screen as you read this .
I want to play with this right now .

Users could pay for upgrades to get 20 mb broadband speeds
The first phase of Swindon 's free public wireless internet has been switched on in the north of the town .
Swindon Borough Council plans for all 186,000 citizens to have blanket " wi- fi mesh " coverage by April 2010 .
The equipment , mounted on 21 lampposts in the Highworth area , will allow people to connect to the internet via laptops or portable devices .
Wireless internet allows computer users to access the internet without the need for wired connection to phone lines .
' Limited access '
Under the scheme basic line rental will be free and there will be no connection charge , say council officials .
Subscribers to the service - to be called Signal - will have limited access but could pay for 20 mb upgrades .
The £ 1 m project will be run by Digital City UK Ltd , in which Swindon Borough Council has a 35 % share .
Digital City chief executive Rikki Hunt said : " People have done free wi-fi before , it happened in Norwich in 2006 as a test period .
" What we 're doing is covering the whole borough , that 's what unique , so it 's not just free access in your home , you can actually move around the borough and still be connected . "
Some 1,400 secure access points are to be fitted around Swindon , similar to those used in homes but with a much higher performance , it is claimed .
Free phone calls
If successful , there is an intention of working on similar roll - outs of the technology in other towns and cities across the UK .
The service will also have the potential to provide free internet phone - calls and remote medical consultations .
Other UK cities have had trials of the schemes , but this is the first time an entire town area will be covered by council - backed public wi-fi .
Experts will be available to answer questions at an open forum in Highworth library on Wednesday between 1700 and 1900 GMT .

Facebook 's Privacy Settings : 5 Things You Should Know Facebook 's new privacy settings are drawing a mix of criticism and praise .
Dec. 12 , 2009  --
Facebook has begun rolling out its new privacy settings to all of its 350 million users .
If you have n't seen it already , you will soon have to go through a wizard that will guide you through the process of confirming your privacy settings .
The new settings are supposed to make it easier and simpler to control your information , but the changes are drawing a mix of criticism and praise from privacy watchdogs such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California ( ACLU ) , and the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) .
The new privacy controls include some great changes , and some not - so - great changes , but here are five privacy issues you should know about as these settings roll out across Facebook .
Search Settings
When I checked my search settings this morning , the option to index my profile by public search engines had been turned on .
This is despite the fact that I had explicitly turned off this setting when Facebook launched public search listings two years ago .
If you do n't want search engines like Google and Bing to index your profile , do yourself a favor and make sure those settings are still set the way you want them to be .
To adjust your search privacy settings click on Settings > Privacy Settings > Search .
If the " Allow indexing " box is checked then search engines will be able to index your information .
Password Protection Layer : Not So Good
Facebook has added a new layer of protection for changing your privacy settings .
Under the new policy you will have to enter your password whenever you want to change your privacy settings .
This is a smart move , and quite a common policy with other Web services .
But in my tests , this extra protection did not work very well at all .
Once I had chosen to exclude my Facebook profile from public search engines , I left my privacy settings page and returned to my profile ( your settings are saved automatically ) .
But when I went back to my privacy settings , the pages were wide open with no password requirement .
I tested this out on several browsers and operating systems , I also signed out and back in several times to see if that would change anything .
But each time I checked my security settings were wide open .
The password protection eventually came back after half an hour or so , but that was far too long .
The password requirement should come back automatically or Facebook should be telling you that this setting is set to time out .
Publicly Available Information ( PAI ) Changes
Facebook is also changing what it deems to be publicly available information ( PAI ) , with almost no recourse for the user to control this -- a change that does not sit well with the EFF .
Information under the PAI umbrella includes your profile picture , friends list ( Facebook says the view friends link has been removed from search results ) , fan pages , gender , geographic region , and networks ( school , work , etc. ) .
There is almost no recourse to protect any of this information .
To illustrate how important this setting could be , the EFF points out that you may belong to a fan page that supports or condemns gay marriage .
Since this is such a controversial issue , that may be a position you are not willing to share with co-workers , fellow church members , or other Facebook friends .
Friends List
Although your friends list is technically under the PAI umbrella , you can still control who sees it .
But controls for this information are found on your Facebook profile page -- not your privacy settings .
If you want to restrict who sees your friends list within Facebook , click on the pencil icon next to your Friends widget below your profile picture , and uncheck the box that says " Show my friends on my profile . "
Other information you can remove from your profile page includes your gender and current city .
Hyper Control
While Facebook is taking away some control over publicly available information , you are getting extreme control over other parts of your Facebook profile .
Now you can restrict who sees your shared content on a per-post basis .
Do n't want certain friends to see your latest update ?
No problem .
Need to keep those photos of you at the bar away from your co-workers ?
You can do that too .
Facebook 's New Privacy Settings Are a Mixed Bag
Facebook 's new privacy settings are a mixed bag of better and simpler controls over some information , while loosening the restrictions on others .
Of course , if you do n't want some of that information to appear , you can always delete it from Facebook ( you cannot delete your gender , but you can make it invisible ) .
Facebook 's privacy controls may not be perfect , but they will urge users to think even harder about what they 're sharing on Facebook , and ultimately that may be a good thing .
At the end of separate interviews on Hardball , Chris Matthews gives Howard Dean a chance to respond to Mary Landrieu 's statements and he comes at her hard for forcing everyone into private insurance by not allowing other choices in the bill .
I 'd call that a smack down for sure .
John Amato :
Sen .
Landrieu drones on and on about her blind love and devotion to the insurance industry that has been a nightmare for many Americans .
Why does she hate the idea that Americans deserve to have a choice about who they buy their health care from ?
Dean :
Mary , I 'd like to know why you deny my people of the choice to sign up for an alternative ?
You are forcing us in to insurance companies .
You took away our choice .
You would not let us choose another program .
You forced us into the insurance industry and we do n't want to be forced into the insurance industry and you took away our choice .
That is wrong .
Landrieu :
That is not true .
You never had that choice to begin with .
Dean :
The president campaigned on it , Mary ...
Landrieu : No , he did n't .
He did not campaign for a public option .
Dean : ... He most certainly did .
He absolutely did , you are not accurate .
He campaigned for a federal employee benefit with a public option .
That 's what he campaigned for .
Landrieu obviously never bothered to read the health care bill that President Obama ran on in the general election .
The public has always seen in Warren Buffett a different kind of capitalist , an honest observer providing sound financial advice regardless of his personal interests .
But is he ?
When it comes to his own holdings Buffett seems to use a carefully cultivated reputation for financial rectitude to feather his own nest .
On Wednesday he came out against Obama ’s proposed bank tax , but his comments were inconsistent .
On one hand he ’s always maintained banks needed to be bailed out , yet he opposes ways to make them pay for it .
At this point , financial giants in which Buffett has large stakes — Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and General Electric — all benefit from an implicit too - big - to - fail government insurance policy .
How can Mr. Buffett , an insurance executive , argue that it ’s inappropriate to charge them for it ?
This is just the latest example of Buffett talking his book .
Buffett also lobbied for and profited greatly from the bailouts .
He invested in Goldman , he said , with the expectation that Congress would “ do the right thing ” by passing the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
In other words , it was a bet on a bailout .
Later he mocked the stress test , which forced over - leveraged banks to raise needed capital .
This was bad for Buffett because it diluted his stakes in banks .
Less well - known is that Buffett was the first to propose a private - public partnership structure in order to rescue troubled banks .
In a letter to Hank Paulson in the fall of ’08 , cited in Andrew Ross Sorkin ’s recent book , Buffett pitched his idea for a “ public - private partnership fund ” that would use public debt to finance private bets on toxic assets .
When Tim Geithner rolled out a similar plan a few months later , it was widely panned as a giveaway to banks .
Buffett later complained about bailouts in his annual letter to Berkshire investors , saying that government subsidized funding put firms like Berkshire at a disadvantage .
He failed to note that public subsidies — in particular FDIC ’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program — helped to keep afloat the eight banks in which Berkshire had a stake .
From the end of ’08 through July of ’09 , 75 percent of the debt sold by these eight banks came with the explicit government guarantee offered by TLGP .
Without it , many might have failed , wiping out Berkshire ’s equity stake .
It takes chutzpah to lobby for bailouts , make trades seeking to profit from them , and then complain that those doing so put you at a disadvantage .
Those who follow him closely are well aware that he talks his own book , but the wider public still believes him to be a trustworthy broker of unbiased financial advice and commentary .
They should n’t .
Buffett did n’t respond to requests for comment .
Buddhists believe that people come back as other animals after death .
He said : " I know it is mummy .
She looks after me just the way she did .
I need to see her like other prisoners see their wives and children . "
I believe most of you have regular vases at home .
Today , we will presents you 9 very unique vases whose shape looks really NOT like a vase .
Some of them are just a design by a special designer ; some of them are real products which can be bought from market .
Hope everyone enjoy these vases , and you find the one you like .
1. Tilting Vase Tells You When it Needs Water [ link ]
Tilting Vase is an interesting and inteligent vase designed by David Sweeney , Jeff Virangkabutra and Michael Korn .
Now what is so special at this vase ?
When the vase is full , the vase stands upright but as water is taken up by the plant or evaporates it ?s center of gravity shifts and the vase begins to ? lie down ?.
Now you can speak to your plants , and make them look better by listening the message you get from the vase .
2. Luna Vase [ link ]
LUNA by Eero Sairanen is a sculpture / vase that revolutionizes the traditional concept of the vase .
Really creative and beautifully design
3. Hula Hoop Vase [ link ]
A series of stackable elements , that once stacked may be used to encompass an empty wine bottle .
The bottle thus becomes a one flower vase , providing it with a new guise and a new use .
The elements are different in shape and by rotating them or changing the order one can change the vase ’s appearance time and time again .
4. Polaroid Flower Vase [ link ]
Designer Jung Hwa Jin has created the Polaroid Flower Vase , a small planter that recalls the nostalgic form of polaroid , with the plant becoming the focus of the “ picture . ”
The planter is suspended with a clothespin on the end of a cord , with a small embedded lamp illuminating its subject .

I ended with this one , cause it ’s by far one of the craziest I ’ve seen .
A lot of people have talked to me over the last week about Wi -Fi ( open and closed , i.e. password - protected ) and the Digital Economy bill .
The more I try to find answers , the more ludicrous it becomes .
For instance , last week it turned out that a pub owner was allegedly fined £ 8,000 because someone downloaded copyright material over their open Wi -Fi system .
Would that get worse or better if the Digital Economy bill passes in its present form ?
To illustrate , I 'm going to pick my favourite example of a potentially worried wireless network provider : my mum .
She does n't understand or like the internet , refuses to even think about securing her Wi-Fi network .
What is her legal status ?
What will she say if / when she receives warnings under the Digital Economy bill because someone has used her open Wi-Fi to download infringing files ?
Well , the bill contemplates that warnings can be sent only to " subscribers " .
These include alleged infringers , and those who have " allowed " others to use their access to the internet to allegedly infringe .
That sounds a lot like it covers those who operate Wi -Fi networks ( and is meant to ) .
Later in the bill , however , a " subscriber " is defined as any person who " ( a ) receives the service under an agreement between the person and the provider of the service ; and ( b ) does not receive it as a communications provider " .
This leaves two avenues of defence for my mum .
One : she might say she was a " communications provider " and thus not a subscriber .
This is at least arguable under the Communications
Act 2003 definition of such , and might get her out of the bill ( hurrah ) .
But if my mum is not a poacher , is she a gamekeeper ?
If not a " subscriber " , is she an " internet access provider " ?
The definition in the bill is that an ISP is someone who provides an " internet access service " , itself defined as :
" an electronic communications service that ( a ) is provided to a subscriber ; ( b ) consists entirely or mainly of the provision of access to the internet ; ( c ) includes the allocation of an IP address or IP addresses to the subscriber to enable that access " .
My mum may fit these conditions .
( Does she " allocate " an IP address ?
Who knows ?
Certainly not my mum . )
But is there an " agreement " between her and an unknown Wi -Fi piggybacker ?
My mum 's Wi -Fi has no " I accept " box .
" Agreement " is defined nowhere in the bill .
But suppose my mum leaves her network unsecured due to ignorance – and the " subscriber "s laptop logs on to the nearest open Wi-Fi network automatically as he sits on the bench outside ?
In such circumstances , can there truly be " agreement " ?
Maybe not , which is good for my mum , but not so good for the government , because it drives a coach and horses through the intention of the bill , which is to ban open Wi - Fi so that it cannot be used as an excuse when ( whenever that is ) the opportunity comes to repel the unfounded allegations of infringement which generate the warnings .
( How my mum could even start to know how to do this without legal aid – which will clearly not be available – is beyond me – but let 's leave that for now too . )
A hardened contract lawyer will already be muttering that in English law formation of contract is an objective not subjective matter .
If my mum appears to extend a service of internet access , and a downloader appears to accept it , does it matter what they actually think ?
Is n't this objectively an " agreement " ?
The Department of Business , Innovation and Skills ( DBIS ) , which is pushing the Digital Economy bill through , would probably like this argument , at least on first thoughts , because it plugs the gaps in the enforcement scheme .
But it has big problems of its own .
My mum would not be a subscriber , but she would be deemed an " ISP " , which would mean she would be bound to comply with sending out of warnings to those users of her service whose IP addresses were passed to her by rightsholders , or else , er , face up to a £ 250,000 fine for non cooperation .
Even DBIS may grind to a halt at this point .
Not only is fining grannies a quarter of a million pounds for not being hip with the internet not going to go down well in Daily Mail land , but it would be impossible for my mum to pass the warnings on : although she may have unknowingly " allocated " her IP address to the " subscriber " , she has no way of identifying those who have used her Wi-Fi , and no way to pass those warnings – and the legal responsibility - on .
Let 's try a different example .
My mum is a dinosaur , let us say .
She will be re-educated and her consciousness raised in the great Mandelson Digital Britain future .
But the DEB is meant to be a business - friendly piece of legislation so presumably it will work fine for businesses – or will it ?
Let 's think about a big solid business , like McDonalds .
McDonalds have a nice well run , password protected Wi -Fi network .
So do many public institutions , like the venerable British Library , which likes to assist scholars and patrons by providing such facilities .
In both cases , the Wi-Fi supplier will probably be regarded as a communications provider and hence not a subscriber .
In both cases , it is very easy to see this time that an " agreement " is explicitly made between the Wi-Fi service and the recipient .
What happens this time if a passing user logs on , downloads infringing material and a warning is dispatched ?
McDonalds may cope because its Wi-Fi is provided by The Cloud , which can possibly cope with identifying which user is to get which warnings .
It will be fiddly and expensive though and the cost of Wi-Fi to McDonalds would probably go up so much it would be uneconomic to supply .
Bang goes a free service which has proved a public boon and a remarkably popular enticement to customers in the ongoing recession .
But if we turn to the British Library , it really bites .
The BL is not set up to be a forensic investigator ; obliging it to act as one will be a fantastically resource intensive exercise for a public body providing a free service .
There is also an issue of privacy and anonymity , something academic researchers are often touchy about .
And again , if the BL refuse to comply – or more likely , simply says it can't – it is , at least in theory , subject to a fine up to £ 250,000 .
So we are back again to the death of public Wi -Fi , closed as well as open .
Can anyone disprove this train of logic ?
Because really , I may be a lawyer , but I do n't like it any more than you do .

Network Lights is a tiny application that turns the NumLock and ScrollLock keyboard indicators into incoming and outgoing network traffic indicators .
Check out our video here to see the lights in action .
The video starts with some simple browsing — we were looking for a Linux ISO to grab in order to really light things up — and by the end of the video you see the burst of blinking that occurs when the large ISO download was underway .
In addition to turning your keyboard lights into indicators , Network Lights also keeps stats on your network activity if you 're curious .
Note :
If you run the app and nothing happens , right click on the system tray icon and open the Settings dialogue .
Check the box that says " Force Keyboard Capture " .
Despite it being tagged as a solution for older motherboards , our test machine has a motherboard manufactured within the last year and an equally as new keyboard , we needed to use the force capture function .

The Mexican public overwhelmingly backs a tough anti-drug strategy : 83 % support using the Mexican army to fight drug traffickers , while only 12 % oppose the idea .
Moreover , the 2009 Pew Global Attitudes survey finds that most Mexicans believe the efforts are effective .
Fully 66 % say the army is making progress against the traffickers , while only 15 % think it is losing ground .
There is also considerable support for U.S. assistance in fighting the drug war .
Almost eight - in - ten want the U.S. to train Mexican police and military personnel , and 63 % want the U.S. to send money and weapons to the Mexican police and military .
However , there is little appetite for having American troops on Mexican soil — only 30 % want U.S. forces deployed to Mexico to fight drug traffickers .

Sharia law sneaked into budget
The one - line revelation is buried in the 212 - page pre-Budget report .
It is among a string of startling details which barely merit a mention in Alistair Darling ’s controversial mini-Budget – prompting fresh accusations that Labour is “ burying bad news ” .
The Government wants to tap into the fast - growing Sharia finance market , set to top £ 205 billion a year , and turn London into the “ global gateway for Islamic finance ” .
Many conventional financial products are not Sharia compliant because Muslim clerics view conventional loans , which involve interest payments , as sinful .
The UK Government was one of the first Western countries to issue a state - backed sukuk , an Islamic bond .
It now wants to rewrite tax laws to stop Muslim businessmen being unfairly taxed when they try to raise money on their companies .
Conventional loans allow them to take equity out of their business , using the property as collateral , but to be Sharia compliant a Muslim “ sells ” the business to the bank and then rents it back .
That leaves the businessman facing a bill for capital gains tax and the Treasury wants to level the tax playing field .
Mohammed Amin , head of Islamic finance at PricewaterhouseCoopers , said : “ The UK has become the leading Western country in Islamic finance by taking a series of measures to ensure that Islamic finance is taxed no worse and no better than conventional finance .
“ The pre-Budget report continues this progress by including measures to equalise the tax treatment of property refinancing transactions . ”
Ministers are also considering issuing Government bonds to Islamic banks to help them comply with new financial regulations .
With three independent Islamic banks and high street names at the forefront of compliant accounts , London is one of the world ’s largest centres for Islamic finance .
Sharia - compliant mortgages , car insurance and even baby bonds are available for Muslims wanting to avoid “ riba ” – interest payments .
Supporters say the Government is wisely getting in on the ground floor of a market which could net the City billions in the future .
Critics warn Labour is rushing into a financial system it does not fully understand and question how far laws should be rewritten to accommodate Islamic practices .
The Financial Services Authority says its policy is one of “ no obstacles , no special favours ” for Islamic finance .
Well , what else is she supposed to lean on ?

Penner 's projected goal total is good for 3rd over this time period .
His pace would tie him for 13th in assists and 6th in points .
He would join Mark Messier , Vincent Damphousse , Doug Weight and Ryan Smyth as Oilers who have led the team in Goals , Assists and Points .
He 's also on pace to accomplish a feat that only one other player in the history of the Oilers has been able to pull off -- lead the team in Goals , Assists , Points , and +/-.
Apparently , this is it
In something of a box office anticlimax to one of the most astonishing careers in entertainment history , despite surprisingly strong reviews , “ This is It ” with Michael Jackson has fallen somewhat short of expectations .
The documentary about the preparations for Jackson ’s never - to - be final tour won was , in fact , the # 1 movie with an estimate of roughly $ 20.4 - 7 million for the weekend and $ 31.9 - $ 32.5 for the “ cume ” since it ’s Tuesday opening — that ’s depending on whether you prefer the numbers offered by the breathlessly negative Nikki Finke or Variety ’s more glass - half - full Pamela McClintock .
The film was originally pegged for closer to $ 50 million or more .
Now , to be fair , I ’ve never been a fan of this whole box office expectations game .
In my book , a movie is a commercial success if it makes a profit ; the bigger the profit , the bigger the success .
That ’s it .
Still , considering who we ’re talking about , it ’s obvious why those expectations were sky high .
Given that Jackson was substantially more admired and less controversial / mocked abroad , it makes sense that the worldwide numbers for “ This Is It ” look a lot better , with a take so far of $ 101 million .
MJ remains , of course , huge in Japan and lots and lots of other places .
Supposedly in response to this response , Sony has made the deeply unsurprising move of extending the film ’s putative two - week run through Thanksgiving .
Nikki Finke ’s cry of “ Con Artists ” might seem a bit over - dramatic in a business that has long been under the spell of P.T. Barnum , but I ’m not going to deny that this was a pretty naked and unconvincing ploy to try to create artificial excitement that , at least in the U.S. , did n’t much take .
If anyone tries to use it again any time soon , if I may indulge in the subjunctive tense , they be putzes .
Still , fair is fair and it appears as if the King of Pop did beat the Hannah Montana concert film internationally , so there ’s that .
While “ This Is It ” was the only new major release this week , and the weekend ’s numbers were low overall , at least partially because of an inevitably somewhat low - key Halloween Saturday , there were other movies in play .
Not at all surprisingly , the holiday was kind to “ Paranormal Activity ” which declined a miniscule 22 % while adding theaters for an estimated weekend total of about $ 16.5 million and a “ cume ” of about $ 84.8 million .
Considering that it ’s still playing in roughly a thousand fewer theaters than “ This Is It , ” this is a genuinely outstanding box office performance for a film which had an original budget that was actually less than half of the budget of the “ zero budget ” “ The Blair Witch Project . ”
Perhaps wisely , Paramount appears to be keeping Israeli - born video game designer and now film director Oren Peli under wraps for the time being – no need to turn him into Quentin Spielberg just yet – but I trust he enjoyed the happiest of Halloweens .
Other than that , there were few surprises this weekend with all the current films pretty much staying static .
However , I ’m sure some of our young male readership will be interested to note that , as per Box Office Mojo , the best per-screen average this Halloween was just under $ 6,800 and it was enjoyed by Apparition ’s “ The Boondock Saints II : All Saints Day ” on 68 screens .
Given the poor performance of my personal great black hope , “ Black Dynamite , ” which was released in seventy theaters by the same arm of Sony and did not even register this week , or last , at the Mojo , this kind of sets my teeth on edge .
It ai n’t fair but the most cinematically accurate spoof film since “ Young Frankenstein ” will be back for another try on DVD .
That , as they say , is show biz , suckas .

One night in the mid-1990s when I was working as a journalist in Beijing , I went out to dinner with some Chinese friends .
I had just finished reading a book called " The File " by the British historian Timothy Garton Ash .
It 's about what happened in East Berlin after the Berlin Wall came down and everybody could see the files the Stasi had been keeping all those years .
People discovered who had been ratting on whom — in some cases neighbors and co-workers , but also lovers , spouses and even children .
After I described the book to my Chinese dinner companions — a hip and artsy intellectual crowd — one friend declared : " Some day ...
US regulators are demanding that Verizon Wireless explain why it 's doubling early termination fees for smartphone customers and why subscribers without a data plan are charged for inadvertently accessing its mobile web service .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) sent an open letter on Friday to the country 's largest mobile phone company asking it to provide details on the policies .
Last month , Verizon hiked the early termination fee for " advanced devices " from $ 175 to $ 350 .
Verizon had said that the extra charge was needed to help recoup costs of free or discounted smartphones .
The FCC wants to know what information about the higher early termination fee is provided to prospective customers , and whether customers are provided a grace period in which they can discontinue the service without being hit with the full $ 350 charge .
Verizon 's policy does let customers who agree to pay full price for a smartphone to avoid paying a full early termination fee .
Smartphones such as the BlackBerry or Droid that are discounted under a service contract are subject to the $ 350 fee for bailing out early .
The FCC also requested that Verizon provide details on its policy of charging customers $ 1.99 for accidentally accessing Verizon Wireless 's Mobile Web without a data plan .
The Commission points to a recent report in the New York Times that suggested the company is using shady tactics to profit from customers who accidentally push a dedicated Mobile Web button on Verizon phones .
The NYT article cites a person who claims to work for Verizon admitting that the company purposefully places the button in a location where customers are likely to inadvertently activate it .
Any data sent over the mobile web network results in a minimum charge of $ 1.99 .
Verizon was given until December 17 to respond to the FCC .

Taking a photograph in a public place has become the quickest way to attract police attention , as increasing numbers of photographers can verify .
But now it has emerged that anti-terrorism officers are uneasy about a far less sophisticated piece of surveillance technology : the watercolour brush and canvas .
Liam O'Farrell , an artist who exhibited at this year 's Royal Academy summer show , has described how he had been questioned and searched by police twice inside a week while painting a scene close to City airport in east London .
The artist contacted the Guardian following a series of incidents in Britain in which photographers , tourists and students were stopped under anti-terrorism laws .
The situation was highlighted in last Saturday 's Guardian when a reporter , Paul Lewis , described being questioned within two minutes of taking photographs of the Gherkin building in the City of London .
In a similar spirit of inquiry , Lewis went to the London Eye , central London , today armed with an easel , canvas and acrylic paints .
What O'Farrell called , perhaps inevitably , his " brush with the police " , began when he set up his equipment on a grass bank adjoining a public road just south of City airport .
With his back to the complex he set about painting a composite scene of terrace houses and the Tate & Lyle sugar factory a few streets away .
Inside half an hour two Metropolitan police officers from the specialist unit based at the airport arrived in a patrol car and demanded to know what he was doing , saying he had been spotted on a CCTV camera .
" I told them , ' I 'm hardly a terrorist , I 'm watercolouring ' .
One policeman said , ' you 're not painting the airport , are you ? '
I told him I was painting the sugar factory .
He said ' no one paints factories ' .
I told him Lowry painted loads of factories and made a mint .
He got a bit touchy then . "
For 15 minutes , O'Farrell said , one officer checked his identification on a radio while another searched his bag .
" They said I had ' weird paraphernalia ' with me .
I said 'it 's a flask of coffee and an iPod ' . "
O'Farrell said he had returned to the same spot a week later to complete the work and was interrogated again , by two other officers .
" I told them I was just doing a watercolour of the sugar factory .
One of them said ' no one does watercolours of factories ' .
I told them about Lowry – it was groundhog day .
It was extraordinary .
" Then one said ' I can see what you 're doing now , I 'd be a bit more concerned if you were painting the airport ' .
I remember from my art history that centuries ago in China artists were murdered in case they [ painted ] maps and roads .
But in the days of digital photography I hardly think a watercolourist painting an airport would be some sort of international threat . "
The experience left him baffled .
" I 've been painting in Moscow , in Vietnam , Ukraine , and all I get round me are bunches of kids .
If the police come by they 're just curious about the painting .
It 's extraordinary what happened to me . "
The incident took place in the summer of 2007 , O'Farrell said , and he was prompted to write after hearing about recent events .
A spokesman said the Met 's assistant commissioner , John Yates , had reminded officers last week that they should not stop photographers without reason .
" Anyone could imagine why an airport is seen as a sensitive site , but we are aware that there are issues of communication with officers about what they can and can't do , which is why John Yates has taken these measures , " he said .
Today the advice was seemingly being heeded .
The Guardian 's reporter spent a couple of hours creating his rendition of the London Eye on a winter afternoon , and , barring a polite request from a security guard to move to a different section of the riverside thoroughfare , received no official attention whatsoever .
The only other interest came from tourists keen to see the work 's progress .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - People on the brink of developing diabetes who get a lot of support and encouragement to diet and exercise can turn things around and avoid the disease , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .
“ Millions of people could delay diabetes for years and possibly prevent the disease altogether if they lost a modest amount of weight through diet and increased physical activity , ” said Dr. Griffin Rodgers , director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease .
In the United States , about 11 percent of adults -- 24 million people -- have diabetes .
Most have type 2 , the kind linked with a poor diet and lack of exercise .
The 10 - year study of overweight people with elevated blood sugar who lost a modest amount of weight found they lowered their risk of developing diabetes by at least a third .
People over 60 got even more dramatic results , cutting their risk of diabetes during the study period by about half .
“ People can lose weight , and this weight loss is accompanied by a lowering of their rate of diabetes , ” said Dr. William Knowler , who works at the health agency , part of the National Institutes of Health .
His study appears in the journal Lancet .
The findings follow up on a large randomized trial of 3,234 overweight or obese adults with elevated blood sugar .
Results of that study , reported in 2001 , found a diet and exercise program and support classes helped cut the risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent after three years compared with a placebo group .
The program consisted of reducing fat and calories and increasing physical activity to 150 minutes a week .
Participants also got training in diet , exercise and behavior modification .
People in this group lost an average of 15 pounds ( 6.8 kg ) in the first year , but they gradually regained all but about 5 pounds .
A second group who took the diabetes drug metformin also succeeded in lowering their diabetes risk by 31 percent after three years compared with placebo .
The latest results show what happened after 10 years of follow - up .
Starting in 2002 , study participants were offered the diet and exercise program and support classes .
After 10 years , the group that started off in the diet and exercise group has sustained a modest weight loss and cut their risk of developing diabetes by 34 percent , compared with the group that started out on a placebo .
The group that took the diabetes pill metformin and later added in the lifestyle program had an 18 percent lower risk of developing diabetes during the study .
“ All that to me supports the fact that the lifestyle intervention , whether it was given immediately , or later on , was beneficial , ” Knowler said in a telephone interview .
He said some people in all three groups continued to develop diabetes , but the rate was much slower if people were able to eat a healthier diet and get regular exercise .
From a policy perspective , he said diabetes can be delayed or avoided with intensive effort .
During a recent strategy meeting at Ternary Software Inc. , a programmer criticized the chief executive 's new incentive plan for employees .
An hourlong discussion ensued , in which several participants , including the CEO , critiqued the proposal .
Ultimately , all six participants agreed to handle incentives differently .
That part was crucial : Ternary runs itself as a democracy , and every decision must be unanimous .
Any of Ternary 's 13 other employees could have challenged the incentive decision and forced it to be revisited .

NASHVILLE , Tenn . –
It ’s been the year of the gun in Tennessee .
In a flurry of legislative action , handgun owners won the right to take their weapons onto sports fields and playgrounds and , at least briefly , into bars .
A change in leadership at the state Capitol helped open the doors to the gun-related bills and put Tennessee at the forefront of a largely unnoticed trend :
In much of the country , it is getting easier to carry guns .
A nationwide review by The Associated Press found that over the last two years , 24 states , mostly in the South and West , have passed 47 new laws loosening gun restrictions .
Among other things , legislatures have allowed firearms to be carried in cars , made it illegal to ask job candidates whether they own a gun , and expanded agreements that make permits to carry handguns in one state valid in another .
The trend is attributed in large part to a push by the National Rifle Association .
The NRA , which for years has blocked attempts in Washington to tighten firearms laws , has ramped up its efforts at the state level to chip away at gun restrictions .
“ This is all a coordinated approach to respect that human , God - given right of self defense by law - abiding Americans , ” says Chris W. Cox , the NRA ’s chief lobbyist .
“ We ’ll rest when all 50 states allow and respect the right of law - abiding people to defend themselves from criminal attack . ”
Among the recent gun-friendly laws :
— Arizona , Florida , Louisiana and Utah have made it illegal for businesses to bar their employees from storing guns in cars parked on company lots .
— Alabama , Arkansas , Louisiana , South Carolina and Virginia have made some or all handgun permit information confidential .
— Montana , Arizona and Kansas have allowed handgun permits to be issued to people who have had their felony convictions expunged or their full civil rights restored .
— Tennessee and Montana have passed laws that exempt weapons made and owned in - state from federal restrictions .
Tennessee is the home to Barrett Firearms Manufacturing , the maker of a .50 - caliber shoulder - fired rifle that the company says can shoot bullets up to five miles and is banned in California .
The AP compiled the data on new laws from groups ranging from the Legal Community Against Violence , which advocates gun control , to the NRA .
Public attitudes toward gun control have shifted strongly over the past 50 years , according to Gallup polling .
In 1959 , 60 percent of respondents said they favored a ban on handguns except for “ police and other authorized persons . ”
Gallup ’s most recent annual crime survey in October found 71 percent opposed such a ban .
The NRA boasts that almost all states grant handgun permits to people with clean criminal and psychological records .
In 1987 , only 10 states did .
Only Wisconsin , Illinois and the District of Columbia now prohibit the practice entirely .
“ The NRA has a stranglehold on a lot of state legislatures , ” said Kristin Rand , legislative director the Violence Policy Center , a gun control group in Washington .
“ They basically have convinced lawmakers they can cost them their seats , even though there ’s no real evidence to back that up . ”
Tennessee ’s new laws came after the Republican takeover of the General Assembly this year , but most other states that loosened restrictions did n’t experience major partisan shifts .
Most of the states where the new laws were enacted have large rural populations , where support for gun rights tends to cross party lines .
While some states have tightened gun laws during the same period , the list of new restrictive laws is much shorter .
In 2009 alone , more than three times as many laws were passed to make it easier on gun owners .
New Jersey ’s 2009 law limiting people to one handgun purchase per month is the most notable of the more restrictive laws .
Other examples this year include Maryland ’s ban on concealed weapons on public transit and Maine ’s vote to give public universities and colleges the power to regulate firearms on campus .
The most contentious of Tennessee ’s new gun laws was one allowing handguns in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol .
It took effect in July after lawmakers overrode a veto by the governor .
Last month , a Nashville judge struck down the law as unconstitutionally vague , but supporters have vowed to pass it again .
A similar Arizona law that took effect in September allows people with concealed - weapons permits to bring their guns into bars and restaurants that have n’t posted signs banning them .
While Tennessee ’s law was in place , many bars chose not to let customers bring guns in .
Likewise , more than 70 communities have opted out of allowing guns in parks .
“ People go in there and start drinking and then they want to start a fight .
What are they going to do if they got a gun in their hand ? ” said Larry Speck , 69 , who works at an auto repair shop in Memphis .
“ I ’ve got a gun permit and I ’m not carrying mine in there even if they have a law . ”
Chattanooga retiree Ken Hasse , 71 , said he worries about the possible consequences of allowing people to carry their guns in places like parks .
“ It ’s going to tempt somebody to use one , ” he said .
Supporters of expanding handgun rights argue that people with state - issued permits are far less likely to commit crimes , and that more lawfully armed people cause a reduction in crime .
Opponents fear that more guns could lead to more crime .
Academics are divided on the effects of liberalized handgun laws , and determining the impact is complicated by the move in several states to close handgun permit records .
A Violence Policy Center project has mined news reports to find that more than 100 people have been killed by holders of handgun - carry permits since 2007 , including nine law enforcement officers .
The project originally intended to list all gun crimes by permit holders , but there were too many to keep track of , Rand said .
“ They shoot each other over parking spaces , at football games and at family events , ” Rand said .
“ The idea that you ’re making any place safer by injecting more guns is just completely contradicted by the facts . ”
The flood of legislative victories in Tennessee after many years of frustration now has some gun backers aiming for a whole new level of freedom :
No permits at all .
The permit laws “ are an extra burden on people to exercise essentially a constitutional right , ” said John Harris , executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association .
Renault entend faire " le pari de la mobilité durable pour tous " en lançant en 2011 - 2012 " une gamme complète " de véhicules électriques qui seront proposés à " un prix comparable à leur équivalent thermique " , a affirmé , jeudi 5 novembre , le PDG de Renault , Carlos Ghosn .
Le véhicule électrique constitue " la réponse de Renault à la conjonction de deux défis " , un " défi écologique " et un " défi énergétique " , a déclaré M. Ghosn , lors de l'inauguration de l'exposition à Paris des quatre prototypes de voitures électriques de Renault .
" Nous ne pouvons pas nous contenter de demi- mesures " , a déclaré Carlos Ghosn , rappelant que l'automobile représentait 12 % des émissions de CO 2 et notant que le prix du baril de pétrole se situait " à un niveau élevé , autour de 80 dollars ( 54 euros ) " .
" Avec la reprise économique et la hausse de la demande , il est très vraisemblable que le baril se positionne durablement au - dessus de 100 dollars , voire de 150 dollars " , a - t - il estimé .
" IL S'AGIT DE METTRE SUR LA ROUTE DES VÉHICULES QUI N'ÉMETTENT PAS DU TOUT DE CO2 "
M. Ghosn a redit que deux des quatre véhicules électriques de Renault seront fabriqués en France , et notamment la citadine Zoe ZE ( zéro émission ) , cœur de la gamme électrique , qui sera produite à Flins , dans les Yvelines , une annonce faite plus tôt dans la journée sur ce site .
La berline Fluence ZE et l'utilitaire Kangoo ZE sont programmés pour le premier semestre 2011 , la petite Twizy ZE pour le second semestre 2011 et la Zoe ZE pour le premier semestre 2012 .
M. Ghosn a réaffirmé que l'objectif de Renault était de proposer " une solution de rupture " .
" Il ne s'agit pas de réduire les émissions de CO 2 de 20 % ou 30 % , il s'agit de mettre sur la route des véhicules qui n'émettent pas du tout de CO 2 " , a - t - il dit .
Les quatre prototypes sont présentés pendant dix jours dans le hall d'exposition de Renault , sur les Champs - Elysées .

You can use a current netbook , " need a screwdriver , " you can get Chrome OS up today .
10:43 AM " The primary reason we are here today , I 'm very excited to announce that as of today the code is open .
We will completely be developing the code in the open . "
10:42 AM
We are working with the top OEMs to come to market .
" You will have to go and buy a Chrome OS machine in the market .
Our target time frame is end of next year . "
Ahead of holiday season with devices in the market .
10:42 AM " It is important to understand how we 're gonna go to market . "
Going with partners to specify at hardware level .
Only support solid state drives , only certain WiFi cards .
10:41 AM Back to Sundar .
" What we are doing is not just an operating system , it 's a choice for the users . "
10:40 AM Local user data cache is only used as cache , as it's saved back into the cloud anyway .
Remember , nothing stays just local here .
10:40 AM " User partition , this is where the user settings are placed .
We 've done a couple of interesting things .
First off it 's always encrypted . "
Should you ever lose the machine , anyone who finds it " will have a very hard time getting to it . "
10:38 AM Boot - partition is read - only .
10:37 AM Security sandbox , all web apps are separated from each other and the OS .
10:37 AM Chrome OS is nothing but web application .
" It ca n't change files on your hard disk . "
10:36 AM Application security model .
In current model , applications run with your permission .
" This creates a bunch of security problems .
A rogue application can cause lots of harm . "
10:35 AM " Appropriate version " is automatically downloaded .
Offline customization does n't sound so likely at this point .
10:34AM " So what happens when it goes wrong ?
If this happens , it could be multiple reasons -- malware , Chrome got hacked .
It could be a random cosmic gray area , random error .
When it happens , we detect it happens , Chrome detects it , and then we go through recovery procedure where it repairs itself . "
10:34AM " We 're using cryptographic signature keys to make sure when we load kernel off disk , it is the set of bytes it 's supposed to be . "
10:33 AM " We 're looking on a system called verified boot . "
Discussing malware .
" The essence of the process is we double check to make sure you 're running what you 're running . "
10:32 AM " We 've cut out all the boot steps we can " with Chrome OS .
" As Sendar mentioned , we do n't run conventional applicatins , so we do n't need to start up background services for them .
And we also autostart the browser . "
All tabs from last session come , too .
10:31 AM
All based on solid storage .
" That 's part of why we can boot so quickly . "
10:31 AM Looks like demo's over , back to the slide show we go !

It wo n't necessarily look like what it does today , but " very many " aspects will probably move over .
10:19 AM " Internally we joke around Chrome is Chrome OS . "
Externally , too .
10:19 AM About a seven second login .
We 're now looking at Chrome OS UI .
It looks ... like Chrome .
10:18 AM Demo time !
10:18 AM " The final point is security .
Given what I 've talked about , everything is a web application , we can finally do something that 's fundamentally different . "
Because users are n't installing their own binary , Google will be able to detect malware better .
10:17 AM " If I lose my Chrome OS machine , I should be able to get a new one , log in , and get everything back ... everything should look similar .
We want users to be able to share machines . "
10:16AM
We want Chrome OS to be fast .
He makes an allusion to TV as to how fast it should turn on .
" Chrome on Chrome OS will be even faster . "

We thought the fever of this autumn was going to be swine flu , but we were wrong .
It has turned out to be National Debt Hysteria .
Our entire political class has taken to their beds with this fever , crying for nurse to bring cuts , cuts , cuts .
The symptoms are simple : the sufferer becomes convinced that debt levels lower than almost all other wealthy nations , and lower than almost all of modern British history , are " a disaster " , and so we must immediately slash our spending .
They keep up this wail even though the most qualified doctors , like the winner of this year 's Nobel Prize for Economics , Professor Paul Krugman , stand by their beds and tell them this will bring our real sickness , the recession , back with a vengeance .
The hysteria will reach a Cameroonian crescendo today when the Tory leader delivers his party conference speech promising Austerity For All .
( Except for millionaires like himself , of course , who will receive a massive inheritance tax cut . )
So let 's calmly study the patient – and see how this National Debt Hysteria is going to do us far more harm that the real national debt ever could .
Let 's start with a few facts that have been forgotten .
Britain went into this recession with one of the lowest debt levels in the developed world .
According to the International Monetary Fund , Japan 's debt in 2008 was 198 per cent of national GDP , Italy's was 104 per cent , Germany 's was 76 per cent , France 's was 65 per cent , the US 's was 61 per cent , and Britain 's was 43 per cent .
All countries have rapidly increased borrowing during this recession – for very good reasons we 'll get to in a second – and Britain has nudged closer to the middle of the league table .
But to claim , as Cameron does , that Gordon Brown had " racked up debts in the good times " so we " ca n't afford more " is simply untrue .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cameron and George Osborne say that a national debt at 75 per cent of GDP makes a country " bust . "
Using this measure , the most successful economies in the world are bankrupt , and have been for a long time .
Japan has apparently been trebly " bust " since the 1970s , yet it has just elected a government committed to higher public spending .
The US , Germany – " bust " and " bust " , yet spending more .
Oh , and Britain has been " bust " for almost its entire history since the 1750s if Cameron 's standard is right .
There have only been two 40 - year periods when we had a debt that dipped below Cameron 's supposed catastrophe - level : the end of the 19th century , and from the 1970s to now .
As the economist Will Hutton puts it : " From 1750 to 1870 , Britain won wars , assembled an astonishing navy , built an empire and launched the Industrial Revolution to become the envy of Europe , yet the national debt was consistently above 80 per cent of GDP .
Nobody cared .
High national debt was a precondition for winning two world wars in the 20th century .
Periods when the over - riding preoccupation has been lowering the national debt have coincided with industrial , economic and strategic decline .
So it will again . "
So is the world – and Britain 's history – bankrupt , or is Cameron 's reasoning ?
In all indebted countries , there have always been people who warned that the fiscal sky was about to fall in .
In 1752 the philosopher David Hume cried : " Either the nation must destroy public credit , or public credit will destroy the nation . "
As the great historian Thomas Macaulay explained : " At every stage in the growth of the debt it has been seriously asserted by wise men that bankruptcy and ruin were at hand .
Yet still the debt went on growing , and still bankruptcy and ruin were as remote as ever . "
But on the basis of this faulty reading of economics , we are about to dramatically slash our public spending – in a way that will cause real harm , rather than the phantasms conjured by Cameron .
There is a reason why governments should increase spending in a recession , explained by John Maynard Keynes from the 1920s onwards .
When the economy sickens , businesses and consumers stop spending except on essentials .
This causes demand to fall .
If the government cuts back at the same time , then nobody is buying anything – and recession turns into depression .
The only way out is for governments to pick up the slack and borrow money to spend on public projects and subsidies that get money running through the economy again .
Then , once we are back to work , the government pays down the debt with the proceeds of growth .
This has been demonstrated to work time and again .
In a recession , it 's irrational for you to rack up debt , but essential for the government to .
Keynes called this " the paradox of thrift . "
Yet Cameron and Osborne deny these truths : Osborne actually claims public spending claimed no role in ending the Great Depression .
What happens if governments – in the middle of rising unemployment – panic about debt and stop stimulating the economy ?
We do n't need to speculate .
During the 1930s , Franklin Roosevelt launched a huge stimulus funded by debt , and the economy began to recover .
Then , in 1935 and 1936 , he was besieged by people offering the Cameron argument : the recovery will be stronger if we cut the debt now .
The result was that the depression came back with a nasty slap , and it was only wiped out when the gigantic stimulus of the Second World War sent debt soaring to 119 per cent of GDP .
This debt was easily repaid once this stimulus paved the way for the biggest boom in American history .
Cameron and Osborne would repeat this mistake .
When I read their statements to Krugman – the Nobel Prize - winning expert on depressions – he said he was " shocked . "
I asked if this approach would make the recession worse , and he said : " Yes . For sure . "
Professor David Blanchflower , until recently on the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee , warns that Osborne 's cuts could well send unemployment soaring to five million .
Indeed , Cameron 's cuts set us up for failure twice over .
Stimulus spending can – if it 's done well – not only get the immediate economy running again , but set us up for future success .
A recent detailed US study by Colombia Teachers ' College found that cutting high - school dropout rates in half would generate $ 45 bn in new tax revenues , by saving on welfare payments , imprisonment , and so on .
Cameron is proposing to do precisely the opposite .
He will end the Educational Maintenance Allowance of £ 30 a week that makes it possible for poor kids to stay on to sixth form college , setting them up for a lifetime of diminished expectations .
So why is Cameron getting away with it ?
Partly , of course , it is due to a media that has an allergy to arguments that take more than 30 seconds to explain and a bias to the Tories .
But it is also due to a failure by Labour and the Lib Dems .
Instead of standing up for the idea of a debt - funded stimulus to get us through the recession , they have panicked and accepted the bogus Tory framing .
They have been reduced to whimpering : we do need cuts now , only we 'll be a little nicer in the way we do it .
It has been a disaster .
The British people are not having the looming Cameron slasher flick explained to them : we will only grasp the plot once the film has begun .
The biggest risk to our economy today is not debt , it is the fear of debt .
Somebody needs to invent a Tamiflu for our national hysteria before we start frantically cutting into our flesh to carve out a hallucinatory disease .

Dutch government says all passengers to US will have to go through full - body scanners once they have been installed at Schiphol airport
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Barack Obama today described US intelligence failings as " totally unacceptable " after it emerged that agencies knew leaders of a branch of al - Qaida in Yemen had talked about " a Nigerian " being prepared for a terrorist attack .
The US president interrupted a holiday in Hawaii to speak bluntly about the lapses that allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to board a Northwest Airlines flight to the US in Amsterdam .

The Dutch government today announced that all passengers to the US would have to go through full - body scanners once they have been installed at Schiphol airport in three weeks .
The Dutch interior minister , Guusje Ter Horst , said the authorities had wanted to introduce the scanners for passengers travelling to the US before the attempted bombing .
However , the devices were not installed because US authorities wanted them to be used on flights to all destinations .
Ter Horst said the attempted plane bombing had been prepared professionally but executed amateurishly .
" If the detonation had been done in a correct manner , then part of the plane would have exploded and a hole in the plane would have caused a great tragedy , " she said .
A preliminary Dutch investigation said all security checks were correctly carried out in Amsterdam before the flight left , and US authorities cleared the passenger list that included Abdulmutallab .
Holst said the Dutch authorities did not know that Abdulmutallab – who was travelling on a Nigerian passport – was on a US security list .
Ter Horst said Abdulmutallab apparently assembled the explosive device , including 80 grams of the military explosive PETN , in the aircraft toilet and had planned to detonate it using a syringe of chemicals .
" It is not exaggerating to say the world has escaped a disaster , " Ter Horst said .
Meanwhile , officials in Somalia said a Somali tried to board a commercial airliner in Mogadishu last month with powdered chemicals , liquid and a syringe that could have caused an explosion .
Abdulahi Hassan Barise , a police spokesman , said the suspect was arrested before the 13 November Daallo Airlines flight left .
It was scheduled to travel from Mogadishu to the northern Somali city of Hargeisa , then to Djibouti and Dubai .
Two international officials in Nairobi said the incident was similar to the attempted Detroit attack .
US officials said they were aware of the incident and were investigating any possible links with the Detroit incident .
A senior official told the New York Times Obama had been briefed that the US had information that would have amounted to a clear warning if shared among agencies .
This included details on where Abdulmutallab had been and what some of his plans were .
" When our government has information on a known extremist and that information is not shared and acted upon as it should have been so that this extremist boards a plane with dangerous explosives that could cost nearly 300 lives , a systemic failure has occurred and I consider that totally unacceptable , " the US president said .
The New York Times reported that although US agencies did not have the name of the 23 - year - old Nigerian , they could have found it by looking at information about him that was already available .
Abdulmutallab has been charged with trying to blow up the flight to Detroit on Christmas Day .
" Had this critical information been shared , it could have been compiled with other intelligence and a fuller , clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged , " Obama said .
" The warning signs would have triggered red flags and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America . "
Senior US officials told the Associated Press that the intelligence authorities were looking at conversations between Abdulmutallab and at least one al - Qaida member .
The unnamed officials said the conversations were vague or coded , but US intelligence believed that , in hindsight , they may have been referring to the attempted attack in Detroit .
Obama 's homeland security and counter - terrorism adviser , John Brennan , is due to present the president with an early report based on recommendations and summaries from across the government .
Yemen , meanwhile , has warned of hundreds more militants on its soil planning to attack the west , and appealed for help to stop them .
Yemen 's foreign minister , Abu Bakr al - Qirbi , told the BBC that up to 300 extremists , backed by al - Qaida , were waiting to follow the example of Abdulmutallab .
" Of course there are a number of al - Qaida operatives in Yemen , and some of their leaders , " he said .
" We realise this danger .
They may actually plan attacks like the one we have just had in Detroit ... I can't give you exact figures .
There are maybe hundreds of them – 200 , 300 . "
The minister said Britain , the US and other western nations could do " a lot " to improve Yemen 's response to militants on its own soil and it was the " responsibility " of developed countries with strong intelligence capabilities to warn it about the movements of terror suspects .
" We have to expand our counter - terrorism units and this means providing them with the necessary training , military equipment , ways of transportation – we are very short of helicopters , " he said , claiming the US , UK and EU could do more .
" There is support , but I must say it is inadequate . "
Yemen 's government confirmed that Abdulmutallab had visited the country twice in recent years – for several months in 2005 and again from August until shortly before his failed attempt to bring down the airliner .
He has told FBI interrogators that he was trained in Yemen by al - Qaida .
Abdulmutallab described Yemen as " great " in internet postings made after he visited the country for the first time to learn Arabic while he was a boarder at an elite international school in west Africa .
Save the planet , go veggie , says climate chief Lord Stern
Britons should turn vegetarian to help beat global warming , according to one of the world 's top experts on climate change .
Lord Stern said methane emissions from cows and pigs were putting ' enormous pressure ' on the world .
The peer , who wrote an influential review of climate change in 2006 , advocated a meat - free diet and called on people to think more about the effect of what they eat .
He predicted people 's attitudes to eating meat would change so much with time that it would eventually become unacceptable - in the same way as drink driving .
And he also forecast the price of meat and other foods that generate a lot of greenhouse gases could rise after December 's pivotal climate change conference .
Damaging ?
Lord Stern says cows and pigs give off huge amounts of greenhouse gases that are worsening global warming
' Meat is a wasteful use of water and creates a lot of greenhouse gases .
It put enormous pressure on the world 's resources .
A vegetarian diet is better , ' he said .

Now share your opinion
The former World Bank chief economist spoke to The Times ahead of the climate change summit in Copenhagen .
He said a successful conference would result in higher costs for meat and other foods that generate large quantities of greenhouse gases .
' I think it 's important that people think about what they are doing and that includes what they are eating , ' the London School of Economics professor said .
Drastic : Lord Stern says Britons should stop eating meat to save the planet
' I am 61 now and attitudes towards drinking and driving have changed radically since I was a student .
' People change their notion of what is responsible .
They will increasingly ask about the carbon content of their food . '
Methane is 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas , and it has been estimated that livestock accounts for a fifth of the global warming impact .
Lord Stern said if business continued as usual then temperatures could increase by 5C by early next century .
' These kinds of changes will have huge consequences .
Southern Europe is likely to be a desert ; hundreds of millions of people will have to move .
There will be severe global conflict , ' he claimed .
His 2006 review warned that if the world did not act on global warming , the cost would be at least 5 per cent of GDP ' now and forever ' .
' Climate change is a serious global threat , and it demands an urgent global response , ' he said .
Identification of gases responsible for the odour of human flatus and evaluation of a device purported to reduce this odour .
" BACKGROUND / AIMS :
While the social significance of flatus derives mainly from its odour , previous studies have focused on the non-odoriferous components of rectal gas .
The aims of the present study were to determine the role of sulphur - containing gases in flatus odour and test the efficacy of a device purported to reduce this odour .
METHODS : Flatus was quantitatively collected via rectal tube from 16 healthy subjects who ingested pinto beans and lactulose to enhance flatus output .
The concentrations of sulphur - containing gases in each passage were correlated with odour intensity assessed by two judges .
Odour intensity was also determined after treatment of flatus samples with zinc acetate , which binds sulphydryl compounds ( hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol ) , or activated charcoal .
Utilising gastight Mylar pantaloons , the ability of a charcoal lined cushion to adsorb sulphur - containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was assessed .
RESULTS : The main sulphur - containing flatus component was hydrogen sulphide ( 1.06 ( 0.2 ) mumol / l ) , followed by methanethiol ( 0.21 ( 0.04 ) mumol /l ) and dimethyl sulphide ( 0.08 ( 0.01 ) mumol / l ) ( means ( SEM ) ) .
Malodour significantly correlated with hydrogen sulphide concentration ( p < or = 0.001 ) .
Zinc acetate reduced sulphur gas content but did not totally eliminate odour , while activated charcoal removed virtually all odour .
The cushion absorbed more than 90 % of the sulphur gases .
CONCLUSION : Sulphur - containing gases are the major , but not the only , malodorous components of human flatus .
The charcoal lined cushion effectively limits the escape of these sulphur - containing gases into the environment . "
We close with one more quote from To the Royal Academy of Farting :
What Comfort can the Vortices of Descartes give to a Man who has Whirlwinds in his Bowels !
The Knowledge of Newton 's mutual Attraction of the Particles of Matter , can it afford Ease to him who is racked by their mutual Repulsion , and the cruel Distensions it occasions ?
The Pleasure arising to a few Philosophers , from seeing , a few Times in their Life , the Threads of Light untwisted , and separated by the Newtonian Prism into seven Colours , can it be compared with the Ease and Comfort every Man living might feel seven times a Day , by discharging freely the Wind from his Bowels ?
Especially if it be converted into a Perfume : For the Pleasures of one Sense being little inferior to those of another , instead of pleasing the Sight he might delight the Smell of those about him , & make Numbers happy , which to a benevolent Mind must afford infinite Satisfaction .
The generous Soul , who now endeavours to find out whether the Friends he entertains like best Claret or Burgundy , Champagne or Madeira , would then enquire also whether they chose Musk or Lilly , Rose or Bergamot , and provide accordingly .

We 'll fail a generation of girls if we teach them they have to have it all , says Jill Berry
Can women have a successful career and a family ?
Looking around at the ambitious and talented young women I teach as headmistress of Dane Alice Harpur school in Bedford , my heart swells .
Brimful of dreams and high expectations , they talk of how they are going to become surgeons , barristers and captains of industry .
They envisage themselves running companies , saving lives and making millions - all with a clutch of rosy - cheeked children in tow .
And why should n't they ?
From the moment these little girls toddled into nursery school , we 've been teaching them that their ambitions should have no limits .
We 've told them there 's absolutely nothing that men can do that they can't do at least as well .
And they 've proved it - girls now outperform boys at every academic stage .
We 've told our daughters that nothing need stand in their way - not relationships , not marriage and certainly not children .
And , being ambitious , hard - working girls , they 've learned the lesson only too well .
The young women we are sending out into the world believe they can have it all - and , if they do n't , they will have failed .
And what a tragedy that is , because the truth is that modern women can't have it all .
They may succeed in their careers and they may succeed as mothers , but to do both at the same time ?
No , that is not possible without making huge sacrifices which many will find simply too much .
The fact is that life is not a level playing field .
Men and women may finally have equal opportunities , but that does n't mean women should make the same choices as men .
The sexes are different .
Most women want children and they want to be the principal carer .
Encouraging young women to aim for the top at the same time as raising a family is unrealistic and , I would argue , damaging .
Equals :
Girls are told there is nothing men can do that they can't but can modern women have it all ?
We need to tell today 's young women that there is absolutely no shame in stepping off the career ladder to bring up children .
Women should be the best they can , but being the best chief executive and the best mother at the same time is unrealistic .
I know that , as a headmistress of a leading girls ' school and president of the Girls ' School Association , many women are going to hold up their hands in horror .
How can I , someone who was part of the generation who fought so hard to win equality , possibly suggest that women should now consider curbing their ambitions ?
Feminist sisterhood will undoubtedly accuse me of trying to send women back into the Dark Ages .
But I refuse to sit back and watch us fail another generation of women by feeding them a fairytale .
Of course , I want my pupils to have successful careers .
I certainly do n't want to turn back the clock and make women economically dependent on their husbands and unable to leave unhappy marriages because they could n't fend for themselves , as happened in my mother 's generation .
But I desperately want my students to be happy .
And that means acknowledging that having a career and children brings pressures which many women will find unbearable .
I know several successful women who were in shock when they became mothers .
No one had warned them they would find the pull of motherhood so powerful .
And no one had prepared them for the terrible juggling act they were faced with .
They felt enormously guilty because they wanted to stay at home with their children .
Quitting work seemed like admitting failure so they soldiered on , becoming increasingly stressed and exhausted .
I am incredibly grateful for my education .
I was the first member of my family to go to university .
I studied English at Manchester before training as a teacher .
I 'm very ambitious .
I do n't have children .
But I know I would have wanted to concentrate on my family and chosen to put my career ambitions on the back - burner for a while , had that been the case .
Having a career and children brings pressures which many women find unbearable
The truth is that many women would be a lot happier if they stepped off the career ladder to raise children .
Instead , in a bid to pursue equality at all costs , we have made these women feel like failures .
Friends tell me that they do n't understand how other women can have it all and they can't .
They feel there 's something wrong with them .
And that 's simply not fair .
We need to admit that children are n't a problem to be negotiated .
They enrich our lives and bring huge happiness as well as challenges .
And no woman who chooses to sacrifice her career for her family should feel a failure .
We need to tell our girls that you can't have it all , all of the time .
We need to admit that balancing a high - powered career and children is incredibly complex .
Career opportunities have changed dramatically .
A generation ago , women dreamed of being nurses , not doctors .
Now , more women than men graduate from medical school .
I would n't deny my girls the chance to study medicine .
But I do tell them that if they want to be a consultant surgeon and have children they will have a very tough balancing act .
It may not be what they want to hear , but I feel if I do n''t open their eyes to the truth , I will be failing them .
I have taught girls and boys during my 30 - year career , and I am convinced the sexes are very different .
Typically , boys have a greater self belief .
They are more inclined to believe they can do something until they are proved otherwise .
Girls are much more self - effacing and self critical .
Men apply for promotion years before they are ready .
Women wait until they have amassed every qualification and scrap of experience .
In short , we are our own worst enemies .
We push ourselves to the brink and then beat ourselves up because we 're not perfect .
That 's why it 's so important that we teach our girls that they have a right to be happy and that they 're not failing if they choose motherhood over their careers .
Yes , we women can make it to the top .
But think very , very carefully about the price you may have to pay .

“ Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ’ sake , ” proclaims a new holiday ad from the American Humanist Association .
Already appearing today in the New York Times and Washington Post , the message will soon be blazoned on the sides , taillights , and interiors of over 200 Washington DC Metro buses .
It ’s the first ad campaign of its kind in the United States , and the American Humanist Association predicts it will raise public awareness of humanism as well as controversy over humanist ideas .
“ Humanists have always understood that you do n’t need a god to be good , ” said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the American Humanist Association .
“ So that ’s the point we ’re making with this advertising campaign .
Morality does n’t come from religion .
It ’s a set of values embraced by individuals and society based on empathy , fairness , and experience . ”
At a press conference today launching the campaign , large displays were featured showing the ads in today ’s New York Times and Washington Post , the bus posters , and how the posters will look mounted on the side of a bus and inside , behind the driver ’s seat .
( High resolution photos of the bus posters , including images of them mounted on and in a bus , are available online at http://www.whybelieveinagod.org/moreabout.html .)
The exterior posters will appear on buses in Northwest Washington starting Tuesday , November 18 .
The interior posters will begin December 1 in Northwest and Southeast .
“ We expect these bus signs to generate a lot of public interest , ” said Fred Edwords , director of communications for the American Humanist Association .
“ Some folks may be offended but that is n’t our purpose .
We just want to reach those open to this message but unaware how widespread their views are .
The “ goodness ’ sake ” ads and posters direct people to a special Web site at http://www.whybelieveinagod.org/
that helps people find others of like mind in the Washington , D.C. , metro area and nationally .
The site also informs the public about humanism and answers common objections to the slogan as well as to the appropriateness of running the campaign during the holidays .
Such high - profile promotion is n’t new to the American Humanist Association .
Throughout 2008 , humanist advertising has become more visible across the nation .
In particular , highway billboards have been erected just outside of New York City , Philadelphia , and other major cities .
They read : “ Do n’t believe in God ?
You are not alone . ”
“ Those billboards , ” Fred Edwords added , “ started raising the profile of our movement and generated an avalanche of responses , both from people who realized that they , too , were humanists as well as from those who disagreed with us .
But everyone heard our message loud and clear .
And this is what it takes for us to reach our audience . ”

From William Glaberson at the NY Times : The Recession Begins Flooding Into the Courts ( ht Liam )
New York State ’s courts are closing the year with 4.7 million cases — the highest tally ever — and new statistics suggest that courtrooms are now seeing the delayed result of the country ’s economic collapse .
...
New York ’s judges are wading into these types of cases by the tens of thousands , according to the new statistics , cases involving not only bad debts and soured deals , but also filings that are indirect but still jarring measures of economic stresses , like charges of violence in families torn apart by lost jobs and homes in jeopardy .
[ T ]he broad impact of the recession is clear in hundreds of thousands of new cases across the judicial system , including people challenging their real estate taxes , home foreclosures , contract disputes and family offenses .
And this is apparently happening all across the country .
I 've been tracking the surge in personal bankruptcy filings , and an increase in business disputes always happens during a recession , but what is really is sad is all the family disputes .
Lawyers for six Iraqi men have pushed for a public inquiry at the High Court
The defence secretary is to announce details of an inquiry into alleged war crimes by UK soldiers in Iraq .
Bob Ainsworth will set out the terms of the probe into claims 20 Iraqis were killed and nine others mistreated at UK bases after a firefight in 2004 .
He will name who will head the inquiry but no date is likely to be announced .
The government agreed to the review in July after months of legal debate .
The Ministry of Defence says the lives were lost during the " battle of Danny boy " .
' No credible evidence ' Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell said a " massive conspiracy " would have needed to be in place for the murder and mistreatment to have taken place .
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) has always insisted the men died during the " battle of Danny Boy " between British soldiers and militiamen in the south of the country , at a checkpoint known as " Danny Boy " .
There is very credible evidence there was clear ill - treatment
Phil Shiner
Public Interest Lawyers
But lawyers for six Iraqi men claim the civilians were killed after they were captured - not during the fighting , near Al Majar - al - Kabir in Maysan province on 14 May 2004 .
They produced medical evidence at the High Court which they claimed supported allegations that captives were taken to the UK's Camp Abu Naji , where they were tortured , murdered and their bodies mutilated .
The disputed events are alleged to have taken place at both Camp Abu Naji and at the temporary detention facility at Shaibah Logistics base .
Phil Shiner , of Public Interest Lawyers - who represents the uncle of one of the dead Iraqis - said there was " very credible evidence there was clear ill - treatment " .
' Investigation blocked '
The government agreed to an inquiry after facing severe criticism from the High Court .
The court said the MoD failed to provide documents showing the government knew several prisoners detained at the time of the battle had complained of abuse to the Red Cross .
And a judge also expressed concern that computers showing pictures of the dead Iraqis were thrown from a cross - channel ferry by an intelligence officer .
The court also criticised the Royal Military Police 's handling of investigations .
A military police inquiry found " no credible evidence " for the allegations but judges criticised the RMP investigation , which they said was blocked , causing delays .
The inquiry is the latest in a series of reviews into British military conduct in Iraq .
An investigation is currently under way into the death of Iraqi civilian , Baha Mousa , who died in 2003 while in British custody , having sustained 93 injuries .
A separate catalogue of 33 allegations of abuse , including rape and torture , are also to be investigated by the MoD .

It ’s almost Christmas again , and that always throws me into a strange mood .
This time I ’m thinking again about my main , production machine — a Celeron Thinkpad that will turn 9 years old next month .
Maybe you can tell by the screenshots scattered here and there on this blog , but it runs without X or any of its sub-libraries .
In fact , it ’s been that way for at least nine months by my calculations , ever since I grew so frustrated with inconsistencies between xorg - server and the siliconmotion driver that I rebuilt the entire thing from scratch without them .
I ’ve mentioned this several times in the past , but I think it ’s worth repeating again that , with the exception of one small point , this computer has handled all the major day - to - day tasks of my personal and online life for the better part of a year .
That includes :
Managing the blog you ’re reading now
Composing the post you ’re reading right now
Reading , composing and managing multiple web - based e-mail accounts
Local and remote file management
Remote system management
Personal timetable and scheduling
Web surfing , to include secure sites and managing multiple downloads
Music playback , including support for ogg , mp3 , flac and other formats
Note - taking of any and all kinds , from personal wikis to hierarchical structures , from to - do lists to free - form categorized and structured lists
Download managers and torrent clients
Download accelerators and automated file downloaders
Internet messaging and chat clients
More network and system profile monitors than are practical to list
News readers and RSS collectors
A slew of randomized “ screensavers ”
A healthy array of font selections
And maybe even more important ,
Image display and management against the framebuffer
Frame grabbing , for screenshots of the “ desktop ”
Full video file playback against the framebuffer , to include Flash videos extracted from YouTube and elsewhere
And to round things out ,
Conversion between multiple audio formats
Conversion between document formats , to include proprietary and open - source documents
Gobs and gobs of games — so many that I rarely have time to pursue them
And best of all it runs the most commonplace of these tasks , concurrently , on around 18 Mb of memory .
That ’s only about 10 percent of the maximum that will fit in this machine .
And what ’s the “ one small point ” that the system “ failed ” at ?
It ’s here .
But I take responsibility for that , and do n’t blame the machine .
I ’m not going to pretend I ’m some sort of superperson because I can tolerate life without a graphical environment — quite to the contrary : I do n’t mean to imply any kind of “ I ’m so cool and you ’re not ” tone at all .
In fact , I ’m quite confident that anyone with the least desire to shift toward this sort of setup could do it .
But that ’s the limiting factor , right there — your desire .
It ’s not the machine or the software that determines whether or not this is feasible , in any shape or form .
It ’s completely up to you .
Whether you pull one or two console applications out of the list and run them against the entire Gnome desktop , or carve your entire system down to fit inside 16 Mb and trumpet your enlightenment … it ’s up to you .
You determine your own level of involvement .
The lessons to be learned are ones I ’ve repeated several times over , so I wo n’t spend much more electronic space harping away at the same points :
You can speed up your computer by reducing the system load .
You can avoid bloat by learning to use clean , fast software with few dependencies .
You can reduce your system requirements by reducing the system load .
You can reduce your need for overpowered technology by using lighter , faster software .
You can save money by preserving and maintaining out of date hardware , and continuing to use it .
You can make a social and environmental impact by refusing to contribute to the corporate and materialistic philosophies of greed that otherwise run rampant in the greater part of culture today … by using the same hardware you ’ve had , and learning to use it better .
There ’s an odd little aphorism that ’s quoted infrequently in my culture : “ A bad workman blames his tools . ”
I would like to add to that one , by suggesting that a bad workman blames his tools , but a worse workman goes out and buys new tools , thinking it will make him a better workman .
Now this time I am implying something .
Happy holidays . 😈
Who are those bitches hanging out with KISS ?

Top Chattanooga officials on Monday gave area legislators a tour of their traffic - camera enforcement program and offered it up as a possible statewide model for lawmakers suspicious such programs are more about money than they are about safety .
Mayor Ron Littlefield touted the city 's use of revenue from its red light and speeding cameras to help fund drivers education programs for young drivers .
" There will be people alive in the future because of that measure , " the mayor said .
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Harmon , D - Dunlap , told local officials that the General Assembly is " going to pass something " to curb abuses .
He said in a later interview that lawmakers may look at some aspects of Chattanooga 's program as a model .
" It could be , " Rep . Harmon said .
" I do n't know what the committee is going to come out with - but we 're going to have to come out with something that 's ( a ) statewide regulation because everybody 's going crazy with these things . "
Police Chief Freeman Cooper urged lawmakers not to gut what in his view is primarily a safety program that he said has helped lower fatalities from 37 in 2006 to 21 in 2009 .
" What we do n't want to see happen , chairman , is that it 's so restrictive that we can't do what 's right for our citizens , " he said " I know the abuse is a possibility there , just like anything else . "
Lawmakers begin their annual legislative session later this month .
Earlier , Mr. Littlefield , City Council members , Chief Cooper , city traffic engineer John Van Winkle and other officials gave lawmakers a bus tour of some of the city 's traffic camera installations .
Among them were cameras along the " S " curves on Hixson Pike , which officials said have dramatically cut accidents .
Officials also saw red light cameras being used at the intersection of state Highway 153 and Hamill Road as well as a mobile unit working a site along Amnicola Highway .
Later , they visited police headquarters where they were given a lengthy presentation on the city 's program .
Chief Cooper told them the program is a " voluntary program " in that motorists have a choice on whether they will violate traffic laws .
Mr. Van Winkle said the city puts its red light cameras at six intersections identified by statistics as " hot spots " for serious accidents .
The red light cameras have had an effect in lowering crashes , he said .
But he noted the most dramatic impact has been with the speed cameras , citing the " S " curves along Hixson Pike .
He said the deadly stretch of road had 101 accidents in 2001 - six years before the cameras went up .
" Last year we only had four crashes , " he said .
Lawmakers said they do n't doubt the impact on the " S " curves .
But in a one - on - one conversation with City Council Chairman Jack Benson , Rep. Richard Floyd , R- Chattanooga , pointed out other problems , noting some cities do n't ticket motorists for failing to come to a complete stop when making a right turn on red at a traffic light .
But the city of Red Bank does , he said .
" People are so paranoid now they wo n't turn right on red , " he said , later noting , " there 's no consistency . "
In response to similar questions raised by Rep. Harmon , Chief Cooper said Chattanooga does not issue tickets on motorists making turns on red .
Speeding citations are issued only when motorists go 10 mph above the speed limit , he said .
Rep. Gerald McCormick , R - Chattanooga , said while the presentation was a good one , he is n't getting complaints from constituents about " too few speeding tickets being passed out .
Quite frankly .
I 've had some call and say they 're uncomfortable with government putting cameras up and watching them . "
Mr. Benson told lawmakers he had " not heard anybody really give any justifiable reason why we should n't use the speeding cameras .
In fact , everything that 's been said about that , it 's not an arbitrary " decision .
He said if lawmakers have issues about laws being enforced , " maybe the laws need to be changed .
I personally want laws enforced or changed if the law 's not enforceable or subjective and unfair . "
He noted that in an increasingly populated society , " we 're going to have cameras . "
Martin Gerber hospitalized with a serious neck injury ( Photo © khl.ru )
Swiss goalie Martin Gerber , who past summer left the Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL to play for Atlant Mytischi of the KHL , was hospitalized after suffering a serious neck injury in a game against Vityaz Chekhov on December 13 .
According to Russian site lifesports .ru during the second period a Vityaz forward ran into Gerber .
As a result Gerber ended up lying on the ice .
After being tested by the team ’s doctors Gerber was put on a wheel stretcher and taken off the ice .
He was sent to a Podolsk municipal hospital where he was diagnosed with a compression fracture of the third cervical vertebra .
“ The injury is very serious , Martin can forget about hockey for the next 6 months , ” said one of the hospital ’s doctors , Igor Suvorov .
“ Thank God the spinal cord was not hurt and there is no threat to his life .
Gerber will soon be sent to a special clinics in Podolsk to undergo computed tomography to ensure the spinal cord is not hurt . ”
Martin Gerber is expected to stay at the hospital for at least 2 months .
Update :
Russian newspaper Sovetskiy Sport talked with Atlant GM , Andrei Verevko :
“ Gerber underwent computed tomography .
The preliminary diagnosis is a compression fracture of the fourth cervical vertebra .
Monday morning Gerber will have an advanced medical examination . ”
Update ( Monday ) :
Martin Gerber ’s injury not so serious .
He is expected to be back in 2 - 3 weeks .

The following is a guest post from Vinay Kumar , who lives in the small coastal town in Southern India .
Vinay has a Phd in Neuroscience from M.I.T. and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University .
He works as a systems engineer and volunteers on an organic farm that he helped to create .
He also provides technical help to local community organizations in India that are fighting polluting industries .
Vinay is a friend of one of Herman Daly 's former graduate students in India which is how he came across TheOilDrum .
The below essay on the implications of oil depletion for human labor is a great example of the cross disciplinary ideas that can emerge at the intersection of the internet and education .
Peak Oil and The Psychology of Work
This is a preliminary attempt to explore the relationship between the current predicament facing humanity arising out of an exploding population facing planetary resource limitations , in other words known as overshoot , and the psychology of work inherent in the human species .
One reason to explore this connection is that the question of overshoot is normally framed in standard Darwinian terms .
In the Darwinian framework overshoot begins with the availability of abundant resources that allows the population of a species to increase exponentially .
This exploding population eventually depletes irreversibly the very resources that sustain the population and this leads to a large scale die - off and a precipitous fall in the species population sometimes leading to extinction .
In this rise and fall , the behavior of the individuals of the species is often typical of any organism seeking to maximize its chances of survival and procreation .
However the human species , aided by a generalized intelligence , is perhaps unique in its ability to extensively craft its environment in order to garner a much larger portion of the ecological resource base to sustain itself .
In the evolution of humans , there have been two signal revolutions that brought about a very large increase in humanity 's ecological valence leading to profound changes in the human mode of existence and its environment .
The first was the agricultural revolution that is now understood as having begun some 10000 - 12000 years ago .
This allowed the hunter - gatherer humans to transition to a settled agrarian lifestyle eventually paving the way for the rise of urban civilizations .
The second revolution was the industrial revolution that is a mere 200-300 years old but which allowed humans to rapidly dominate the planet as perhaps no other species had managed to before .
There can be no doubt that the availability of ecological resources played a defining role in these transitions – in the case of the agricultural revolution the key resource was fertile top soil of river valley ecosystems .
The nutrient laden silt deposited in the flood plains of riverine systems such as the Nile , the Euphrates and the Indus ensured the initial success and widespread replication of settled agriculture .
Similarly it was the availability of concentrated forms of different resources chiefly energy but also ores of various metals that were the principal enablers of the industrial revolution .
While the role of ecological resources in these signal revolutions is fairly well understood , the role of human mental faculties in their myriad manifestations is either unclear or the subject of severe controversies .
But there can also be little doubt that human mental faculties – through innate predisposition and learnt skills and behavioral responses – must have played a fundamental role in these changes as well .
My interest lies in understanding how our mental faculties contributed to these fundamental transformations , with the hope that this understanding will enable us as individuals and collectives to be better prepared for the inevitable turmoil that results from the decline in the availability of concentrated energy resources .
In particular in this essay I want to explore how the human mind views and deals with the concept of work – both as an idea in the mind and as a felt necessity of human existence .
In physics work is the same as energy .
In fact energy is defined as the ability to do work and therefore they are measured in the exact same units .
In the biological world , all organisms have to do work in order to change and exploit their environment for their benefit .
But it is not uncommon in the animal kingdom to have sharply differentiated work burdens across different members of a species , e.g. the work differential between the worker ants vs the drones , or the lioness vs the lion .
However , what work means to the human mind is something quite different from both the physical concept , and the forms observed in other animal species .
The intrinsic tendencies towards work in humans ( like most other mental faculties ) have always influenced and defined their cultural and political systems and thus contributed to the rise and fall of civilizations .
It is not difficult to see that both the agricultural and industrial modes of human existence principally involve the organization and concentration of matter using energy to overcome the inevitable tendency towards disorganization and diffusion ( in other words overcome the second law of thermodynamics ) .
The main difference lies in the fact that in the agricultural mode human work is an integral part of the energy flow whereas in the industrial mode human energy is replaced to a large extent by energy obtained from burning fossil fuels .
It is normally acknowledged in peak - oil circles ( at least amongst those who do see the decline in fossil fuels as leading to a decline in industrial civilization ) that the aftermath of peak - oil would witness the come - back of human labour as a prominent source of energy for economic activities .
And this may very well happen for the simple reason that individuals would have no other choice .
But it is worth looking at the psychological context in which this might happen if for no other reason but that our sanity may depend on doing so .
And history is a good place to begin doing that .
It appears to me that throughout history humans have always distinguished between physical and mental work .
It is a felt experience for most of us that we would rather be doing mental work as opposed to physical work .
One could argue that most of us would rather do no work at all if our sustenance and comforts are somehow guaranteed .
While that may be the case at the psychological level , at an empirical level it appears to me that a farmer would rather take up the job of a bank teller given the same remuneration , than continue with farming .
Irrespective of why this might be the case , this phenomenon implies that it ought to be easier to find humans willing to do work involving less physical labour compared to more .
And yet , most human societies historically have privileged mental work over physical work .
Almost universally work involving a greater component of mental work lead to greater surplus accumulation and a more comfortable life .
To me this is a conundrum and has serious implications for the coming post - peak world .
A clear indication of this preference can be seen in the themes found in the world 's folk literature .
No matter which corner of the world one looks at , one is likely to find many folk tales that begin with a clever and intelligent weaver or woodcutter who uses his mental prowess to end up as the prince or the prime minister of his country .
On the other hand the chances of finding a tale in which the king ends up living happily as a labouring peasant are almost nil .
This relative popularity of mental work compared to physical work has been a tremendous force – a kind of psychological energy – that has fueled our transition from a hunter - gatherer to agrarian and then to industrial modes of existence .
A significant example of how the relative popularity of mental work compared to physical work has defined the very fabric of most societies is to look at India .
In India the principal form of social stratification , namely the caste system , appears to be based on the crucial distinction between mental and physical work .
For those who are unaware of the main elements of the caste system ( or varnashram as it was referred to in Sanskrit ) , humans were divided into four varnas ( categories ) which was determined by their profession or the kind of work done by them .
This division was hierarchical and defined ( for as long as it was possible to move from one varna to another ) a direction for human aspiration .
Thus at the top were the Brahmanas ( the Brahmins ) whose work was predominantly intellectual in nature , as teachers , priests , philosophers , etc .
In the next category were the Kshatriyas who had jobs in administration and governance .
At a lower level were the Vaishyas who were involved in business and trade .
At the lowest level were the Shudras who consisted of artisans , farmers and other professions all involving a significant amount of manual labour .
It should be of interest that each of these varnas were further divided into several sub-castes also organized in an internal hierarchy .
The relative position of the sub - caste within the varna had much to do with the manual labour component of the work that its members did .
So for instance , the priests involved in conducting the rituals in a temple had higher status than those who were tasked with keeping the temple premises in pristine condition .
Throughout the pre-industrial period various ecological and cultural limitations kept a lid on the natural human aspiration of moving away from physical labour and towards mental labour and this contributed to maintaining societal homeostasis .
It is well understood that in India the ossification of the caste system into a rigid and oppressive form determined by birth , served to severely curb the aspirations of ordinary people for millennia , but that it also provided stability and continuity to the political economy of the country even in the face of various invasions and political upheaval .
Across the world , the fall of empires and civilizations resulted mostly from political overreach ( as in Rome ) or straightforward ecological overshoot ( as in Easter Island ) or some combination of these reasons .
The relative role of physical and mental labour might have had only a marginal influence on the decline phase of pre-industrial civilizations .
Yet the industrial civilization has seen the most drastic change in the composition of people doing and willing to do physical work vis -a - vis mental work .
The proportion of America 's population doing agriculture has declined from around 50 % near the beginning of the 20th century to less than 5 % towards its end , no doubt aided by the explosion of less manual labour intense employment in the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy .
But in addition and most importantly , it has opened up newer aspirational possibilities to ordinary humans that one could not even dream of in the pre-industrial age .
A recent survey indicates that 40 % of India 's farmers are willing to quit farming since they find it unprofitable .
However in my own experience the number is closer to 100 % when real alternatives are available , and economics is only part of the reason .
Aspirational changes brought about by education and mass - media are at least as crucial a component as the economic crisis afflicting agriculture .
A subtle version of this same phenomenon is the shift , amongst those who continue to be in agriculture , from food crops to cash crops .
Even when cash crops are plagued by highly uncertain and volatile price swings , cash crops are preferred since they involve less manual labour .
A deindustrialising society will therefore need to not only deal with the scarcity of material resources but also work against the prevailing cognitive current of privileging non-manual labour on a scale unprecedented in human history .
The problematic part is that this is not merely a political arrangement , but a manifestation of the individual 's preference and is central to the aspirations of millions of humans today .
What this implies is that the breakdown of the industrial civilization will also witness an unprecedented cognitive breakdown as well .
A variety of questions can be asked on how this will play out and what adaptive mechanisms we have at our disposal at both the individual and the collective levels .
I hope to explore these and other issues concerning the relationship between our material and cognitive predicaments in future essays , and I hope that it will help the TOD readership to address these questions with much greater intensity than what it has done so far .

Ms Lloyd Platt said : “ We hope through the vouchers that we can offer clients all the practical options available to them – divorce being only one of the options . ”
For Richard Crane , the " new normal " in the labor market began when he was laid off from a New Jersey battery plant in the summer of 2006 .
Mr. Crane had been earning more than $ 100,000 a year operating heavy machinery at Delco , a former unit of General Motors .
He worked there for 23 years , since graduating from high school .
But when he lost his job he was thrust into a netherworld of part - time gigs : working the registers at Taco Bell , organizing orders at McDonald 's , whatever he could find .
" I thought it would be temporary , " says Mr. Crane , 49 years old .
Three years later , he is selling outdoor furniture by day and pumping gas by night , while worrying about his skills atrophying and spending scant time with his teenage son .
He makes about a third of his former pay .
Unemployed , Underemployed Pile Up Data on the rising rate .
More interactive graphics and photos
Mr. Crane is part of a growing group of underemployed -- people in part - time jobs who want full - time work or people in jobs that do n't employ their skills .
Since the recession began two years ago , the number of people involuntarily working part - time jobs has more than doubled to 9.3 million , according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , the highest number on record .
The proliferation of underemployed could represent a profound reordering of the employment structure .
Many people who had comfortable full - time jobs with benefits and advancement opportunities now are cobbling together smaller jobs often at lower pay , in a shift that economists say could become permanent for many individuals stuck in the cycle .
Underemployment , along with unemployment , is widely seen as a force slowing the economic recovery .
The trend has been building for years , says Robert Reich , who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton and now is a professor of public policy at the University of California , Berkeley .
" For decades , workers have been watching their salaries and benefits erode , " says Mr. Reich , who took an 8 % pay cut last week , along with the rest of the Berkeley faculty .
" We are subjecting millions of people to a standard of living below that which they could achieve if the economy were at full capacity , " he says .
" Underemployment means that many more people who can't spend as much as they otherwise would . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke last week lamented in a speech to the Economic Club of New York that the number of underemployed is rising much faster than during previous recessions .
And the average workweek has fallen to 33 hours , the lowest level in the post - World War II period .
" These data suggest that the excess supply of labor is even greater than indicated by the unemployment rate alone , " Mr. Bernanke said .
The unemployment rate is now 10.2 % .
Scott Pollack
Among the underemployed is Marty Rasmussen of Walnut Creek , Calif. , who was a banking executive for more than 15 years .
He and his wife earned a combined income of more than $ 250,000 a year .
As a hobby , he built cabinets and furniture .
Two years ago , he was laid off by a big bank in San Francisco .
While job - hunting , he volunteered to build cabinets for a local Lutheran church , and some fellow parishioners hired him to do work .
His onetime hobby became his sole source of income .
In the last year , he earned more than $ 10,000 replacing windows and installing crown molding .
He just finished a pair of nightstands commissioned by a friend paying $ 700 .
His wife also lost her job this year and is collecting unemployment benefits .
" It is hard transitioning from hobbyist , because I 'm used to giving my work as gifts , " he says .
State labor officials and economists generally label the underemployed as those who are working part - time when they would prefer full - time work , as well as people who are working beneath their skill level .
My concern is that we older fellows are competing for and winning the same jobs that our kids would normally take .
What becomes of them ?

Federal figures on the underemployed , however , do n't count that second group -- those who are overqualified for their jobs .
Still , the government 's broadest measure of labor underutilization -- known as the U6 -- has more than doubled in the two years since the recession began to 17.5 % , and it is up from 12 % just a year ago , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
This means that nearly one in five people are either unemployed , involuntarily working part - time or " marginally attached " -- they want jobs but have n't searched in at least a month .
It also counts " discouraged workers " who have stopped searching .
" The number would be much higher if we included the mechanical engineers working at 7 - Eleven , " says Heidi Shierholz , who studies underemployment at the Economic Policy Institute , a left - leaning Washington think tank .
Melanie Donahoe might be one of them .
The 56 - year - old mother of three who lives in Stuyvesant , N.Y , has watched her gross income as a self - employed jeweler shrink from a peak of $ 55,000 to $ 40,000 when the recession set in , to perhaps $ 25,000 this year .
" Between the recession and the high price of gold , it just keeps slipping and slipping , " she says .
This summer , she signed on for work as a government census taker , which paid $ 15 an hour and tided her over for a few months .
Then , she joined a local Lowe 's as a part - time cashier , earning $ 9 an hour .
She hopes it leads to full - time work .
After being laid off by the New Jersey battery plant in 2006 , Mr. Crane took a job stocking shelves at Costco in the fall of 2006 .
His pay was $ 10.76 an hour -- the same money he earned when he was hired by Delco in 1983 , just out of high school .
" It 's sad , " says Mr. Crane , who had been earning about $ 28 per hour at Delco , before overtime .
In late 2007 , he took a job at Lowe 's while working at a series of fast - food jobs on the side , as well as a stint at Pathmark supermarket .
He still works at Lowe's , earning $ 15.96 an hour selling lawnmowers , outdoor furniture and Christmas ornaments .
At night , he pumps gas at a Quick Check for $ 13.70 an hour .
Typically , he works between 61 and 63 hours per week .
It would n't be so bad , he says , if the hours were consecutive .
But with the gap between jobs , he can only sleep a few hours a night now -- sometimes just an hour .
Last week , he managed to clock 87 hours and barely saw his son .
" That 's all I do -- every day -- I just keep working , " he says .
" I 've got to .

His wife , who had been a stay - at - home - mother , also took a job .
She earns about $ 20,000 working at a nursing home .
Last year , they collectively earned of about $ 42,000 .
This year , they expect between $ 48,000 and $ 50,000 .
Mr. Crane has applied for hundreds of jobs , among them sanitation worker , bridge painter , tree cutter and transit worker .
There were some factory openings , he says , but they pay less than Lowe's .
Over the summer , Mr. Crane 's electricity was shut off , he says .
He paid the bill and had it restored .
But he did n't pay the gas , which is about $ 175 per month .
Instead , all summer , they cooked on the grill outside .
Mr. Crane bought an electric hot water heater for baths and laundry .
They lived that way for three months before finally turning the gas back on .
Ultimately , many economists expect the underemployment situation to improve , but not for a few years .
Companies are cutting back hours , so as they pick up , they are likely to return hours to current staff before hiring new people .
" This whole pool of people with reduced hours means recovery of employment is that much farther off , " says Ms. Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute .
Eventually , employment will pick up .
But for people like Mr. Crane , the current situation could become permanent .
As they work part - time , they have less time to look for work .
Their résumés , meanwhile , become spotty .
" If you have a string of jobs beneath your skills , it erodes your resume and marketability , " says Ms. Shierholz .
Mr. Crane no longer sees his new life as temporary .
He no longer dreams of going and fixing equipment at the factory and operating big machines .
" My new goal is to become a manager at Lowe's , " he says .
" That will pay $ 17 an hour .
I 'm hoping this happens in the next couple of years , by the time my son is in high school . "

Serbia 's President Tadic ( left ) handed over the application on Tuesday Serbia has formally submitted its application to join the 27 - nation EU , in a move to end years of isolation .
President Boris Tadic handed over the application in Stockholm to Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt of Sweden , current holder of the EU presidency .
The EU is granting 50 m euros ( £ 45 m ; $ 71 m ) to Serbia in budget support .
But Serbia still has to cross a major hurdle - the capture of two remaining war fugitives , before membership negotiations will begin in earnest .
Visa - free travel Serbia feels it has built up a certain momentum on its path to the EU in the past few weeks , the BBC's Belgrade correspondent Mark Lowen says .
ANALYSIS By Mark Lowen , BBC Belgrade correspondent
It was Serbia that decided this was the right time to apply , but some countries - notably the Netherlands and the UK - think it is premature ...
The authorities in Belgrade feel strongly that the momentum of the last few weeks needs to be kept up .
Opinion polls suggest overwhelming Serb support for joining the EU , at 60 - 70 % .
But a majority also opposes the hunt for Gen Mladic , seeing him as a national hero .
An important trade pact with the bloc has now come into force and since 19 December Serbs have enjoyed visa - free travel to most EU countries .
The EU says that in 2010 Serbia will receive a second instalment of 50 m euros in budget support , as well as a loan of 200 m euros .
But Serbia 's attempts to gain membership have been hampered by concerns , particularly in the Netherlands , over its failure to capture the two remaining war fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , based in The Hague .
Chief among them is the former Bosnian Serb military commander , Ratko Mladic .
Earlier this month the UN's chief war crimes prosecutor said Serbia 's co-operation with ICTY was " progressing " .
Belgrade has handed over all the necessary documents .
However , in his report to the UN , Serge Brammertz said Serbia must continue searching for both Gen Mladic and Goran Hadzic , who is wanted for war crimes in Croatia .
Long road ahead Belgrade is now pinning its hopes on the next report by the chief prosecutor , expected in June .
Ratko Mladic is thought to be in hiding in Serbia Our correspondent says a long road lies ahead : it is likely to take at least four years before the hand of EU membership extends to Serbia .
Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav republic to have joined the EU so far .
That took place in 2004 , and its neighbour Croatia is on track to be the next to join , in 2011 or 2012 .
It was Serbia that decided this was the right time to apply , but some countries - notably the Netherlands and the UK - think it is premature , our correspondent reports .
They believe Serbia should have waited for its Stabilisation and Association Agreement ( SAA ) with the EU to be ratified .
The authorities in Belgrade feel strongly that the momentum of the last few weeks needs to be kept up , Mark Lowen says .
Opinion polls suggest overwhelming Serb support for joining the EU , at 60 - 70 % .
But a majority also opposes the hunt for Gen Mladic , seeing him as a national hero .
The granting of visa - free travel to Serbs does not apply to those living in Kosovo .
The territory 's independence declaration is not recognised by Serbia , but neither do five EU member states recognise it , so that is not officially an obstacle to Serbia joining the EU , our correspondent says .
Serbia has signed a security co-operation agreement with Eulex , the EU police and justice mission in Kosovo .
But Belgrade is treading carefully , conscious that Serb nationalists feel their country 's interests were betrayed in Kosovo .
By forming closer links with Serbia and encouraging reforms there the EU is showing it is serious about Serbia 's membership bid , our correspondent adds .
It is also a way of keeping together a region that is still quite fragile after the wars of the 1990s , he says .

Five years ago , a tragedy occurred in American journalism : Investigative reporter Gary Webb – who had been ostracized by his own colleagues for forcing a spotlight back onto an ugly government scandal they wanted to ignore – was driven to commit suicide .
But the tragedy had a deeper meaning .
Webb ’s death on the night of Dec. 9 , 2004 , came as the U.S. press corps was at a nadir , having recently aided and abetted President George W. Bush in taking the country to war in Iraq under false pretenses .
The press corps also had performed abysmally in Bush ’s two presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004 , hesitant to take on the powerful Bush Family .
In retrospect , Webb ’s suicide could be viewed as an exclamation point on that sorry era , which had begun a quarter century earlier with the rise of Ronald Reagan and the gradual retreat – under right - wing fire – of what had once been Washington ’s Watergate / Pentagon Papers watchdog press corps .
Yet , five years after Webb ’s death , the U.S. news media continues to scrape along the bottom , still easily intimidated by the bluster of right - wing media attack groups and fast - talking neoconservatives – and still gullible in the face of lies and myths used to justify the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But the sad tale of Gary Webb remains instructive for anyone wanting to understand what went wrong with the U.S. news media and why much more work is needed to rebuild an independent press corps as a safeguard for the American Republic .
Webb ’s important historical role began in 1996 when his " Dark Alliance " investigative series for the San Jose Mercury News revived public interest in the CIA ’s tolerance of cocaine trafficking by President Reagan ’s beloved Nicaraguan contra rebels in the 1980s , at a time when Reagan was promoting a “ just say no / zero tolerance / war on drugs . ”
The scandal of contra cocaine trafficking and the CIA ’s protection of these crimes had surfaced in the 1980s , but the Big Three newspapers – New York Times , Washington Post and Los Angeles Times – paid the scandal little heed , mostly accepting the denials of Reagan administration insiders .
So , when Webb shed new light on the scandal in 1996 , the same newspapers subjected Webb to a merciless assault and rejoiced when Webb ’s editors caved in to the pressure and forced Webb to quit in disgrace .
Nevertheless ,
Webb ’s series prompted an internal CIA investigation by Inspector General Frederick Hitz who issued two reports in 1998 containing devastating admissions about the CIA ’s knowledge and protection of contras known to be active in the cocaine trade .
The Big Three newspapers ’ response was mostly to downplay or ignore Hitz ’s findings , rather than to correct the record .
Because of this misused power of the Big Three – in this case , to protect the reputation of the Reagan administration and their own failings – Webb ’s reputation was never rehabilitated .
He was unable to find decent - paying work in his profession ; his marriage fell apart ; he struggled to pay bills ; and he was faced with a move out of a modest rental house near Sacramento .
A Tragedy
So , on Dec. 9 , 2004 , the 49 - year - old Webb typed out suicide notes to his ex-wife and his three children ; he laid out a certificate for his cremation ; he taped a note on the door telling movers – who were coming the next morning – to instead call 911 .
Webb then took out his father ’s pistol and shot himself in the head .
The first shot was not lethal , so he fired once more .
Even with Webb ’s death , the big newspapers that had played key roles in his destruction could n’t bring themselves to show Webb any mercy .
After Webb ’s body was found , I received a call from a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who knew that I was one of Webb ’s few journalistic colleagues who had defended him and his work .
Back in 1985 for the Associated Press , I also had co-written with Brian Barger the first story exposing the contra-cocaine scandal .
I told the L.A. Times reporter that American history owed a great debt to Gary Webb because he had forced out important facts about Reagan - era crimes .
But I added that the L.A. Times would be hard - pressed to write an honest obituary because the newspaper had not published a single word on the contents of the CIA inspector general ’s final report , which had largely vindicated Webb .
To my disappointment but not my surprise , I was correct .
The L.A . Times ran a mean - spirited obituary that made no mention of either my defense of Webb , nor the CIA ’s admissions in 1998 .
The Times obituary was republished in other newspapers , including the Washington Post .
In effect , Webb ’s suicide had enabled senior editors at the Big Three newspapers to breathe a little easier , since one of the few people who understood the true and ugly story of not only the Reagan administration ’s protection of the contra- cocaine trafficking but the U.S. media ’s complicity in the cover - up was now silenced .
To this day , none of the journalists or media critics who participated in the destruction of Gary Webb has been punished for their actions .
None has faced the sort of humiliation that Webb had to endure .
Instead , the death of Gary Webb and the circumstances surrounding it have remained one of the U.S. news media ’s dirty little secrets .
In recognition of that continuing injustice , I believe it ’s fitting on the fifth anniversary of Webb ’s death to remind the American people of what Webb ’s work helped expose .
Dark Alliance
Webb ’s suicide in 2004 had its roots in his fateful decision eight years earlier to write a three - part series for the San Jose Mercury News that challenged a potent conventional wisdom shared by the elite U.S. news organizations – that one of the most shocking scandals of the 1980s just could n’t possibly be true .
Webb ’s “ Dark Alliance ” series , published in August 1996 , revived the decade - old allegations that the Reagan administration in the 1980s had tolerated and protected cocaine smuggling by its client army of Nicaraguan rebels known as the contras .
Though substantial evidence of the contra crimes had surfaced in the mid-1980s ( initially in an article that Brian Barger and I wrote for the Associated Press in December 1985 and later at hearings conducted by Sen. John Kerry ) , the major news outlets had refused to take the disclosures seriously .
For instance , reflecting the dominant attitude toward Kerry and his work on the contra - cocaine scandal , Newsweek dubbed the Massachusetts senator a “ randy conspiracy buff . ”
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Kerry ’s Contra - Cocaine Chapter ” or Robert Parry ’s Lost History : Contras , Cocaine , the Press & Project Truth . ]
Thus , the truth of the contra - cocaine scandal was left in that netherworld of uncertainty , largely proven with documents and testimony but never accepted by Official Washington .
But Webb ’s series thrust the scandal back into prominence by connecting the contra-cocaine trafficking to the spread of crack that ravaged Los Angeles and other American urban centers in the 1980s .
For that reason , African - American communities were up in arms as were their elected representatives in the Congressional Black Caucus .
Webb ’s “ Dark Alliance ” series offered a unique opportunity for the major news outlets to finally give the contra-cocaine scandal the attention it deserved .
But that would have required some painful self - criticism among Washington journalists whose careers had advanced in part because they had not offended Reagan supporters who had made an art out of punishing out - of - step reporters for pursuing controversies like the contra -cocaine scandal .
Also , by the mid-1990s , a powerful right - wing news media had taken shape and was in no mood to accept the notion that many of President Reagan ’s beloved contras were drug traffickers .
That recognition would have cast a shadow over the Reagan Legacy , which the Right was busy elevating into mythic status .
There was the turf issue , too .
Since Webb ’s stories coincided with the emergence of the Internet as an alternate source for news and the San Jose Mercury News was at the center of Silicon Valley , the big newspapers saw a threat to their historic dominance as the nation ’s gatekeepers for what information should be taken seriously .
Plus , the major media ’s focus in the mid-1990s was on scandals swirling around Bill Clinton , such as some firings at the White House Travel Office and convoluted questions about his old Whitewater real - estate deal .
In other words , there was little appetite to revisit scandals from the Reagan years and there were strong motives to disparage what Webb had written .
Rev. Moon ’s Newspaper
It fell to Rev. Sun Myung Moon ’s right - wing Washington Times to begin the counterattack .
The Washington Times turned to some ex-CIA officials , who had participated in the contra war , to refute the drug charges .
Then – in a pattern that would repeat itself over the next decade – the Washington Post and other mainstream newspapers quickly lined up behind the right - wing press .
On Oct. 4 , 1996 , the Washington Post published a front - page article knocking down Webb ’s story , although acknowledging that some contra operatives did help the cocaine cartels .
The Post ’s approach was twofold : first , it presented the contra - cocaine allegations as old news – “ even CIA personnel testified to Congress they knew that those covert operations involved drug traffickers , ” the Post sniffed – and second , the Post minimized the importance of the one contra smuggling channel that Webb had highlighted – that it had not “ played a major role in the emergence of crack . ”
A Post side - bar story dismissed African - Americans as prone to “ conspiracy fears . ”
Soon , the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times joined in the piling on against Gary Webb .
The big newspapers made much of the CIA ’s internal reviews in 1987 and 1988 – almost a decade earlier – that supposedly had cleared the spy agency of a role in contra-cocaine smuggling .
But the CIA ’s decade - old cover - up began to weaken on Oct. 24 , 1996 , when CIA Inspector General Hitz conceded before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the first CIA probe had lasted only 12 days , the second only three days .
He promised a more thorough review .
Nevertheless , Webb was becoming the target of media ridicule .
Influential Post media critic Howard Kurtz mocked Webb for saying in a book proposal that he would explore the possibility that the contra war was primarily a business to its participants .
“ Oliver Stone , check your voice mail , ” Kurtz smirked .
[ Washington Post , Oct. 28 , 1996 ]
Webb ’s suspicion was not unfounded , however .
Indeed , White House aide Oliver North ’s chief contra emissary Rob Owen had made the same point in a March 17 , 1986 , message about the contra leadership .
“ Few of the so - called leaders of the movement … really care about the boys in the field , ” Owen wrote .
“ THIS WAR HAS BECOME A BUSINESS TO MANY OF THEM . ” [ Capitalization in the original . ]
In other words , Webb had been right and Kurtz had been wrong .
Mercury News Retreat
Still , although Kurtz and other big - name journalists may have been ignorant of key facts about the contra war , they still pilloried Gary Webb .
The ridicule also had a predictable effect on the executives of the Mercury News .
By early 1997 , executive editor Jerry Ceppos was in retreat .
On May 11 , 1997 , Ceppos published a front - page column saying the series “ fell short of my standards . ”
He criticized the stories because they “ strongly implied CIA knowledge ” of contra connections to U.S. drug dealers who were manufacturing crack - cocaine .
“ We did not have proof that top CIA officials knew of the relationship , ” Ceppos wrote .
The big newspapers and Reagan ’s defenders celebrated Ceppos ’s retreat as vindication of their own dismissal of the contra -cocaine stories .
Ceppos next pulled the plug on the Mercury News ’ continuing contra-cocaine investigation and reassigned Webb to a small office in Cupertino , California , far from his family .
Webb resigned the paper in disgrace .
For undercutting Webb and other Mercury News reporters working on the contra investigation , Ceppos was lauded by the American Journalism Review and was given the 1997 national “ Ethics in Journalism Award ” by the Society of Professional Journalists .
While Ceppos won raves , Webb watched his career collapse and his marriage break up .
Still , Gary Webb had set in motion internal government investigations that would bring to the surface long - hidden facts about how the Reagan administration had conducted the contra war .
The CIA published the first part of Inspector General Hitz ’s findings on Jan. 29 , 1998 .
Despite a largely exculpatory press release , Hitz ’s Volume
One admitted that not only were many of Webb ’s allegations true but that he actually understated the seriousness of the contra - drug crimes and the CIA ’s knowledge .
Hitz acknowledged that cocaine smugglers played a significant early role in the Nicaraguan contra movement and that the CIA intervened to block an image - threatening 1984 federal investigation into a San Francisco - based drug ring with suspected ties to the contras , the so - called “ Frogman Case . ”
On May 7 , 1998 , another disclosure shook the earlier presumptions of the Reagan administration ’s innocence .
Rep. Maxine Waters , a California Democrat , introduced into the Congressional Record a Feb. 11 , 1982 , letter of understanding between the CIA and the Justice Department .
The letter , which had been requested by CIA Director William Casey , freed the CIA from legal requirements that it must report drug smuggling by CIA assets , a provision that covered both the Nicaraguan contras and Afghan rebels who were fighting a Soviet - supported regime in Afghanistan and who were implicated in heroin trafficking .
Justice Report
The next break in the cover - up was a report by the Justice Department ’s Inspector General Michael Bromwich .
Given the hostile climate surrounding Webb ’s series , Bromwich ’s report also opened with criticism of Webb .
But , like the CIA ’s Volume One , the contents revealed new details about government wrongdoing .
According to evidence cited by Bromwich , the Reagan administration knew almost from the outset of the contra war that cocaine traffickers permeated the paramilitary operation .
The administration also did next to nothing to expose or stop the crimes .
Bromwich ’s report revealed example after example of leads not followed , corroborated witnesses disparaged , official law - enforcement investigations sabotaged , and even the CIA facilitating the work of drug traffickers .
The report showed that the contras and their supporters ran several parallel drug - smuggling operations , not just the one at the center of Webb ’s series .
The report also found that the CIA shared little of its information about contra drugs with law - enforcement agencies and on three occasions disrupted cocaine - trafficking investigations that threatened the contras .
Though depicting a more widespread contra - drug operation than Webb had understood , the Justice report also provided some important corroboration about a Nicaraguan drug smuggler , Norwin Meneses , who was a key figure in Webb ’s series .
Bromwich cited U.S. government informants who supplied detailed information about Meneses ’s drug operation and his financial assistance to the contras .
For instance , Renato Pena , a money - and - drug courier for Meneses , said that in the early 1980s , the CIA allowed the contras to fly drugs into the United States , sell them and keep the proceeds .
Pena , who was the northern California representative for the CIA - backed FDN contra army , said the drug trafficking was forced on the contras by the inadequate levels of U.S. government assistance .
The Justice report also disclosed repeated examples of the CIA and U.S. embassies in Central America discouraging Drug Enforcement Administration investigations , including one into contra-cocaine shipments moving through the international airport in El Salvador .
Inspector General Bromwich said secrecy trumped all .
“ We have no doubt that the CIA and the U.S. Embassy were not anxious for the DEA to pursue its investigation at the airport , ” he wrote .
Despite the remarkable admissions in the body of these reports , the big newspapers showed no inclination to read beyond the criticism of Webb in the press releases .
Cocaine Crimes & Monica
By fall 1998 , Official Washington was obsessed with the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal , which made it easier to ignore even more stunning contra-cocaine disclosures in the CIA ’s Volume Two .
In Volume Two , published on Oct. 8 , 1998 , CIA Inspector General Hitz identified more than 50 contras and contra-related entities implicated in the drug trade .
He also detailed how the Reagan administration had protected these drug operations and frustrated federal investigations throughout the 1980s .
According to Volume Two , the CIA knew the criminal nature of its contra clients from the start of the war against Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
The earliest contra force , called ADREN or the 15th of September Legion , had chosen “ to stoop to criminal activities in order to feed and clothe their cadre , ” according to a June 1981 draft CIA field report .
According to a September 1981 cable to CIA headquarters , two ADREN members made the first delivery of drugs to Miami in July 1981 .
ADREN 's leaders included Enrique Bermudez and other early contras who would later direct the major contra army , the CIA - organized FDN .
Throughout the war , Bermudez remained the top contra military commander .
The CIA later corroborated the allegations about ADREN ’s cocaine trafficking , but insisted that Bermudez had opposed the drug shipments to the United States which went ahead nonetheless .
Ends and Means
The truth about Bermudez ’s supposed objections to drug trafficking , however , was less clear .
According to Hitz ’s Volume One , Bermudez enlisted Norwin Meneses , a large - scale Nicaraguan cocaine smuggler , to raise money and buy supplies for the contras .
Volume
One had quoted a Meneses associate , another Nicaraguan trafficker named Danilo Blandon , who told Hitz ’s investigators that he and Meneses flew to Honduras to meet with Bermudez in 1982 .
At the time , Meneses ’s criminal activities were well known in the Nicaraguan exile community .
But Bermudez told the cocaine smugglers that “ the ends justify the means ” in raising money for the contras .
After the Bermudez meeting , contra soldiers helped Meneses and Blandon get past Honduran police who briefly arrested them on drug - trafficking suspicions .
After their release , Blandon and Meneses traveled on to Bolivia to complete a cocaine transaction .
There were other indications of Bermudez ’s drug - smuggling tolerance .
In February 1988 , another Nicaraguan exile linked to the drug trade accused Bermudez of participation in narcotics trafficking , according to Hitz ’s report .
After the contra war ended , Bermudez returned to Managua , where he was shot to death on Feb. 16 , 1991 .
The murder has never been solved .
Along the Southern Front , in Costa Rica , the drug evidence centered on the forces of Eden Pastora , another leading contra commander .
But Hitz discovered that the U.S. government may have made matters worse .
Hitz revealed that the CIA put an admitted drug operative – known by his CIA pseudonym “ Ivan Gomez ” – in a supervisory position over Pastora .
Hitz reported that the CIA discovered Gomez ’s drug history in 1987 when Gomez failed a security review on drug - trafficking questions .
In internal CIA interviews , Gomez admitted that in March or April 1982 , he helped family members who were engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering .
In one case , Gomez said he assisted his brother and brother - in - law in transporting cash from New York City to Miami .
He admitted that he “ knew this act was illegal . ”
Later , Gomez expanded on his admission , describing how his family members had fallen $ 2 million into debt and had gone to Miami to run a money - laundering center for drug traffickers .
Gomez said “ his brother had many visitors whom [ Gomez ] assumed to be in the drug trafficking business . ”
Gomez ’s brother was arrested on drug charges in June 1982 .
Three months later , in September 1982 , Gomez started his CIA assignment in Costa Rica .
Years later , convicted drug trafficker Carlos Cabezas alleged that in the early 1980s , Ivan Gomez was the CIA agent in Costa Rica who was overseeing drug - money donations to the contras .
Gomez “ was to make sure the money was given to the right people [ the contras ] and nobody was taking ... profit they were n’t supposed to , ” Cabezas stated publicly .
But the CIA sought to discredit Cabezas at the time because he had trouble identifying Gomez ’s picture and put Gomez at one meeting in early 1982 before Gomez started his CIA assignment .
While the CIA was able to fend off Cabezas ’s allegations by pointing to these discrepancies , Hitz ’s report revealed that the CIA was nevertheless aware of Gomez ’s direct role in drug - money laundering , a fact the agency hid from Sen.
Kerry ’s investigation in 1987 .
The Bolivian Connection
There also was more about Gomez .
In November 1985 , the FBI learned from an informant that Gomez ’s two brothers had been large - scale cocaine importers , with one brother arranging shipments from Bolivia ’s infamous drug kingpin Roberto Suarez .
Suarez already was known as a financier of right - wing causes .
In 1980 , with the support of Argentine ’s hard - line anti-communist military regime , Suarez bankrolled a coup in Bolivia that ousted the elected left - of - center government .
The violent putsch became known as the Cocaine Coup because it made Bolivia the region 's first narco - state .
Bolivia ’s government - protected cocaine shipments helped transform the Medellin cartel from a struggling local operation into a giant corporate - style business for delivering cocaine to the U.S. market .
Flush with cash in the early 1980s , Suarez invested more than $ 30 million in various right - wing paramilitary operations , including the contra forces in Central America , according to U.S. Senate testimony by an Argentine intelligence officer , Leonardo Sanchez - Reisse .
In 1987 , Sanchez - Reisse said the Suarez drug money was laundered through front companies in Miami before going to Central America .
There , other Argentine intelligence officers – veterans of the Bolivian coup – trained the contras .
Inspector General Hitz added another piece to the mystery of the Bolivian - contra connection .
One contra fund - raiser , Jose Orlando Bolanos , boasted that the Argentine government was supporting his contra activities , according to a May 1982 cable to CIA headquarters .
Bolanos made the statement during a meeting with undercover DEA agents in Florida .
He even offered to introduce them to his Bolivian cocaine supplier .
Containing the Scandal
Despite all this suspicious drug activity around Ivan Gomez and the contras , the CIA insisted that it did not unmask Gomez until 1987 , when he failed a security check and confessed his role in his family ’s drug business .
The CIA official who interviewed Gomez concluded that “ Gomez directly participated in illegal drug transactions , concealed participation in illegal drug transactions , and concealed information about involvement in illegal drug activity , " Hitz wrote .
But senior CIA officials still protected Gomez .
They refused to refer the Gomez case to the Justice Department , citing the 1982 DOJ - CIA agreement that spared the CIA from a legal obligation to report narcotics crimes by non-employees .
Gomez was an independent contractor who worked for the CIA .
The CIA eased Gomez out of the agency in February 1988 , without alerting law enforcement or the congressional oversight committees .
When questioned about the case nearly a decade later , one senior CIA official who had supported the gentle treatment of Gomez had second thoughts .
“ It is a striking commentary on me and everyone that this guy ’s involvement in narcotics did n’t weigh more heavily on me or the system , ” the official acknowledged .
A Medellin drug connection arose in another section of Hitz ’s report , when he revealed evidence suggesting that some contra trafficking may have been sanctioned by Reagan 's National Security Council .
The protagonist for this part of the contra-cocaine mystery was Moises Nunez , a Cuban - American who worked for Oliver North ’s NSC contra-support operation and for two drug - connected seafood importers , Ocean Hunter in Miami and Frigorificos de Puntarenas in Costa Rica .
Frigorificos de Puntarenas was created in the early 1980s as a cover for drug - money laundering , according to sworn testimony by two of the firm ’s principals – Carlos Soto and Medellin cartel accountant Ramon Milian Rodriguez .
Drug allegations were swirling around Moises Nunez by the mid-1980s .
His operation was one of the targets of our investigation at the AP in 1985 .
Finally reacting to these suspicions , the CIA questioned Nunez on March 25 , 1987 , about his alleged cocaine trafficking .
He responded by pointing the finger at his NSC superiors .
“ Nunez revealed that since 1985 , he had engaged in a clandestine relationship with the National Security Council , ” Hitz reported , adding :
“ Nunez refused to elaborate on the nature of these actions , but indicated it was difficult to answer questions relating to his involvement in narcotics trafficking because of the specific tasks he had performed at the direction of the NSC .
Nunez refused to identify the NSC officials with whom he had been involved . ”
After this first round of questioning , CIA headquarters authorized an additional session , but then senior CIA officials reversed the decision .
There would be no further efforts at “ debriefing Nunez . ”
Hitz noted that “ the cable [ from headquarters ] offered no explanation for the decision ” to stop the Nunez interrogation .
But the CIA ’s Central American task force chief Alan Fiers said the Nunez - NSC drug lead was not pursued “ because of the NSC connection and the possibility that this could be somehow connected to the Private Benefactor program [ the contra money handled by North ] .
A decision was made not to pursue this matter . ”
Joseph Fernandez , who had been the CIA ’s station chief in Costa Rica , later confirmed to congressional Iran - Contra investigators that Nunez “ was involved in a very sensitive operation ” for North ’s “ Enterprise . ”
The exact nature of that NSC - authorized activity has never been divulged .
At the time of the Nunez - NSC drug admissions and his truncated interrogation , the CIA ’s acting director was Robert M. Gates , who is now President Barack Obama ’s Defense Secretary .
Miami Vice
The CIA also worked directly with other drug - connected Cuban - Americans on the contra project , Hitz found .
One of Nunez ’s Cuban - American associates , Felipe Vidal , had a criminal record as a narcotics trafficker in the 1970s .
But the CIA still hired him to serve as a logistics coordinator for the contras , Hitz reported .
The CIA also learned that Vidal ’s drug connections were not only in the past .
A December 1984 cable to CIA headquarters revealed Vidal ’s ties to Rene Corvo , another Cuban - American suspected of drug trafficking .
Corvo was working with anti-communist Cuban Frank Castro , who was viewed as a Medellin cartel representative within the contra movement .
There were other narcotics links to Vidal .
In January 1986 , the DEA in Miami seized 414 pounds of cocaine concealed in a shipment of yucca that was going from a contra operative in Costa Rica to Ocean Hunter , the company where Vidal worked .
Despite the evidence , Vidal remained a CIA employee as he collaborated with Frank Castro ’s assistant , Rene Corvo , in raising money for the contras , according to a CIA memo in June 1986 .
By fall 1986 , Sen .
Kerry had heard enough rumors about Vidal to demand information about him as part of a congressional inquiry into contra drugs .
But the CIA withheld the derogatory information .
On Oct. 15 , 1986 , Kerry received a briefing from the CIA ’s Alan Fiers , who did n’t mention Vidal ’s drug arrests and conviction in the 1970s .
But Vidal was not yet in the clear .
In 1987 , the U.S. Attorney in Miami began investigating Vidal , Ocean Hunter and other contra-connected entities .
This prosecutorial attention worried the CIA .
The CIA ’s Latin American division felt it was time for a security review of Vidal .
But on Aug. 5 , 1987 , the CIA ’s security office blocked the review for fear that the Vidal drug information “ could be exposed during any future litigation . ”
As expected , the U.S. Attorney did request documents about “ contra - related activities ” by Vidal , Ocean Hunter and 16 other entities .
The CIA advised the prosecutor that “ no information had been found regarding Ocean Hunter , ” a statement that was clearly false .
The CIA continued Vidal ’s employment as an adviser to the contra movement until 1990 , virtually the end of the contra war .
Honduras Trafficking
Hitz revealed that drugs also tainted the highest levels of the Honduran - based FDN , the largest contra army .
Hitz found that Juan Rivas , a contra commander who rose to be chief of staff , admitted that he had been a cocaine trafficker in Colombia before the war .
The CIA asked Rivas , known as El Quiche , about his background after the DEA began suspecting that Rivas might be an escaped convict from a Colombian prison .
In interviews with CIA officers , Rivas acknowledged that he had been arrested and convicted of packaging and transporting cocaine for the drug trade in Barranquilla , Colombia .
After several months in prison , Rivas said , he escaped and moved to Central America where he joined the contras .
Defending Rivas , CIA officials insisted that there was no evidence that Rivas engaged in trafficking while with the contras .
But one CIA cable noted that he lived an expensive lifestyle , even keeping a $ 100,000 thoroughbred horse at the contra camp .
Contra military commander Bermudez later attributed Rivas ’s wealth to his ex-girlfriend ’s rich family .
But a CIA cable in March 1989 added that “ some in the FDN may have suspected at the time that the father - in - law was engaged in drug trafficking . ”
Still , the CIA moved quickly to protect Rivas from exposure and possible extradition to Colombia .
In February 1989 , CIA headquarters asked that DEA take no action “ in view of the serious political damage to the U.S. Government that could occur should the information about Rivas become public . ”
Rivas was eased out of the contra leadership with an explanation of poor health .
With U.S. government help , he was allowed to resettle in Miami .
Colombia was not informed about his fugitive status .
Contra Spokesman
Another senior FDN official implicated in the drug trade was its chief spokesman in Honduras , Arnoldo Jose “ Frank ” Arana .
The drug allegations against Arana dated back to 1983 when a federal narcotics task force put him under criminal investigation because of plans “ to smuggle 100 kilograms of cocaine into the United States from South America . ”
On Jan. 23 , 1986 , the FBI reported that Arana and his brothers were involved in a drug - smuggling enterprise , although Arana was not charged .
Arana sought to clear up another set of drug suspicions in 1989 by visiting the DEA in Honduras with a business associate , Jose Perez .
Arana ’s association with Perez , however , only raised new alarms .
If “ Arana is mixed up with the Perez brothers , he is probably dirty , ” the DEA responded .
Through their ownership of an air services company called SETCO , the Perez brothers were associated with Juan Matta Ballesteros , a major cocaine kingpin connected to the murder of a DEA agent , according to reports by the DEA and U.S. Customs .
Hitz reported that someone at the CIA scribbled a note on the DEA cable about Arana stating : “ Arnold Arana ... still active and working , we [ CIA ] may have a problem . ”
Despite its drug ties to Matta Ballesteros , SETCO emerged as the principal company for ferrying supplies to the contras in Honduras .
During congressional Iran- Contra hearings , FDN political leader Adolfo Calero testified that SETCO was paid from bank accounts controlled by Oliver North .
SETCO also received $ 185,924 from the State Department for ferrying supplies to the contras in 1986 .
Hitz found that other air transport companies , which were used by the contras , also were implicated in the cocaine trade .
Even FDN leaders suspected that they were shipping supplies to Central America aboard planes that might be returning with drugs .
Mario Calero , the chief of contra logistics , grew so uneasy about one air - freight company that he notified U.S. law enforcement that the FDN only chartered the planes for the flights south , not the return flights north .
Hitz found that some drug pilots simply rotated from one sector of the contra operation to another .
Donaldo Frixone , who had a drug record in the Dominican Republic , was hired by the CIA to fly contra missions from 1983 - 85 .
In September 1986 , however , Frixone was implicated in smuggling 19,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States .
In late 1986 or early 1987 , he went to work for Vortex , another U.S. - paid contra supply company linked to the drug trade .
A Fig Leaf
By the time that Hitz ’s Volume Two was published in fall 1998 , the CIA ’s defense against Webb ’s series had shrunk to a fig leaf : that the CIA did not conspire with the contras to raise money through cocaine trafficking .
But Hitz made clear that the contra war took precedence over law enforcement and that the CIA withheld evidence of contra crimes from the Justice Department , the Congress and even the CIA ’s own analytical division .
Besides tracing the evidence of contra - drug trafficking through the decade - long contra war , the inspector general interviewed senior CIA officers who acknowledged that they were aware of the contra - drug problem but did n’t want its exposure to undermine the struggle to overthrow Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
According to Hitz , the CIA had “ one overriding priority : to oust the Sandinista government .
… [ CIA officers ] were determined that the various difficulties they encountered not be allowed to prevent effective implementation of the contra program . ”
One CIA field officer explained , “ The focus was to get the job done , get the support and win the war . ”
Hitz also recounted complaints from CIA analysts that CIA operations officers handling the contras hid evidence of contra - drug trafficking even from the CIA ’s analysts .
Because of the withheld evidence , the CIA analysts incorrectly concluded in the mid-1980s that “ only a handful of contras might have been involved in drug trafficking . ”
That false assessment was passed on to Congress and the major news organizations – serving as an important basis for denouncing Gary Webb and his series in 1996 .
Although Hitz ’s report was an extraordinary admission of institutional guilt by the CIA , it passed almost unnoticed by the big American newspapers .
[ For more details on the report , see Parry ’s Lost History . ]
See No Evil
On Oct. 10 , 1998 , two days after Hitz ’s Volume Two was posted at the CIA ’s Internet site , the New York Times published a brief article that continued to deride Webb but acknowledged the contra - drug problem may have been worse than earlier understood .
Several weeks later , the Washington Post weighed in with a similarly superficial article .
The Los Angeles Times never published a story on the release of Volume Two .
To this day , no editor or reporter who missed the contra - cocaine story has been punished for his or her negligence .
Indeed , some of them rose to become top executives at their news organizations .
On the other hand , Gary Webb ’s career never recovered .
Unable to find decent - paying work in a profession where his past awards included a Pulitzer Prize , Webb grew despondent .
His marriage broke up .
By December 2004 , he found himself having to move out of his rented house near Sacramento .
Instead , Webb decided to end his life .
Webb ’s suicide offered the New York Times , the Washington Post and the L.A .
Times one more chance to set matters right , to revisit the CIA ’s admissions in 1998 and to exact some accountability from the Reagan - era officials implicated in the contra crimes .
But all that followed Gary Webb ’s death was more trashing of Gary Webb .
The L.A . Times ran its mean - spirited obituary that made no mention of the admissions in the CIA ’s Volume Two .
No one reading this obit would have understood the profound debt that American history owed to Gary Webb , who deserved the lion ’s share of the credit for forcing the CIA to make its extraordinary admissions .
Though a personal tragedy for his family and friends , Webb ’s suicide conveyed a larger message , too .
Gary Webb was a kind of canary in the American mine shaft .
His fate represented a warning about the dangers that can befall a nation whose journalists care more about their salaries and status than the truth and the public ’s right to know .
The fifth anniversary of Webb ’s death should be a moment for reflection , too , by progressives and independent - minded Americans that it is long past time to build media institutions that can support brave journalists who dare to tell difficult truths .

On his program Tuesday , MSNBC host Chris Matthews called former Vice President Dick Cheney a “ troll . ”
“ Well does he ever stop ? ” Matthews opined .
“ He ’s crawled troll - like out from under his bridge to say that President Obama is projecting weakness to our enemies . ”
“ He is really tough , ” Matthews added later .
“ I compare him to the troll that comes out from under the bridge and bites the ankle … ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Matthews , if you remember , tried to interdict Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson , who recently likened Vice President Cheney to a “ vampire ” on his program and said Cheney had blood “ dripping from his teeth . ”
Apparently the veteran newsanchor does n’t think Grayson is too far off .
On Tuesday ’s program , he called Cheney a troll — twice .
Matthews also called Cheney a “ troll under the bridge ” in May .
It might take a while to sink in , but the global warming cause is on the skids .
Two issues are taking the whole project down : it is getting cooler not warmer ( and hence the change of the rhetoric to a vague concern over “ climate change ” ) , and the email scandal of a few weeks back proved that this really is an opinion cartel with preset views not driven by science .
Oh sure , people are saying that climategate is not really very serious and is only being exploited by Fox News and the like .
And it ’s true that not all measures of global temperature show cooling and that the science can be complex .
On that basis , the New York Times urges us to ignore the outpouring .
“ It is also important not to let one set of purloined e-mail messages undermine the science and the clear case for action , in Washington and in Copenhagen . ”
Yes , a clear case .
Come on .
The whole political agenda of these people is now being seriously questioned .
It is no longer a slam - dunk case that we are going to have world central planning in order to control the climate and protect the holy earth from the effects of industrialization .
Oh , and tax us good and hard in the process .
But you know what is most tragic to me about this ?
This whole hysteria led to a fantastic diversion of energy on the left side of the political spectrum .
Instead of working against war and the police state , issues on which the left tends to be pretty good , instincts were diverted to the preposterous cause of creating a statist system for global thermometer management .
The effort to whip everyone up into a frenzy over this began more than ten years ago .
Every lefty fundraising letter harped on the issue , and demanded people commit their lives to it , explaining that if mother earth dies , then all is lost .
It is a more important issue than all the rest , the litmus test to determine whether you are a friend or an enemy .
This made it very difficult for libertarians to cooperate with the left over the last years .
Sure , there are some libertarian ideas for dealing with pollution , but none as compelling as central planning , and there was never any way that we would go along with that idea .
The costs associated with dismantling industrial civilization outweigh even the worst - case global - warming scenario .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
And methodologically , the whole thing was always nuts .
If we ca n’t determine cause and effect now with certainty , how in the heck will we be able to determine it after the world state controls our carbon emissions , and impoverishes us in the process ?
No one will ever be in a position to say whether the policy worked or failed .
That is not a good basis for enacting legislation .
Meanwhile , the left threw everything it had into this hysteria .
Protests , letters , billions in spending , frenzy , moral passion , mania , witch hunts — you name it .
You would swear that climate change was the issue of the millennium for these people .
Meanwhile , the police state has made unbelievable advances in the last ten years .
We all live today in fear of the state ’s “ security ” apparatus .
Airports have become living chapters in a dystopian novel .
The local police treat us like potential terrorists .
Crossing the US border is becoming reminiscent of East Germany .
You ca n’t go anywhere without your papers .
And where has the left been while the whole world is being Nazified ?
Worrying about my barbecue grill out back .
Then there is the war issue .
The scary George Bush started war after war and kept them going to bolster his own power and prestige , creating as many enemies as possible through provocations and making up enemies if he had to .
He funded a bubble that wrecked the economy and destroyed country after country in the name of justice and peace .
And what followed Bush ?
A president who repudiated this ghastly legacy ?
No , Obama is a supporter of the same wars and continues them , even ramps them up .
Does the left consider him a bad guy ?
Not really .
With a handful of exceptions , his critics on the left are friendly critics .
They are glad to put up with this because he is willing to do their bidding on the climate change front .
You think Democrat politicians do n’t exploit this ?
They surely do .
In this sense , the climate issue is much like the pro-life cause on the right .
If a politician pushes the correct buttons , it does n’t matter what else they say or do .
They are no longer looked at with a critical eye .
The American left has long forgotten its roots .
As Arthur Ekirch has explained , the left sold its soul to the state with the New Deal .
Whereas it once opposed regimentation and industrial management of society , it turned to support exactly that .
War was the next issue to go .
The New Left in the 1960s held out the hope of capturing some of that early love of liberty on the left , even the anarchist impulse , but the New Left did n’t last long .
It was eventually swallowed up by machine politics .
The left today that supports world government to stop climate change bears little resemblance to the left of 100 years ago , which favored civil liberties and social liberality and was willing to do anything to end war .
Now it has diverted its energies to a preposterously unworkable scheme based on pseudo - science .
This is a terrible tragedy .
The left still has much to contribute to American public life .
It can oppose the police state and the militarization of society .
It can favor human liberty in most every area of life , even if it has n’t made its peace with the free market .
Most of all , it can oppose American imperialism .
But before it recaptures the spirit of its youth , it has to get rid of the preposterous idea that it should support the total state to manage what every generation has always known is unmanageable .

Another New Year ’s Eve , another round of car torchings in France .
And another wave of reader complaints that we do n’t brand these arsonists as Muslims .
Robert Basler , who handles reader feedback , got so many emails in reaction to a Paris story on the New Year ’s torchings that he did a post on his blog Good , Bad and Ugly : Reader reaction to Reuters news .
These readers are convinced the people torching the cars were Muslims and this was an important fact we were hiding from them .
“ Just who do you think you are protecting , let alone informing , by leaving on that tiny little detail ? ” asks a reader named Hoss .
Reader K.K.S. writes : “ How many of the “ youths ” were Muslim ?
My guess is most …
What side is Reuters on ?
My guess is …
It is n’t the right one , the French one or the American one !!!
Reuters starts sounding more like Al Jereeza ( sic ) everyday ! ” A comment signed Dean asks : “ Were the youths who burned those cars in France Muslims ?
Is n’t that relevent ( sic ) to the story ? ”
What echoes through these comments is the force of conviction without proof .
The only point I agree with is that calling these people “ youths ” — following the French practice — does n’t tell us much about them .
We could have said “ vandals ” or “ delinquents ” or “ arsonists , ” which they certainly were .
But how do they know the perpetrators were Muslims or that a religious tag was relevant ?
As far as I can see , these readers do n’t live in France , speak its language , know its society and politics or visit its rough suburbs , as our reporters do .
They may not know that there are no official statistics on religious or ethnic backgrounds in France , so the statement they want us to make cannot be backed up with authority .
If despite all this , they have solid proof to back up their claims , they should send it in and we ’ll consider it .
We ’ve been down this road before .
During the suburban riots in late 2005 , some media ( and many blogs ) talked about “ Muslim riots ” or a “ Paris intifada ” and asked why we did n’t jump on this bandwagon .
We discussed that in a blog post here , spelling out that there were no specifically Islamic factors or demands in the protests , the areas were mixed neighbourhoods rather than Muslim ghettos and the unrest was an outburst by a multiethnic underclass against a society that has sidelined it .
Sure , there were Muslims among them — but there were non-Muslims as well .
What value do we add to a news story by using a questionable religious label to describe a political and socio-economic phenomenon ?
The traditional New Year ’s
Eve car torchings have some other factors not mentioned in that earlier blog post .
One of them is insurance fraud .
There are estimates that about 20 % of the torchings are actually arranged by owners who pay street gangs to torch their old cars so they can cash in on the insurance .
The Paris daily Le Monde says they pay them a few dozen euros and can be reimbursed up to 4,000 euros .
A 2008 law made it even easier to claim this refund .
If our story had gone deeper into motives , this would have been an interesting one to mention .
Another element that readers outside of France do not seem to understand is that political violence is as French as brie and baguettes .
It ’s not just poor people in the suburbs who lash out in anger then they feel the system has let them down .
Farmers have attacked trucks bringing in cheaper produce from Spain or Italy .
Trade unions have clashed with police trying to break up their road or rail blockades .
Militant ecologists destroy fields of genetically modified crops .
Students lash out against changes in education or labour laws .
Street demonstrations occasionally end with some protesters trashing shops and cafes .
So these car torchings are not an isolated phenomenon , but part of a larger pattern of political violence that goes back at least until the French Revolution .
The idea that we want to “ protect ” Muslims from bad publicity hardly holds water when you go back through some stories and posts the Paris bureau has done .
On this blog alone , we ’ve had posts about a French Muslim football team refusing to play gays , the problem of forced marriages in the Muslim community , a Muslim man who divorced his new wife for not being a virgin , the failures of the French Muslim Council or cases when Muslim men forbid doctors to treat their wives .
If the Muslim angle is relevant , we mention it .
It ’s hard not to conclude that people who send comments like those copied above want us to stop reporting on events in their complexity and start profiling people with biased simplicity .
Is that what our readers want ?

You can make marijuana capsules from your trim material .
They are a good way to ingest marijuana without having to eat “ the brownie . ”
You can purchase capsules at your local health food store ; buy the size most convenient for you to use .
I prefer smaller caps because you can always take another one if you are n’t feeling the effects enough and it may be uncomfortable if you ingest too much .
Start by heating trim in an oven or microwave until it is crispy .
Next , grind it up .
A coffee grinder does a good job .
After the blades spin let the dust settle before you open it .
Gently move the powder into a bowl and add enough olive oil to it until it has the consistency of cookie dough .
Fill the bottom of the capsule using your gloved hand and then cover it with the top half .
The caps are ready to enjoy .
Try one first .
You can store them for months in the refrigerator .
WARNING : If you are a vegetarian or a vegan , check the label first .
Some capsules are made with gelatin , which comes from cows .
Fantasy as a genre is often unfairly maligned .
While there are plenty of authors who seem to be paid by the word and are only concerned with churning out volume , there are many authors producing fantastic works that transcend genre and often are even worthy of the word literature .
While there were many worthy contenders , here are what we consider to be the 10 greatest fantasy series of all time .
10 . The Wheel Of Time by Robert Jordan
I could probably write several pages on what ’s wrong with The Wheel of Time ( Jordan never could write female characters , the quality fell off a cliff after book four , the series should have ended many , many books ago , etc. , etc. ) , but the positives of the series greatly outweigh the negatives .
The Wheel of Time was made for those who like their fantasy writ large , and The Wheel of Time fulfills that desire epicly .
You wo n’t find a more in depth work ( which has it ’s downsides as well , every new book release begs for a rereading of the incredibly long series since it ’s nearly impossible to keep track of every minor character ) and Jordan clearly takes as much pleasure in world building as any fantasy author since Tolkien .
As previously mentioned , WoT has a huge cast , a fully realized world with dozens of races and nations , and a huge tapestry of plot lines that combine to form one of the greatest fantasy series of all time .
It ’s a shame that Jordan did n’t live to complete it , but hopefully Brandon Sanderson will bring the series to a satisfying conclusion .
9 . The Dark Tower by Stephen King
The Dark Tower actually shares some similarities with The Wheel of Time .
In both series the first four books are the strongest , and you also get the sense with both Robert Jordan and Stephen King that they did n’t quite know how to end their creation , which led to a very controversial ending in The Dark Tower ’s case along with some questionable decisions by King like his self - insertion in the story .
That being said , like The Wheel of Time , the pluses outweigh the minuses in the case of The Dark Tower series .
King has created one of the most iconic fantasy characters of all time in the Gunslinger Roland and the world ( dimension ? alternate universe ? ) he creates , with all of it ’s similarities to our reality , is lush and feels tangible .
It ’s too bad that Stephen King does n’t dabble more in fantasy , because he clearly has a knack for world building .
Not to mention everything he writes seems to be phone book sized , which would fit right in with the fantasy genre .
8. The Farseer by Robin Hobb
Zombies !
Sort of ; the big threat in The Farseer trilogy comes from the villain turning the people of the Six Duchies into Forged ones , a type of zombification that removes all emotion from someone .
That alone would probably get The Farseer on my list as I ’m a pretty big zombiephile , but the writing and story here are both top notch .
The premise sounds a little stock ( boy grows up never knowing his mother , turns out to be a royal bastard , etc. etc. ) but the predictability stops there .
Hobb really fleshes out her main character , making him one of the more real characters I have had the pleasure of reading .
7. Discworld by Terry Pratchett
Terry Pratchett ’s Discworld might not have the gravitas of other fantasy works , but it makes our list by virtue of being pure fun .
Pratchett is a rare thing in the fantasy niche – an honestly good writer who masterfully parodies the genre while still creating an internally consistent world that is interesting and enjoyable to read .
If you ’ve never read a Discworld book but feel interested I ’d recommend getting cracking – the series is up to 37 books as of the end of 2009 .
6. Earthsea by Ursula LeGuin
Ursula LeGuin is one of the more literary writers you will find writing fantasy .
Her Earthsea Cycle takes place in a world of uncharted sea that contains a huge archipelago of islands .
The books are full of lyrical prose that bring to mind Tolkien style fantasy .
LeGuin does n’t beat you over the head with normal fantasy tropes , the Earthsea Cycle is understated and an intriguing story that just happens to take place in a fantastical world .
5. Memory , Sorrow and Thorn by Tad Williams
Memory , Sorrow and Thorn takes place in a world not entirely different from our own , drawing upon history and folklore to create a new story .
Reading this series you will find elements of Arthurian England , Nordic stories and religion ( including a Christ figure that was executed by being nailed upside - down to a tree , leading to the formation of this world ’s main religion which is a mixture of Christianity and Norse mythology ) , and many other parallels to our own world .
This is high fantasy at it ’s best , writ large and with bold strokes .
If you enjoy Tolkien , Robert Jordan , and other similar writers check out Tad Williams who does things somewhat similarly , and often arguably better .
4. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
When considering a ranking of the greatest fantasy series of all time , the question of Harry Potter is a thorny one .
There ’s inevitably a backlash when something is as popular as Rowling ’s work , and add to that the fact that the series is ostensibly meant for children and you have a case that naturally inspires a lot of debate .
I ’m not sure I believe Rowling did anything particularly new with Harry Potter , but a work does n’t necessarily have to be innovative for it to be great .
Nearly every fantasy series owes a debt to Tolkien for instance , but that does n’t mean Tolkien has written the only work of fantasy that matters .
Rowling did n’t really come up with anything new , but her execution was peerless , and the connection she made with tens of millions of readers is laudable .
People will be reading Harry Potter for decades to come , and I ’m not sure a better introduction to fantasy could be found .
3. Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
The king , you knew Tolkien would be showing up here sooner or later .
The real surprise is that he ’s not number one , which is n’t so much an indictment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as it is praise for the top two .
Gallons of ink have been spilled when it comes to Tolkien .
I ’m not sure any other genre of fiction owes as much to one person as fantasy owes to Tolkien .
Even today in our 21st century life Tolkien touches many different avenues of entertainment , including ( obviously ) books , movies , role playing games , and video games .
You ’d think with his trilogy being such well worn territory by now that it would have lost some luster , but it ’s actually still a fantastically good read , and if you have n’t made the effort yet because it seems old or you ’ve seen the movies you really should .
The payoff is definitely worth the time .
2. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe
The Book of the New Sun is a novel written in four parts .
It is written in first person by a man named Severian .
His profession is torturer and the books chronicle his rise to power as ruler of the world .
The world is our world , but set in a distant future where the sun has begun to cool and dim .
The books are rare in the fantasy genre in that they have invited serious analysis and literary criticism .
The Book of the New Sun starts with a killer premise and more than delivers .
I came to the series only recently and count it as one of the greatest reads I have ever had , fantasy or no .
It is a more challenging work than most “ wizards and knights ” fantasy , but oh so worth it .
1. A Song Of Ice And Fire by George R.R. Martin
It ’s not completely out of the realm of possibility that this series has seen a premature end , and yet I still would call it the greatest fantasy series of all time .
Martin is standing on the shoulders of giants here certainly , Tolkien especially I think , but his series is mature in ways that others simply can’t match .
For some reason the parallel that enters my mind is the television series
The Wire , a show that at first glance looks like a normal police procedural but actually goes so much more in depth when it comes to realism that it ’s practically it ’s own genre .
The same holds true for A Song of Ice and Fire , where despite the fantastical setting , people behave like real people with real motivations for their actions .
In a genre where many writers build fantastically deep worlds only to fill them with characters who are mostly cliche , Martin rises above the crowd , and that ’s why , even if he never does get around to finishing it , we think A Song of Ice and Fire is the greatest fantasy series of all time .
NAIROBI — More than 1,400 civilians were deliberately killed this year in eastern Congo during two successive military operations , and the United Nations urgently needs “ a new approach to protect civilians , ” according to a Human Rights Watch report to be released Monday .
The report , based on months of research and more than 600 interviews , paints a bleak and brutal picture of eastern Congo , which has been ravaged by civil war for more than a decade .
The presence of about 19,000 United Nations peacekeepers has not seemed able to stop the slaughter .
Among the atrocities listed by Human Rights Watch researchers were cases of girls being summarily killed after being raped , and other victims being tied together before their throats were slit .
The 183 - page report also said : “ Government representatives said the operations would bring peace and security to the region .
They have not . ”
It called the attacks against civilians “ vicious and widespread . ”
' I 'm too old for all that standing up and singing lark '
My manager rings .
" I 've got you a gig in Eastbourne tomorrow . "
" Not interested , " I say .
" My back 's killing me and I 'm too old for all that standing up and singing lark . "
" It 'll be fine .
It 's at an old people 's home and there 'll be only 30 there .
Or 29 , if nice Mr Briggs does n't make it through the next 24 hours . "
" Sounds more like it .
They wo n't be all pissed and rowdy , will they ? "
" Nah – they 're given their meds at 6.30 pm , so they 'll be good as gold . "
" I still want a rider in the contract .
Just in case .
Anyone caught bringing Horlicks into the gig gets slung out .
We do n't want them spilling it or throwing it at me , do we ?
And it'd be nice to start early : I 'm good for nothing next day if I 'm up after 10 pm . "
The band arrives in Eastbourne in time for a bracing walk on the seafront and a cream tea on the pier , then we head for the Peace Haven Rest Home where I change into stretch cords and slippers before going on stage .
" Hel lo - o - o - o , Eastbourne ! "
" Could you speak a bit louder ? " says Mrs Adamson in the front row .
" My hearing aid is n't working well . "
" I 'd rather not , " I reply .
" I ca n't stand too much noise . "
We kick off with a quiet version of Everyday Is Like Sunday that gets the place rocking and I 'm about to start the second number when Mrs Adamson interrupts again : " Can we stop now , dear ?
We do n't want to miss Corrie .
Why do n't you join us ? "
" What a great idea , " I say .
Today Eastbourne , tomorrow Torquay Crematorium .
Blinding tour .
Certification in software seems to be one of those hot topics that never die .
This phoenix recently rose again in the form of Certified Scrum Developer announcements and discussions that followed on the agile developer skills mailing list .
A recurring theme in the discussion is the mythical Joe the Developer , who is passionate about his work and needs the certificate to stand out from the crowd so that hiring managers can notice him easier .
Joe the Developer , passionate about his work , does n’t stop at 5 PM .
He attends user groups , reads blogs and comments on them , participates in mailing lists , contributes to opensource projects , tweets about interesting web pages or maintains links on delicious , has a blog , occasionally speaks at user groups and maybe even spoke at a conference or two .
He does n’t do all those things but chances are that he is doing at least some of them , and Google knows these things and can easily point that out .
Anyone who wants to spend five minutes checking out Joe the Developer will find that he is someone passionate about his work much easier on Google than by verifying references and certificates .
Joe the Developer does n’t need a certificate , for there is Google .
On the other hand , Joe the Plumber needs the certificate desperately , or at least he thinks that he does .
Joe the Plumber heard that you can make more money programming than plumbing and decided to suddenly become a programmer .
He does n’t really care about programming so he does n’t have time to read blogs , participate in mailing lists or attend user groups .
The only way to stand out is to get a business - class fast track ticket , which everyone knows costs extra .
So Joe the Plumber is going to look for a way to quickly get a piece of paper that says he knows his stuff , and once he gets the job it ’s only important not to get fired and he ’ll manage that somehow .
You can probably guess by now that my opinion about certification is pretty negative , and I already wrote about that several times .
What is really amazing about this particular time is that serious people whom I respect seem to be arguing for certification , with the idea that certification is coming anyway so it ’s better if the community gets on board and influences it rather than ignoring it and suffering after .
To that I can only say that people do drugs anyway but it ’s still not OK for us to sell it to them .
There is a huge difference between training and certification .
I guess that anyone , even Joe the Most - Experienced - Developer - In - The - World , would benefit from a few days of training by Ron Jeffries and most other people arguing for certification now .
But that is because these people really have something to say about the way software is built and if you are looking for gems of knowledge that is the right place to look .
Developers should take training to get that knowledge , not to get a piece of paper that is supposedly going to help them get a job ( and it will not , at least in any company that really cares about development ) .
Training is there to help you get started with a new practice or fill in the gaps .
It is not the end of the journey but quite the opposite , just a beginning on the path to knowledge .
ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari holds $ 1.5 billion in assets across the world , Pakistan 's main anticorruption body alleged in a report delivered Tuesday to the country 's Supreme Court .
The court is considering the constitutionality of an amnesty protecting the embattled leader and thousands of other officials from corruption charges .
The National Accountability Bureau , a politically independent government investigative body , gave the court a list of allegations involving Mr. Zardari , following a request by ...
Drug smugglers in Spain are at least 25 kilos of cocaine short after boxes of bananas in which they 'd hidden the Bolivian marching powder ended up on supermarket shelves .
The alarm was raised on Saturday morning when several one kilo packets were found in a box of " enormous green tropical bananas " in a Madrid branch of supermarket chain Lidl .
According to El Mundo , the bananas came from Mercamadrid , Madrid 's central wholesale market .
By the time the drugs were spotted , they had made their way to Lidl outlets across the capital and in Cáceres and Plasencia , Extremadura .
One shaken Lidl employee said : " Two or three police cars arrived and they went straight for the bananas .
They tipped them out onto a table and began sifting them . "
Lidl admitted that " nothing like this had ever happen before " .
The supermarket declined to say how may outlets were affected until the police had concluded their investigation , but assured shoppers that all of the offending bananas had been pulled from the shelves .
Spanish TV reports last night noted that boxes of bananas are commonly used to get cocaine into the country , although it 's not clear just how smugglers came to lose track of this consignment in what El Mundo called a " sensational error " . ®
A lot of us dream of having a well - paying job that allows us to schedule our life around our work , but most of us must manage our life around our work instead .
Does it really have to be this way ?
If you are a registered nurse , then the answer is no .
Thanks to per diem nursing , you can set your own hours .
You can work as much or as little as you want .
You can take weeks off if you like , and you can still earn a great salary and recieve good benefits .
Sound too good to be true ?
It ’s not .
Per diem nurses are RNs who work temporary shifts at hospitals and other health clinics .
These temporary assignments are found through medical staffing agencies like Advantage Medical Staffing .
Per diem nurses are often on call and are usually scheduled week - to - week .
Some nurses working per diem nursing positions are responsible for covering for staff members who are sick , on vacation , or on maternity leave .
Per diem nursing positions can be either pert - time or full time , depending on the RNs preferences .
While per diem nursing does n’t offer the familiarity of a regular nursing job in the same setting week after week , there are many who prefer the chance to explore new and interesting aspects of the nursing field .
That makes per diem nursing a great way for new nurses to explore many different nursing environments quickly .
Per diem nursing also offers the chance to learn new skills that can help an RN advance his or her career .
Per diem nursing is also a good match for new mothers , nurses close to retirement , or any other RN who only wants to work intermittent shifts .
Per diem nursing is a great opportunity for RNs who want more say over where they work and what they do .

Why oh why oh why ca n’t the “ deniers ” just stop asking awkward questions , and just trust us ?
I mean , we global warming scientists always tell the truth , do n’t we ?
Our scientific ethics are as pure as the driven snow .
We never exaggerate and peddle scare stories just to get a good headline , we never fudge and fiddle data to make it fit a pre-conceived agenda , we never destroy original observations so they can never be checked , and we are always completely transparent about our scientific methods , happy to comply with each and every FOI request that we receive .
Now back to the real world …
The famously moonbattish Grauniad advocates censorship in order to ram through the global warming agenda .
Only the title and the sub - heading are required :
Why do climate deniers hold sway in Australia ?
If Australia does not silence its sceptics and reduce its emissions there is a real risk of the nation becoming uninhabitable .
Apart from the fact that “ silencing sceptics ” is the antithesis of the scientific method , reducing Australia ’s emissions , by 5 % , 10 % , even 100 % , will make not one iota of difference to the climate , local or global , and will have no bearing on whether the nation “ becomes uninhabitable . ”
Do n’t forget that the opposite of “ sceptical ” is “ gullible . ”
Idiotic climate madness on an epic scale .

LET me start by saying I ’m a fan of generic drugs .
They save Americans billions of dollars each year and give us access to wonderful drugs at affordable prices .
I ’ve recommended generics in this column many times and use them myself when possible .
But there is a gnawing concern among some doctors and researchers that certain prescription generic drugs may not work as well as their brand - name counterparts .
The problem is not pervasive , but it ’s something consumers should be aware of  especially now that more insurers insist that patients take generic medications when they are available .
Let me also prepare the groundwork for what I hope will be full and frank reader comments , by acknowledging that this issue is controversial .
Joe Graedon , who has been writing about pharmaceuticals for three decades and runs a consumer advocacy Web site , the People ’s Pharmacy ( peoplespharmacy.com ) , was 100 percent behind generics for many years .
# 5 Brittany Murphy –
The most recent celebrity death , Brittany Murphy starts off our list at # 5 .
Bug-eyed and at least slightly psychotic Brittany Murphy would be more likely to get pepper sprayed than a friendly smile while walking down the street if she was not famous .
However , because people have seen her in a few movies she was perceived as “ quirky ” and “ cool ” .
Hopefully those fans of her ’s act just as “ quirky ” as she did by overdosing in the shower post haste .
# 4 DJ AM – First off the man was a DJ .
He made insane amounts of money for putting his iPod on shuffle in clubs .
If you do n’t want to jump up and celebrate when someone like that dies than there is something seriously wrong with you .
The media ignored the glaring hypocrisy of this douchebag .
He was shooting a show for MTV were he chastised kid ’s for not being strong like him and quitting drugs , before going back to his hotel room and overdosing on them .
What an ass !
# 3 David Carradine –
What is not to like about a celebrity death that involves a rope that is tied around the neck and genitals for autoerotic asphyxiation in a whore house in Thailand ?
David Carradine probably had the most embarrassing celebrity death of 2009 .
If only it had been someone more famous who died with a rope around their wiener like a Tom Cruise , George Clooney , or Rosie O’Donnell then it would have been tops on our list for sure .
# 2 Tiger Woods – OK so Tiger Woods did n’t actually die this year , but his endorsement career pretty much did .
And a more glorious death we have not seen in years ( mainly because of all the whores ) .
The fact that nerdy white guys absolutely worshiped Tiger because they thought he represented a hip classly minority version of themselves is funny enough .
However , then to have their idol completely exposed as a relentless poon hound who has stuck it in everything from porn stars to Waffle House hostesses is down right hilarious .
So much for Tiger being the epitome of a colored with class for you WASPs to worship .
Do n’t worry you still have Colin Powell .
Police have dusted off an old chapter of the Canadian Criminal Code and charged a woman with posing as a witch , allegedly to defraud a Toronto lawyer of more than $ 100,000 .
Vishwantee Persaud , 36 , is accused of conning veteran criminal lawyer Noel Daley by saying she was the embodiment of his deceased sister , whose spirit would guide him to financial success .
" She told ( Daley ) that she had a history in her family of them being sort of good witches , or having occult powers , and that she could do a tarot card reading for him , " said Det. Const .
Corey Jones .
It was an attempt to gain Daley 's trust , police allege , and the spell worked .
Over the next few months , police say , the lawyer coughed up money for a variety of reasons – including alleged bogus law tuition and rent for a premier office space in the heart of the financial district .
Persaud also faces two fraud charges .
Daley declined to discuss the matter with the Star , saying it is before the court .
But in an interview with Law Times , published Nov. 30 , he described being conned by a woman who was " the epitome of the skills that make up a good confidence man . "
Despite its archaic tone , the witchcraft charge is n't all that rare .
From January 1999 to October 2009 , 38 people in Ontario were charged under Section 365 , which deals with fraudulently pretending to exercise witchcraft , sorcery , fortune telling or conjuration .
The provision is really a remnant from the dark ages , said Alan Young , a professor at York University 's Osgoode Hall law school .
The charge , which was part of the code when it was enacted in 1892 , has nothing to do with the occult , but with scammers who fake mystical powers , Young said .
" They wanted to regulate the practice to protect vulnerable people from giving their life savings over to fortune tellers who were basically con artists . "
If Persaud is found guilty , there wo n't be any burning at the stake .
The witchcraft charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and up to a $ 2,000 fine .
Daley befriended Persaud , who allegedly claimed to be a third - year law student in a bad financial situation , in January 2009 , police said .
Dubious of her schooling , he quizzed her on her legal knowledge .
She got it all right .
Within months , she was working at his law firm and he occasionally pitched in for her grocery bills .
Then came the alleged tarot reading , which police say she used to gain Daley 's trust .
After that , she began proposing business ideas , police allege .
She said she had connections from her days at a successful Toronto marketing firm , police say .
And Daley paid up , fronting cash for proposed deals with Sony and Wal - Mart , Jones said .
" My desire to make an easy buck clouded my judgment , " Daley told Law Times .
Soon , Daley said , he was paying rent for an office at First Canadian Place , as well as $ 18,000 for cancer treatments .
Then Persaud allegedly proposed they make money hosting and providing security for celebrities at the Toronto International Film Festival , police said .
No actors showed , and Daley became suspicious .
Persaud , who is also charged with four counts of failing to comply with recognizance and two counts of failing to comply with probation , is being held in custody .

But the news of the arrest is bittersweet in the psychic community .
" It definitely puts a stain on our business .
The outside world sees that and think that there are just bad readers out there , " said Lisa Marvin , a psychic adviser and co-owner of Metaphysique in Yorkville .
" People who go to readings are looking for guidance , " she said .
" They should n't be taken advantage of . "

Formula 1 has been wholly guilty of not embracing fans enough through new media , but moves are being made to address the situation in time for the 2010 season .
That is the claim of Mercedes GP CEO Nick Fry , who told the Motor Sport Business Forum in Monaco on Thursday that he felt F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone finally understood that the sport could benefit from expanding its profile on the internet .
His comments came after leading figures from the motorsport industry said that F1 was not doing enough to promote itself through new media .
" I think it is a bit of old fashioned thinking to think that by giving people more over the internet they will consume less somewhere else , " said Fry .
" In fact , with younger consumers and fans are actually doing both - they are not reducing their consumption of one because you are giving them more in another area .
They are doing both maybe at the same time .
" I think the accusation that we have been a bit slow on new media is correct - that we could have done a lot more .
But I think you might find that FOM have things they are working on at the moment that will hopefully see the light of day during the course of next year which will hopefully at least partially address that .
It is a slow yes , but the point is not lost and I think things are happening . "
Fry believes that the changing economic situation worldwide , and the fact that the field could no longer demand huge funding from car makers , means that a new sense of reality has arrived over improving the show .
" We are all in the same boat , " he said .
" I think the business model that we all have now is very similar .
We have to grow F1 , if we grow F1 it is good for FOM , it is good for television companies , good for people in the business , good for the teams .
So we have an aligned objective .
" That is very important because in the past , we probably did n't have that aligned objective , perhaps because the teams were being funded by other sources , maybe a tobacco company or a car company , and maybe the objective was slightly different from what it was today where we have got to run hopefully a break even or even a profitable business .
That is something that has changed quite dramatically over the last 18 months . "
He added : " The reality of life is that we have to up our game , because our competitors have upped their game .
Cricket has gone from something that was as dull as ditchwater to something that is competition for F1 .
It is not the main competition , but it is example of how people have raised their game .
" And we have to do likewise .
We have to improve . "
With the four - day winter meetings beginning Monday in Indianapolis , the Giants and A's approach with far different philosophies than a year ago .
At this point in 2008 , the Giants already had signed Edgar Renteria , Jeremy Affeldt and Bobby Howry and were on the verge of finalizing a deal with Randy Johnson .
The A's already had traded for Matt Holliday and begun negotiating with Jason Giambi , a sign they were n't fully dedicated to their youth movement , later adding Orlando Cabrera and Nomar Garciaparra .
A year later , both teams have done a 180 .
The Giants want to be more patient , the A's more youthful .
" What we really want to do is give our young players a chance to develop , " A's general manager Billy Beane said , " and we want to hold on to them . "
Last month , Beane spoke of improving the offense via trades , and he acquired Jake Fox and Aaron Miles from the Cubs on Thursday .
Now he 's looking mostly at free agents , if only because he appears unwilling to part with any of his valuable youth .
" We would probably be more interested in free agents , " Beane said .
" Given we 're going through a rebuilding process , the advantage with free agents is you do n't have to give up a player for them . "
A draft choice , either .
The A's are n't interested in elite free agents or any who'd cost a compensatory draft pick ( Type A free agents who were offered arbitration by their original teams ) .
Tom Gannam / AP
Same with the Giants .
GM Brian Sabean is focusing on " second - tier " free agents .
As to why the Giants are n't as aggressive as last winter , when they were quick to acquire free agents , Sabean said , " People learned from last year that letting things develop might be worthwhile .
Also , we 're further along and do n't have as many holes .
We know we have to upgrade the offense .
Other teams , their acute need is pitching and are n't as good roster - wise in that area . "
Indeed , both the Giants and A's have far better pitching than hitting , and bats will be the focus in Indianapolis .
The Giants need a catcher - to replace Bengie Molina and bridge to Buster Posey - a first baseman and possibly an outfielder .
They 're not ruling out an experienced reliever ( a Howry re-signing perhaps ) , especially to provide bullpen depth in case prospect Madison Bumgarner is in the rotation .
Oakland 's goal is to find a long - term answer at third base .
Fox is a third baseman by trade , but the A's might also play him at first , in left and as a designated hitter .
Brett Wallace might not be ready for the majors .
Dallas McPherson has been shelved with injuries .
Adam Kennedy is a free agent but not entirely out of the picture .
Eric Chavez still is around .
That 's a lot of options , but the A's remain in the market for a third baseman .
" We 're trying to surround the position , " joked Beane , adding , " If Chavez is healthy , he 's the guy .
But we have to prepare for him not to be .
Even if he is healthy , we still need someone long term . "
Beane is said to have inquired about Kansas City 's Alex Gordon and Alberto Callaspo and the Angels ' Brandon Wood , but none is considered trade bait for now .
Third base appears settled for the Giants after Sabean said the organization envisions Pablo Sandoval there ( and not at first ) in 2010 .
With Posey waiting in the wings , Sabean wants to find a catcher only for one year .
Certain free agents - including Rod Barajas , Miguel Olivo and Yorvit Torrelaba - prefer more than one year , but their agents still plan to meet with the Giants in Indy .
" Absolutely , " said Dan Lozano , who represents Barajas .
Martin Arburua , Olivo 's agent , said he already spoke with the Giants and will chat again .
" There 's mutual interest , " he said .
" Miguel definitely likes Bruce Bochy ( who managed Olivo in San Diego in 2005 ) and would love to play in the Bay Area .
He resides in Modesto .
Miguel would take the best opportunity to play .
I 'm not sure if the Giants are it or not .
We 've talked to several teams . "
london ’s underground became the first subway system in the world when it began operation in 1863 .
since then , underground subways have been built in almost every major city of the world .
from new york and paris to hong kong and dubai , subways are an essential part of public transportation in cities .
within these systems , architecture plays a big role in defining the environment of the subway .
here is a collection of some of the most architecturally interesting subway stations .

stockholm tunnelbana
the subway system in stockholm , sweden features art installations in almost every station .
the city ’s 100 stations feature art by almost 140 artists and it is often called the world ’s longest art gallery .
the system may focus on artwork , but it also features a number of stations with unusual architecture .
the t-centralen station is one of the most distinctive designed by per olof ultvedt in 1975 .
the station features a massive mural painted on the cavern - like ceiling that exposes the rocky core of the city .
many of the system ’s stations also feature this unique cavern ceiling that gives them an organic feeling and unique atmosphere .

munich U - bahn
munich ’s uU - bahn subway system only began in 1972 , but it has quickly grown into a 98 station system spread across the entire city .
because of its young age munich had the advantage of learning from the mistakes of other systems creating spacious and efficient stations .
while the first stations were quite plain , the architecture of its new stations is often quite daring .
some stand out stations include the colourful dulferstrasse station designed by peter lanz and jurgen rauch and westfriedhof , which features lighting installations by ingo mauer .

bilbao metro
the bilbao metro is unusual among subway systems since it was designed and engineered as a whole .
the stations were all designed by foster + partners , who set to use dramatic curved forms to create a signature look for the city ’s transportation infrastructure .
inside the stations , the space was kept as open as possible , using the full height and width of the underground tunnels .
above ground , each station features a curved glass entrance that is reminiscent of a shell and became known as a fosteritos by locals .

shanghai – bund sightseeing tunnel
the bund sightseeing tunnel located in shanghai , china is n’t technically a subway system but rather a short distance transporter .
measuring only 647 m long , the train tunnel connects the bund to pudong .
along the way the rider is bombarded with lighting effects , music and special effects that turn the ride into something out of this world .

dubai – metro station
one of the world ’s newest subway systems is the automated rail network in dubai which officially opened in september of 2009 .
the red line which includes 10 stations is the first part of the project to be completed and features the aedas designed metro station .
the international firm was selected to design all 47 stations in the new system along with two rail depots .
this particular station features a curved rood design that covers the station and lets light in through small windows .
the iconic building is just the start of a series of stations that will push the boundaries for subway architecture .

tokyo – iidabashi station
tokyo is well known for being one of the busiest subway systems is the world , but so well known for its subway architecture .
the oedo line in tokyo is the newest in the city ’ massive system and features some interesting designs like iidabashi station designed by makoto sei watanabe architects .
the station was built in 2000 and features a distinctive faced clad with massive curved steel and glass forms .
inside the station has numerous design features including a geometric green light sculpture running the length of the escalator shaft .
the station ’s design is also significant since it was create through computer generated forms .

prague ’s subway system has a diverse array of station designs that span numerous architectural styles .
the line a stations all feature distinctive tile cladding that gives them a futuristic feel .
each station along the line has a different colour of aluminum tile that is repeated in concave or convex patterns .
the tiles are installed along the tracks and curve up the wall and onto the ceiling .
this subtle variation from station to station gives riders a navigation system to guide them on their travels .

moscow – komsomolskaya station
moscow ’s komsomolskaya station definitely goes down as the most elaborate subway station .
the design was built in the 1930 ’s and features large chandeliers , vaulted plaster ceilings and arched walkways .
the classical design of the space gives the station a palatial feeling , not something you see in most subways .
the station also boasts hand painted frescoes and detailed plaster moulding on almost every surface .

toronto – museum station
while most of the subways stations in toronto are very traditional , one newly remodeled station stands out .
museum station is located right below the city ’s royal ontario museum which was recently added to by daniel libeskind .
the new station replaces simple columns with recreations of the museum ’s collection including egyptian sarcophaguses , totem poles and mayan statues .
the station also haswalls clad with large aluminum panels that are cut - out with the station name to reveal a hieroglyphics pattern behind .
the unique station links the subway with the museum above .

barcelona – drassanes station
the spanish firm on - a arquitectura recently remodeled the barcelona subway station drassanes .
the space ’s new design was based on the concept of using the same materials as the subway cars that drive through the station .
a white concrete covers the walls and slowly blends into the floors which were made vibration proof .
the ceiling was made black to contrast the white and is lined with long angular light fixtures .
other corridors in the station feature a mosaic of oversized tiles in a variety of vivid colours .

Keith 's note :
With regard to Jeff Hanley 's current comments , this is not the first time that Hanley 's organization has had problems presenting ( or admitting ) a consistent view of what Ares 1's safety was relative to Shuttle and other launch systems .
Indeed , you only have to look at Joseph Fragola 's presentation to the Augustine Committee to see what Constellation knew Vs what it said .
Specifically , there was a briefing chart that was withheld from the Augustine Committee - see below for that chart .
" Fragola said that the passage quoted by the Sentinel storyfrom the Exploration Systems Architecture Study concluding that it would take at least seven flights ( two test flights and five mission flights ) before the Ares I and Orion crew capsule could to be deemed to be as safe as the shuttle referred to a more powerful configuration of Ares - Orion that used a liquid oxygen - methane engine and not the simpler lower performance configuration being designed today .
He said he knew this because he wrote the section of the ESAS that the Sentinel was referring to .
Indeed , the report does say a few pages before the passage quoted by the Sentinel that a LOX - methane engine is riskier than the original simpler design for Ares - Orion , however , Fragola either misremembered the report or was not entirelyhonest with Congress when he dismissed our reporting . "
" NASAWatch.com , a respected watchdog website , reported on Tuesday night that NASA allegedly withheldinformation from a White House panel that showedthe Ares I rocket did not meet the agency 's own safety goals . "
" In an e-mail to the Orlando Sentinel , Jeff Hanley , manager of the Constellation Program that includes Ares I and Orion , said that in the four years since the ESAS was first conducted , there have been advances in engineering risk assessments and that supercomputer analyses say that the ultimate risk of losing a crew aboard Ares I would be just 1 - in - 2,800 .
But he acknowledged that even with better risk - assessment techniques and designs , a new rocket poses considerable risk .
" What at least some of our work suggests is that , yes , on the second launch the LOC [ loss of crew ] risk may be roughly on par with today 's mature shuttle risk .
Other assessments are less rosy ( a little riskier than a shuttle launch ) , so we are working right now to sort out a ' best estimate , '' he wrote . "
Both Hanley and Fragola will be testifying .
Perhaps someone can ask them about all of this .
This is the version of the chart ( Slide 19 ) that was used by Joe Fragola in his 29 July 2009 presentation to the Augustine Committee .
[ click on image for larger version ]
This is an internal version of that same chart that was prepared by Fragola 's company Valador - but was not used .
[ click on image for larger version ]
Note that this unused chart has specific call outs as to Ares I , Ares V / Shuttle , and EELV safety ratings .
Note that Ares I does not meet the " Target from Crew Memo " safety goals ( red line ) that the Constellation program set for itself .
Why did Steve Cook not allow this chart to be used ?
When asked by Committee member Leroy Chiao to use the chart in his presentation and point out where Ares 1 falls in terms of its relative risk , Fragola used a laser pointer and indicated a region i.e. a safety rating that was above the requirement line i.e. safer than what the internal version of that unused internal chart showed .
Chiao 's broader question starts at 30:24 .
His specific Ares 1 question starts at 34:35 .
The laser pointer is somewhat difficult to make out but a higher quality video will show it much more clearly .
Meeting transcript Page 56 - 57
Leroy Chiao , Ph.D.
In that case , where would Ares fall on this charts ?
Joe Fragola - Valador Inc. - Vice President
As I recall , it is about 0.85 to 0.86 .
Leroy Chiao , Ph.D.
Okay , do you have a pointer , can you kind of show us where that might be ?
Joe Fragola - Valador Inc. - Vice President
It 's about ... this is 0.8 , so 0.85 is approximately around in here .
If you talk about a 1 in 200 or 1 in 400 launch vehicle , you are talking about the Ares being up in this area and that is rather significant .
If you start looking at the probability that you 'll get better than 1 in 1000 , no vehicle comes close to Ares l .
And , of course , models have uncertainties associated with it .
That 's why I showed these significantly large bands of uncertainty .
But the fact of the matter is it's the combined confidence of high reliability demonstrated on the SRBs for the Shuttle with the understanding of the significant scenarios that create the abort environments that gives you that feeling of confidence on the Ares l .
Leroy Chiao , Ph.D. Okay .
And help me a little bit because we 've been seeing numbers of Ares being 1 in 2000 , but you are saying it might be even be a little less than 1 in 1000 .
Joe Fragola - Valador Inc. - Vice President
Our calculations are better than 1 in a 1000 , better than 1 in a thousand .
Leroy Chiao , Ph.D.
Okay then .
Maybe I 'm confused about what this 1 in 2000 or 2153 number ...
Joe Fragola - Valador Inc. - Vice President
Well , there are different ... this was an independent assessment .
There were different models .
There were different teams .
The teams have not gotten together to resolve the uncertainties but it's important to understand that independent of what the absolute of that number is , the thing to remember is the relative safety level of Ares l is significantly better , to talk about both , significantly better than all the alternatives and significantly better than the current shuttle .
Even though the shuttle has demonstrated with a very high level of reliability , it is a question of reliability and abort effectiveness that makes the combination .
The choir ’s last official performance was in 2007 , around the time of the death of its founder , Walter J. Turnbull .
But no one ever announced that it was gone .
Board members and alumni had hoped to revive it , but they acknowledged last week that they had not had any success .
For a famous organization that politicians had vowed would outlive its founder , it had a quiet end .
Many of the choir ’s materials , like copies of handwritten scores and its trademark burgundy blazers , now sit in black garbage bags and open boxes in the church ’s damp dirt - floor basement , amid overturned tables and sacks of plaster of Paris .
Led by Dr. Turnbull , who started the group in 1968 , the choir sang at the White House for nearly every president since Lyndon B. Johnson , and it was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Bill Clinton .
But it did not survive long enough to perform for the country ’s first black president .
The choir ’s demise as a functional organization was a result of many factors , but everyone agrees it was set in motion by a single episode : an accusation by a 14 - year - old boy in 2001 that a counselor on the choir ’s staff had sexually abused him .
The counselor eventually was sentenced to two years in prison .
The accusation and the scandal that followed 
Dr. Turnbull did not report the claim to the authorities and allowed the counselor to continue working with children  set off a chain of events that led the city to oust the choir in 2006 from the Choir Academy of Harlem , the school building that had been its home .

How to Get Away with Murder Not airing in the next 14 days
Back in 1992 , I remember going to the Echelon Mall in Voorhees , New Jersey .
It was a five minute drive from my home in Cherry Hill and I always looked forward to it .
The mall had every imaginable store you could think of , several fountains , rides and games for kids , a movie theater , and even a gigantic arena - sized arcade called Exhilarama .
Check out the dead mall >
Those were the 1990s .
Those were the days .
Today , the Echelon Mall is now called the Voorhees Town Center and even a name change can't aid a dying beast .
Someone , somewhere thought it'd be a good idea to bulldoze half the mall , put up condos and housing , and give the mall a more " exclusive " feel .
The problem is : who wants to live at a mall ?
Only two " anchor stores " remain at the mall , the food court is half vacant , and there are literally no stores of quality in the mall aside from a GameStop , Victoria 's Secret , and Verizon Wireless .
What began as a revitalization project for a dying mall was cut short by a lack of credit and funding for constructing the project .
Tons of big box stores and condos were supposed to go up around the newly re-designed mall but alas , nothing has come to fruition .
Scanning the terrain , you 'll quickly realize why commercial real estate is such an epic disaster .
At the height of Iran 's bloody civil unrest this year , a young doctor named Ramin Pourandarjani defied his superiors .
He refused to sign death certificates at a Tehran prison that he said were falsified to cover up murder .
He testified to a parliamentary committee that jailers were torturing and raping protesters , his family says .
He told friends and family he feared for his life .
And ...

By Eric Thomas : World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko ( 39 - 2 , 37 KO’s ) has reportedly reached a preliminary agreement to fight WBA heavyweight champion David Haye ( 23 - 1 , 21 KO ’s ) , according to the latest boxing news .
In an article with the Ukrainian daily Dakty , Klitschko “ In the near future I plan to fight Haye and take the title .
The preliminary agreement has already been reached . ”
Before the 38 - year - old Klitschko can take on Haye , the British heavyweight star must first get by his next fight , former two - time WBC heavyweight champion John Ruiz , whom he fights in early 2010 .
There ’s no certainty that Haye will get by Ruiz , however .
Thus far , Haye has n’t looked nearly as impressive in the heavyweight ranks compared to his prior form while fighting as a cruiserweight .
Haye threw little more than 10 punches per round against Valuev and had to be content with winning a 12 round majority decision .
In Haye ’s last bout on November 7th , he struggled badly in beating 36 - year - old WBA heavyweight champion Nikolay Valuev , a fighter who was regarded by many as having the distinction of being the weakest of heavyweight champions .
Before that fight , Haye was close to signing for a fight with Vitali Klitschko .
But instead , Haye chose to take the fight with Valuev .
This left some people in the boxing world with the impression that Haye wanted to take the easier fight for fear that he would be beaten by Vitali .
Haye also was near to fighting IBF / WBO heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko on June 20th , only to come up lame weeks before fight complaining about a back injury .
Vitali defeated American Kevin Johnson by a one - sided 12 round decision last Saturday night in Berne , Switzerland , winning every round of the fight on two of the judges ’ scorecards and 11 of the 12 rounds on the third .
Klitschko’s opponent was in the survival mode from the opening seconds of the fight , staying on the ropes and hunkering down in what appeared to be a strategy to prevent from ending up as Klitschko ’s 38th knockout victim .
If that was Johnson ’s strategy , which is hard to see any other way given his lack of offense in the fight , then it worked perfectly for Johnson .
He stayed upright then entire 12 rounds and was never hurt in the fight .
However , by not taking any chances to let his own punches go , aside form throwing jabs and an occasional right hand , Johnson lost round after round and spoiled what may end up being his only attempt at challenging for a world title .
Klitschko returned from a four year retirement last year , beating then WBC heavyweight champion Samuel Peter by an 8th round stoppage .
Klitschko followed that victory with stoppage wins over Juan Carlos Gomez and Chris Arreola , two of the best heavyweights in the division .
Like most of Klitschko ’s previous bouts , he made it look easy in beating them .
It ’s hard to say how much better Haye can do than Johnson .
Haye is the same size as Johnson , but with shorter arms and a not as good jab .
Certainly by watching Haye ’s bout with Valuev , it would seem that he would be way in over his head in a fight with Klitschko .
This fight has the makings of a mismatch , although casual boxing fans will probably buy it up just the same .

Research confirms mothers were right all along - removing a Band - Aid is less painful when it is ripped off quickly .
A study at Queensland 's James Cook University used 65 medical students who removed Band - Aids either quickly or slowly , and ranked their pain reaction from zero to 10 .
Quick removal returned a pain score of 0.92 in comparison with 1.58 for those who chose the slow approach .
Researcher Dr Carl O'Kane says the research found the cause of pain to be more of a psychological issue .
" It 's fascinating that if you had a preconception that slow was going to be more painful in fact it was , so it also suggests that pain is not just what you perceive but what you think you will perceive when you get the painful stimulus , " he said .
" So there 's a lot of cultural and psychological factors there as well . "
Tell the truth now .
You have a formal dining room but eat at the breakfast nook .
The living room with the vaulted ceiling sits empty while everyone piles into the family room .
That third bathroom does n't get visited more than once a week .
There 's a lot of space that just does n't get used , despite the labor and material required to build it and the money you 're spending to heat and cool it .
Looking at it , of course , is free .
Is that how you should be living ?
Maybe not .
A lot of people are rethinking not just how much room they need , but how they structure their lives .
" There 's more to small than size , " says Seattle - area architect Ross Chapin , who specializes in designing small - home " pocket neighborhoods . "
" There 's a shift in attitude that is real personal -- realizing what is enough , " he says .
" When you can shift your attitude that way , you can save thousands of dollars in yearly expenses . "
And , in the process , be on the way to living sustainably .
Housing prices and energy cost savings are starters .
Other factors causing the shift in attitudes include changing demographics -- smaller families and increase in empty - nest baby boomers -- and the need to develop cities more densely so that farmland is spared .
Northeast Portland builder Walt Quade says we can thank the recession for the change in thinking .
Seriously .
People are beginning to make better decisions , he says .
They 're buying smaller homes and smaller cars , and bumping up their savings .
City and regional planners are tinkering with development codes to allow and encourage denser development and alternative housing .
It 's made us think , Quade says , about what 's important .
" That 's the kind of process people need to go through , " Quade says .
Quade is a tall , bearded and barrel - chested man who 's constructed his share of big houses .
But as he talks , he 's standing in his revised vision : A 325 square - foot house he built in his backyard .
The house occupies a 12 - foot by 29 - foot rectangle .
Open the front door and you 're in the living room , which is a step away from kitchen area .
The bathroom is a couple strides past that , and beyond that is the single bedroom .
The Murphy bed folds up into the wall , allowing a hobby or work table to fold out .
Quade built it with the intention of learning how to construct a small home .
Plans are one thing , but handling the materials and getting a feel for how the space works are something else .
" Until you build it , you do n't know , " he says .
Quade acknowledges the tiny house is not for everyone .
It costs about $ 40,000 .
It can fit on a truck and be hauled to a beach or mountain site as a vacation cabin , but Quade has another market in mind .
Portland 's building code since 2007 has allowed Accessory Dwelling Units , or ADUs : Sometimes called " granny flats " or " mother - in - law apartments , " they can be tucked into backyards or added to existing structures .
They simply can't exceed 800 square feet .
They are one of the ways the Portland - Vancouver area will accommodate 1 million new residents projected to arrive here by 2030 .
, the regional government for Multnomah , Washington and Clackamas counties , believes we can handle that growth with only minor expansions of the urban growth boundary -- the line that separates city and country .
But we 'll have to crowd in .
And people such as Quade are all for it .
" My feeling is , if we want to grow responsibly , that 's what the urban growth boundary is all about .
This is the way we have to go , " he says .
" There are lots of ways we can approach higher densities within the UGB and be creative about it . "
It 's an idea that 's taking hold .
Wood Village , in east Multnomah County , changed its development code in September to allow cottages -- houses of 1,200 square feet or less and clustered around a common outdoor space .
Although the city was primarily concerned about providing housing options , the code change also doubled the allowable residential density .
Metro estimates that cottages will cost 20 percent to 30 percent less than traditional single - family homes .
Salish Pond Cottages in nearby Fairview -- designed by Chapin -- found a ready market of people for homes ranging from 750 to 1,200 square feet .
Valerie Correa , a family therapist , lives in a one - bedroom home with her 2 - year - old son .
She converted a loft into her son's room , and some of her furniture doubles as storage -- such as a daybed with drawers underneath .
" You definitely have to clear out stuff more frequently , " she says .
Quade 's tiny house off Northeast 55th Avenue is occupied by his sister - in - law , Raynice Pawlowski , who arrived from a Chicago suburb .
Moving in required her to shed some of her belongings ; there is no room for clutter .
" I try to keep things put away and be tidy , " she says .
" It 's a good space . "
Both living situations feature outdoor space that provides relief from cramped quarters .
The Salish cottages front a pond and have a common area for gatherings that would overwhelm a small home .
Pawlowski shares her brother - in - law 's large yard , vegetable garden and fruit trees .
But storage is a key issue .
, the Swedish - based furniture and home accessories store in Northeast Portland , addresses that with floor models that demonstrate how to live small .
Among them is a two - bedroom " Eco Home " unit packed into 572 square feet .
Store spokeswoman April Minister says the model uses vertical storage up the walls and furniture that does " double duty " as storage containers .
The arrangement provides " ah - ha " living space moments for customers .
" We only live in about 500 square feet , anyway , " Minister says .
" That 's what it opens your mind to . "
Chapin , the architect , says people should assess their lives .
" What do you do with the turkey pan ? " he asks .
" The suitcases , the cross-country skis , the snow tires , the winter clothing , the vacuum ?
" You still need storage , " he says .
" The idea of a real tiny house is great , but there are still critical needs .
Where do you put the files , the last several years of taxes ? "
His firm considers homes " fully livable " at about 500 square feet for one person , 900 square feet for a couple , 1,200 square feet for a small family and 1,600 to 2,000 square feet for a larger family .
No one , he says , needs 4,000 square feet .
The instinct to live smaller comes from a convergence of worry over limited land and resources , global warming , " peak oil " and other issues , he says .
Living in our big , beautiful houses , with living spaces focused to the back instead of toward our neighbors , isolates us .
" The good news is that living a little closer together fosters a sense of community , " Chapin says .
" We 've far over - emphasized the importance of privacy , to the point that we have a society that has quite a bit of dysfunction , and we 're seeing the fraying at the edges .
" I think there are two significant movements in the country , " Chapin says .
" One is that bigger is better ; that 's been the prevailing notion for the last 50 years .
Another movement says small is beautiful .
" I think the first movement is moving toward its sunset , and the second is more on the rise . "

Many have pointed out that this campaign seems to imply the urgent need to eliminate President Barack Obama at the earliest opportunity by any means necessary , ( you can figure out the rest ) .
May his days be few ; may another seize his position .
May his children be orphans , and his wife a widow .
We 've seen a lot of comment about a new twist on the right , a whole campaign ( t- shirts , bumper stickers , e-mails and more ) all built on the biblical passage in Psalms 109 which says in part :
NYC - Metropolitan Museum of Art : Limestone Head of King David flickr image by wallyg
In Psalms 109 , King David , who is one of the revered heroes of the Old Testament is lamenting .
He says :
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me ,
speaking against me with lying tongues .
They beset me with words of hate ,
and attack me without cause .
In return for my love they accuse me ,
even while I make prayer for them .
So they reward me evil for good ,
and hatred for my love .
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me ?
He goes on :
They say , Appoint a wicked man against him ;
let an accuser stand on his right .
When he is tried , let him be found guilty ;
let his prayer be counted as sin .
May his days be few ;
may another seize his position .
May his children be orphans ,
and his wife a widow .
May his children wander about and beg ;
may they be driven out of the ruins they inhabit .
May the creditor seize all that he has ;
may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil .
And then King David says ,
Help me , O Lord my God !
Save me according to your steadfast love .
Let them know that this is your hand ;
you , O Lord , have done it .
Let them curse , but you will bless .
Let my assailants be put to shame ; may your servant be glad .
May my accusers be clothed with dishonour ;
may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle .
With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord ;
I will praise him in the midst of the throng .
For he stands at the right hand of the needy ,
to save them from those who would condemn them to death .
For those would quote the Bible for their justifications , would n't you think they can do a bit better than this ?
The rich irony is that those who have chosen this Bible verse as a slogan clearly have no idea of the context and meaning of that which they quote .
ALBANY  New York ’s system of juvenile prisons is broken , with young people battling mental illness or addiction held alongside violent offenders in abysmal facilities where they receive little counseling , can be physically abused and rarely get even a basic education , according to a report by a state panel .
The problems are so acute that the state agency overseeing the prisons has asked New York ’s Family Court judges not to send youths to any of them unless they are a significant risk to public safety , recommending alternatives , like therapeutic foster care .
“ New York State ’s current approach fails the young people who are drawn into the system , the public whose safety it is intended to protect , and the principles of good governance that demand effective use of scarce state resources , ” said the confidential draft report , which was obtained by The New York Times .
The report , prepared by a task force appointed by Gov. David A. Paterson and led by Jeremy Travis , president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice , comes three months after a federal investigation found that excessive force was routinely used at four prisons , resulting in injuries as severe as broken bones and shattered teeth .
Ezra Klein is satisfied with the Senate bill .
" Insurance companies win , " Markos Moulitsas tweeted last night .
" Time to kill this monstrosity coming out of the Senate . "
This was , for progressives , a frustrating vote .
But the flip side of it being morally unconscionable for Joe Lieberman to put the bill at risk over something as small as Medicare buy - in for 3 - or - so million people is that the absence of Medicare buy - in -- and of the weak public plan -- is not reason enough to oppose the bill , either .
Klein 's argument seems to be :
If we need more money for subsidies , we can later throw more money at the system ,
If costs are n't held down , then there 'll be a better argument for a public option in the future .
My take is that it 's unconscionable to force people to buy a product from a private insurer that enjoys sanctioned monopoly status .
It 'd be like forcing everyone to attend baseball games , but instead of watching the Yankees , they were forced to watch the Kansas City Royals .
Or Washington Nationals .
It would effectively be a tax -- and a huge one -- paid directly to a private industry .
Without any mechanisms to control costs , this is yet another bailout for yet another reviled industry .
Subsidies ?
Insurance companies are free to raise their rates to absorb that cash .
More money for subsidies ?
More rate increases , as well as more national debt .
Do n't expect Lieberman and his ilk to care .
They 're in it for their industry pals .
If you want a similar model , watch how universities increase tuition to absorb increased financial aid opportunities .
And since the Senate and its industry - bought Senators wo n't allow insurance premium caps or an end to the insurance industry 's anti-trust exemption ( much less a public option to compete against them ) , there is nothing keeping those companies from jacking up rates to screw people .
In fact , that 's been their modus operandi for years .
Provisions prohibiting rescissions are fine and dandy , and fairly non-controversial , but they are toothless .
The legislation allows rescissions based on " fraud " and " willful misrepresentation " .
I 'm still not sure what that means , but if the insurance company does n't want to pay for your expensive care , seems they can assert those clauses and refuse to pay .
Then what ?
You have to fight for coverage , get lawyers , hit the courts , hope you survive long enough to resolve the issue .
Looks a lot like the status quo , does n't it ?
Indeed , insurance companies already cite fraud or misrepresentation as the excuses for rescissions .
The insurance industry began 2009 fearing genuine reform that would force them to become responsible corporate citizens , and they are exiting it on the cusp of a dramatic government - sanctioned windfall .
It pays to be an industry that 's too big to fail .
Strip out the mandate , and the rest of the bill is palatable .
It 's not reform , but it 's progress in the right direction .
And you can still go back and tinker with it at a later time .
Whether this passes or not , any further reforms will still need new legislation .
And any new legislation will be just as furiously opposed as this one was .
It 's not like the opponents of health care are motivated by reason .
They are motivated by the health insurance industry 's bottom line .
Nothing we do with this current bill will change that .
Blizzard 's World of Warcraft is a hugely successful MMO .
So if you are game developer and you want to make a hugely successful MMO , copy WoW , right ?
Right ?
Wrong , says WoW .

" There are a lot of people that try to emulate World of Warcraft - and as flattering as that is our end it 's definitely not the right move , " says Blizzard producer Shane Dabiri in magazine PC Zone .
" I know that World of Warcraft is very successful , and so people think if they were to make another game just like it they could somehow capture that audience .
However , I do n't think that 's what players are looking for .

" Players that have invested time in WOW do n't just want to do the same thing in other game - they want to try something completely new and different , " he argues .
" I think the industry needs to move in that direction to come up with some innovative new MMOs that are trying really different things .
Take City of Heroes - at least that 's something that 's not a fantasy game . "

Man 's got a point .
There already is WoW .
If someone wants to play a World of Warcraft like game , then they 'll probably play , well , WoW .

Nothing makes European leaders more fearful than the thought of their own irrelevance .
And nothing better captures this fear than the rise of China as a global political heavyweight .
A powerful EU interlocutor for addressing European concerns with the Chinese leadership ?
Not at the expense of every national leader 's right of individually courting Beijing .
An effective new framework for managing global cooperation ?
Not at the expense of individual countries ' seats at the negotiating table .
In the wake of the upcoming EU - China summit , Europe 's China angst - its fear of losing influence by granting real responsibility to China , is risking turning this encounter into yet another wasted opportunity for taking on global responsibilities .
Despite all the rhetoric about engaging China and global burden - sharing , Europeans are mute on spelling out what joint stakeholdership in global affairs would really mean and what Europe would need to do to tip the scales in China 's strategic calculus from mere words on harmony to real global commitments .
This week 's EU - China Summit is a perfect illustration for this malaise .
The EU goes into the summit with stakes being lowered to the extreme minimum : it is not even publicly advertised and has no clear strategic focus or sense of direction .
But without focus , even important and promising plans such as a new Partnership and Co-operation Agreement are doomed to become irrelevant .
The contrast to the United States , where the idea of joint global leadership via a G2 is gaining currency , could not be starker .
Europe as the self - declared champion of effective multilateralism , however , has failed to back up its rhetoric with concrete steps on what jointly working on global problems with China would mean .
For fear of further losing influence in the global arena , European leaders still have a persistently unpleasant gut feeling about truly entrusting China with global responsibilities .
In the eyes of many EU leaders scenarios such as seeing ranking Chinese Communist Party members holding high - level posts at the UN , the World Bank , and the WTO still invoke the paralysing fear of being left behind instead of marking the path towards becoming joint stakeholders of global governance .
As a result the EU has been unable to produce a bold global agenda powerful enough to supersede short - term national political calculations .
Paradoxically , clinging on to its vested rights and perceived national relicts of power actually leaves it less influential on the course of world affairs .
This means that in a way Europe lacks a common voice on China precisely because it lacks strategic confidence in jointly shaping world affairs with an increasingly influential China .
Rather than explaining to their voters that co-operating with Beijing to address global challenges does not necessarily mean compromising one 's own political values , European policy makers prefer the blame China game for pandering to domestic audiences .
Europe in an increasingly powerless position
This leaves Europe in an increasingly powerless position - ready to be exploited by the sklilful Chinese diplomacy .
Only if Europe overcomes its China angst and spells out a bold and concrete vision for jointly shaping global order will it remain influential .
Technically , the EU is well - placed to use co-operation with China for giving life to its vision of effective multilateralism .
It has built up an impressive system of co-operation with China that brings together a unique mix of instruments and mechanisms aimed at jointly addressing policy challenges - from trade to nuclear non-proliferation .
At the top , however , the annual EU - China Summit has become a lame duck and has failed to provide the requisite political backing for the EU 's new type of flexible network diplomacy that engages with different actors and different levels of the Chinese government .
It is high time for the EU to change course and make the EU - China summits count .
That is , the EU needs to bring to the table a clear agenda with the key points that matter and on which the EU can build broad consensus .
Such an agenda could include issues such as spelling out a concrete framework for how the EU can most effectively assist Beijing in turning China 's ambitious new climate change goals into reality or how China can facilitate international efforts to stop Iran from achieving nuclear weapons through support for the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle .
In turn , European leaders need to make Europe ready for embracing a world in which individual EU member states will no longer occupy the front bench places in global affairs .
Having small European countries such as Austria and the Netherlands cling to their directorships on the World Bank board and Italy to their seat at the G20 summits is anachronistic .
By reducing its over - representation in many global bodies , Europe needs to make room for allowing further Chinese representation and responsibilities .
Europeans seem to be reluctant to specify demands on China for global responsibility in order not to risk receiving what they wish for .
If we really wish for effective multilateralism , let us be ready to embrace it .
Our own experience in Europe has shown that real power is often a more subtle form of influence .
Björn Conrad and Stephan Mergenthaler are researchers at the Global Public Policy Institute ( GPPi ) in Berlin , an independent non-profit think tank focusing on effective and accountable governance , where they co-lead the " EU , China and global governance " programme .
Toddlers with symptoms of autism can show dramatic improvement if they are given early , intensive therapy .
The finding , from the first randomised controlled trial in such young children , should settle the question of whether early screening and treatment of autism are worthwhile .
Sally Rogers , a psychologist at the Mind Institute of the University of California , Davis , and colleagues randomly assigned autistic toddlers aged 18 to 30 months to receive either conventional care or an intensive programme of behavioural therapy known as the Early Start Denver Model .
This emphasises fun , child - directed activities rather than the repetitive exercises used in conventional autism therapies , which are less suitable for very young children .
Learning from fun
“ Being able to follow children ’s leads and build fun into their interactions is an important teaching tool .
That may sound like common sense , but with autism nothing is common sense , ” says Rogers .
After two years , the 24 children in the ESDM programme achieved significantly higher scores in IQ tests and in several measures of language use , everyday skills and social interaction than the children given conventional care .
Psychologists who had not encountered the children before the treatment considered that seven of them no longer met the diagnostic criteria for autism , as compared with just one of the 21 who received conventional care .

Techniques for detecting autism in very young children have been improving for several years , but until now it has not been clear that parents and doctors could do much with the information .
Rogers ’s study should settle that question , says Laura Schreibman , a psychologist at the University of California , San Diego .
“ The cost of providing this treatment when the child is very young is way less than the cost of providing adult care to these individuals , ” she adds .
“ You have to look at it as an investment .
There is a treatment we know is effective .
Let ’s get on with it . ”

One of my guiltiest pleasures is watching men scramble to figure women out .
The practice of convincing women to sleep with them seems particularly challenging and they rack their brains trying to figure out the best way to score .
Cocky men will often claim that all it takes is a bit of ‘ game ’ and they will smugly impart their infinite wisdom on their gawky peers .
A guy that lacks experience in the sex department will sometimes latch on to any tip or trick thrust down his throat without ever considering the lasting effect his behavior has on society as a whole .
There is a difference between ‘ bad game ’ and ‘ good game . ’
Because I ’m in the mood , I ’m going describe a few popular forms of game to all of my young , single , male readers from a woman ’s perspective .
After that , it ’s up to you what you do with this oh so valuable information .
The “ Accidental ” Insult
This is when a man purposely tries to manipulate a woman ’s insecurities in such a way as to make her feel like she has to prove her womanhood by sleeping with him .
To really make this work , a man has to portray his comments and gestures as completely accidental or risk starting a fight .
The key here is subtly .
He does n’t want to insult her too much or she ’ll get angry .
But he does want to insult her just enough to make her feel that there is something wrong with her .
The idea behind this is that women with insecurities are easy to get in bed .
Examples
Common examples of this include : Playfully pinching her back fat or arm fat , casually pointing out wrinkles or dark circles under her eyes , or buying her clothing that is obviously too small for her .
Sometimes a man can simply ask with mock concern , “ Are you tired ?
You look tired today .
Is everything ok ? ”
This works particularly well if the woman is feeling alert and cheerful .
The man ends up looking thoughtful and sensitive , while the woman is left with a nagging feeling that there is something wrong with her face or demeanor .
Once a man has knocked the woman down a couple of pegs , it is much easier for him to close the deal .
She will feel vulnerable and apprehensive and will likely over inflate the importance of even the most meager of validations tossed her way .
She might even put a little extra effort into her lovemaking subconsciously trying to prove to him that she ’s still worthwhile …even if she has gained a couple of pounds .
My Thoughts
This method most assuredly works .
It is an especially effective tool to use against young women who are naturally critical of themselves .
With that said , I do n’t like it .
For one thing , every single criticism that can be said of the female population is a direct result of deep seated insecurities , too much pride , and a shockingly large and easily bruised ego .
The women that constantly feel bad about themselves are also the women that file false domestic abuse charges and seek large quantities of alimony after a divorce .
Women plagued by worries that they ’re no longer desirable have a harder time remaining loyal in their relationships , are generally more mean spirited , and have a larger tendency to engage in malicious gossip .
A woman that completely lacks confidence in herself can be emotionally destroyed by too many ‘ Accidental ’ insults and a woman destroyed is a woman that has nothing to lose by destroying you .
I guess what I ’m trying to say is that if you use this technique , yeah , you might get laid for the night .
But you ’ll also be doing your part to help create a monster .
When you divorce a woman who is zealously consumed by thoughts of ruining your life , you have to ask yourself what is missing in her life that drove her to this point .
What happened to her inner sense of self ?
What happened to her pride that caused her to stoop to such levels ?
Men , if you desire women who are confident , even tempered and fair , then it makes sense to build them up rather than constantly knocking them down .
Sometimes , this might mean jerking off for the night .
Also , I ’d just like to note that I have slept with men that have utilized this technique .
Every single memory is etched into my mind negatively .
A lot of men do n’t mind being remembered as a lousy fuck .
But if you are the type of guy that wants a woman to fondly remember your penis , avoid this technique .
The Balancing Act
This is when a man attempts to insult and compliment a woman at the same time .
This works for all the same reasons that the ‘ Accidental compliment ’ works in that it preys on a woman ’s insecurities .
However , it is much more successfully used on young girls than it is on grown women .
Grown women are liable to get pissed the fuck off .
Examples
“ You know , even though you ’ve got a big ass , I think it ’s really hot . ”
“ Your nose is a little crooked , but your eyes are so beautiful that you barely notice . ”
“ Kirsten Dunst is a lot thinner than you , but I bet you have the better personality . ”
My Thoughts
Like I said above , I generally do not approve of any method of operation that ultimately makes a woman feel bad about herself .
Also , this method often backfires resulting in some pretty intense domestic fights .
The Reverse Compliment
Out of the three , this method takes the most skill and a fair bit of perception to pull off successfully .
Because of this , I do not see it as often used or explained as the other two .
However , with the right amount of practice , it can score you large quantities of ass .
To do this correctly , a man has to first identify an insecurity that the woman already possesses .
Then , he has to casually refrain from validating her until an intimate moment arises .
Example
This is a tough one to explain , so I ’m going to give you a personal example and hope it clarifies things a bit .
Way back when I was a single girl , I decided to get my hair cut before a date .
I told my hairdresser that I wanted something dramatically different from my old hairstyle and she obliged .
However , when I looked in the mirror afterwards , I could n’t decide if I hated it or loved it .
I went on my date feeling very insecure about the cut .
My date made note of it by simply saying , “ Ah , you got your hair cut . ”
I patted my hair nervously and said , “ Yeah , I ’m not really sure how I feel about it .
It ’s really different . ”
Instead of instantly complimenting me , my date said , “ You know , I read somewhere that women who change their hair want to make big changes in their lives . ”
The next thing I knew , we were talking about my goals and it occurred to me that he had n’t said whether or not he liked my hair .
I secretly stressed out about this during the rest of the date .
Much later that evening , during an intimate moment ( We were kissing ) , my date paused and whispered in my ear , “ You know , I really like your hair like that . ”
Oh yeah .
He closed the deal that night .
My Thoughts
While this is technically just another form of manipulating a woman ’s insecurities , I like it because the end result is positive for everyone .
The man gets laid and the woman walks away from the experience feeling a bit more confident and sexy .
Nowhere does the man attempt to create negativity .
Instead , he primes the woman in such a way as to make his compliment seem more sincere .
For example , had my date just complimented my hair right off the bat , I might have suspected that he was just trying to be nice and continued to stress out about it .
However , the way he did it made his opinion seem more genuine and I ended up loving my fucking haircut after our date .
Furthermore , a man that utilizes this technique will likely be remembered positively by the woman he fucks .
While her other sexual experiences may have been shrouded in feelings of shame or anxiety , this one will probably make her smile when she looks back on it .
Also , a woman that has had many positive experiences with men will likely not end up a ball busting , bull dyke feminist .
How is that not a win -win for the whole wide world ?

Missing your own party
The largest spike in attention for this book came and went without me noticing .
The problem with having too much ...
President Donald Trump continued his assault on the integrity of the U.S. elections during the first presidential debate Tuesday , spreading falsehoods about the security of voting and misrepresenting issues with mail ballots .
In the final segment of the contentious debate between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden , Trump launched into an extended argument against mail voting , claiming without evidence that it is ripe for fraud and suggesting mail ballots may be “ manipulated . ”
“ This is going to be a fraud like you ’ve never seen , ” the president said of the massive shift to mail voting prompted by the coronavirus pandemic .
Trump ’s riff was laden with misstatements and inaccuracies .
Mail voting has proved to be safe and secure in the five states that already use it broadly .
And while some irregularities and errors have occurred in the early vote , Trump on Tuesday mischaracterized those incidents .
His comments come as his reelection campaign and the Republican Party have begun challenging the way those ballots are being processed and preparing for broad legal battles after Election Day .
A look at Trump 's claims and the facts .
— Trump accused Philadelphia election officials of inappropriately keeping his campaign 's poll monitors from observing voters filling out mail ballots at a voting center Tuesday .
He was repeating an accusation he and his son had made earlier this week — and election officials have disputed .
Election lawyers note Trump campaign 's watchers had no legal right under state law to observe citizens filling out mail ballots .
— Trump cited a case of military ballots marked for him being thrown in the trash as evidence of a possible plot to steal the election .
But he did n't mention the strange details of the case .
County election officials say that the seven ballots , along with two unopened ones , were accidentally tossed in an elections office in a Republican - controlled county by a single contract worker and that authorities were swiftly called .
— Trump pointed to problems that have arisen as states rush to adapt to mail balloting — mainly in his native New York , where elections officials sent error - riddled mail ballots this week and a slow count left the outcome of multiple congressional primaries up in the air in June .
But he falsely claimed that the outcome of one of those races , the primary won by Democratic Rep. Carolyn Mahoney , was fraudulent .
— Trump claimed a West Virginia mail worker was “ selling ballots . ”
That drew a clarification from West Virginia 's Republican secretary of state , Mac Warner , who noted the case involved a postal worker altering eight absentee ballot applications during the state ’s primary election earlier this year .
Five ballot requests had party affiliations changed from Democrat to Republican .
On the other three requests , the voters ’ GOP party affiliation was not changed but the postal worker circled the word “ Republican ” in a different color ink than was used on the forms .
The carrier pleaded guilty to election fraud and injury to the mail in July .
— Voter fraud is rare in the United States .
An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found Americans were more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter fraud .
Still , Trump continued to sow distrust and again refused to commit to avoid declaring victory if the count goes past Election Day , as expected .
Last week his refusal during a news conference to commit to a peaceful transition alarmed many .
Biden tried to lower the temperature about accepting the voters ' will .
“ I will accept it , and he will , too .
You know why ? ” Biden said .
“ Because once the winner is declared once all the ballots are counted , that ’ll be the end of it .
And that ’s fine . ”

The claimants said funds from their land had been mismanaged The US government has agreed to pay $ 3.4bn ( £ 2.1 bn ) to settle a long - running case over Native American land .
The Cobell case , filed in 1996 , alleged the government had mismanaged billions of dollars in income from natural resources on Native American land .
Under the deal the interior department will share $ 1.4bn ( £ 859 m ) among 300,000 tribe members as compensation and set up a $ 2bn fund to buy land from them .
President Barack Obama said it was " an important step towards reconciliation " .
" I heard from many in Indian Country that the Cobell Suit remained a stain on the nation - to - nation relationship I value so much , " Mr Obama told Congress .
He said he had pledged as a presidential candidate to resolve the issue and was proud the step had finally been made .
The secretary of the interior department also said it would aid reconciliation .
" This is an historic , positive development for Indian country , " Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement released by the department .
Contentious case
The dispute dates back to the 1887 Dawes Act , which seized Indian land - much of it rich in natural resources - and gave it to white - owned companies to exploit .
Ms Cobell said many Natives Americans were owed far more Under the Act , the land was divided into plots and each Indian family was assigned a parcel of land , a concept alien to their culture in which all land belonged to the tribe .
The idea was for them to be " compensated " for the use of their land ; however disputes arose almost immediately , perpetuated as ever smaller parcels of land were inherited by new generations .
Attorney General Eric
Holder said the parties had tried to reach an agreement " many , many times " .
" But today we turn the page .
This settlement is fair to the plaintiffs , responsible for the US , and provides a path forward for the future , " he said .
Elouise Cobell , a member of the Blackfoot tribe and who filed the complaint in 1996 , welcomed the settlement , saying the administration had listened to Native American concerns .
Today is a monumental day for all of the people in Indian Country that have waited so long for justice
Elouise Cobell
The great American land row
But she said there was " no doubt " the final amount was " significantly " less than what those affected actually deserved .
The plaintiffs had claimed they were owed $ 47bn .
Ms Cobell said : " Today is a monumental day for all of the people in Indian Country that have waited so long for justice .
" Did we get all the money that was due us ?
Probably not ... but there too many individual Indian beneficiaries that are dying every single day without their money . "
On its website the department for the interior said that the litigation had included hundreds of motions , dozens of rulings and appeals , and several trials .
The agreement must be approved both by Congress and a federal judge .

The Jerusalem Police on Sunday arrested Yoel Kreus , the " operations officer " of the Eda Haredit , a staunchly anti-Zionist haredi communal organization , for allegedly assaulting a woman in the Meah Shearim neighborhood after she refused to cross the street at his command .
A spokesman for Eda Haredit said " Rabbi Kreus never laid a hand on anyone . "
Haredim Jerusalem ' chastity squad ' branching out Ari Galahar Residents of capital 's Beit Israel neighborhood say members of ' modesty guard ' recently attacked young divorcee , American yeshiva students suspected of screening porn films Jerusalem ' chastity squad ' branching out
When she refused , he allegedly assaulted her , spraying her with mace .
The woman did not require medical attention and called the police .
The officers who arrived at the scene promptly arrested Kreus , who reportedly implicated himself in the incident .
Eda Haredit sources slammed the arrest .
Kreus is a prominent figure in the community and according to the community 's spokesman , Rabbi Shmuel Pappenheim , " The police are burning their last few bridges with the haredi community . "
Many within Eda Haredit speculated that the arrest was actually a form of retribution for the latest haredi riots in the capital .
" Rabbi Kreus spoke against several things lately , so it is possible that is why the police did this , although I certainly hope that is not true , " Pappenheim said .
" Naturally , once a complaint is filed an investigation is in order , but the arrest was wrong .
This is an Eda officer , a major activist in the community , who is all of a sudden suspected of an act he could n’t have possibly committed .
" Rabbi Kreus never laid a hand on anyone and has never taken part in any violent act whatsoever . "

Comparison between w42-11 ( sales release ) and w51 - 1 ( PR1.1 ) at a package level .
It seems that “ word of the year ” announcements have become the de facto way for dictionary makers to grab some social media buzz by selecting a word from our neck of the woods .
And sure enough , they ’ve done it again , this time with Oxford Dictionary declaring “ unfriend ” the word of 2009 .
The definition of the verb is just as you ’d expect : “ To remove someone as a ‘ friend ’ on a social networking site such as Facebook . ”
Several other tech and social media centric word choices were considered , including hashtag , sexting , freemium , and paywall .
Other words that have recently received the dictionary treatment include “ Twitter , ” which entered the Collins English Dictionary earlier this year , and “ Facebook , ” which was Collins ’ word of the year back at the end of 2007 .
The tradition of picking a new media word seems to have originated back in 2004 , when “ Blog ” made the top of Merriam Webster ’s annual list .

A freshwater stingray using the tools it has around it
Freshwater stingrays use water as a " tool " in problem - solving tests , scientists reveal for the first time .
Researchers gave South American freshwater stingrays tests to evaluate their problem - solving ability .
The stingrays learned to use jets of water as a tool to extract a meal of hidden food from a plastic pipe .
It reveals that the fish , once thought a " simple reflex animal " , has cognitive abilities to rival birds , reptiles and mammals , scientists say .
Scientists from Israel , Austria and the US publish their study in the journal Animal Cognition .
Tool use in fish is far from anything seen in birds or mammals
Dr Michael Kuba
Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel
Freshwater stingrays , found in many tropical waters such as the Amazon river , are related to ocean stingrays .
Like sharks , they have skeletons made of cartilage , rather the bony skeletons of less closely related teleost fish .
In the past , scientists have assumed that such cartilaginous fish have limited cognitive abilities , in part because they have been difficult to study , says Dr Michael Kuba from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel who undertook the latest study .
His team tested the ability of captive South American stingrays ( Potamotrygon castexi ) to solve problems , by setting them a series of underwater tasks .

Using a plastic pipe with one end sealed and containing hidden food , researchers observed how the fish overcame the challenge of getting the meal from the container .
They also tested the fish to see if it could discriminate between black and white ends of the tube .
The stingrays not only performed the tasks well but also demonstrated a range of problem - solving strategies , including using water as a " tool " to obtain the hidden reward .
" Tool use in fish is far from anything seen in birds or mammals , " explains Dr Kuba .
Dr Kuba says that the definition of tool use , using an agent to achieve a goal , was set by cognitive scientist Dr Benjamin Beck in 1980 .
The stingrays meet this definition by using water as a tool , manipulating their bodies to create a flow of water that moves food towards them .
At least one other fish species is known to use water in a similar way .
The archer fish , a teleost , shoots spurts of water from its mouth to dislodge prey from leaves above the water 's surface .
" Archer fish use water as a projectile to hunt insects , " says Dr Kuba .
Like the archer fish , the stingrays also use jets of water to dislodge food stuck among plants on the surface of the fish tank , a behaviour caught on video by the researchers .

Previously , stingrays have largely been on the sidelines of cognitive research for a number of reasons , says Dr Kuba .
" Firstly , they are bigger and more difficult to study than other model animals such as zebra fish , guppies or mice , " he says .
" Second , they , like sharks , have often been considered to be reflex machines having very acute senses but limited cognitive capacities . "
" What our study shows is that stingrays are capable of problem solving , " he says .
Dr Kuba also suggests that research on stingrays may reveal important aspects of the vertebrate thought process .
" They are members of one of the oldest lines of vertebrates and to know more about their abilities will help us to learn more about the evolution of cognition in vertebrates . "
A diet of chicken , fish and protein shakes might do wonders for people with brain injuries .
Akiva Cohen of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and his colleagues mimicked brain injury in mice by injecting fluid through a hole drilled in their skull .
After seven days , the brain - injured mice had much lower levels of three branched - chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) , leucine , isoleucine and valine , compared with control mice .
These are found in protein - rich food and are known for their ability to build muscle .
The team then fed another set of brain - injured mice either plain water or water enriched with BCAAs .
Five days later , those that had taken BCAAs had normal levels of the amino acids and performed better on a learning task .

Excitation disturbance
Cohen ’s team reckon they might have figured out how the BCAAs are having this effect .
In the hippocampus of a person with a brain injury , the delicate balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition is disturbed , says Cohen .
The BCAAs may help restore the balance by making more neurotransmitters , he suggests .
The findings complement observations made by a group of Italian biochemists last year .
Simona Viglio of the University of Pavia and colleagues found that minimally conscious patients who were given BCAAs intravenously improved in their “ feeding , grooming and toileting ” abilities .
“ The new findings represent a substantial progression because they provide evidence , on an experimental basis , of the beneficial effects of BCAAs , ” says Viglio .
Cohen ’s group will now look at the effects of BCAAs on other areas of the brain , and are hoping to start human trials of amino acid - based treatments soon .
“ In the near future , BCAA administration in humans could become a routine treatment , ” says Viglio .

Often these lists are funny and curious , light - hearted , and here too we may find some humor where it was intended in the last quips of some offenders .
The author ’s hope is that by looking at these unique cases , at least a starting point for discussion and thought is created .
1 .
Thomas J. Grasso : The Botched Last Meal
Thomas J. Grasso was executed in 1995 in Oklahoma for strangling an 87 year old woman in her home with her Christmas tree lights .
He reportedly stole $ 12 and a cheap television set .
His last meal was extravagant to say the least : two dozen steamed mussels , two dozen steamed clams , a double cheeseburger from Burger King , a half - dozen barbequed spare ribs , two large strawberry milkshakes , half a pumpkin pie , and whipped cream with dice strawberries .
And one more thing : supposedly , a 16 - ounce can of spaghetti with meatballs .
Or , at least that ’s what the prison thought .
His last words suggest there was a miscommunication : “ I did not get my Spaghetti - O ’s , I got spaghetti .
I want the press to know this . ”

George Harris : Famous Last Words
George Harris was executed in 2000 , convicted of shooting a man during a heated argument over the whereabouts of machine guns he had purchased .
His last words are often quoted for their irony : “ Someone needs to kill my trial attorney . ”

Gerald Lee Mitchell : Candy Lover to the End
Gerald Lee Mitchell allegedly shot two men after robbing them during a drug deal .
In a separate case , he was convicted of murder after the shooting death of a man who refused to give him a necklace he wanted .
His attorney claimed that at the time of the murders he had an IQ of 75 and may have been borderline retarded , not operating at full capacity at the time of the crimes .
However , what makes his case stand out more than anything else is not his crime or his personal background , but his strange last meal request : a bag of Jolly Ranchers candies , assorted flavors .

Masumi Hayashi : The Curry Poisoner
This one hails from Wakayama , Japan .
Housewife Masumi Hayashi is currently awaiting execution in Japan for putting arsenic in a communal pot of curry being served at a 1998 festival .
Sixty seven people were poisoned , four of whom died .
The case has gained international attention because the evidence indicting Hayashi is completely circumstantial – she was seen near the curry pot that was poisoned , and she had access to arsenic , as her husband was an exterminator .
However , Hayashi was also tried for three other attempted murders via poison .
She was an insurance saleswoman before , and the motive in those cases was believed to be collecting insurance payments .
( Her husband has since been incarcerated for insurance fraud . )
In this instance , the motive was believed to be revenge , because her neighbors had shunned her family due to its checkered past .

Aileen Wuornos : Spaceships and Aliens
Aileen Wuornos killed seven men in Florida between 1989 and 1990 while working as a prostitute .
She sometimes claimed that these killings were acts of self - defense against rape , though at other times said they were not .
As her execution neared , she became increasingly outraged at prison officials , citing various injustices and acts of inhumane treatment , and also said that the prison matrons wished to rape her before her execution .
In her final interview , she said that her mind was being controlled by “ sonic pressure ” to make her appear crazy , and that she would be taken to a spaceship by angels once dead .
Her final words were : “ Yes , I would just like to say I ’m sailing with the rock , and I ’ll be back , like Independence Day with Jesus .
June 6 , like the movie .
Big mother ship and all , I ’ll be back , I ’ll be back . ”

Odell Barnes : International Controversy and an Inedible Last Meal
The case of Odell Barnes is well known , and is remarkable for the amount of international media attention it got .
In 1989 , an intruder ( allegedly Odell Barnes ) broke into the Texas home of Helen Bass , 42 , then robbed , beat , stabbed , and possibly raped her , before ending her life with a gunshot to the head .
The crux of his case was built on forensic evidence and an eyewitness that placed him at the scene .
The case was largely viewed as open and shut by the jury , who took a scant three hours to find him guilty .
Barnes was unable to afford his own lawyers , and public defenders were not equipped to handle the case , so he was appointed two local attorneys , who had a small budget and not much preparation .
They conducted no defensive investigation or forensic tests .
Anti-death penalty activists at home and abroad ( especially in France ) contributed to a new defense fund , and the new lawyers uncovered several discrepancies and inconsistencies in the original case , including places where the testimony of witnesses was problematic and potentially outright false .
The defense team also uncovered evidence of tampering .
Despite the divided public opinions and international controversy , Odell Barnes did not receive clemency , and was executed .
His last meal request was for “ Justice , Equality , World Peace . ”

Mumia Abu - Jamal : The World ’s Most Famous Inmate ?
Mumia Abu - Jamal is notable as likely the most famous Death Row inmate in the world , convicted of the 1981 killing of Philadelphia cop Daniel Faulkner .
His sentence is one of the most passionately debated in modern history .
An outspoken activist and critic of local authority , many have claimed that Abu - Jamal was given an unfair trial .
This is supported by the key witnesses at his original trial , who have since recanted their testimonies .
On the flip side , some evidence remains damning to this day , such as the murder weapon being both on the scene and belonging to Abu - Jamal .
The specifics of the case are worthy of a read unto themselves , but what makes Abu - Jamal most unique is the amount of fame he has garnered .
Recording artists Snoop Dogg , Rage Against the Machine , Anti-Flag , and Massive Attack have all produced songs referencing Abu - Jamal ( to name but a few ) , and he is the subject of four documentaries .
He is an honorary citizen of at least 25 cities around the world , most notably Paris .
In 2006 , Republican leaders in Philadelphia filed criminal complaints within the French legal system against the city of Paris for “ glorifying ” Abu - Jamal .

William Kogut : Ingenious Suicide
William Kogut was on death row at San Quentin , but was never actually executed .
In a note , he stated that only he should have the right to punish himself for his crimes , and so he committed suicide in a remarkable way .
He had decks of playing cards , a pipe , a broom , and a kerosene heater in his room .
He tore the packs of playing cards to shreds , taking the pieces with red ink .
At the time , the ink in these cards contained nitrocellulose , which is flammable when wet .
He stuffed these into his pipe , then crammed a broom handle in behind them to plug the pipe .
He then poured water through the other end of the pipe , which soaked the card pieces at the end into an explosive mixture .
Finally , he put the plugged end against the kerosene heater in his room and the empty end against his head , creating something not unlike a shotgun .
The heat from the heater turned the water to steam , causing an explosive pressure build up that helped ignite the nitrocellulose solution .
This in turn caused an explosion that actually shot pieces of playing cards through his skull .

Gene Hathorn : Fish Food Artist
Gene Hathorn has been on Death Row since 1985 for killing his own family .
He has partnered with controversial Danish artist Marco Evaristti to use his body in an art exhibit .
Hathorn maintains his innocence and is still in the appeals process , but if executed his body will be deep - frozen and transferred to Germany , where Evaristti will use it as fish food .
“ My aim is to first deep freeze Gene ’s body and then make fish food out of it .
Visitors to my exhibition will be able to feed goldfish with it , ” Evaristti told The Art Newspaper .
The exhibit is part of Evaristti ’s ongoing work that seeks to create discussion about the death penalty ’s role in society .
Evaristti is well known for strange and controversial work , including spray painting an entire iceberg red .

John Wayne Gacy : The Killer Clown
John Wayne Gacy , Jr. raped and murdered at least 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978 .
Twenty - six of these bodies were found in the crawl space of his house , with three more buried elsewhere on his property .
He was a KFC manager and a part - time clown known as “ Pogo ” .
During his trial , he jokingly remarked that the only illegal thing he ’d ever done was “ running a cemetery without a license . ”
His reported last words are unconfirmed , but are said to be “ Kiss my ass , ” aimed at a correctional officer before going to the injection room .
After his death , his brain was removed and is currently in the possession of Dr. Helen Morrison , who looked for common traits in the brains of serial killers .
Her examination of Gacy ’s brain revealed no abnormalities .

The things we ’ve seen on this list – the absurd , the striking , the controversial , the disturbing – are all facets of human life , and if nothing else we should be unsurprised to see them on Death Row .
It is all too easy to forget that , whatever their flaws or crimes , and however inhumane some of their acts may be , those executed are still people , with quirks and personal tastes .

This Christmas , the first installment of Doctor Who : The End of Time will be screened in the UK .
Featuring the well publicized demise of the tenth Doctor , David Tennant and the birth of a new , younger model in Matt Smith , the two - parter is sure to be a ratings winner .
But what do we actually know about Tennant ’s swansong ?
Four knocks will signal his doom , the Ood have also predicted his demise and of course
The Master will be making his long awaited comeback also , but still , actual details about the plot remain scarce .
Also bowing out this year is Russel T. Davies as the show ’s writer and executive producer , so expect all bets to be off in the first episode , to be screened on Dec 25th .
Speaking to Wales Online , Davies was clear that the story would be kept under wraps until the big day , and that fans should appreciate that fact :
“ We do like keeping secrets .
You should always watch it without knowing what ’s going to happen and watch it unfold , brand new in front of you . ”
“ If you want to go online and look for all the spoilers then go ahead , but I know for a fact you are depriving yourself of enjoyment , which I think says a lot about the online experience .
It ruins it when you know too much . ”
So with little to go on in the way of plot spoilers , how about those images ?
Released today by the BBC , we have pictures of The Master , gagged and bound and flanked by armed guards .
However , knowing The Master , one would assume that it ’s all part of a far grander plan .
A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen .
The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return .
The sign , cast by camp prisoners , which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates " Arbeit Macht Frei " ( work sets you free ) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp , is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery .
Katarzyna Padlo , spokeswoman for police in Oświęcim , ( the Polish name for Auschwitz ) in south - eastern Poland , said : " We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30 am and 5 am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police . "
Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign .
Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5 m - long heavy cast - iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate , over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country .
The news of the sign 's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return .
Shimon Peres , president of Israel , discussed the theft with Poland 's prime minister , Donald Tusk , in Copenhagen today .
" The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place , " he told Tusk .
" The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world . "
Avner Shalev , president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel , said : " This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust , " referring to those responsible as " certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days " .
Jaroslaw Mensfeld , a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz , called the incident " shameful " and said it amounted to the " desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered " .
Karen Pollock , chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK , said she was disgusted by the robbery , which she called an " appalling act of vandalism [ that showed ] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there .
" The Nazi death camp Auschwitz - Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule . "
Poland 's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency .
" This is regretful and embarrassing , " said Bogdan Borusewicz , chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate .
" I just hope they do n't destroy the plaque . "
Andrzej Przewoznik , minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments , said : " This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal . "
There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery , with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers , from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters .
Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery .
Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras .
They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other .
Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van .
After that any trail of the thieves has been lost .
Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police .
A 5,000 zloty ( £ 1,000 ) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign .
Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site , which is now a museum .
The Polish ambassador to Israel , Agnieszka Magdziak - Miszewska , said that it was believed the robbery had been " meticulously planned , because they were not caught on security cameras " .
She added : " Finding the metal sign has become a national priority . "
Approximately 1.5 million people , mainly Jews , died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi- occupied Poland .
About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war .
The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940 , and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer , linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work .
Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired .

First , they came for the NAZIs : Cantwell Convicted , First Amendment Attacked Today a jury at Federal district church in Concord , NH returned two guilty verdicts for “ Crying Nazi ” Christopher Cantwell .
He ’s facing up to 20 years in prison for felony interstate extortion and threat charges for telling another despicable Nazi over the Telegram chat app that Cantwell was going to fuck his wife in front of their children if the “ victim ” did n’t cough up information about another white supremacist .
No doubt , it ’s easy to hate Christopher Cantwell .
He himself is a hater .
He judges and hates other people for the color of their skin , their belief systems , among other things .
He also hates himself .
Cantwell is aware of his various faults and failures and he despises himself , punishing himself with drug abuse and distracting himself by hating others .
How do I know this about him ?
I know Cantwell – I do n’t know whether he ’d admit it , but I ’m basically his minister .
I try to minister a message of peace to a man whose name literally speaks to who he is – a man who Can ’t - be - Well .
He and I have spent countless hours together prior to and since him becoming a racist and Nazi .
I have chronicled his story here on this blog from as far back as his early days .
Before becoming a racist , he was a controversial cop-hating libertarian comedian that escaped from New York to move here to Keene , New Hampshire .
At one point , Chris admitted that his formula in life for financial success was the more people hated him , the more money he made .
At another time , he publicly stated that Christopher Cantwell was a “ character ” .
I ’m not sure where the real Chris was in relation to the “ character ” of Cantwell , but I do know his fall has been tragic and also entirely preventable .
The government gang deserves plenty of blame as well , and I ’ll get to that , but for now let ’s focus on three of Cantwell ’s biggest mistakes : 1 . Racism is stupid and inhumane .
–
When Cantwell was a libertarian , he would have judged people by their individual actions and character rather than by their circumstances of birth .
Sadly , around 2015 Cantwell started to become a racist as he was following an apparently similar arc by one of his prime influencers , Stefan Molyneux .
Cantwell likely believed that he’d be so hated if he became a racist that he ’d make way more money than being a less - hated libertarian comedian .
He dove in deep to racism , destroying a ton of productive relationships .
For instance , I fired him from my radio show , Free Talk Live .
Cantwell had been one of our best hosts , before his fall to racism – he was really entertaining on - air .
Unfortunately , it was n’t long after he became a racist until Cantwell completely abandoned any semblance of libertarian thought and totally embraced statism .
This turn towards statism also left him with the delusional belief that the police could be a helpful tool .
2 . Do n’t talk to the police !
–
When he moved here as a cop-hating , crass libertarian comedian , Cantwell was likely being watched by the FBI for his public statements that skirted the line of advocating violence against the police .
After he moved back to Keene in 2015 , he had an encounter in downtown Keene which altered his views about the police .
In the encounter , KPD officers did n’t shoot Cantwell who had drawn his gun to defend a young woman from an attack by a drunken man .
While it was good for Cantwell to stop hating and collectivizing the humans behind the inhumane role of “ law enforcement officer ” , it went bad for him because he went too far and actually started to embrace and trust the police .
When he became a racist , he saw them as his future ally and tool of force to use to create his fantasy white paradise .
So , he started talking to them regularly , from a local KPD sergeant to FBI agents including Phil Christiana , the longtime investigator of various libertarian activists in Keene .
Ultimately , Cantwell ’s habit of chatting with cops led to him being charged and convicted as a political prisoner .
Based on testimony I witnessed during a federal bail hearing and further testimony at trial – which was covered in detail by Hilary Sargent – it ’s clear Cantwell sunk his own case .
First , by admitting to the FBI that he was the person behind the account - in - question on Telegram and then further by using the term “ threat ” to describe the obviously hyperbolic chat in an email to his “ friend ” at Keene Police .
Without claiming the account in his talks with the FBI , there may have been no way to prove it was Cantwell behind the account .
As one agent admitted under oath at the bail hearing , Telegram is not operating servers in the United States and the agents ca n’t subpoena them for information like IP addresses for its users .
Cantwell ’s own admissions to police likely were factors that sealed his fate in this case .
Speaking to police is a grave danger to your freedom .
3 . Do n’t make haters your hobby .
Ignore them as best you can .
–
With publicity comes haters , it ’s just part of life .
Per his life plan , Cantwell relished every opportunity to engage his haters in the hopes they would hate him even more , and spread his product around .
At one time his product was a libertarian radio show and various blog posts .
He had his haters in his libertarian days , but it was n’t until after he became a racist that he met haters willing to sink even lower than Cantwell himself .
Always a divisive figure , but intelligent and well - spoken , Cantwell quickly rose to prominence in the white nationalist community .
True to his form , he got into internet conflict with various racist people and groups including the “ Bowl Patrol ” , a group of Nazis that were even more detestable in their opinions than Cantwell , if that ’s possible .
The group took its name from the haircut of Dylan Roof , the mass murderer at a church in South Carolina some years ago .
Originally Cantwell fans , their honeymoon with Cantwell ended and they turned on each other .
Bowl Patrol raided Cantwell ’s phone lines incessantly with awful prank calls during his online radio show , among other online targetings .
The point is , Cantwell became obsessed with them , trying to identify who the members were and spending time telling the police all about his issues with them .
At one point Cantwell even called Child Protective Services on “ CheddarMane ” aka Benjamin Lambert , the supposed “ victim ” in the case in which Cantwell was convicted today .
Had Cantwell just ignored and blocked the haters rather than engage them , none of this would ever have happened .

Christopher Cantwell ’s Conviction : Caselaw Applies to Everyone , Not Just People You Hate Hi Special Agent Shayne , or more accurately , hi Shayne ’s handler .
I expect that Shayne will have to take one of those HR classes on how to not friend request the target or the target ’s friends under your real name .
To the rest of you who have not ascended from the depths of the Federal Government : I typically avoid reporting on my friends .
Because either I ’m talking to the internet about them “ behind their backs ” or I ’m getting a story together with the topic of the story , and that ’s just bad journalism regardless of how much the corporate media does it .
Then it occurred to me that I ’m not a journalist ; I ’m a reporter and a commentator .

Sarah Palin greets fans at a book signing event for her new book " Going Rogue " at the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn .
Monday , Dec. 7 , 2009 .
Andy King / AP
It was a Palin party at the Mall of America Monday .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was there for more than three hours to sign her new book , " Going Rogue . "
Palin , who was the vice presidential running mate of Republican John McCain in the 2008 election , signed books for more than 1,000 people , some of whom urged her to run for office again .
People started arriving at the mall in the cold and dark , a full seven hours before the noon start time for Palin 's book signing .
" This is better than Black Friday by far , " said Darla Hathaway of Rosemount , who was first in line to meet Palin .
She said she showed up at 4:30 this morning .
" It 's an extraordinary opportunity to meet her and to thank her for her book , and encourage her to keep going and run for president and be there for the people , " Hathaway said .
As the hours passed , more people started lining up behind Hathaway .
By mid-morning , the line was estimated at 800 people .
An official with the Mall of America said 1,500 wristbands were given out , but could n't say if all of those with wristbands would have their books signed .

Palin started signing books about 20 minutes before her scheduled start .
She did n't address reporters or the crowd .
Instead , she started signing books with workman - like efficiency .
This is just one of many stops Palin is making to promote her book , which has sold more than a million copies , and it shows .
It worked like an assembly line , with Palin 's husband Todd opening up each book for her to sign , as she mixed in small talk and a handshake for each person who met her .
Some of those in line said they already read the book .
Others started reading it as they waited to meet Palin .
Many in the audience were casually dressed .
But there was a Palin impersonator , a man wearing sweatpants that read " drill , baby , drill , " and a husband and wife wearing matching shirts that said " Palin / Bachmann 2012 . "
That couple , Tom and Gae Magnafici , said they want to see Palin run for the White House with U.S. Rep.
Michele Bachmann , a Republican from Minnesota 's 6th District , as her running mate .
Gae and Tom Magnafici are among the first in line at the Palin book signing at the Mall of America .
They wore their sweatshirts to urge Palin to run for president with Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann .
The Magnaficis are from St. Croix Falls , Wis. MPR Photo / Tim Nelson
" I just think these would be the two people who can straighten out the country in 2012 , because we 're not getting the job right now , " said Tom Magnafici .
Magnafici was n't the only one hoping for Palin to run .
Many in line said they would back her over Minnesota 's own Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who has n't ruled out his own run for president .
Steven Vigoren of Gilbert said he 'd support Palin over any other candidate .
" I will vote for Sarah Palin anytime she 's on the ballot .
Pawlenty is good , but he 's no Sarah Palin .
She is so much better , " he said .
Palin is n't just signing books while she 's in Minnesota .
She was also set to headline a high - dollar , private fundraiser for a conservative group called the Freedom Club .
Freedom Club spokeswoman Midge Dean said Palin agreed to attend a small gathering at a Bloomington hotel .
Dean said people are being asked to give $ 5,000 to meet Palin , have a photo taken with her , and have her autograph a book .
" It 's extremely important to us because she 's a very popular person .
And we wanted to raise money for our project this year , which is to get back [ Republican ] control the Minnesota House , " Dean said .
Dean said her group paid a fee to have Palin appear at the event , but she would not disclose the amount .
Palin has reportedly been asking for upwards of $ 100,000 for such events .
While Palin's supporters are excited about her Minnesota appearance , Frank Benenati with the Democratic National Committee said Palin is out of touch with most voters .
" While there may be long lines at some places on her book tour , including the Mall of America there , her ideals and what she represents are far from what mainstream Americans want in a political leader , " he said .
Palin has said little about a possible run for the White House in 2012 .
But an appearance over the weekend -- when she signed books in Iowa -- could be a signal .
Iowa is where the first presidential contest will be held in 2012 .
Editor 's Note :
This is a great example of a great FanPost .
love the historical tie-ins and the love for the Yotes and Sharks ( Except on Sharks / Yotes gamedays )
I made this on the Sharks blog page , but I'm a ' Yotes fan as well , and I figured I 'd share this just so some people could get a little kick out of it .
Hope you enjoy .
Growing up in San Jose , I started playing ice hockey 4 years before the San Jose Sharks were even a reality .
With the Northern California Bay Area far from a hockey hotbed , resources for learning about professional hockey were limited to the Long Island - based Sportschannel ( all Isles , all the time ! ) , and hockey cards .
Being all of 10 years old , I was like any other kid eager to learn .
I memorized stats , knew which country each player was from , and could tell you what style each player was known for .
But the one thing that really sparked my interest on each hockey card was the difference in each players ' gloves .
Some wore beefy , short - cuffed gauntlets , some wore sleek , long - cuffed gloves that seemed to wrap around the stick as if it were part of their anatomy .
I could tell you which brand almost every player wore , if it was made of leather or nylon , and what colors they were .
Even as an adult , I still get a little giggly when trying on a new pair of mitts .
These days , the technology that goes into making hockey gloves is far superior than what it was 20 + years ago , everything from the materials used to the scientific process of blending form and function .
But in the NHL , it seems that style has been thrown out the window by a majority of teams , making the styling of gloves a thing of the past .
As of this writing , 10 NHL teams sport an all black glove motif .
Let me re-word that , so that you can sense my extreme boredom .
ONE THIRD of all NHL teams wear gloves that are black , and nothing else ( except maybe some lettering .
Whoopty doo ) .
In no particular order , these teams are : Anaheim , Boston , Calgary , San Jose , Chicago , Philadephia , Colorado , Dallas , Los Angeles , and Pittsburgh .
via assets.nydailynews.com
( Do n't worry , Sid .
The monotony puts me to sleep , too . )
How about teams wearing all blue gloves ?
I count 8 .
Those teams would be :
Atlanta , Edmonton , Florida , Nashville , NYI , St. Louis , Toronto , Vancouver .
Heck , I could go on and on about the solid color scheme 21 out of the 30 NHL teams have predominantly adopted , but what if we could change that ?
As I said before , the technology of hockey has made vast improvements over the years , so why not bring back a little variety ?
With a little bit of creativity , any team can create a memorable look , even if they only use it once in awhile .
How about the original 6 adopting the old - school , brown leather look ?
After all , they all had leather - brown gloves at some point in their early days .
Detroit , Boston , Toronto , Chicago , NYR , and Montreal could all rock these bad boys whenever they face each other :
via ep.yimg.com ( Yes , they are brand new )
via www.spelten.com
( Throwback gloves !
Remeniscent of yesteryear , right ?)
How about Phoenix playing along with the desert theme , and adding a radical rattlesnake look ?
Okay , maybe that 's stretchin ' it ...
But as you can see , the option IS there if someone wanted to explore it .
Score an empty netter for Technology .
But one of the most intriguing reasons I thought of this post was the San Jose Sharks .
From 1967 - 1976 , Northern California was home to another hockey team , The California / Oakland Golden Seals .
And for a brief time , the Seals wore white skates .
via www.hockeytalk.biz
The thought of wearing white skates was laughable until the mid-1990's , when Nike used Sergei Fedorov as their spokesman for their first forray into the hockey business .
The result ?
Kids in every rink wanted a pair .
via www.hhof.com
( Little did he know , but Sergei was the first Russian in the NHL to be big pimpin ' )
So , maybe as an homage to the previous hockey team in NorCal , or maybe just to deter from the fact that 80 % of their division wears all black gloves , I was thinking ......
Why not white gloves for the Sharks ?
The All - Star game last year featured white gloves with colored cuffs for the Western Conference , and I thought they were rather sharp looking .
via cache2.asset-cache.net
( Hey !
I know those guys ! )
via www4.pictures.gi.zimbio.com
( Somethin ' for the ' Yotes fans )
Now , what if the Sharks wore those white gloves once in awhile , with the same black cuff that currently resides on their all black counterparts ?
I realize that some hockey purists would cringe at the thought , but it 's obvious to most that times are a changin ' .
Here 's some terrible mockups I did ( forgive the poor MS Paint skills .
You get the idea ) :
Personally , I 'm sold .
The only team in the NHL badass enough to rock those ?
Where else would be more fitting than San Jose ?
It 's a solid argument that San Jose , due to the hockey history in the Bay Area , should get first crack at the predominantly white look .
And if you disagree with me , I 'll slew foot you .
But agree with me or not on San Jose , I 'm personally a fan of the all white look .
It adds some flash to what has become an overlooked facet of the game .
As you can see , When it comes to options , the sky 's the limit .
Kids these days do n't realize how great we had it .
But ask any rabid , 11 year old hockey fan these days , I 'm sure they could tell you how great it could be .
Just do n't listen to them if their argument is " not as good as these " beauties :

Now , I leave it up to you .
What would you want to see ?
Anaheim or Philly in Orange ?
Boston in bright yellow ?
More two - tone gloves ?
Dallas in gold ?
L.A. in pink ? ( Eheeh ! )

ROME 's Career Regular Season Statistics
Much recent attention has been paid to the email about the “ trick ” and the effort to “ hide the decline ” .
Climate scientists have complained that this email has been taken “ out of context ” .
In this case , I ’m not sure that it ’s in their interests that this email be placed in context because the context leads right back to a meeting of IPCC authors in Tanzania , raising serious questions about the role of IPCC itself in “ hiding the decline ” in the Briffa reconstruction .
Relevant Climategate correspondence in the period ( September - October 1999 ) leading up to the trick email is incomplete , but , in context , is highly revealing .
There was a meeting of IPCC lead authors between Sept 1 - 3 , 1999 to consider the “ zero - order draft ” of the Third Assessment Report .
The emails provide clear evidence that IPCC had already decided to include a proxy diagram reconstructing temperature for the past 1000 years and that a version of the proxy diagram was presented at the Tanzania meeting showing the late twentieth century decline .
I now have a copy of the proxy diagram presented at this meeting ( see below ) .
The emails show that the late 20th century decline in the Briffa reconstruction was perceived by IPCC as “ diluting the message ” , that “ everyone in the room at IPCC ” thought that the Briffa decline was a “ problem ” and a “ potential distraction / detraction ” , that this was then the “ most important issue ” in chapter 2 of the IPCC report and that there was “ pressure ” on Briffa and other authors to show a “ nice tidy story ” of “ unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more ” .
[ Update Dec 11 – see note at bottom on the chronology .
Comments from readers have clarified that the issue at the Arusha meeting was that the Briffa reconstruction “ diluted the message ” more through its overall inconsistency as opposed to the decline , which was still relatively attenuated in the Arusha version .
After the Arusha meeting , Briffa hastily re-calculated his reconstruction sending a new version to Mann on Oct 5 , 1999 and it was this hastily re-done version that introduced the very severe decline that was hidden in the First Order Draft and Jones WMO Report ]
The chronology in today ’s posts show that the version of the Briffa reconstruction shown in the subsequent proxy diagram in the IPCC “ First Order Draft ” ( October 27 , 1999 ) , presumably prepared under the direction of IPCC section author Mann , deleted the inconvenient portion ( post - 1960 ) of the Briffa reconstruction , together with other modifications that had the effect of not “ diluting the message ” .
About two weeks later ( Nov 16 , 1999 ) came the now infamous Jones email reporting the use of “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” to “ hide the decline ” in a forthcoming WMO ( World Meteorological Organization ) report .
Jones ’ methodology is different than the IPCC methodology .
Jones ’ trick has been described in previous posts .
Today , I ’ll describe both the context of the IPCC version of the “ trick ” and progress to date in reverse engineering the IPCC trick .
IPCC Lead Authors ’ Meeting , Sept 1999
IPCC Lead Authors met in Arusha , Tanzania from September 1 to 3 , 1999 ( see Houghton , 929985154.txt and 0938018124.txt ) , at which the final version of the “ zero - order ” draft of the Third Assessment Report was presented and discussed .
The “ First - Order Draft ” was sent out to reviewers two months later ( end of October 1999 ) .
By this time , IPCC was already structuring the Summary for Policy - makers and a proxy diagram showing temperature history over the past 1000 years was a “ clear favourite ” .
A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary .
( Folland , Sep 22 , 1999 , in 0938031546.txt )
This desire already placed “ pressure ” on the authors to “ present a nice tidy story ” about “ unprecedented warming in a thousand years ” :
I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘ apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data ’ …( Briffa , Sep 22 , 1999 , 0938031546.txt )
The “ zero - order ” draft ( their Figure 2.3.3a as shown below ) showed a version of the Briffa reconstruction with little variation and a noticeable decline in the late 20th century .
Figure 1 . IPCC Third Assessment Report Zero-Order Draft Figure 2.3.3a Comparison of millennial Northern Hemisphere ( NH ) temperature reconstructions from different investigators ( Briffa et al , 1998 ; Jones et al , 1998 ; Mann et al , 1998; 1999a ) …
All the series were filtered with a 40 year Gaussian filter .
The problematic Briffa reconstruction is the yellow series .
No minutes of this meeting are available , but Climategate correspondence on Sep 22 - 23 , 1999 provides some contemporary information about the meeting .
Mann noted that “ everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that the [ decline in the Briffa reconstruction ] was a problem ” :
Keith ’s series … differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that Phil ’s does from ours .
This is the problem we all picked up on ( everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a potential distraction / detraction from the reasonably concensus viewpoint we ’d like to show w/ the Jones et al and Mann et al series .
( Mann , Sep 22 , 1999 , 0938018124.txt )
IPCC Chapter Author Folland of the U.K. Hadley Center wrote to Mann , Jones and Briffa that the proxy diagram was a “ clear favourite ” for the Summary Policy - makers , but that the existing presentation showing the decline of the Briffa reconstruction “ dilutes the message rather significantly ” .
After telling the section authors about the stone in his shoe , Folland added that he only “ wanted the truth ” .
A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary .
But the current diagram with the tree ring only data [ i.e. the Briffa reconstruction ] somewhat contradicts the multiproxy curve and dilutes the message rather significantly .
[ We want the truth .
Mike thinks it lies nearer his result ( which seems in accord with what we know about worldwide mountain glaciers
and , less clearly , suspect about solar variations ) .
The tree ring results may still suffer from lack of multicentury time scale variance .
This is probably the most important issue to resolve in Chapter 2 at present ..( Folland , Sep 22 , 1999 , in 0938031546.txt )
Climategate Letters , Sep 22 - 23 , 1999
The Climategate Letters contain a flurry of correspondence between Mann , Briffa , Jones and Folland ( copy to Tom Karl of NOAA ) on Sep 22 - 23 , 1999 , shedding light on how the authors responded to the stone in IPCC ’s shoe .
By this time , it appears that each of the three authors ( Jones , Mann and Briffa ) had experimented with different approaches to the “ problem ” of the decline .
Jones appears to have floated the idea of using two different diagrams – one without the inconvenient Briffa reconstruction ( presumably in the Summary for Policy - makers ) and one with the Briffa reconstruction ( presumably in the relevant chapter ) .
Jones said that this might make it “ somewhat awkward for the reader trying to put them into context ” , with it being unclear whether Jones viewed this as an advantage or disadvantage :
If we go as is suggested then there would be two diagrams – one simpler one with just Mann et al and Jones et al and in another section Briffa et al .
This might make it somewhat awkward for the reader trying to put them into context .
( Jones , Sep 22 , 1999 Jones 093801949 )
Another approach is perhaps evidenced in programming changes a week earlier ( Sep 13 - 14 , 1999 ) , in which programs in the osborn - tree6 / mann / oldprog directory appear to show efforts to “ correct ” the calibration of the Briffa reconstruction , which may or may not be relevant to the eventual methodology to “ hide the decline ” .
The correspondence implies ( though this is at present not proven ) that IPCC section author Mann ’s first reaction to the “ problem ” was to totally delete the Briffa reconstruction from the proxy diagram , as the correspondence of September 22 seems to have been precipitated by Briffa being unhappy at an ( unseen ) version of the proxy diagram in which his reconstruction had been deleted .
Briffa ’s length email of Sep. 22 , 19990 ( 938031546.txt ) should be read in full .
Briffa was keenly aware of the pressure to present a “ nice tidy story ” of “ unprecedented warming ” , but is worried about the proxy evidence :
I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘ apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data ’ but in reality the situation is not quite so simple …
[ There are ] some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent warming .
I do not think it wise that this issue be ignored in the chapter .
( Briffa , Sep 22 , 1999 , 0938031546.txt )
He continued :
For the record , I do believe that the proxy data do show unusually warm conditions in recent decades .
I am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive data .
I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years ago .
I do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend that that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the Holocene ( not Milankovich ) that require explanation and that could represent part of the current or future background variability of our climate .
( Briffa , Sep 22 , 1999 , 0938031546.txt )
Thus , when Mann arrived at work on Sep 22 , 1999 , Mann observed that he had walked into a “ hornet ’s nest ” .
( Mann Sep 22 , 1999 , 0938018124.txt ) .
In an effort to resolve the dispute , Mann said that ( subject to the agreement of Chapter Authors Karl and Folland ) he would add back Briffa ’s reconstruction , but pointed out that this would present a “ conundrum ” :
So if Chris [ Folland ] and Tom [ Karl ] are ok with this , I would be happy to add Keith ’s series .
That having been said , it does raise a conundrum :
We demonstrate [ through comparining an exatropical averaging of our nothern hemisphere patterns with Phil ’s more extratropical series ) that the major discrepancies between Phil ’s and our series can be explained in terms of spatial sampling / latitudinal emphasis ( seasonality seems to be secondary here , but probably explains much of the residual differences ) .
But that explanation certainly can’t rectify why Keith ’s series , which has similar seasonality * and * latitudinal emphasis to Phil ’s series , differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that Phil ’s does from ours . ]
This is the problem we all picked up on ( everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a potential distraction / detraction from the reasonably concensus viewpoint we ’d like to show w/ the Jones et al and Mann et al series .
( Mann Sep 22 , 0938018124.txt
Mann went on to say that the skeptics would have a “ field day ” if the declining Briffa reconstruction were shown and that he ’d “ hate to be the one ” to give them “ fodder ” :
So , if we show Keith ’s series in this plot , we have to comment that “ something else ” is responsible for the discrepancies in this case .
[ Perhaps Keith can help us out a bit by explaining the processing that went into the series and the potential factors that might lead to it being “ warmer ” than the Jones et al and Mann et al series ??
We would need to put in a few words in this regard ]
Otherwise , the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and , thus , can undermine faith in the paleoestimates .
I do n’t think that doubt is scientifically justified , and I ’d hate to be the one to have to give it fodder !
( Mann Sep 22 , 0938018124.txt )
By the following day , matters seem to have settled down , with Briffa apologizing to Mann for his temporary pangs of conscience .
On Oct 5 , 1999 , Osborn ( on behalf of Briffa ) sent Mann a revised version of the Briffa reconstruction with more “ low - frequency ” variability ( Osborn , Oct 5 , 1999 , 0939154709.txt ) , a version that is identical up to 1960 , this version is identical to the digital version archived at NCDC for Briffa et al ( JGR 2001 ) .
( The post -1960 values of this version were not “ shown ” in the version archived at NCDC ; they were deleted . )
As discussed below , this version had an even larger late - 20th century decline than the version shown at the Tanzania Lead Authors ’ meeting .
Nonetheless , the First Order Draft ( Oct 27 , 1999 ) sent out a few weeks later contained a new version of the proxy diagram ( Figure 2.25 ) , a version which contains the main elements of the eventual Third Assessment Report proxy diagram ( Figure 2.21 ) .
Two weeks later came Jones ’ now infamous “ trick ” email ( 0942777075.txt ) .
The IPCC Trick
Mann ’s IPCC trick is related to the Jones ’ trick , but different .
( The Jones trick has been explained in previous CA posts here , here and consists of replacing the tree ring data with temperature data after 1960 – thereby hiding the decline – and then showing the smoothed graph as a proxy reconstruction . )
While some elements of the IPCC Trick can be identified with considerable certainty , other elements are still somewhat unclear .
The diagram below shows the IPCC version of the Briffa reconstruction ( digitized from the IPCC 2001 ) compared to actual Briffa data from the Climategate email of October 5 , 1999 , smoothed using the methodology said to have been used in the caption to the IPCC figure ( a 40 year Hamming filter with end - point padding with the mean of the closing 20 years ) .
Figure 3 . Versions of the Briffa Reconstruction in controversy , comparing the original data smoothed according to the reported methodology to a digitization of the IPCC version .
Clearly , there are a number of important differences between the version sent to Mann and the version that appeared in the IPCC report .
The most obvious is , of course , that the decline in the Briffa reconstruction has , for the most part , been deleted from the IPCC proxy diagram .
However , there are some other frustrating inconsistencies and puzzles that are all too familiar .
There are some more technical inconsistencies that I ’ll record for specialist readers .
It is very unlikely that that the IPCC caption is correct in stating that a 40 - year Hamming filter was used .
Based on comparisons of the MBH reconstruction and Jones reconstruction , as well as the Briffa reconstruction , to versions constructed from raw data , it appears that a Butterworth filter was used – a filter frequently used in Mann ’s subsequent work ( a detail that , in addition , bears on the authorship of the graphic itself ) .
Second , the IPCC caption stated that “ boundary constraints imposed by padding the series with its mean values during the first and last 25 years . ”
Again , this does n’t seem to reconcile with efforts to replicate the IPCC version from raw data .
It appears far more likely to me that each of the temperature series has been padded with instrumental temperatures rather than the mean values of the last 25 years .
Finally , there are puzzling changes in scale .
The underlying annual data for the Jones and Briffa reconstructions are expressed in deg C ( basis 1961 - 1990 ) and should scale simply to the smoothed version in the IPCC version , but do n’t quite .
This may partly derive from errors introduced in digitization , but is a loose end in present replication efforts .
The final IPCC diagram ( 2.21 ) is shown below .
In this rendering , the Briffa reconstruction is obviously no longer “ a problem and a potential distraction / detraction ” and does not “ dilute the message ” .
Mann has not given any “ fodder ” to the skeptics , who obviously did not have a “ field day ” with the decline .
IPCC Third Assessment Report Figure 2.21 : Comparison of warm - season ( Jones et al. , 1998 ) and annual mean ( Mann et al. , 1998 , 1999 ) multi-proxy - based and warm season tree - ring - based ( Briffa , 2000 ) millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions .
The recent instrumental annual mean Northern Hemisphere temperature record to 1999 is shown for comparison .
Also shown is an extra-tropical sampling of the Mann et al. ( 1999 ) temperature pattern reconstructions more directly comparable in its latitudinal sampling to the Jones et al. series .
The self - consistently estimated two standard error limits ( shaded region ) for the smoothed Mann et al. ( 1999 ) series are shown .
The horizontal zero line denotes the 1961 to 1990 reference period mean temperature .
All series were smoothed with a 40 - year Hamming - weights lowpass filter , with boundary constraints imposed by padding the series with its mean values during the first and last 25 years .
Contrary to claims by various climate scientists , the IPCC Third Assessment Report did not disclose the deletion of the post - 1960 values .
Nor did it discuss the “ divergence problem ” .
Yes , there had been previous discussion of the problem in the peer - reviewed literature ( Briffa et al 1998 ) – a point made over and over by Gavin Schmidt and others .
But not in the IPCC Third Assessment Report .
Nor was the deletion of the declining values reported or disclosed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report .
[ Dec 11 . - IPCC TAR does contain a sly allusion to the problem ; it mentions “ evidence ” that tree ring density variations had “ changed in their response in recent decades ” .
Contrary to claims of realclimate commenters , this does not constitute disclosure of the deletion of the post - 1960 values in the controversial figure or even of the decline itself . ]
The hiding of the decline was made particularly artful because the potentially dangling 1960 endpoint of the Briffa reconstruction was hidden under other lines in the spaghetti graph as shown in the following blow - up :
Figure .
Blow - up of IPCC Third Assessment Report Fig 2 - 21 .
To my knowledge , no one noticed or reported this truncation until my Climate Audit post in 2005 here .
The deletion of the decline was repeated in the 2007 Assessment Report First Order and Second Order Drafts , once again without any disclosure .
No dendrochronologist recorded any objection in the Review Comments to either draft .
As a reviewer of the Second Order Draft , I asked the IPCC in the strongest possible terms to show the decline reported at CA here :
Show the Briffa et al reconstruction through to its end ; do n’t stop in 1960 .
Then comment and deal with the “ divergence problem ” if you need to .
Do n’t cover up the divergence by truncating this graphic .
This was done in IPCC TAR ; this was misleading .
( Reviewer ’s comment ID # : 309-18 ) ]
They refused , stating that this would be “ inappropriate ” , though a short discussion on the divergence was added – a discussion that was itself never presented to external peer reviewers .
Returning to the original issue : climate scientists say that the “ trick ” is now being taken out of context .
The Climategate Letters show clearly that the relevant context is the IPCC Lead Authors ’ meeting in Tanzania in September 1999 at which the decline in the Briffa reconstruction was perceived by IPCC as “ diluting the message ” , as a “ problem ” , as a “ potential distraction / detraction ” .
A stone in their shoe .
Update ( Dec 11 ) :
Some of the follow - up comments on this post do shed light on this sequence and enable a more precise interpretation of the emails .
With the benefit of these comments , there are a couple of points on the chronology that I need to modify , particularly in respect to the role of the October 5 revision of the Briffa reconstruction in respect both to the Arusha meeting and to the hide the decline .
The Arusha meeting objected to the Briffa reconstruction “ diluting the message ” and reducing confidence in the multiproxy reconstructions .
And , of course , it is the overstated confidence that has been the primary objection here .
However , I agree with critics who observe that the proximate objection to the Briffa reconstruction at Arusha was not that the decline per se diluted the message , but the Briffa reconstruction overall diluted the message and interfered with a “ tidy story ” .
The stone in the shoe was that the Briffa reconstruction prevented a “ tidy story ” ; the “ decline ” as a separate problem came a bit later .
After the Arusha meeting , Briffa hurriedly re-did his chronology and the new version was delivered to Mann on Oct 5 , 1999 – it was this version that had the big decline .
In the First Order Draft of Oct 27 , 1999 , IPCC author Mann deleted the post -1960 portion of the Briffa reconstruction plus other things that I do n’t yet quite understand .
Jones ’ trick , as observed in the post , is a little different .
( The post -1960 portion of the Briffa reconstruction was also deleted from the NCDC archive and the Climategate Letters , as previously noted , was the first digital “ archive ” of the post - 1960 Briffa reconstruction used in TAR . )
As of Oct 5 , 1999 , the revised Briffa reconstruction had not been presented in any peer - reviewed literature but nonetheless was adopted by IPCC .
The hasty recalculation of the Briffa reconstruction resulted in a big decline in the late 20th century – this is the decline illustrated in the graphic in my post .
In the First Order Draft of late October 1999 , IPCC did not show the decline .
In the Jones trick email two weeks later , as noted above , Jones hid the decline in a slightly different way .
Another issue raised by readers pertains to quotations .
The post was already long and I tried to keep the quotations relatively concise .
Some readers have criticized the ellipsis .
I ’ve accordingly amended the quotations ( amendments in square brackets . )
Sullivan ( far right ) played at the Download Festival in 2006 with his band
James " The Rev " Sullivan , drummer for US heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold , has died aged 28 .
Sullivan , who co-founded the band in 1999 , apparently died of natural causes at his home in California on Monday .
A statement on the band 's website said Sullivan was " one of the world 's best drummers , but more importantly our best friend and brother " .
Avenged Sevenfold played the Reading and Download festivals in the UK .
Their last album charted in the US top five .
The band picked up a Kerrang !
magazine album of the year award in 2008 for their self - titled LP , and were currently working on their fifth studio album .
The statement added : " Jimmy you are forever in our hearts .
We love you . "
An autopsy performed on Sullivan on Tuesday was inconclusive as to the cause of death .
Orange County sheriff spokesman Jim Amormino said the coroner 's office has ordered toxicology , microscopic and laboratory tests to help determine why the drummer died .
It is expected to be several weeks before the results are known .

The story so far :
On Dec 31 of 2009 , developer Brian Green announced the closing of Near Death Studios .
NDS is the company behind the venerable Meridian 59 , the first graphical MMO .
( Although M59 will continue to run for the foreseeable future . )
The story was picked up by Joystiq , although some of the reported facts were wrong .
This led Green to post a sharp critique of gaming journalism .
It ’s an interesting read , and one of the guys from Joystiq jumps in to the comments at the end of that post .
You do n’t need to read it all to follow what I ’m about to talk about , but it ’s still interesting and worth a look .
Part of the problem with the lack of journalism in gaming journalism is that a lot of gaming sites – mine included – mix commentary and humor with news .
People seem to have this impression that it ’s okay to joke around on your blog , but once you ’re a “ real ” site you need to straighten up and start behaving like a J - school professional .
It ’s not clear where the line should be drawn , and ignores the fact that many sites grow gradually into larger ones , and that they often get big because of their lack of professionalism .
There ’s often this disconnect with blogs :
The writer sees it as a conversation with friends , and the readers think of it as a hobby news site .
The writer is wanting to comment and gossip , but once a site gets so big the readers start expecting journalism .
I think this is a cultural problem , mostly .
We have n’t had something like blogs before , and so in many cases people are still working out what to expect from them .
( This is even more true in the political arena .
Web surfers will think nothing of stumbling onto some random small - fry political wonk and demanding that the author familiarize themselves with Dr. Humphrey J. Poncebottom ’s 700 page tome , “ A Treatise on Regionalism and Steel Tariffs in 16th Century France ” before they have the audacity to complain about the cost of canned soda . )
But this serves as a good launching point for something I ’ve wanted to say for a while now …
I divide the gaming press into three broad groups .
Starting from the bottom :
1. Blogs
The bottom - feeders are blogs like this one .
No real journalism , and no pretense of being such .
It ’s all reviews , commentary , op - ed , and webcomics down here at this end of the food chain .
I ’ve said before that people like me are information parasites .
We ingest gaming news and excrete a waste product known as opinion editorials .
Blogs are , essentially , entertainment .
Once in a while a blogger gets a scoop , scores some insider info , or gets an interview , but for the most part we ’re just making observations and repeating stuff we read elsewhere .
Anway , I sometimes get proud of the community we have here .
Hey , this site scores over a million pageviews a month .
I must be doing pretty well , right ?
But if I ever want a dose of humility , I need only look up at …
2. News Sites
The next tier are the mid-range sites .
There ’s at least an order of magnitude difference in reach between a large blog like mine and one of these news sites .
Places like Kotaku , Rock Paper Shotgun , Destructoid , and the above - mentioned Joystiq , as well as my fellow crimefighters at The Escapist .
( It confuses things somewhat that many of them use a blog format , and so defining them becomes a bit tautological :
They ’re second - tier news sites because they ’re in the second tier ! )
These sites do a mixture of news and entertainment .
This is where I get my gaming news and this is where all of the interesting discussions happen .
These sites tower over blogs , although they are nothing compared to …
3. The Whores
Sites like IGN and Gamespot are the 800 pound gorillas of gaming journalism .
The gap between the News Sites and the Whores is another order of magnitude .
It really is interesting how neatly the sites break into discernible bands like this when you graph them .
IGN and Gamespot are neck - and - neck , and they tower above the news sites who are all basically clustered together .
Alexa only lets you graph five sites at a time , but if I added Rock Paper Shotgun , The Escapist , Destructoid , and Blue ’s News , they would all end up more or less overlapping the lines at the bottom .
I realize it probably sounds like sour grapes to refer to these big sites as “ Whores ” .
But then , I ’m a bottom feeder and I can get away with that sort of obvious unprofessionalism .
But I really do think these sites are worse than useless .
I ’m thinking back to The Gerstmann Thing .
That was a bad thing that happened , and nothing has changed since then .
The way it looks to me : A publisher can use their advertising money to leverage a better review for a game .
That game will sell more copies as a result .
While the system is n’t completely zero - sum , I do n’t think it ’s unreasonable to assume that this will cost other titles some sales .
Bad games are lifted up at the expense of good ones .
Money flows not to the best developers , but to developers working under publishers with the most advertising muscle .
You know .
Money .
If this is at all accurate , then the Whores are actually poisoning the well of videogaming in order to cash a paycheck .
If you had described this state of affairs to me in 2001 , I probably would have predicted that the system would self - correct through traffic .
Gamers would lose confidence in the Whores and would seek their gaming news elsewhere .
But this has n’t happened .
IGN and Gamespot are bigger than ever .
They have remained big even though they feature the very worst sort of annoying full - page advertisements , the signal - to - noise on their front page was usually abominable , and their reviews are suspect .
( Both have fixed their front pages this year though .
They ’re pretty much par for the course now . )
They are doing everything “ wrong ” from a traffic standpoint , but they ’re still winning .
As it stands , the two of them have more traffic than all other gaming news sites combined .
My guess is that these bigger sites are being propped up by the network effect .
I think you can look at anything they have on one of the Big Two and find the same thing elsewhere , only better .
But people go to Gamespot because other people go to Gamespot .
What ’s the solution ?
I actually do n’t think there is one .
I think the damage done by the review score mills is a lot worse than the damage done by lack of fact - checking .
But the point is arguable , and of course there ’s never any reason not to strive to do better .
In 1987 , Hironobu Sakaguchi was planning his retirement from the gaming industry .
Square , the four - year - old company he co-founded , faced imminent bankruptcy after a string of disappointing Famicom releases , while competitor Enix surged ahead with a new game called Dragon Quest .
Sakaguchi knew he could do better than Dragon Quest , and boldly decided to prove it with one final fantasy - adventure RPG people would remember long after Square faded into history .
He named it accordingly .
Five sequels later , Final Fantasy proved anything but a finale .
By the end of 1994 , Square was a developer with some weight behind the name , and Sakaguchi was their executive wunderkind .
They 'd branched out with other successful titles like Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger , earned a place as one of Nintendo's top third - party developers , and slowly moved into the prized American market .
With Final Fantasy VI in the can , Sakaguchi and his team had choices to make on where to take their venerable series next , and their decisions not only changed their company forever , but the entire gaming industry .
Seven was about to become everyone 's lucky number .
Production on Final Fantasy VII started in late 1995 .
After a strict hands - on approach to his series , Sakaguchi stayed in the background for Final Fantasy VI .
For the new sequel , he stepped back into the lead with a mystery plot centered around Midgar , the perpetually dark capital city of Gaia , and the familiar themes of rebels fighting a corrupt system , pursued by " Hot Blooded Detective Joe . "
The player 's ultimate goal : destroy Midgar .
That changed when Yoshinori Kitase , director on Chrono Trigger and Scenario Writer for V and VI came aboard .
Working with co-writer Kazushige Nojima , the mystery angle was dropped and the game 's opposing forces -- AVALANCHE and Shinra , Cloud and Sephiroth -- came into sharper focus .
Basic FF gameplay was already long established , so only a few tweaks were deemed necessary .
Active Time Battles , standard since IV , made a return to add urgency to the turn - based fights , but everyone agreed VI 's underused and underwhelming Desperation Attacks had to go .
Instead of a last gasp from a nearly - dead PC , Kitase instituted Limit Breaks , a massive , adrenaline - fueled counterattack that built up as a character took damage .
Building and using Limit Breaks became a strategic part of combat .
After years of forests , castles , and one trip to the moon , VI had moved away from a purely fantasy setting and went more futuristic .
Following that trend , art director Yusuke Naora fleshed out a monolithic industrial playground in the tiered city of Midgar and built its towering Mako reactors .
Sakaguchi expected series designer Yoshitaka Amano to put his signature touch on their characters and designs , but Amano was busy opening workshops and exhibitions in France and New York , limiting his involvement .
The team turned instead to a minor character and monster designer named Tetsuya Nomura .
This was Nomura 's first shot as a design lead , and he attacked it .
VII was shaping up as a dark game , and his first design for chief protagonist Cloud Strife was a slick , black - haired kid to contrast uber - villian Sephiroth 's silver mane .
Unfortunately , Cloud just did n't look very heroic .
A spiky blonde hairdo lightened him up and kept his prickly nature intact , and the colossal sword by his side was met with instant approval .
Gruff rebel leader Barret Wallace started with two hands and a bow - shaped gun before going cyborg with a Gun - Arm .
Flower girl / savant Aerith rounded out the list of available PCs , designed to inject some needed femininity .
Sakaguchi and Kitase decided that cast was a little too thin , though .
Nomura added another half - dozen characters for players to choose from , and he sweated every detail .
Tifa Lockhart came in as romantic competition for Cloud 's affections ; Nomura obsessed over the length and color of her skirt to counterpoint Aerith 's long pink dress , and nearly settled it by putting her in pants .
The new Cid , a staple since II , became a foul - mouthed chain smoker .
Talking lion Red XIII gained tattoos and a Native American motif before Nomura set his tail on fire for a little extra color .
Ninja thief Yuffie Kisaragi and mechanical puppet Cait Sith added the requisite cute factor , while brooding Vincent Valentine 's background changed from horror researcher to detective to chemist to undead man of mystery .
Nomura did n't stop there .
He gave Final Fantasy 's mascot Chocobos a makeover , took charge of animating Summon attacks and Limit Breaks , and soon had story input as well .
One offhand , late - night suggestion became one of the most shocking story twists in gaming history .
Nothing upsets true fans of music more than when a song they know and cherish is covered by another artist , and it ends up becoming a huge hit , for the wrong person .
It ’s even more upsetting when fans of the new version have absolutely no idea where the song originally came from , and will even argue with you about its origin .
While these are n’t the most insulting examples to music lovers , these are likely some covers that even you may not have realized were n’t original .
They were huge hits , but only after they were covered .
1 ) Tainted Love – Soft Cell
One - hit wonder Soft Cell had this as a pop hit in 1981 , so of course , everybody thought it was about AIDS , or at least catching an STD , because it ’s difficult to look at a New Wave band and assume they ’re not either injecting heroin at breakfast or barebacking it with the gender of their choice .
But the original song was performed by Gloria Jones back in 1964 , when they could n’t even talk about sex without pretending they were singing about cars or something .
Jones actually recorded it twice , once in 1964 and the second time in 1976 with Marc Bolan of T. Rex ( you know him as the guy who sang “ Children of the Revolution ” ) .
But apparently it took synthesizers and androgynous men in painfully tight pants to make the song a hit .
2 ) Killing Me Softly – Lauryn Hill
The more musically - inclined among you are probably thinking we ’re going to mention Roberta Flack , since she was the one who bagged two Grammys for it in 1973 for this , and unlike Lauryn Hill , kept her sanity afterwards .
And you ’d be right , since she was the first one to actually cover the song .
But the song , originally titled “ Killing Me Softly ( With His Blues ) ” , was actually written and performed first by Lori Lieberman , and it ’s about Don McLean .
Yes , Lauryn
Hill ’s overemotional singing is directed towards the dude who wrote “ American Pie ” .
Although considering such O.G.s as Englebert Humperdinck and Perry Como got there first , that ’s probably the least embarrassing tidbit for the Fugees on this one .
3 ) Respect – Aretha Franklin
“ Respect ” is widely considered an anthem of female empowerment , along with “ I ’m Just a Girl ” and “ … And Justice For All ” .
But that ’s pretty much entirely a coincidence , because it was originally written and performed by Otis Redding , who was kind of like Don Draper , only he was black , he could sing , and he got laid more often than Draper can ever dream ( we know that seems impossible , but trust us ) .
The entire song is actually about a guy being disrespected by his woman , and him telling her lying , cheating ass off , which was enough for Otis to not just reach the top five on the Black Singles chart ( yeah , back then , even the music charts were segregated ) , but to actually become Otis ’ biggest hit .
We wonder if all the people celebrating it as a stride for feminism in music were aware of the fact that Franklin was just covering a huge male star ’s hit .
4 ) Mickey – Toni Basil
Speaking of flipped genders , this piece of ‘ 80s cheese was originally written from a male perspective too .
It was based off of “ Kitty ” by the British pop band Racey , and pretty much the only difference between the two songs is the find / replace job they did on the title , even though a woman ’s sexual frustration is a bit … different from a guy’s .
And would it make it better or worse for you to know Toni Basil chose “ Mickey ” as the name as a tribute to Monkee Mickey Dolenz ?
The screaming is all the answer we need .
5 ) I Will Always Love You – Whitney Houston
Yes , one of the highest - selling singles of all time is a cover .
But it ’s not just any cover .
It ’s a cover of Dolly Parton , who you probably know best as the woman who introduced you to the concept of just how awesome boobs are .
Parton actually wrote the song in response to the departure of a friend and business associate as a bittersweet goodbye , just like Costner would star in “ The Bodyguard ” and say a bittersweet goodbye to his dignity .
If you paid attention to country , it was actually a monster hit , going to number one in 1974 , and then Parton went back to the well in 1982 and made it a number one hit again , the first time the same song by the same artist had hit number one twice on the country charts .
Both also crossed over onto the pop charts and did OK for a country tune at the time , although it took a crackhead with amazing lung power to push it to number one .
Hell , even after Houston made it the best - selling single of all time and guaranteed we ’d think of her banging Kevin Costner every time we heard it , Parton STILL went back , re-recorded it as a duet , and that went to # 15 on the country charts .
Dolly Parton : more powerful than you think .
6 ) Whiskey In The Jar – Metallica
No , it ’s not by Metallica .
Or by Thin Lizzy , or by Pulp , or by U2 , or by the Pogues if you ’re into drunken Irish ranting .
Which you probably are , since “ Whiskey In the Jar ” is actually an Irish folk tune that ’s been , as you might have noticed , covered by pretty much everybody who can breathe through their nose and hold a guitar .
Except Avril Lavigne , but we ’re not sure if it ’s because of the former or the latter .
One of the upsides of this song is we can torment all the metalheads we know by insisting Metallica ’s covered U2 , although Lars has yet to follow through with a Metallica cover of “ I Still Have n’t Found What I ’m Looking For . ”
7 ) Nothing Compares 2 U – Sinead O’Connor
Hey , speaking of Irish music , remember Sinead O’Connor when she used to be famous for singing while bald , instead of changing her sexuality every other week and tearing up pictures of the pope because she wanted to be a priest and that pesky vagina and / or lesbianism and / or insanity was getting in the way ?
It turns out , in case you had n’t guessed from the spelling up there , that Sinead ’s biggest hit actually came from the one musician crazier than she is : Prince .
Prince had written it for his spin - off band The Family , which only put out one album .
“ Nothing ” was just an album cut , but somebody , somewhere , realized what it really needed was an Irish bipolar chick , leading to Sinead ’s one hit .
Prince actually got around a lot in the ‘ 80s , musically speaking .
In addition to having sex with the Bangles ( we ’re just assuming here , but this IS Prince we ’re talking about ) , he also wrote “ Manic Monday ” for them .
O’Connor went on to record a reggae album .
No , seriously .
8 ) Blinded By the Light – Mannfred Mann
You probably know this for its incredibly annoying and inescapable organ hook that plays once every two hours on that Top 40 station the guy the next cube over just wo n’t stop listening to .
You ’d be forgiven for thinking that some obscure hippie wrote this song , but no , it was actually written by …Bruce Springsteen .
It was a cut off the Boss ’s first album that was n’t released as a single .
However , that line everyone mishears as “ wrapped up like a douche in the middle of the night ” ( it ’s really “ revved up like a deuce ” , as in deuce coupe ) was originally “ cut loose like a deuce in the middle of the night . ”
Yes , Mannfred Mann rewrote Bruce Springsteen , and we like to think that lyric being misheard for thirty years is the revenge of God .
Embarrassingly , this also happens to be the only song Springsteen ’s ever written that hit # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Oh , and if you think the Boss had n’t suffered enough abuse , Funkstar Deluxe put out a disco version .
Why ?
Because they are Danish , and hate us all .
9 ) New York , New York – Frank Sinatra
It ’s probably not a surprise Frank Sinatra sang a lot of covers , or that this one is a cover , but one thing that might surprise you is that this is actually a song from the late ‘ 70s .
“ New York , New York ” was actually written in 1977 for Martin Scorese ’s movie of the same name , which you have never seen or heard of because it ’s a two - and - a - half hour long musical about Robert DeNiro beating the ever - loving crap out of Liza Minelli .
Once the coke wore off , they were forced to release the movie and it ’s been something nobody involved wants to talk about since .
But the Kander and Ebb soundtrack caught Sinatra ’s eye , so somebody at least escaped with a paycheck .
Sinatra did n’t record this one until 1980 , and yet it ’s been his signature tune ever since .
10 ) I Swear – All - 4- One
It ’s probably not a surprise that a cheesmo boy band did a cover , generally because boy bands are the musical versions of nursing homes , where songs go to die a horrible , sad , unnoted death .
What ’ll probably surprise you is that “ I Swear ” is actually a country song performed by a guy named John Michael Montgomery .
The song had actually topped the country charts , and then All - 4 - One turned around , covered it , and topped the charts in America that actually matter , plus most of Europe , Australia , and probably Russia if their radios were working at all , which is the musical version of cockblocking for poor John there .
Then again , Montgomery ’s still putting out albums and charting , and All - 4 - One only recently figured out how to sell an album in the US again after an extended tour of being big in Japan and nowhere else , so chalk one up for him .
11 ) Achy - Breaky Heart – Billy Ray Cyrus
Yep , despite that skull - eating mullet and that terrifying hellspawn of his following Britney ’s career path , Cyrus ’ songwriting is not to blame for this early ‘ 90s sonic atrocity .
That we can blame on another country act , the Marcy Brothers .
The Marcy Brothers never had much of a hit of their own , the highest they charted being # 34 on the country charts , so we ’re sure they ’re proud that Cyrus made a pop culture joke out of their song .
Then again , they do n’t have to exploit their kids to make the rent , so maybe the Marcy Brothers won out in the end .
Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iranian authorities warned of crackdowns as they tried to head off possible protests Monday , when the country marks Students Day -- the anniversary of the 1953 killing of three university students by security forces .
Authorities prepared for public gatherings that could turn into demonstrations against the June 12 elections , in which hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner .
The heavily disputed results led to protests nationwide and the jailing of hundreds of demonstrators .
Charges of torture , rape and other abuses have since emerged from those jailed .
The Iranian government initially denied such accusations .
But state media reported in August that authorities had fired and arrested the chief of an Iranian jail that was closed amid allegations of mistreatment of detainees .
Ongoing prosecutions of protesters also have resulted in sentences that have included death .
The Iranian government restricts the activity of journalists in Iran , making it difficult for news organizations to independently obtain or confirm information .
Members of the foreign media were forbidden from Monday through Wednesday to even go out and watch any possible protests stemming from Students Day , the Ministry of Culture said .
The Iranian security forces command congratulated the nation on Students Day , which it said is " observed as the symbol of Iran 's struggle against tyranny and oppression , " according to the semi-official ILNA news agency .
" We expect the respected faculty and students , particularly given the current sensitive situation , to prevent anyone from possibly taking advantage of these ceremonies and to extend any and all needed cooperation to the hardworking members of the security forces , " the command said , according to ILNA .
Former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , one of the nation 's most powerful clerics and a reformist , slammed his country 's leadership , saying " there is no tolerance for [ differing ] views and constructive criticism , " and that some of the reactions to criticizing the country " encourage chaos , " according to ILNA .
Speaking with student activists in the holy city of Mashhad , Rafsanjani quoted a verse from the Quran : " A secure society is a society that is pious and not subject to tyranny . "
He then added that those have been the objectives of the country 's 1979 Islamic revolution , and that only when a society is pious and free of tyranny will it achieve progress , expand and maintain its safety , according to ILNA .
The three memorialized students were killed by the shah 's security forces in 1953 , which Zohreh Alhean , a member of the Islamic Parliament , said " signifies the struggle against worldwide oppressions , perpetrated by the American usurpers and the blood of the students , spilled on this day . "
Tehran also blamed Western powers for instigating the protests against the June 12 elections , which involved tens of thousands of Iranians .
It has become an annual office ritual on a par with the Christmas party , but giving a colleague the wrong " secret santa " present could lead to an unwelcome legal hangover , lawyers have warned .
Sending risqué or tongue - in - cheek gifts could provide grounds for claims for harassment or sexual or religious discrimination , according to employment lawyers .
Jokes such as giving a colleague lacy underwear or a greying co-worker a bottle of hair dye as a joke are among gift ideas fraught with potential legal danger .
Even giving a female co-worker a cookbook or a kitchen gadget could be deemed sexist , solicitors have claimed .
Seemingly innocuous offerings , such as a festive bottle of wine could also cause offence to those who do not drink for religious reasons .
Giving anonymous gifts to colleagues whose names are picked at random has become a popular custom in Irish offices .
Last year a policeman in the UK , was forced to resign after giving a Muslim officer a packet of bacon and a bottle of wine as a secret Father Christmas present .
His colleague did not complain but the incident was reported to senior officers , leading to the PC ’s resignation .
Neeta Laing , head of employment law at law firm Lewis Hymanson Small in the UK said : “ Workers should think carefully before buying their colleague a present that could be viewed as offensive .
“ Use your common sense , for example , do n’t give religious colleagues alcohol or offensive magazines or female workers kitchen ware . ”
She added : “ If an employee does receive , for example , a pair of lacy knickers and finds the gift offensive and wishes to pursue a harassment case , this must be taken seriously . ”

Shortly after the funeral of California student Scott Hawkins , who was beaten to death by his college roommate on October 23 , his parents received a second shock .
A bill for $ 29,186.50 arrived from the hospital where Hawkins had been taken after being found unconscious in his dorm room , along with a form letter telling “ the patient ” that he was considered indigent and should seek further treatment through county health services .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gerald and Elizabeth Hawkins had been informed by Sacramento State College that their son was already dead when his body was discovered and were not aware that he had received level 5 trauma care for five minutes in the hospital emergency room .
“ It was just devastating and insulting , ” Gerald Hawkins stated .
It ’s just hard to grasp for words .
My wife and I were near collapse . ”
“ It was just awful , ” Elizabeth Hawkins told CBS13 News .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any civilized country , anywhere in the world that would allow the parents of a murdered boy to receive a bill like this .
…
When you have barely enough energy to finish your sentences , having to sit down and deal with something like this out of the blue is extremely difficult . ”
UC Davis Medical Center issued a statement apologizing for the “ clerical error ” and explaining that “ the patient ’s death in the emergency department should have been flagged as a death in the outpatient record . ”
That would have generated a letter of sympathy and a tactful inquiry about the family ’s insurance .
Hawkins was a transfer student who had only been rooming for a short time with his alleged attacker , Quran Jones , and it was not clear what prompted the attack .
Death was attributed by a representative of the college to “ blunt force trauma , ” and one police spokesperson said Hawkins had been beaten with a baseball bat , although this has not been confirmed .

When police responded to reports of the disturbance , they found Hawkins unconscious and Jones wielding an eight - inch knife .
Jones was shot by police as he advanced with the knife and will be charged with murder when he recovers .
Imagine , you wake up in the morning , try to find your slipper .
Then suddenly , you find you step on something fluffy ; and it is mouse head … .
I guess , this one must be as slippery as fish .
lolI need green in my life .
So I have meadow , trees and animal on my shoes ?
Take a walk in the grass wherever you are in these creative flip flops that have real grass growing inside .
( That is weird to me !!!)
The moving garden – we have cabbage , pea and some berry .
lolI guess , the shoes top will never get wet in raining day ?
I love “ Pika ” and I want to play game all the time ….
Okat designed these unique barefoot sneakers by using his own feet and toes as inspiration .
More scary feet shoes !
I guess no one dare to step on you when you wear this kind of shoes .
I just have no word for this one .
Except the balancing issue I am concerned , this one look like the most wearable shoes in this list .
Here 's the latest fashion amongst pet-lovers .
You 've probably already heard about clothing of dogs or even cats but here you 'll find something about chicken clothing .
Yes , if dogs and cats can have their own suit then chickens deserve their own chickensuit , too !
The idea for suiting a chicken came in a dream .
A dream of a chicken that was covered with hair instead of feathers .
Well , you ca n’t take a chicken ’s feathers off and then glue hair on it – can you ?
This is how the chickenssuit came about .
The inventors of the clothing for chickens ( Austrian / Japanese design team ) truly believe that there is a real need for this world to suit its chickens .
Premiere at the Expo in Aichi ( Japan ) :
Freya von Moltke 's group supported the 1944 attempt to kill Hitler A prominent member of Germany 's anti-Nazi resistance during World War II has died , aged 98 , at her home in the US .
Freya von Moltke , who had lived in Vermont since 1960 , died last Friday after a viral infection , her son said .
She had belonged to a group of aristocrats , clerics and diplomats who backed a failed attempt to kill Hitler with a bomb in 1944 .
The group , known as the Kreisau Circle , was led by her husband , Helmuth , who was later executed for his activities .
She told an interviewer in 2002 : " To object and then to stand for what you believe in is one of the most important human activities to this day . "
Resistance meetings Von Moltke was born Freya Deichmann in Cologne in 1911 and met her husband when she was 18 .
Both she and Helmuth received law degrees and were married in 1931 .
They were opponents of Hitler from the start of the Nazi regime and assisted Jews and other victims of Nazism through Helmut 's international law practice in Berlin .
In 1942 and 1943 , Von Moltke hosted meetings at the family estate , Kreisau in Silesia , at which the resistance group discussed plans for the democratic Germany they hoped would follow the collapse of Nazism .
The Kreisau Circle supported the failed attempt on Hitler 's life in July 1944 .
Treason Von Moltke said later that she had fully supported her husband : " I never advised him to stop , but rather encouraged him , because I was convinced that that was the right way for him to fulfil his life . "
Helmuth von Moltke was executed for treason in January 1945 .
After the war , Von Moltke and her two sons moved to South Africa where she worked as a social worker .
She returned to Germany in 1956 where she began her work in publicising the Kreisau Circle .
She settled in Vermont in 1960 , where she published several books about resistance to the Nazis during the war .
The former family estate in Silesia , located in current - day Poland , is now used as a centre for reconciliation between Germany and Poland and as a meeting place to promote European integration .

Many would be entrepreneurs hesitate to start their own business because they think it is too risky from a monetary perspective .
In fact , most people do n’t think starting a business is even worth trying unless they can come up with a grand slam profitable idea .
Of course profitability is an extremely important factor with any business , but what if I were to tell you that you could save a decent amount of money every year with your business while only making a small profit or none at all ?
That ’s right !
Most people do n’t consider the tax savings involved in running a business .
Most people do n’t realize that having a day job is one of the worst ways to save on taxes because Uncle Sam takes a huge chunk out of your paycheck BEFORE you pay for anything .
On the other hand with a business , you can effectively pay for everything using pre-tax dollars which can save you up to 35 % .
So while on paper your business may not be making any money , in reality you could be saving big bucks by purchasing goods with money that is not taxed at all .
But talk is cheap !
I thought that it would be interesting to throw some numbers into the mix by calculating how much the average American could save by starting their own business .

The Average American
First off , the average American makes roughly $ 63,091 before taxes ( Click here to get updated incomes in the US ) .
If we assume that they fall under the 25 % tax bracket , the average American is also getting reamed up the wazoo by Uncle Sam to the tune of about $ 11960 before they can even use this money leaving themselves with only $ 51131 .
Even worse , the average American spends roughly $ 49638 a year which does n’t leave much savings .
It ’s no wonder that the average American household is just barely scraping by !
In order to calculate the tax savings associated with running a business , we must break down each and every expense of the average American to see what can possibly be written off with a business and assume a certain percentage of savings .
Below is my analysis .
Transportation – Gasoline And Oil Costs
The average American spends roughly $ 2384 on gasoline and oil related products .
If we assume that gas is $ 3 a gallon and that the average car gets 20 miles per gallon , the average American drives roughly 15893 miles per year .
We ’ll round this number to 16000 for simplicity .
Currently with my business , I ’m able to expense roughly 22 % of the miles I drive on my car for business purposes .
How do I do this ?
Whenever I need to drive some place or run some errands , I make sure that I try to take care of something business related along the way .
For example , if I need to go to the grocery store , I also make a trip to the office store or other related establishment where I need to pick up something for the business .
It takes a bit of planning and excellent documentation but you ’d be surprised by how easily you can find ways to use your car for business .
For the average American , 22 % of 16000 miles is roughly 3520 miles .
For 2009 , the IRS mileage tax deduction is 55 cents .
3520 * $.55 equals a tax writeoff of $ 1936 .
Housing And Shelter
The average American spends $ 10,023 on housing or shelter every year .
Currently , my wife and I expense 20 % of our rent for business related purposes .
In actuality , we use more than 20 % of dedicated business space in our home but we keep things at 20 % to prevent the likelihood of an audit .
In any case , 20 % of $ 10023 equals $ 2004.60 of tax writeoffs for the average American .
Food – Eating Out
The average American spends roughly $ 2668 a year eating out .
For my wife and I , we love discussing business over dinner .
In fact , we make many of our key business decisions at restaurants because it ’s a more relaxed environment and easier for us to concentrate .
As a result , we are able to expense some of our meals every month .
For this analysis , let ’s assume that the average American can expense 10 % of their meals .
Because meals and entertainment can only be deducted at 50 % , this effectively equals a 5 % writeoff .
$ 2668 * .05 equals $ 133.40 .
Travel
The average American spends roughly $ 1600 on summer vacations every year .
While travel expenses purely for pleasure can not be expensed , any vacation can be made to be business related with the proper planning .
So what my wife and I usually do every year is plan our vacations around our business travel .
For example , a few years ago my wife and I had to meet with linen and textile vendors in Japan so we made a vacation out of it .
We purposely planned our meetings every other day and used our free days to relax and pamper ourselves .
If you do things right , you can pretty much expense almost the entire vacation !
Because I ’m not sure how the $ 1600 a year is broken down in terms of airfare vs food / entertainment costs , I ’m going to assume that 75 % of this cost is deductible for the average American .
Total tax deduction $ 1200 .
Utilities
Since we use 20 % of our house for business , it ’s only fair that we deduct the same percentage for utilities .
In addition to water , gas and electricity , we also have a dedicated phone line for the business which can all be expensed .
The average American spends $ 3477 on utilities every year .
Once again , the exact breakdown of this number is unclear so we need to make some assumptions .
For example , a business probably would n’t be able to expense the cable tv bill .
However , most other items are fair game .
To be conservative , I ’m going to assume that at least 10 % of this amount is deductible which puts the deduction at $ 347.70 .
Computer Equipment And Household Furnishings
Unfortunately , this category is extremely vague .
Computer equipment and household furnishings covers everything from furniture all the way to decorative items and computers but excludes major appliances .
Because this category is so broad , I ’m going to be conservative here and assume only 15 % of this amount is deductible .
Thanks to section 179 , computer equipment and other furnishings can be expensed 100 % up to a six figure dollar amount every year .
Chances are , if you have a business and purchase a computer , it can be written off in its entirety in the same tax year .
The average American spends $ 1797 in this category .
15 % of $ 1797 is $ 269.55 .
Adding It All Up
Obviously , I have not included every possible business expense in my analysis , only the common items .
If you really want to get nit picky , in reality you could probably expense far more than what I ’ve mentioned in this article .
In any case , if we total all of the categories mentioned above , this comes out to $ 1936 + $ 2004.60 + $ 133.40 + $ 1200 + $ 347.70 + $ 269.55 = $ 5891.25 .
Based on an income of $ 63091 , this represents almost a 10 % writeoff on the average American ’s taxes !
Putting all of the numbers together at a 25 % tax bracket , this is a savings of $ 1472.81 every year .
Keep in mind that most of the deductions I calculated above were on the conservative side .
In practice , my wife and I actually deduct a good amount more especially under the computer and equipment category .
If you are worried about getting audited , the best thing to do is to arm yourself with an accountant and document every expense carefully .
Your accountant should be able to tell you with high confidence whether or not an expense is actually deductible .
This is free money folks , but only available if you have a business .
Stop giving your money away to the government now !

GOP blame at TSA ?
As Republicans seek to put the blame for the widespread perception of ineptness at the Transportation Security Administration on the Obama administration , Democrats are arguing that Republican legislators bear part of the blame and that they 're politically vulnerable on the subject .
Perhaps the largest impediment to change at the agency : South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint has a hold on the appointment of a TSA chief , over his concern that the new administration could allow security screeners to unionize .
Republicans have cast votes against the key TSA funding measure that the 2010 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security contained , which included funding for the TSA , including for explosives detection systems and other aviation security measures .
In the June 24 vote in the House , leading Republicans including John Boehner , Pete Hoekstra , Mike Pence and Paul Ryan voted against the bill , amid a procedural dispute over the appropriations process , a Democrat points out .
A full 108 Republicans voted against the conference version , including Boehner , Hoekstra , Pence , Michelle Bachmann , Marsha Blackburn , Darrell Issa and Joe Wilson .
The conference bill included more than $ 4 billion for " screening operations , " including $ 1.1 billion in funding for explosives detection systems , with $ 778 million for buying and installing the systems .
UPDATE : DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton responds :
Democrats have only themselves to blame for not having a confirmed TSA administrator .
President Obama waited 243 days in office before making a nomination and Harry Reid has been too busy trading earmarks for votes on health care to schedule debate on the nominee .
This is an important debate because many Americans do n't want someone running the TSA who stands ready to give union bosses the power to veto or delay future security measures at our airports .

When I found out that a graphic novel about the life of Bertrand Russell was in the works , I imagined it would be interesting , but I never thought it would be as spellbinding as it turned out to be .
Logicomix , created by a team of Greek artists and writers is full color graphic novel about Bertrand Russell and his ardent quest for the logical foundation of mathematics .
The creators of the graphic novel put themselves into the story , between chapters of Russell 's life , to discuss their thoughts on key moments .
It 's a clever and useful way to add additional context to the story .
The book is 352 pages long — 10 pages less than what it took Russell and Whitehead to prove that 1+1 = 2 in their book Principia Mathematica , but I was tearing through it to find out what happened .
Afterwards , I went back to admire the artwork , which is masterfully composed and filled with terrific architecture and other detials .
All - in - all , this was a surprisingly terrific book .

Bacon and eggs could help pregnant women boost their baby 's intelligence
The traditional English breakfast is not normally associated with good health .
But scientists have found that eating a plate of bacon and eggs could help pregnant women boost the intelligence of their unborn child .
Women are usually given a list of foods to avoid during pregnancy and it is well documented that a pregnant woman 's diet can affect her unborn baby .
Scientists have found that eating a plate of bacon and eggs could help pregnant women boost the intelligence of their unborn child
But the new study suggests that a chemical in pork products and eggs can help the baby 's growing brain to develop .
Scientists at the University of North Carolina have discovered that the micronutrient , called choline , is vital in helping babies in the womb develop parts of their brains linked to memory and recall .
In a study of the effects of choline on the brains of baby mice , those fed small doses of choline while in the womb had genetic differences to those given large amounts .
Dr Gerald Weissmann , editor - in - chief of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology journal , which published the research told The Telegraph : ' We may never be able to call bacon a health food with a straight face , but [ similar studies ] are already making us rethink what we consider healthy and unhealthy . '
Other foods that contain a high level of the nutrient include liver , milk , chicken and nuts .
Previous studies have suggested that large doses of choline could help protect against heart problems .
Spoiler Halo 1's 2nd mission where you had to find the marines that crash landed throughout the map , but in halo reach you are finding spartans .
Spoiler dropped off , and the action immediately begins .
You are with squadmates .
Throughout this mission you have to cover your spartan friend ( whos a girl ) and give her coverage so that she can hack into the computer .
There are 3 big guns on the map that she has to hack into .
Hacking into them gains control of the gun , and I guess it gives them control of the air ( you see banshees and hornets flying throughout the entire level )
Spoiler Truth and Reconciliation ( the 3rd stage on Halo 1 ) .
You and another spartan have snipers .
You have to get into the enemy base from the cliffs ( you start out on the cliffs ) .
While you go in the base , your spartan friend covers you from the cliffs above .
At the end of this level , you save a bunch of scientists or marines ( not really sure who they are actually ) .
They are humans who refused to leave their site even though they ordered everyone to get out .
At the end of the level you save them and get picked up by a pelican .
Spoiler you encounter a bunch of covenant fighting this big ass monster ( it had tusks , it seemed like some sort of prehistoric animal )
When you see the covenant fighting the monster , you are told not to engage combat , but to just go by unnoticed .
You stand and watch the covenant fighting the monster , only to see the covenant get owned .
Spoiler find other spartans on the map ( similar to Halo 1's second stage where you have to find the crash landed marines ) .
Spoiler take control of several huge missile guns throughout the map , and provide coverage to a spartan that would hack into the guns and control them .
Spoiler Halo 1's 3rd stage , Truth and Reconciliation .
You start with a sniper and cloaking perk , you sneak into an enemy base at night , and you shoot from cliffs .
This first mission was just like
It 's a pretty big map , and the worthog was very useful for getting places .
The worthog can carry as many as 5 people ( the driver , the front passenger , the gunner , and two seats below the gunner that face left and right , not forward ) The second mission was pretty action packed .
You start out getting
The third stage is very similar to Those were the first 3 stages .
As for gameplay , everyone on those forums are talking about the perks .
You can only carry one at a time .
I found 3 different devices in the first 3 missions - Halogram , cloak , and sprint .
So it 's not really a perk , like you would think from call of duty .
They are just devices you pick up and The new BR is the 12 round , 1 shot with the scope .
I think it 's more powerfull than the burst fire BR from halo 3 .
The sniper rifle has a longer delay between shots ( I was upset with this ) .
The gameplay seem VERY similar to the other halos .
It still has that " slow " feeling .
The enemies also fight the exact same way , even the hunters .
The new needler carbine gun is cool .
It takes three shots to make the needles explode on someone .
However , if that person has a shield , you have to take out the shield before the needles can stick .
So this gun can be effective if you shoot grunts and jackals , that way they explode and do more damage .
You can't just shoot an elite three times , you have to bring his shield down first , then when you shoot him 3 times when he doesnt have a shield , the needles explode .
When you cloak , your radar is jammed , so you see red dots everywhere .
Also , you can't hear anything going on .
It 's like trying to hear someone say something when you are underwater .
There is a new worthog that shoots volley missles .
It seemed very overpowered , but fun .
It would shoot about 4 - 6 shots and they explode upon contact .
Then there is about a 5 second wait .
Then you can shoot again ( basically a 5 second cooldown for every time you can fire ) .
I found something really extraordinary .
In the middle of mission 3 , You must understand that this game is still LOOONG from being done .
People on the forums are making too early judgments , like saying the graphics were horrible .
Well I played the game and the graphics were pretty bad .
That 's because they havn't finished it yet ...
In fact , they did n't even have human voice overs when someone would talk in the game .
Overall gameplay was about the same as the other Halos .
Enemies battles are similar too .
I do n't know if you can dual wield .
They made me play through the first 3 missions .
The first mission was on a pretty big map , and I had toSecond stage was pretty action packed , main goal was to Third stage was very similar to This game WILL be on the circuit I KNOW IT FOR A FACT , I am an mlg 50 and was a level 40 in h2 hardcore and know what competitive IS !
Floyd Mayweather Jr : I have Nothing to Gain by Fighting Manny Pacquiao
After seeing Manny Pacquiao dismantle Miguel Cotto on Saturday night , I said that a Pacquiao / Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight has to happen for the sake of boxing ’s integrity .
There ’s only one fight left that makes sense for each fighter .
One fight , and one fight only , and it ’s between them .
Unfortunately Pacquiao expressed no immediate interest in fighting Floyd , and Floyd has gone on record saying he does n’t want to do business with Bob Arum ( Manny ’s promoter ) .
Making matters worse is that Floyd told Sky News he feels like he has nothing to gain by fighting Pacquiao :
Floyd says that everyone wants to see him lose while Manny ’s already lost three times therefore there ’s no upside for him .
While there ’s no erasing Pacquiao ’s three losses and Floyd ’s undefeated record , there is a question as to who is the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world and who the top welterweight is .
Right now Pacman is on top of his game and considered to be every bit as good as Floyd .
Because of that reason , Mayweather stands plenty to gain by fighting ( and beating ) Manny .
The term “ undisputed ” champion is often used in boxing .
Right now there ’s a dispute that can only be settled in the ring .
Floyd should recognize that and make this fight happen to boost his legacy .
After that , beating Sugar Shane Mosley would just be icing on the cake of an unblemished career .

* Al Qaeda involvement under investigation
* Suspect due in court in Detroit on Monday
* Air travel security measures under review
* U.S. officials say air travel safe
By Vicki Allen
WASHINGTON , Dec 27 ( Reuters ) -
There is no initial evidence that the Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up a U.S. passenger jet was involved in a larger plot , a senior U.S. official said on Sunday .
But al Qaeda involvement is a “ subject of investigation ” in Friday ’s incident , U.S. homeland security chief Janet Napolitano said after U.S. authorities on Saturday charged Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , with attempting to blow up the plane by setting alight an explosive device attached to his body .
The suspect , who was being treated for burns at a Michigan hospital , was overpowered by passengers and crew on the Northwest Airlines plane from Amsterdam on Christmas Day with almost 300 people on board .
“ Well , right now we have no indication that it is part of anything larger .
But obviously the investigation continues .
And we have instituted more screening and what we call mitigation measures at airports , ” U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” program .
Asked whether al Qaeda was involved in the incident , Napolitano told ABC ’s “ This Week ” program , “ That is now the subject of investigation , and it would be inappropriate for me to say and inappropriate to speculate .
So we will let the FBI and the criminal justice system now do their work . ”
A senior U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said on Saturday authorities were looking at the possibility that Abdulmutallab had ties to al Qaeda in Yemen .
Abdulmutallab is due to make his first court appearance at 2 p.m. EST ( 1900 GMT ) on Monday in federal court in Detroit on a motion from prosectors to take a sample of his DNA .
Napolitano said U.S. authorities were reviewing current rules on who goes on official watch lists used to identify people who might pose security threats and was reviewing screening policies and technologies .
The U.S. government created a record of Abdulmutallab last month in the intelligence community ’s central repository of information on known and suspected international terrorists , a U.S. official said on Saturday .
But there was not enough negative data to put him on a “ no - fly ” list , the official said .
The government needs “ information that ’s specific and credible if you ’re actually going to bar someone ” from air travel , Napolitano said on CNN .
‘ SYSTEM WORKED ’
She also sought to reassure travelers , telling CNN , “ The traveling public is very , very safe in this air environment , ” adding that “ the system worked ” to thwart a potential disaster .
" Everybody played an important role here .
The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action , " she said of the incident that occurred on Northwest Airlines flight 253 , a Delta - owned Airbus 330 .
Delta Air Lines DAL.N has taken over Northwest .
“ The whole process of making sure that we respond properly , correctly and effectively went very smoothly , ” she said .
Airports and airlines in the United States and around the world have tightened security after the foiled attack .
Security officials were investigating how Abdulmutallab had been able to get explosive materials onto the plane despite higher security worldwide since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , hijacked airline attacks in the United States .
Al Qaeda was held responsible for those attacks .
An initial FBI analysis found the device used by Abdulmutallab contained PETN , also known as pentaerythritol , one of the explosives carried by “ shoe bomber ” Richard Reid in his failed attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger jet just before Christmas in 2001 , months after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The device consisted of a six - inch ( 15 - cm ) packet of powder and a syringe containing a liquid , which were sewn into the suspect ’s underwear , according to media reports .
Abdulmutallab , the son of a respected Nigerian banker , started his journey in Nigeria ’s commercial hub of Lagos , where he boarded a KLM flight to Amsterdam before going through another security checkpoint while in transit at Schiphol airport , Dutch counter - terrorism agency NCTb has said .
The head of Nigeria ’s Civil Aviation Authority , Harold Demuren , said Abdulmutallab had been through the usual screening procedures at Lagos airport before boarding the KLM flight .
“ The passenger did not check in any baggage but was spotted with a shoulder bag .
He went through a normal screening and check - in process , ” Demuren said in a statement published in Nigerian newspapers on Sunday , citing CCTV footage .
He said Abdulmutallab was in possession of a multiple - entry U.S. visa issued in London on June 16 , 2008 , and due to expire in June 2010 , which was scanned without the Advance Passenger Information System returning any objection .
Demuren said Nigeria had recently passed security audits by both the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the America Transportation Security Audit .
Abdulmutallab was refused a visa to enter Britain in May 2009 when he tried to apply for a course at a bogus college , Britain ’s Sunday Times newspaper said .
Demuren said Abdulmutallab had purchased his $ 2,831 Lagos - Amsterdam Detroit return ticket at the KLM office in Accra , Ghana , on Dec. 16 with a Jan. 8 , 2010 , return date .

Miami , Florida ( CNN ) -- Freedom's Flight is a beautiful thoroughbred with an impressive pedigree .
His bloodlines can be traced to two of the greatest race horses of all time , Seattle Slew and Secretariat .
But , unlike his kinship , Freedom 's Flight 's racing career ended before it had even started .
It was almost two years ago when the thoroughbred 's leg snapped right out of the gate at Miami's Gulfstream race track .
The animal 's days as a cherished racehorse came to an abrupt end .
" He came from the famous Clairborne farm and ended up on one of the worst farms in America , " says new owner Richard " Kudo " Couto .
That " worst " farm in America turned out to be an illegal slaughter farm in Miami - Dade County , Florida .
Couto , working for the South Florida Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , participated in a raid on the farm and rescued Freedom 's Flight .
The timing of that rescue may have saved Freedom 's Flight 's life .
The horse was limping around on his broken leg , he had sores on his body , and you could see his bones protruding from his dirty coat .
Some 18 months since his rescue , Freedom 's Flight looks more like the stunning race horse that was worth thousands of dollars than the injured horse that was sold for $ 50 to an illegal slaughter farm .
" Prior to his rescue , I did n't know that illegal slaughter farms existed in the country -- let alone under my nose in my own county , " says Couto .
This new knowledge has motivated Couto .
" It really made me buckle down and basically dedicate my life to shut this industry down .
It 's become personal for me , " he says .
Couto suspects that there are more than 100 illegal slaughterhouses in the area .
There is only one slaughterhouse that operates legally , Cabrera's , and there the United States Department of Agriculture inspectors are housed on its property .
Many of these illegal places are concentrated in an unincorporated area of Miami - Dade County .
The roads are dirt , the vegetation thick and uninviting .
This is the western fringe of Miami along the rim of the Everglades , an area considered a sort of no - man 's land .
There are signs in English and in Spanish advertising animals for sale .
Tarps are put up to hide what is behind the chain link fences , but most of these businesses are open to the public .
" You do n't have to be a rocket scientist after walking the properties and seeing the dead carcasses , the guts in the trash bins , the slaughter tables , the knives -- all of the tools of running this type of operation is right in front of you , " says Couto .
CNN visited several of these establishments .
At one location where a pig was being carved on one table and a chicken on the other , we asked to film on the property .
" This slaughterhouse is n't as clean as you can see , try Cabrera 's , " said the unidentified man behind the slaughter table .
Like several places we visited there was blood on the floor , dirty butcher knives and an overwhelming stench .
Couto says it is n't the slaughtering of animals that has put him on this mission .
It 's the way the animals are treated .
" These animals are living in extreme filth .
They 're beaten .
The way they 're slaughtered is inhumane , " says Couto .
Couto has been on a one - man crusade to shut down illegal slaughterhouses that are operating without licenses and without oversight by the health or agriculture departments .
He was first exposed to what he calls the " dark underbelly " of the area when , with the Florida SPCA , he was investigating the slaughter of horses for their meat .
Motivated by Freedom's Flight , Couto left the South Florida SPCA to form his own organization called ARM -- Animal Recovery Mission .
For the past year he has used a video camera to collect evidence .
Couto has simply walked right into dozens of slaughterhouses and has filmed bloody slaughter tables .
" I go in acting like a customer , " he says , " I ask them , ' How much for the pig ? '
And they 'll say 120 dollars .
' How much for the kill ? ' ' 20 bucks .
We 'll slaughter it for you for 20 bucks . '
It 's that easy . "
One local agency that spends a lot of time in the area because sections of it are considered protected wetland is the Miami - Dade Department of Environmental Resources Management .
Carlos Espinosa is in charge of enforcing the county 's environmental regulations .
" When we come across other issues relating to other departments , we pass that information on to other departments , " says Espinosa .
Couto took his story and his videos to every local agency he could think of with oversight responsibility .
He tried to set up a task force with agencies in charge of violations such as animal cruelty , illegal structures , illegal businesses , permit problems and zoning issues .
A sign - in sheet from one of these meetings shows many of the agencies attended the meeting , but Couto says nothing came of it .
CNN contacted Miami -Dade Animal Services Department , an agency that had a representative at that meeting .
Spokesperson Xiomara Mordcovich said the agency does not deal with issues involving farm animals and directed us to the Miami - Dade Police Department .
The Police Department declined an interview .
" We are not actively investigating any incidents involving illegal slaughterhouses , " the department said in an e-mail .
Then it referred us back to Animal Services and also to the code compliance department .
Charles Danger , director of the Miami - Dade Building and Neighborhood Compliance Department , admits that it was because of Couto 's persistence that it is now putting together a multi-agency task force he called " Operation Miss Piggy and Mr. Ed . "
According to Danger , part of the reason nothing has been done to clean up this area is because of fear for the safety of inspectors .
" Every time we go in there , we have to go in there with the police -- and even the police do n't want to go in there , " says Danger .
Danger says the Miami - Dade Police Department is now on the new task force , which also includes agencies such as the state health department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
" It comes from a lot of years of illegal operation .
We have to do it together because it's not going to be easy , " says Danger .
One organization that will keep tabs on the progress is the Animal Recovery Mission .
Couto says he will not go away quietly .
He calls his mission " redemption and revenge for Freedom 's Flight and what he went through . "

( WATCH BEFORE IT GETS TAKEN DOWN .. AGAIN !)
It is both fascinating and worrying to discover that if you are an innocent person who wants your police DNA record removed from the national basis , you have much more chance if you live in Yorkshire than London , and none at all if you live in Nottinghamshire .
In this key area for civil liberties , you are at the mercy of your local chief constable .
Until the policy was declared illegal by the European court of human rights , the government planned to keep the DNA of the innocent forever , making us all suspects for life .
Ministers , having dragged their feet for months , have now offered a system where they will only keep the DNA for six years .
This is still unacceptable , because it is unnecessary in crime - fighting terms .
A system similar to the one in Scotland , in which the DNA of those arrested but not charged for the most serious crimes can only be kept for three years would work well and gain public acceptance .
We need to adopt something much more like the Scottish model in the rest of the UK .
It is that issue of public acceptance that worries me most .
Once the DPP had declared I had no case to answer , following my arrest for leaking embarrassing stories about Home Office failures , I demanded that my DNA record be destroyed .
After a certain amount of huffing and puffing , the Metropolitan police announced that I was an " exceptional case " and agreed .
I was immediately flooded by letters and emails from some of the other million people in the same position as me , wanting to know how they could be declared exceptional as well .
There is no good answer , because as far I can see the only exceptional thing about my case was the publicity it generated : there are hundreds of thousands of equally innocent people who do n't want to be on a database but who have been told to lump it .
These are the people who the authorities should be worried about , because they are angry and alienated .
Among those who contacted me were magistrates , former army officers , compliance officers for IT firms , solicitors and many other businesspeople .
In other words the respectable backbone of any healthy society .
The sort of people who never have any trouble with the police , and are instinctively willing to help police officers when needed .
The ones who wrote to me are now extremely angry , and many of them make the point that they now regard the police with suspicion and fear .
If this carries on , the police will find that their job is much more difficult than it ever has been , because they cannot rely on the co-operation of the respectable majority .
That would be a disaster for policing in this country .
So when ministers or police chiefs seize on the odd case , always with emotional pulling power , which they claim would not have been solved without a big DNA database , they should consider the long - term implications of an intrusive DNA policy .
An alienated population seldom provides the tip - offs the police need to catch criminals , or the evidence in court needed to convict .
This has been a problem at times within some minority communities who regard the police as hostile .
How much more difficult life would be for the police if this attitude became widespread .
A smaller , targeted DNA database would not only be a more effective tool in crime - fighting it would act as a sign that the creeping expansion of the surveillance state was being reversed .
In this instance civil liberties and the real interests of the police point in the same direction .
The only people who still need convincing are current Home Office ministers , and the senior ranks of the police .
Images of Iraq ’s Al Abid launch vehicle , from a UN report .

Saddam ’s space program
The invasion and occupation of Iraq is one of the great foreign policy mistakes the United States has made in the recent past .
But whereas historians will be asking questions about the war for decades to come , it also offers the opportunity to answer some questions as well .
Among the big questions are :
What happened to Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction and why ?
Why was the CIA so bad at intelligence about the weapons ?
But there are also some questions with less immediate impact , but that still retain historical significance .
What happened to naval aviator Scott Speicher in the opening hours of the first Gulf War ?
( A question now apparently answered . )
Why did most of the Iraqi air force fly to Iran during that war ?
Did the pilots do it of their own volition ?
And did they think it was better to give their old enemy their airplanes rather than lose them to their new enemy ’s air strikes ?
Why did an Iraqi airplane attack the USS Stark in 1987 ?
What exactly did supergun genius Gerald Bull do for Iraq during the 1980s ?
And what was the Iraqi space program ?
In the late 1980s Iraq had a space program .
Iraq even got so far as to develop a 50 - kilogram test satellite .
On December 5 , 1989 , Iraq launched a 25 - meter long rocket from a launch pad 230 kilometers southwest of Baghdad .
Iraq described this as a “ satellite launch system , ” and there were initial erroneous reports that the rocket had placed several objects in orbit .
In reality , this was only a test of the first stage and the vehicle ’s second and third stages were only steel mockups .
The CIA determined that this was not a prototype ballistic missile — it was large and ungainly , and had to be launched from a fixed position making it vulnerable to attack .
In a top secret 1990 report , Iraqi Ballistic Missile Developments , the CIA stated that Iraq was indeed trying to build a satellite launching vehicle , but faced many technical challenges , such as staging and guidance .
In the late 1980s Iraq had a space program .
Iraq even got so far as to develop a 50 - kilogram test satellite .
After the United States invaded and occupied Iraq , it was possible for US intelligence agencies , as well as the United Nations , to roam Iraq collecting evidence about its various weapons programs .
The United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission , known as UNMOVIC , gathered substantial information on various Iraqi ballistic missile programs , including information on the Al Abid space launch vehicle .
Much of the information was gathered from documents turned over by the Iraqis in 1995 after a high - level defector prompted the Iraqis to preemptively release documents they had been hiding in a chicken farm in order to blunt the defector ’s damage .
UNMOVIC also gathered additional information after the American invasion in the form of interviews and other documents .
That information is now contained in a massive report on various Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs .
Starting a space program Iraq began its space efforts around 1988 .
The program operated under several names , including the declared name of Al Abid as well as alternate names such as Bird ( “ Al Ta’ir ” in Arabic ) and Comet .
Iraq began development of its indigenous space program after an effort to cooperate with another , unnamed , country failed .
However , according to UNMOVIC , at least one other country provided assistance , and one or two additional countries were also sought for help but did not provide it .
The identities of all these countries have not been revealed by UNMOVIC , probably in an effort to pursue a counter proliferation strategy .
The project was carried out under the overall direction of the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization .
In mid-1988 the Space Research Corporation ( SRC ) began studying development of a launch vehicle capable of placing a 100–300 kilogram payload into a 200 – 500 kilometer orbit .
The vehicle had to be developed using existing systems .
A second team , apparently consisting of two foreign experts from an unnamed country , also assisted .
According to Iraqi officials involved in the program and interviewed later , the project was always civilian — although that was a rather loose definition .
SRC evaluated several different options , including configurations of four to six extended burn - time SCUD rockets clustered around a single extended burn - time SCUD as a second stage and a new third stage .
By early 1989 , the SRC had settled on a design consisting of five SCUDs clustered for the first stage , another for the second stage , and a “ double - base propellant ” rocket for the third stage .
The foreign specialists proposed a different design : a single SCUD as a core stage surrounded by strap - on rockets consisting of four or eight SA - 2 liquid propellant rockets from a surface - to - air missile , or four or eight SCUD rockets .
The second stage would be either liquid or solid propellant , and the rocket would also include an apogee kick motor .
Space Research Corporation experts rejected this design approach .
The SRC leadership produced a development schedule for the Al Abid with the goal of making the first launch by December 12 , 1990 .
Initially , the design had an enlarged payload shroud to house the satellite , giving it a hammerhead appearance .
But General Ra’ad , who oversaw Iraq ’s missile development programs , proposed increasing the diameter of the third stage to 1.25 meters in order to avoid this hammerhead shape .
He also designed a clamshell payload fairing .
By mid-1989 , the Al Abid design consisted of a five - SCUD first stage , a 1.25 meter diameter liquid propellant rocket for the second stage , and a third stage that might have been a modified SCUD with a larger diameter tank .
The SCUD is .88 meters in diameter , so the second stage was actually wider than the individual SCUDs used in the first stage .
Testing and foreign assistance
In December 1989 the Iraqis conducted their first test launch of the Al Abid from a fixed launch site at Al Anbar .
Although this was only a test of the first stage , it took place a mere six months after the SRC had developed their project timeline — a fast pace that UNMOVIC attributed to foreign assistance as well as the “ practical approach in modifying and developing different versions of the SCUD ” that project manager General Ra’ad was known for .
The second and third stages were steel mockups .
A videotape retrieved from the Haider chicken farm in 1995 showed that the first stage worked successfully for 45 seconds until the vehicle exploded .
The Iraqis suspected that explosive bolts between the first and dummy second stages may have fired prematurely , causing the accident , but this was still a partial success at getting a complex vehicle off the ground .
The Iraqis also approached two foreign countries to purchase a more powerful engine , but they were rebuffed .
The countries offered to launch Iraq ’s satellites themselves , but would not sell them engines .
The Iraqis quickly determined that the performance of the second stage was crucial to the overall performance of their rocket .
They had increased the diameter of the second stage to boost its power , but ran into additional problems .
The SCUD liquid propellant engine lacked the necessary thrust .
They initially sought to increase the performance by increasing the expansion ratio of the engine nozzle and changing the fuel .
The SCUD nozzle was designed to operate from sea level up , so it was relatively narrow .
The second stage would ignite at higher altitude , and if it had a wider expansion it would improve the thrust performance .
They changed the expansion ratio from 10 to 30 by adding a skirt .
They also changed the TM 185 fuel to diethylenetriamine ( DETA ) or a mixture of DETA and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine ( UDMH ) .
An initial engine test was partially successful until the expansion skirt burned through — a result of being tested at sea level rather than in at simulated high altitude .
The Iraqis also approached two foreign countries to purchase a more powerful engine , but they were rebuffed .
The countries offered to launch Iraq ’s satellites themselves , but would not sell them engines .
The Iraqis also apparently began developing a new first - stage engine with four SCUD combustion chambers and a single turbo- pump .
However , development work halted with the onset of the 1991 Gulf War .
After the December 1989 test launch , the Iraqis decided that the second and third stages of the Al Abid should be tested separately .
They planned a test for autumn 1990 that they referred to as Al Kharief , or “ Autumn . ”
The Al Kharief became the focus of international controversy .
United Nations inspectors claimed that this was a new missile , whereas the Iraqis claimed that it was the upper stages of the Al Abid .
In reality , it was both part of the Al Abid and a test platform for a nuclear delivery system under development by the Iraqis .
Around mid-1990 , Al Kharief work was proceeding very slowly , prompting a meeting of all relevant parties .
However , it became clear to project leaders that the development was plagued by disagreements and differing priorities .
The Al Kharief test ground to a halt , and the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait led to the suspension of all activities .
According to General Ra’ad , no final report was ever produced and no drawings of the vehicle were available .
The S - 13 nuclear delivery system Saddam Hussein had long sought a nuclear weapon , but Iraq ’s program had been sporadic and ineffectual at producing one .
In 1987 Iraq started a new program to develop a nuclear bomb , and Iraqi missile experts began discussions with the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission about the development of a ballistic missile to deliver it .
The nuclear weapon would have a weight in excess of two metric tons with a diameter of 1.25 meters .
The missile required a range of 650 kilometers .
These requirements were beyond the capabilities of Iraq ’s missiles and so the nuclear weapon designers were told that they would have to reduce the size of their planned weapon .
In April 1989 Iraq started work on Project S - 13 , the development of a long - range nuclear - tipped missile .
A senior Iraqi military leader later stated in an interview that although the weapons designers declared in 1988 that they wanted a missile ready by 1991 , he believed it would take until at least 1993 to produce one .
Initially , Project S - 13 evaluated three options : a 1.25 meter diameter missile capable of delivering a one - ton weapon 1,200 kilometers ; a derivative of the Al Hussein / Al Abbas missile that could reach 650 kilometers ; and an unmodified SCUD - B missile with a range of only 300 kilometers .
Clearly Iraq wanted to develop a space program .
But why ?
Iraqi statements and documents on the S - 13 project are inconsistent .
Some documents indicate that the Iraqis viewed the new project as a replacement for the existing Al Abbas conventional missile .
According to one senior general , his plan was for the Al Abid space launch vehicle ’s second and third stages to form the basis of the nuclear missile .
But General Ra’ad , who was in charge of the Al Abid development , insisted that he was unaware of plans to use his rocket for nuclear delivery and that nobody ever approached him about using the Al Kharief ( the “ Autumn ” test of the Al Abid second and third stages ) for such a purpose .
It is possible that General Ra’ad was in fact unaware of or disagreed with the plans , but the disparity remains , and UNMOVIC investigators concluded that there was a tie between the programs , “ although the precise details of the relationships are unclear . ”
UNMOVIC added , “ What is clear , however , is that these activities were contributing to the long - term solution for a delivery vehicle for the nuclear weapon under the overall control or oversight of General Amer Al Sa’adi . ”
Unanswered questions
Although the United Nations report mentions a 50 - kilogram test satellite , it contains no further details , not even a photograph .
Also missing are details about the purpose of the program .
Clearly Iraq wanted to develop a space program .
But why ?
Was it motivated primarily by prestige , a desire to become the first Arab nation to launch a satellite ?
Or was Saddam Hussein seeking to develop a satellite reconnaissance capability to monitor his neighbors ?
Unfortunately , those are not questions of great interest to United Nations arms inspectors , or even US intelligence agencies .
But it is possible that a more peaceful , stable , and open Iraq will enable these questions to be someday answered .

The Catcher in the Rye Introduction
Over the course of three days , a rich kid who can't stop getting expelled from every school he attends wanders around Manhattan trying to get ( 1 ) drunk and ( 2 ) lucky .
No , it 's not the plot of an unreleased Gossip Girl season ( RIP ) .
It 's the plot of Catcher in the Rye , J. D. Salinger 's beloved , banned , reviled , worshiped , and — well , let ’s just say polarizing 1951 novel about a depressed prep school boy with a heart of gold .
Chuck Bass , meet your worst nightmare .
After rocketing almost immediately to the top of the bestseller lists , The Catcher in the Rye began its run on the banned books list .
Not that we ’re surprised by this ( profanity , sex , alcohol abuse , prostitution — need we go on ? ) , but we are a little surprised that it ’s also so common in high school English classes .
Is there ’s something more going on than the ramblings of a depressed and admittedly immature sixteen - or seventeen - year - old ?
Boy ( as Holden would say ) is there .
Reaching all the way back to the coming - of - age Bildungsroman tradition , The Catcher in the Rye is a book about a teenager trying to find a way to be true to himself while growing up in a world full of phonies — and a book about post - World War II America burrowing into the “ phoniness ” of consumerism while trying to pretend that the trauma of the atomic bomb did n’t happen .
No wonder The Catcher in the Rye ended up as a symbol of alienation and isolation for the disillusioned and restless post - war generation .
And then there ’s J. D. Salinger himself , who stopped publishing and essentially disappeared from public view at the height of his career — almost like he was a sort of Holden Caulfield .
So , is Holden really a stand - in for Salinger himself ?
Does Holden eventually get better ?
What really happened between his three days in New York and his “ rest ” out West ?
That 's a secret Salinger will never tell .
xoxo .
Yahoo is n't happy that a detailed menu of the spying services it provides law enforcement agencies has leaked onto the web .
Shortly after Threat Level reported this week that Yahoo had blocked the FOIA release of its law enforcement and intelligence price list , someone provided a copy of the company 's spying guide to the whistleblower site Cryptome .
The 17 - page guide describes Yahoo's data retention policies and the surveillance capabilities it can provide law enforcement , with a pricing list for these services .
Cryptome also published lawful data - interception guides for Cox Communications , SBC , Cingular , Nextel , GTE and other telecoms and service providers .
But of all those companies , it appears to be Yahoo 's lawyers alone who have issued a DMCA takedown notice to Cryptome demanding the document be removed .
Yahoo claims that publication of the document is a copyright violation , and gave Cryptome owner John Young a Thursday deadline for removing the document .
So far , Young has refused .
Yahoo's letter was sent on Wednesday , within hours of the posting of Yahoo's Compliance Guide for Law Enforcement at Cryptome .
In addition to copyright infringement , the letter accuses the site of revealing Yahoo's trade secrets and engaging in " business interference . "
According to the letter , disclosure of its surveillance services ( .pdf ) would help criminals evade surveillance .
The Compliance Guide reveals , for example , that Yahoo does not retain a copy of e-mails that an account holder sends unless that customer sets up the account to store those e-mails .
Yahoo also cannot search for or produce deleted e-mails once they 've been removed from a user 's trash file .
The guide also reveals that the company retains the IP addresses from which a user logs in for just one year .
But the company 's logs of IP addresses used to register new accounts for the first time go back to 1999 .
The contents of accounts on Flickr , which Yahoo also owns , are purged as soon as a user deactivates the account .
Chats conducted through the company 's Web Messenger service may be saved on Yahoo's server if one of the parties in the correspondence set up their account to archive chats .
This pertains to the web - based version of the chat service , however .
Yahoo does not have the content of chats for consumers who use the downloadable Web Messenger client on their computer .
Instant message logs are retained 45 to 60 days and includes an account holder 's friends list , and the date and times the user communicated with them .
Young responded to Yahoo's takedown request with a defiant note :
I cannot find at the Copyright Office a grant of copyright for the Yahoo spying document hosted on Cryptome .
To assure readers Yahoo's copyright claim is valid and not another hoary bluff without substantiation so common under DMCA bombast please send a copy of the copyright grant for publication on Cryptome .
Until Yahoo provides proof of copyright , the document will remain available to the public for it provides information that is in the public interest about Yahoo's contradictory privacy policy and should remain a topic of public debate on ISP unacknowledged spying complicity with officials for lucrative fees .
\— – Note : Yahoo's exclamation point is surely trademarked so omitted here .
The company responded that a copyright notice is optional for works created after March 1 , 1989 and repeated its demand for removal on Thursday .
For now , the document remains on the Cryptome site .
Threat Level reported Tuesday that muckraker and Indiana University graduate student Christopher Soghoian had asked all agencies within the Department of Justice , under a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request , to provide him with a copy of the pricing list supplied by telecoms and internet service providers for the surveillance services they offer government agencies .
But before the agencies could provide the data , Verizon and Yahoo intervened and filed an objection on grounds that the information was proprietary and that the companies would be ridiculed and publicly shamed were their surveillance price sheets made public .
Yahoo wrote in its objection letter that if its pricing information were disclosed to Soghoian , he would use it " to ' shame ' Yahoo !
and other companies — and to ' shock ' their customers . "
" Therefore , release of Yahoo ! 's information is reasonably likely to lead to impairment of its reputation for protection of user privacy and security , which is a competitive disadvantage for technology companies , " the company added .
The price list that Yahoo tried to prevent the government from releasing to Soghoian appears in one small paragraph in the 17 - page leaked document .
According to this list , Yahoo charges the government about $ 30 to $ 40 for the contents , including e-mail , of a subscriber 's account .
It charges $ 40 to $ 80 for the contents of a Yahoo group .

Republican senators on Wednesday blocked an effort to debate a bill that would prevent credit card companies from raising interest rates ahead of new regulations coming into force next year .
The move angered congressional Democrats who were pushing for an emergency freeze on credit card rates .
“ I ’m extremely disappointed that the financial health of millions of American taxpayers has been completely brushed aside by a handful of Wall Street banking interests in the US Senate , ” Rep. Betsy Markey ( D - CO ) said , as quoted in the Coloradoan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who heads the Senate Banking Committee , had authored a bill that would have prevented credit card issuers from hiking interest rates ahead of a new law coming into effect in February that restricts how and when rates can be raised .
Earlier this year , Dodd wrote and passed through the Senate the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure ( CARD )
Act , which requires credit card issuers to give customers advance notice before hiking rates and fees .
That bill comes into force in February .
But , as news sources reported earlier this year , credit card companies took advantage of the delay to hike interest rates before the bill became law .
Dodd ’s latest bill would freeze credit card rates where they are now until the new law comes into effect next year .
It would also require credit card companies to review all interest hikes going back to the beginning of 2009 to see if customers were overcharged .
But when Dodd asked for the Senate ’s unanimous consent to discuss the bill , Sen . Thad Cochran ( R - MI ) “ objected on the behalf of several of his GOP colleagues , preventing debate , ” reports The Hill .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Knowing that the Credit CARD Act would finally protect consumers from these abuses , the industry has tried to make one last grab for their customers ’ pocketbooks , ” Dodd said Wednesday .
“ The reason we allowed a gap period between the passage of the legislation and the imposition of the regulations or the statutory requirements was because the industry came to me and said , you know senator , we ’re going to need some time to administer , to change how we provide these kinds of benefits to people .
So would you give us a little window here to operate ? ”
Dodd said .
“ Unfortunately they ’ve taken that window and used it as a way to jam in on the consumers of this country , ” Dodd said .

A Rasmussen poll released Tuesday shows that about half of Americans — 50 percent — saw their credit card interest rates go up in the past six months .
( CNN ) -- Authorities in Colorado have filed charges against the parents in last month 's notorious " balloon boy " case , and the pair 's lawyers say the two are expected to plead guilty on Friday .
The Larimer County district attorney 's office Thursday said Richard Heene has been charged with one count of attempting to influence a public servant , a felony , and Mayumi Heene has been charged with one count of false reporting to authorities , a misdemeanor .
Richard Heene turned himself in Thursday afternoon and was released on a $ 5,000 personal recognizance bond , the Latimer County Sheriff 's Office said .
Mayumi
Heene did not appear with him .
The Heenes will appear Friday in Larimer County Court , where they are expected to plead guilty , their attorneys said .
The penalty range for the felony is two to six years in prison with a fine of $ 2,000 to $ 500,000 .
The range for the misdemeanor would be six months in jail with a fine of $ 50 to $ 750 , the district attorney 's office statement said .
The Heenes ' attorneys said prosecutors have agreed to a sentence of probation with the possibility of up to 90 days in jail for Richard Heene and up to 60 days in jail for his wife .
The threat of deportation for Mayumi Heene was a factor in the plea deal negotiation , the attorney 's statement said .
" Mayumi Heene is a citizen of Japan .
As such , any felony conviction or certain misdemeanors would result in her deportation , even though her husband and children are Americans , " the statement said .
" It is supremely ironic that law enforcement has expressed such grave concern over the welfare of the children , but it was ultimately the threat of taking the children 's mother from the family and deporting her to Japan which fueled this deal . "
Prosecutors in the case could not be immediately reached for comment .
On October 15 , a large silver balloon came loose from moorings in the Heenes ' yard and floated over Colorado .
Mayumi Heene called 911 and said the couple 's 6 - year - old son Falcon was inside the craft .
Millions of people across the country watched the saga on television for nearly two hours as military aircraft tracked the balloon in the air and rescuers chased it on the ground .
Mayumi
Heene later admitted the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time , authorities said .
Watch the moment the hoax was revealed
Court documents released last month said the couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and " instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax . "
Their motive ?
To " make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests , " the documents said .
* Netanyahu says no room for troop disobedience
* Soldiers rebelled during demolition at settler - outpost
* Military plays down mutiny
JERUSALEM , Nov 17 ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced concern on Tuesday over a mutiny by pro-settler soldiers that raised fears of more rebellion in the ranks in any future land - for - peace moves with the Palestinians .
" Our security and existence depend on the Israel Defence Forces , " Netanyahu told reporters .
" If you promote disobedience , you will bring about the downfall of the state .
There is no place for disobedience . "
In an incident on Monday played down by the military as an aberration and described by some political commentators as a crossing of a red line , a handful of soldiers protested against the partial dismantling of a settler - outpost in the West Bank .
Their action prompted 15 right - wing legislators in the 120 - member parliament to propose a bill that would bar the military from forcing troops to remove Jews from settlements in the occupied territory .
Two of the soldiers disobeyed orders and refused to secure the settlement site , which had been built without government permission and where police razed two buildings .
They were sentenced respectively to 20 days and 14 days in jail .
Two other soldiers , who held up a sign at an army base in the West Bank saying their battallion would never evacuate settlements , also faced a disciplinary hearing at which each received a month - long prison term .
" The military ... must understand there are some soldiers who cannot implement these orders .
It is like asking a man to strike his brother , " said Rabbi Elyakim Levanon of the Elon Moreh seminary in the West Bank where some of the troops had studied .
" Stop the anarchy , " countered a headline in Israel 's biggest newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , above commentary urging the army to crack down hard on soldiers who disobey orders .
The military 's chief of staff , Lieutenant - General Gabi Ashkenazi , told reporters he would do just that .
But Brigadier - General Avi Bnayahu , the military 's chief spokesman , played down the significance of the protests .
" This is not a political tidal wave washing through the military and the matter has not spiralled out of control , " Bnayahu said .
SETTLER-OUTPOSTS
Ideological divides run deep in Israel , especially over the future of some 500,000 Jews who live among 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , areas captured in a 1967 war .
But the military , to which Jewish men and women are conscripted at the age of 18 , has long been seen as off - limits to political debate .
Soldiers who participated in the removal of settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 were hand - picked and specially trained for the task .
Troops uncomfortable with the mission were quietly excused by their commanders .
Politically - charged demolitions at some of the dozens of outposts erected by Jews in the West Bank without formal permission are usually carried out by police rather than soldiers , who are assigned perimeter security duty .
The latest mutiny followed a protest last month by conscripts , who disrupted their swearing - in ceremony by calling for continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank , part of the territory where Palestinians hope to create a state .
After that incident , two soldiers were sentenced to 20 days in jail and removed from their unit .
" No one should be surprised if the signs of protest within the military against the evacuation of structures and settlements only grow , " wrote Alex Fishman , military affairs correspondent for Israel 's biggest daily , Yedioth Ahronoth .
" After all , these soldiers were sentenced to only a few days of detention , as if they committed a traffic offence . "

Douglas Adams ( 1954-2001 )
Website | Wikipedia Entry
Douglas Adams was a British writer who wrote the Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy , Dirk Gently ’s Holistic Detective Agency and several episodes of Doctor Who .
He described himself as a ‘ radical atheist ’ in order to distinguish himself from agnostics .
In 1999 , Adams explained that :
‘ I really do not believe that there is a god – in fact I am convinced that there is not a god ( a subtle difference ) .
I see not a shred of evidence to suggest that there is one .
It ’s easier to say that I am a radical Atheist , just to signal that I really mean it , have thought about it a great deal , and that it ’s an opinion I hold seriously . ’
In his final book , The Salmon of Doubt , published in 2002 , Adams addresses people who believe that God must exist because the world so fits our needs .
He compares them to an intelligent puddle of water that fills a hole in the ground .
The puddle is certain that the hole must have been designed specifically for it because it fits so well .
The puddle exists under the sun until it has entirely evaporated .

She has written The Son factory , The Caged Virgin and Infidel .
In The Caged Virgin , she wrote of her atheism :
‘ September 11 was a turning point , but it was not until six months later , After I had read The Atheist Manifesto by Hermann Philipse , that I dared to admit to others that I no longer believed .
I had been given book in 1998 by my boyfriend Michael but did n’t want to read it at the time .
I thought : an atheist manifesto is a declaration of the devil .
I could feel any resistance .
But recently I felt ready .
The time had come .
I saw that God was an invention and that subjection to His will meant nothing more than subjecting yourself to the willpower of the strongest . ’

I ’m an Atheist .
I do n’t believe in God , Gods , Godlets or any sort of higher power beyond the universe itself , which seems quite high and powerful enough to me .
I do n’t believe in life after death , channeled chat rooms with the dead , reincarnation , telekinesis or any miracles but the miracle of life and consciousness , which again strike me as miracles in nearly obscene abundance .
I believe that the universe abides by the laws of physics , some of which are known , others of which will surely be discovered , but even if they are n’t , that will simply be a result , as my colleague George Johnson put it , of our brains having evolved for life on this one little planet and thus being inevitably limited .
I ’m convinced that the world as we see it was shaped by the again genuinely miraculous , let ’s even say transcendent , hand of evolution through natural selection . ’

Isaac Asimov was a Russian - born American writer and professor of biochemistry , whose prolific output of over 130 books covered science fiction , mysteries , popular science , history and memoirs .
In 1982 , Asimov said :
‘ I am an atheist , out and out .
It took me a long time to say it .
I ’ve been an atheist for years and years , but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist , because it assumed knowledge that one did n’t have .
Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic .
I finally decided that I ’m a creature of emotion as well as of reason .
Emotionally I am an atheist .
I do n’t have the evidence to prove that God does n’t exist , but I so strongly suspect he does n’t that I do n’t want to waste my time . ’
In 1994 , Asimov speculated that :
‘ If I were not an atheist , I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words .
I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God , God , God , and whose every deed is foul , foul , foul . ’

I had always thought that the world was a small price to pay for eternity ; but it was worth more than that , because I loved the world , and it was suddenly God whose price was small : from now on His name would have to be a cover for nothing more than a mirage …
I was not denying Him in order to rid myself of a troublesome person : on the contrary , I realized that He was playing no further part in my life and so I concluded that he had ceased to exist for me . ’

Bill Bryson is an American writer of travel , language and science books , including Notes from a Small Island , The Mother Tongue and A Short History of Nearly Everything .
In 2005 , he said :
‘ I ’m not a spiritual person , and the things I ’ve done have n’t made me one , but the one thing I did appreciate when I was writing A Short History was that conventional science and a belief in god are absolutely not incompatible .
You can be a scientist and believe in god : the two can go hand in hand .
What certainly struck me during my research was that the very fundamental creationist views – the literal biblical interpretation of how the world was created – is much , much less exciting than real science .
If you believe in god , it ’s much more fantastic to believe that he created this universe billions of years ago and set in motion this long train of activities that eventually resulted in us .
I think that ’s so much more satisfying , more thrilling , than the idea that it was all done in seven days . ’

George Carlin was an American comedian , actor and writer .
In a 1997 routine , he said :
‘ Religion has actually convinced people that there ’s an invisible man – living in the sky – who watches everything you do , every minute of every day .
And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do .
And if you do any of these ten things , he has a special place , full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish , where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ‘ til the end of time !
[ Pause ]
But
He loves you . ’
Carlin said that he worships the sun , because he can see it , and now prays to Joe Pesci , because he seems like someone who can get things done , adding :
‘ I noticed that of all the prayers I used to offer to God , and all the prayers that I now offer to Joe Pesci , are being answered at about the same fifty percent rate .
Half the time I get what I want .
Half the time I do n’t .
Same as God : fifty - fifty . ’

All I know is that God is n’t a good explanation , so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one . ’
I ca n’t help feeling that such a position , though logically sound , would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied , and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin , Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist . ’
In 1996 , Dawkins said of belief in God : ‘ By all means let ’s be open - minded , but not so open - minded that our brains drop out . ’

That God must either be turned into a symbol for something less concrete or abandoned altogether . ’
And Dennett wrote about faith :
‘ I certainly grant the existence of the phenomenom of faith ; what I want to see is a reasoned ground for taking faith as a way of getting to the truth , and not , say , just as a way people comfort themselves and each other ( a worthy function that I do take seriously ) . ’

So there was little point in praying .
Nonetheless , before every battle , prayers were read , all kinds of incantations were incited , staged by all sorts of preachers .
We attended these ceremonies and I saw how all the soldiers stood in place , as though they could n’t believe their ears .
I could n’t believe it either , but I counted for nothing …
Since then , I have given up belief in God , in a ‘ light ’ that leads us , or anything of that sort .

In 2005 , he wrote :
‘ Atheism is not a philosophy ; it is not even a view of the world ; it is simply a refusal to deny the obvious …
It is worth noting that no one ever needs to identify himself as a non-astrologer or a non-alchemist .
Consequently , we do not have words for people who deny the validity of these pseudo - disciplines .
Likewise , atheism is a term that should not even exist .
Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make when in the presence of religious dogma . ’
In 2006 , Harris wrote :
‘ The President of the United States has claimed , on more than one occasion , to be in dialogue with God .
If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer , this would precipitate a national emergency .

I can do what I do to share my enjoyment of sex with all my viewers out there .
If I can help any person or persons have a great sex session , then I ’ve done a good job !
I believe that society changes and that we can take what is good from the world ’s religions and leave behind what is n’t so good , and forge a new say .
I ’m one of the forgers , I like to think ! ’

Death is certain , replacing both the siren - song of Paradise and the dread of Hell .
Life on this earth , with all its mystery and beauty and pain , is then to be lived far more intensely : we stumble and get up , we are sad , confident , insecure , feel loneliness and joy and love .
There is nothing more ; but I want nothing more . ’

We do have this need for mysticism .
That is in my movies .
And I always like to do stories about gods and monsters and imaginary beings of all kinds , because God is the greatest imaginary being of all time .

My feeling about even disorganized religion is summed up in James Taylor ’s immortal line in “ Sweet Baby James ” : “ Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep . ” I have no desire to promote secular insomnia .
As for being spiritual , not in the New Age sense , certainly .
I find enough mystery in mathematics to satisfy my spiritual needs .
I think , for example , that pi is mysterious enough ( do n’t get me started ! ) without having to worry about God .
Or if pi is n’t enough , how about fractals ?
or quantum mechanics ?…
In the same interview , when asked if he was an atheist , he said :
No one is more dangerous than someone who thinks he has The Truth .
To be an atheist is almost as arrogant as to be a fundamentalist .
But then again , I can get pretty arrogant .
However , by 2000 , he had told Cosmik Debris magazine :
I used to think atheists were arrogant , but now I am one and I like it .

Having taken that step , it informs every moment of my life .
I ’m not greedy .
I have love , blue skies , rainbows and Hallmark cards , and that has to be enough .
It seems just rude to beg the invisible for more …
Believing there ’s no God means I can’t really be forgiven except by kindness and faulty memories .
That ’s good ; it makes me want to be more thoughtful .
I have to try to treat people right the first time around …
Believing there is no God gives me more room for belief in family , people , love , truth , beauty , sex , Jell - o and all the other things I can prove and that make this life the best life I will ever have . ’
Penn added , about the challenge of proving there is no God , that :
‘ You ca n’t prove that there is n’t an elephant inside the trunk of my car .

‘ There are two sorts of atheists .
One sort claims that there is no deity , the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity ; I belong to the latter group , because if I were to claim that no god exists , I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim , and I cannot .
Religious persons have by far the easier position ; they say they believe in a deity because that ’s their preference , and they ’ve read it in a book .
That ’s their right . ’

No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down …
From that day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly secular person . ’

Then there was the theory of evolution – the teaching about which in schools was fought against in a courtroom in the USA and is still disbelieved by a majority of Americans , incredibly .
There ’s also no mention of dinosaurs in the bible either .
Perhaps it ’s not inspired by an all - knowing being after all and is , after all , just a cracking good work of fiction ?

Still , I went with agnosticism for a long , long time because I just hated to say I was an atheist – being an atheist seemed so rigid .
But the more I became comfortable with the word , and the more I read , it started to stick . ’

Linus Torvalds is a Finnish software engineer who developed the Linux operating system kernel .
In 1999 , when asked about his religion , he said :
‘ I am an atheist .
I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature .
I actually think it detracts from both .
It gives people the excuse to say , ‘ Oh , nature was just created ’ , and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous .
I appreciate the fact that , ‘ Wow , it ’s incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place . ’
I think we can have morals without getting religion into it , and a lot of bad things have come from organized religion in particular .
I actually fear organized religion because it usually leads to misuses of power . ’

In times past he has had ( and worn out and flung away ) hundreds and hundreds of religions ; today he has hundreds and hundreds of religions , and launches not fewer than three new ones every year …
One of his principle religions is called the Christian .
A sketch of it will interest you .
It sets forth in detail in a book containing two million words , called the Old and New Testaments .
Also it has another name – The Word of God .
For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God .
It is full of interest .
It has noble poetry in it ; and some clever fables ; and some blood - drenched history ; and some good morals ; and a wealth of obscenity ; and upwards of a thousand lies . ’

And in 1993 he said of Christianity :
‘ The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history .
The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge .
The subtext is , all the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on .
You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and had n’t asked any questions . ’

Now , she and her husband , Paul , plan to raise the twins .
The creation of Ethan and Bridget tested the boundaries of the field known as third - party reproduction , in which more than two people collaborate to have a baby .
Five parties were involved : the egg donor , the sperm donor , Ms. Baker and the Kehoes .
And two separate middlemen brokered the egg and sperm .
About 750 babies are born each year in this country through gestational surrogacy , and twice that many surrogacies are attempted .
Most are less complicated than the arrangement that resulted in the birth of Ethan and Bridget .
But as the dispute over the Michigan twins reveals , surrogacy arrangements that go badly can have profound implications , particularly for the children .
Surrogacy is largely without regulation , with no authority deciding who may obtain babies through surrogacy or who may serve as a surrogate , according to interviews and court records .
Instead , surrogacy is controlled mainly by fertility doctors , who determine which arrangements are carried out and also earn money by performing the procedures .
And while some agencies that coordinate surrogacies and some clinics that carry them out strictly adhere to guidelines , others do not , the interviews and records show .
The lax atmosphere means that it is now essentially possible to order up a baby , creating an emerging commercial market for surrogate babies that raises vexing ethical questions .
In some cases , parents must go through adoption proceedings to gain legal custody of the children .
But even in those situations , the normal adoption review process is upended .
In surrogacy , prospective parents with no genetic link often create their own baby first , then ask for legal approval , potentially leaving judges with little alternative .
Some states allow prebirth orders that place the parents ’ names on the birth certificates without any screening .
When disputes arise after the babies are born , the outcome can vary from state to state .
In California , considered a friendly state for surrogacy , courts have upheld the validity of surrogacy contracts , meaning that the people who hire surrogates are very likely to keep the babies if a dispute arises .

1 . Do n’t be evil .
In Stephen King ’s vast library of work — more than 60 books and nearly 400 short stories written over 35 years , according to The New York Times — the death tolls are vast , and the antagonists are monstrous , powerful , and often arbitrary .
The protagonists often make it out in one piece , but there are no guarantees for anyone else .
There are a few helpful paths to survival , though , starting with the most boring , obvious one : Do n’t be the bad guy .
While King ’s has drawn from early predecessors like Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft , his worlds have never been as amoral and malevolent as theirs ; good people suffer and often die , but the evil forces virtually always lose the ultimate battle , and they mostly die .
( At least those that were n’t already dead to begin with . )
A few , like the perennial baddie sometimes called Randall Flagg ( The Stand , the Dark Tower books , Eyes Of The Dragon ) escape to fight another day , sometimes under new names and in new forms .
But usually , at the end of the day , evil goes down swinging and cursing .
Anyone in a King story looking to make it out alive , take note .
2 . Do n’t go anywhere .
In King stories , tourism generally equals death .
In Gatlin , Nebraska , the title characters of “ The Children Of The Corn ” are waiting to murder strangers in the name of their horrible god .
Somewhere in Oregon , Rock And Roll Heaven pulls in the unwary with offers of great music by the long dead , but the tunes in “ You Know They ’ve Got A Hell Of A Band ” come at a great price .
Willow , Maine welcomes newlyweds with friendly locals and storms of killer frogs in “ Rainy Season . ”
The Shining has a resort hotel in Colorado that will kill entire families if they stay too long .
In Desperation , a bloated Nevada sheriff will arrest drivers on minor infractions , just so he can shoot them in the back .
In spite of its apparent destruction at the end of Salem ’s Lot , that town is still open for a bite any time .
Really , you ’re better off just staying home .

3. Avoid off - brand merchandise .
In King stories , it ’s a good idea to make sure your purchases come from accredited brand names and have trustworthy , trackable histories .
Otherwise , you might end up paying for something for the rest of your life .
( Insert creaky , menacing laughter here . )
Nowhere is this more evident than in King ’s “ deal with the devil ” parable Needful Things , in which Castle Rock is laid to waste by a new store that offers exactly what its customers desire .
Leland Gaunt , proprietor , deal - maker , and not at all nice fellow , has a special stock of priceless items that he ’ll sell to just the right bidder , in exchange for a pittance and a prank that seems harmless but really is n’t .
Everyone who buys suffers , just like Arnie Cunningham suffers for investing in a used Plymouth Fury without looking for references in Christine .
Or Richie Grenadine suffers , when he learns that incredibly cheap beer is n’t necessarily worth the savings in “ Gray Matter . ”
Sometimes mysterious goods can be lifesavers , as in “ Chattery Teeth , ” and sometimes even seemingly trustworthy product goes bad , like the Polaroid Camera in “ The Sun Dog , ” which takes the most awful pictures .
But be on the safe side : Shop smart , and always get a receipt .
4. Learn the rules .
Often , King tales are about the process of figuring out the particular , peculiar laws of each new jungle he sets his characters into .
When a cell - phone - borne virus turns people into zombies in Cell , protagonist Clayton Riddell has to learn the monsters ’ limits and drives in order to have a chance at saving his infected son .
The title character in Lisey ’s Story has to figure out what Boo ’ya Moon is , how to get there , and what it means to her and her late husband .
Thad Beaumont has to deduce what a psychopomp is and how to use it to escape his mad brother - thing in The Dark Half .
And ignoring the rules , hoping to turn things to his advantage , leads Louis Creed in Pet Sematary to a terrible place .
The rules tend to be pretty strange — just look at the bizarro tongue - biting Ritual Of Chüd that the kids in It have to go through ( twice ! ) to deal with their monstrous enemy .
And it ’s almost never clear who established the rules in the first place .
But the rules are always older and stronger than frail humanity , and victims can generally become survivors just by getting their adversaries on the wrong side of immutable cosmic law .

5 . Be a kid .
Being a child is n’t a foolproof path to survival in a Stephen King book : Children periodically die to show just how dangerous and ruthless a given story ’s threat is , and how serious the situation has become .
From George Denbrough at the very beginning of It to Brian Rusk , the first customer at the shop in Needful Things , King books are littered with child corpses ; hell , Jake in the Dark Tower series dies three different times .
And yet …
King ’s stories often have a sentimental twinge toward children , and they ’re far more likely to survive than not , often due to other people ’s sacrifices and struggles .
Sometimes they ’re MacGuffins — in the cases of Kyra in Bag Of Bones , Patrick Danville in Insomnia , Charlie in Firestarter , or Danny Torrance in The Shining , their survival is central to the plot .
Sometimes their survival is the entire plot , as with Trisha in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon .
Sometimes they just get very lucky , like David and Hilly Brown , escaping the cataclysm that takes their town in The Tommyknockers .
One way or another , kids have a pretty good chance of making it out alive .
Of course , they ’ll probably lose their innocence along the way .
As “ Low Men In Yellow Coats ” from Hearts In Atlantis illustrates , sometimes in a conflict , the child survives , but childhood does n’t .
6 . Be resourceful and ruthless .
Again , this one may be obvious , but while King often respects that fragile childish innocence , he tends to reward the bastards who are willing to bite the bullet and do whatever it takes to survive , from Paul Sheldon cramming a burning manuscript into Annie ’s mouth in Misery to Jessie Burlingame slashing her own wrists to escape in Gerald ’s Game .
Andy Dufresne is willing to go to staggering extremes to escape with his sanity and self - respect as well as his life in “ Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption , ” while the teacher in “ Sometimes They Come Back ” is willing to rip off his own fingers and summon a demon in order to deal with his killer - ghost problem .
Redemption and rescue never comes easy in a King story ; those who make it out usually do so via insane acts of mingled terror and bravado .
As Hal Shelburn explains after he risks his life to take out a killer toy in “ The Monkey , ” fear often numbs any feelings of courage , but it does n’t matter what you ’re feeling , as long as you ’re doing the right thing .

7 . Accept that you ’ll never be cool .
Like most popular authors , King has an affection for the underdog , but that affection is often undone by a deep , unsettling antipathy toward the social outcasts in his fiction .
Carrie
White of Carrie is to be pitied , but not entirely liked , and while her tragic fall is precipitated by an undeserved act of cruelty committed by her peers , the subtext is unmistakable : Know your place .
Carrie pretends she ’s a normal girl and goes to the prom , where she gets doused in pig ’s blood .
Arnie Cunningham , the awkward , nerdy loser at the heart of Christine , finds that the self - confidence and hot girlfriend he gets from having his own wheels means losing himself to the ghost in the machine .
Ed Hamner in “ I Know What You Need ” seems like the perfect mate , in spite of being a dork with a crappy job and a crappy life — so clearly he ’s using evil magic to improve his odds with the ladies .
Then there ’s Harold Lauder , the most miserable bastard in King ’s The Stand ; he ’s a zit - covered , fat - assed freak who has the temerity to fantasize about one of the book ’s heroines .
Lauder gains some measure of acceptance with the good guys , but his self - hatred leads to a seething resentment of those around him , as well as a fatal pact with the Walking Dude .
Had Harold just made peace with his geekiness , he might ’ve found salvation along with the rest of his so - called friends , instead of winding up dead in a ditch , a victim of his own insecurities .
8. Believe in the healing power of art .
King has never been shy about his passion for storytelling , so it ’s no surprise to see that love translating itself into his work .
Being a writer does n’t always guarantee a long life , but it certainly improves a character ’s odds of survival .
Bag Of Bones narrator Mike Noonan finds salvation literally hidden in the prose of his final thriller .
Bill Denbrough ’s adult turn to horror fiction provides him with a valuable tool for dealing with a childhood that refuses to stay buried in It.
Richard Hagstrom in “ Word Processor Of The Gods ” hates the world he ’s trapped in , and sees that it ’s slowly killing a boy he cares about , so he literally writes them up a new one .
King himself , showing up as a character in the Dark Tower books , keeps his characters alive by writing , and rescues himself in the process .
And prose is n’t the only doorway to salvation , either .
The painter hero of King ’s recent novel Duma Key is nearly destroyed by his work , but he turns the tide by using that same work as a weapon for beating back the forces of darkness .
Still , the best example of how art can stave off destruction comes from one of King ’s most bizarrely personal novels , Misery , in which romance novelist Paul Sheldon uses his latest , greatest creation to keep his murderous number - one fan at bay .

9 . Pack a lunch .
King ’s protagonists have bad luck with confined spaces .
Witness the fate of poor Donna and Tad Trenton , a mother and son trapped in their car for days by a rabid St. Bernard in Cujo .
Or the hero who gets locked in a porta-potty and left for dead in “ A Very Tight Place . ”
While disaster may be impossible to avoid , characters can plan for it by keeping the possibilities in mind , and at the very least , storing up supplies against the storm .
Stored food would ’ve kept Lloyd Henreid from munching on his cellmates in The Stand , and though it would n’t have saved the lives of the auto - entombed mobsters in “ Dolan ’s Cadillac , ” it might have at left them to face those final few moments of gasping for air with a full stomach .
Who knows how much more comfortable Jesse Burlingame would ’ve spent her time handcuffed to a bed in Gerald ’s Game if she ’d had the foresight to leave munchies within arm ’s reach ?
At the very least , the surgeon - narrator stranded on a desert island in “ Survivor Type ” could ’ve benefited by brown - bagging it .
10 . Keep a decoy buddy around .
Sacrifice is a running theme in King books ; once in the frying pan , many characters find that the best way to stay out of the fire is to let someone else jump first .
Like Dick Hallorann , showing up to draw Jack ’s ire and let his other victims escape in The Shining .
( At least in the book , Dick not only survives , but actually manages to do some good in the process . )
Or John Coffey , sucking up other people ’s death , then quietly going to his own in The Green Mile .
Or the unfortunate Jimmy , heading into danger first and setting off the knife trap in ’ Salem ’s Lot .
Or Jonesy in Dreamcatcher and Bobbi ’s fearsome sister Ann in The Tommyknockers , each knowing that they ’ve been compromised and doomed , and that the best they can manage is to get between their tormentors and anyone who still has a chance of fighting back .

11 . Steer clear of Roland .
Speaking of ablative buddies , Dark Tower series protagonist Roland Deschain has a long chain of them , from his childhood friends to the adult companions he pulls out of their own worlds .
It ’s clear from the beginning that he has an agenda that will brook no compromise , no matter whom he has to sacrifice .
He ’s also a highly skilled killer who does n’t allow for interference .
Within his radius , friends and foes alike tend to wind up dead ; King draws him as a somewhat tragic , lonely figure , but also a right selfish bastard , when it comes right down to it .
By the end of King ’s magnum opus , he has a body count that rivals the scariest of King ’s monsters ; the quest just really is n’t worth the lethality of being his friend .
12 . Follow God , not religion .
It ’s hard to ignore the contempt for organized religion that runs through all of King ’s writing , where a commitment to Christianity more often than not translates to tyrannical madness .
Witness Margaret
White , the domineering fundie mother in Carrie , who locks her daughter in a closet at the slightest hint of sin .
Or Mrs. Carmody in “ The Mist , ” who responds to monsters and death with a series of nonsensical Bible verses and a growing hunger for human sacrifice .
But that does n’t mean King does n’t believe in God .
Faith is a key component in his work , and while that faith boils down to a commitment to basic goodness , respect for a Man Upstairs is still important .
Mother Abigail , the elderly woman who serves as a lynchpin for the heroic forces in The Stand , knew her Bible as well as Mrs .
White , but she used that knowledge more as a bulwark of her own essential decency .
Where the evil “ Christers ” ( as one of the heroes of Cell labels them ) use scripture to reinforce their own prejudices , thus dooming themselves to inevitable retribution , the heroes , like David Carver , the child prophet of Desperation , only know that somewhere , Someone is in charge , and the best way to get by is listen to the signs and not get bogged down in the details .

13 .
Do n’t fall in love with the hero .
Pity Susan Norton .
In ’ Salem ’s Lot , she does n’t do anything wrong — in fact , she ’s barely there at all .
As one of a long line of less - than - convincing King love interests , she meets Ben Mears , the novel ’s protagonist , is dutifully impressed by his writing prowess , becomes interested in his suspicions about a dark force rising in the town , and then ends up as vampire chow .
Her purpose in the narrative is to add tragedy to Ben ’s fight against evil , but it also points out one the essential dangers of romance in genre fiction .
And King is no exception to the rule .
See also Rachel Creed in Pet Sematary , who marries a doctor , then gets dragged across the country to a small town in Maine where an evil Indian burial ground claims her cat , her toddler son , her neighbor , and eventually , her .
The never - seen lover in “ The Ledge ” is murdered off the page and still gets used to force the hero to go for a very dangerous walk .
Tommy Ross , the boyfriend of Sue Snell and target of Carrie White ’s infatuation in Carrie , ends up unconscious , then electrocuted .
Ben Richards ’ wife Sheila is murdered so her husband can have a spectacular finish in The Running Man .
And of course , poor Susan Delgado ’s fate in Wizard & Glass serves as the perfect haunting backstory for Roland in Dark Tower .
( See above . )
Falling for a King hero means a lover who will remember your name , forget your birthday , and likely lead you to your ugly , agonizing demise .
14 . Do n’t trust technology .
Sure , it seems shiny .
Who would n’t want the ability to talk to anyone anywhere , travel the stars in comfort and speed , or generate full novels without ever having to write anything down ?
But in King - land , the tech that makes all these things possible is almost always something the world would ’ve been better off without .
“ The Jaunt ” tells of a future where instantaneous transportation is possible , but only if you stick to the rules .
In Cell , the real , relatable magic of cell phones leads to mass insanity , murder , and the disintegration of society .
But the Faustian bargain struck between science and our immature need for power comes through plainest in The Tommyknockers , where a group of long - dead aliens control a small Maine town by offering the locals access to astonishing innovations and otherworldly devices .
While King has publicly admitted the book is as much about his drug addiction as about technology , its cautionary advice is still useful to any future protagonists :
Behind every high - speed mail - sorting machine is a bald woman with tentacles where her vagina used to be .

15 . Listen to the magic voices in your head .
As we ’ve said before and will say again , latter - day King stories tend to get deterministic , with the fight between good and evil going on way above the protagonists ’ heads .
So people tend to get a lot of help from the other side , generally in the form of internal voices that guide them and provide key hints as to the best path to take .
This plot device reaches its apex in Rose Madder , where both the abused - wife protagonist and her insane abuser husband essentially become chess pieces on an unseen board , piloted through the plot step by step .
But most of King ’s novels have these guiding voices in some form or the other .
Usually they sound like someone the protagonist used to know and love .
Usually they know far more than the protagonist does .
And while they are n’t always benevolent , they do n’t lie and they do n’t fail .
The question is , why do they care ?
16 .
If all else fails , redefine survival .
Sometimes you ca n’t beat ’em .
So why not join ’em ?
Maybe that means becoming a hideous fungoid beast , as in “ Gray Matter . ”
Or becoming a slave to brutal machines , as in “ Trucks . ”
Or losing your faith and your soul , like Father Callahan from ’ Salem ’s Lot .
Or finding a way into another world , like Seth Garin and Audrey Wyler in The Regulators .
( Or Father Callahan again , for that matter . )
Or winding up as an armless proto-alien in “ I Am The Doorway , ” or a crazed murderer in “ The Man Who Loved Flowers . ”
Actually , survival in King books often seems to be paired with horrific madness and murder , but come on , who would n’t willingly slaughter a few dozen executives ( “ The Ten O’Clock People ” ) or kids ( “ Suffer The Little Children ” ) in order to save their own necks ?
No one ever said survival in a King story would be easy , after all .
George W. Bush gave one of the worst speeches of his life yesterday , especially given the level of national distress and the need for words of consolation and wisdom .
In what seems to be a ritual in this administration , the president appeared a day later than he was needed .
He then read an address of a quality more appropriate for an Arbor Day celebration : a long laundry list of pounds of ice , generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast .
He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help should send cash , grinned , and promised that everything would work out in the end .
We will , of course , endure , and the city of New Orleans must come back .
But looking at the pictures on television yesterday of a place abandoned to the forces of flood , fire and looting , it was hard not to wonder exactly how that is going to come to pass .
Right now , hundreds of thousands of American refugees need our national concern and care .
Thousands of people still need to be rescued from imminent peril .
Public health threats must be controlled in New Orleans and throughout southern Mississippi .
Drivers must be given confidence that gasoline will be available , and profiteering must be brought under control at a moment when television has been showing long lines at some pumps and spot prices approaching $ 4 a gallon have been reported .
Sacrifices may be necessary to make sure that all these things happen in an orderly , efficient way .
But this administration has never been one to counsel sacrifice .
And nothing about the president 's demeanor yesterday -- which seemed casual to the point of carelessness -- suggested that he understood the depth of the current crisis .
While our attention must now be on the Gulf Coast 's most immediate needs , the nation will soon ask why New Orleans 's levees remained so inadequate .
Publications from the local newspaper to National Geographic have fulminated about the bad state of flood protection in this beloved city , which is below sea level .
Why were developers permitted to destroy wetlands and barrier islands that could have held back the hurricane 's surge ?
Why was Congress , before it wandered off to vacation , engaged in slashing the budget for correcting some of the gaping holes in the area 's flood protection ?
