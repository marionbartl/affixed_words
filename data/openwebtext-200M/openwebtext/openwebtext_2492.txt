Distribute and Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
I am not an economist , norunlike a half - vast majority of the hairsprayheaded newsies who have somehow lately , miraculously , become overnight experts on all matters economic do I pretend to be one on TV .
What I am is an individual who has worked hard for forty years in a difficult , exacting , and not terribly rewarding profession , which has nevertheless offered me the opportunity an expensive one , but worth it of telling the truth , exactly as I see it , without having to worry about what interests , corporate or otherwise , I might offend .
And it seems to me that this is the moment the very moment when whatever I have sacrificed for that opportunity will now begin to pay off .
About halfway through those forty years , I made the acquaintance of Robert LeFevre , that great libertarian storyteller and teacher , who showed me ( although I had already had suspicions in that direction ) that what my generation had been indoctrinated to call the " Business Cyle " of boom and bust throughout American history was actually a government cycle of interference with the economy , followed by disaster , followed usually by government 's backing off until prosperity restored itself , whereupon the idiotic cycle started over again .
In the 19th century , economic turndowns were called " panics " , and from 1776 until 1929 , two facts about them were incontrovertible .
First , each and every one of them can easily be shown to have been the direct result of some particular stupidity on the part of the federal government .
And second , as soon as government withdrew from the part of the economy it had damaged , the economy began to heal itself .
Until 1929 , no panic had ever lasted longer than about eighteen months .
When the big Crash came in ' 29 , and the Franklin Roosevelt regime decided to interfere even more , the resulting Great Depression lasted twelve years .
It did n't really end , even then .
It 's just that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which Roosevelt labored hard for years to achievetended to distract everybody and gave him all the excuse he needed to flood the economy with counterfeit paper money and baseless credit .
Sound familiar ?
The Depression did n't really end until millions of G.I.s , many of them returning with ideas for new enterprises or a hunger for new toys Bill Ruger , with his partner Alex Sturm , comes to mind , as does the brainchild of Albert Dremel rebuilt the American Productive Class after it had been beaten half to death and hijacked by the Roosevelt government .
But wait there 's a third fact about panics and depressions you need to know , one only libertarians ( not Republicans ) will tell you about : every instance of catastrophic government interference with the economy was carried out by bought - and - paid - for politicians , at the behest of some corrupt corporate interest they felt they needed to please .
These corporate interests did n't aspire to compete for your dollars by producing the best goods and services they could at the lowest possible prices ( a quaint little system called " capitalism " ) , but used the government as a bludgeon in the marketplace to preclude or destroy competition and force you to buy their products whether you want to or not .
This system is called " mercantilism " and it's exactly what Adam Smith wrote his Wealth of Nations to complain about in 1776 .
A panic or depression starts years before most people notice , when government creates money out of thin air , either by printing itone of the 19th century 's worst turndowns was brought on by phony dollars whipped up to pay for the War Between the Statesor by generating credit .
Today 's mess began when the Carter Administration forced lending institutions to offer people loans for homes they could n't actually afford .
( This seems to be an obsession with Jimmy the Peanut , whose " habitats for humanity " are currently in the process of derezzing , but this is n't an article on psychopathology , so we 'll leave the subject for another day . )
The Clinton gang took Carter 's program and expanded it .
To make things worse but to win over the lending institutions government gives them the magical power of " fractional reserve banking " .
That is , they 're allowed encouraged to commit fraud , by lending out many times the money they actually have .
Non-existent currency is transferred to would - be homeowners , who bestow it upon whoever they 're buying their house from , who transfers it to another , or even the same bank .
It 's all on paper ; nothing real ever changes hands , and it's all based on a fervent hope that not everyone on the job will be like the cranky old framing carpenter who takes his paycheck to the bank at the end of every week and swaps it out for cash .
Of course if they do , the government will just print more .
Paper currency is worth even less than imaginary capital : I think it was Ludwig von Mises who said only government can take two valuable commodities , paper and ink , and combine them to make something utterly worthless .
While it lasts , everybody seems to benefit .
Idiots go on electing Jimmy Carter clones " He gave me my home ! " bankers get obscenely wealthy and powerful .
If any of them realize that some of them will be made the scapegoats when the party 's over , they do n't seem to show it .
Why do government , its pet bankers , and their academic sock - puppets hate the idea of monetary standards based on gold , silver , platinum , or even bottlecaps and popsicle sticks ?
Because counting wealth in terms of tangible assets , anything with intrinsic value , would reduce their financial and political power by at least ten- or twelvefold .
Of course sooner or later , the bubble will eventually burst , an entire economy based on no real assets is bound to collapse .
Enough homeowners fail to make their mortgage payments so that the bank , even given its magical lending powers , can't afford to pay the institutions it owes money to .
Housing contractors do n't get paid and they go out of business and lay off their workers , including our friend the cranky old framing carpenter , who not only can't make their own mortgage payments , but can't go out and buy plasma TVs and Twinkies .
Circuit City and Hostess go out of business , putting even more people out of work .
The house of cards flattens .
The Great Depression and the Crash of ' 29 were caused directly by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , which allowed the private ( mostly foreign ) banking system to control a phenomenon the price of borrowed money , which we call " interest " that formerly had been controlled by the " Invisible Hand " of the free market system .
Cheap money is always popular , especially politically , and people borrowed and spent on things their common sense and better nature would have kept them from if the interest rate , kept artificially low , had been higher .
In earlier ages , the panic ends when someone thinks of something that can use old , overpriced assets , now being sold at a discount or given away , to make something that everybody wants and can buy for a nickel .
Even during the badly - managed Great Depression , a guy took a homemade game invented to spread socialist propaganda and became a millionaire by turning it into the most successful boardgame in history .
Nobody ever calculates how many formerly out - of - work people the manufacture and sale of Monopoly ™ gave employment and hopeto .
Multiply that a few thousand times and you 'll get an idea how they begin to dig their way out of a hole dug for them by politicians and phony financiers provided that the government stays out of their way .
When George Washington was an otherwise healthy and vigorous 67 years of age ( and no , I am not changing the subject ) , the good general went horseback riding in a freezing rain and contracted pneumonia .
Unfortunate enough to be rich , the poor fellow could afford a pack of quacks who drained him of his blood with leeches and fed him mercurous chlorate , certainly the opposite , in many respects , of what the man needed .
He died , of course .
That 's more or less the same thing FDR did to the economy in the 30s the opposite of what it needed and Bobo the God -King and his acolytes plan doing now .
Their dimly - conceived notion is to keep the bubble inflating , pumping it with " bailouts " , more funny money , until Russia , Syria , or Pakistan can be persuaded to attack Pearl Harbor , this time at the risk of the entire world going up in radioactive flames .
Based on past experience , that 's our future violent and uglyunless we do something to prevent it .
If we can , it could be the end of government mercantilism voracious , cannibalistic as we know it .
Instead of a disaster , this could be their last stand .
Politicians must be taught , in no uncertain terms , that the only real way to economically " stimulate " the Productive Class is to stop stealing their fucking money !
If the government announced a total tax amnesty , as well as a complete , permanent end to individual and corporate taxes repealing all unconstitutional economic regulations would help , too this depression would be over by the end of the week .
Businesses should shut up about " unfair competition " from the Japanese , the Chinese , and the Upper and Lower Slobbovians , and simply compete .
The trouble is , we 'd soon see for whose sake we 're suffering this mess , as life went on perfectly salubriously without our government keepers .
The way out the only way out is to tell them now what you want .
The way out the only way out is to tell them that , unless they do what 's really needed which is for them to go away you will never vote again for another incumbent , never vote again for another Republican or Democrat .
The way out is to make them believe it .
Do it now , while the mail is still being delivered .

Following the initial release date previously announced , the main collaborative textbook published by the Association , A Grammar of Modern Indo-European , has entered a pre-version 4 stage , heading for its second printed edition .
Appart from the expected changes in MIE concept ( viz. EIE , PIH , etc. ) and the correction of errors and ommissions , the structure has been revised and new sections added , thanks to the unending contributions of Fernando López - Menchero .
Among them , a “ Indo - European in Use ” section and a phonetical transcription of common vocabulary from English into Indo - European , with Latin meaning for clarification .
The Pre-Version has been published as another revision of the first printed edition ( v. 3.85 ) , to allow more contributions and corrections until this ( fourth ) full revision of the grammar is finished .
Publication of the second printed edition is due before the end of this year .
Your Indo-European Language Team .
In America , there are foragers among us , out searching for morels in the spring , and there are hunters too .
Yet most of our food , except for fish caught from the sea , is farmed .
We do not trap songbirds for savory pies .
( We destroy too many of them through other means . )
Once you look beyond the parochial culinary habits of most Americans you discover that wildness , and the tastes associated with it , have a talismanic power that is very hard to eradicate .
It is what keeps the Japanese whaling and keeps some Africans eating bush meat .
And it is one of the things that helps explain the voracious and utterly destructive Chinese appetite for turtles .
As global wealth rises , so does global consumption of meat , which includes wild meat .
Turtle meat used to be a rare delicacy in the Asian diet , but no longer .
China , along with Hong Kong and Taiwan , has vacuumed the wild turtles out of most of Southeast Asia .
Now , according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times , they are consuming common soft - shell turtles from the American Southeast , especially Florida , at an alarming rate .
Some scientists estimate that two - thirds of the tortoise and freshwater turtle species on the planet are seriously threatened .
Some of that is secondhand damage  loss of habitat , water pollution , climate change .
But far too many turtles are being lost to the fork and the spoon .

Google ’s Chrome browser came out of beta today .
Chrome is critical to the company ’s overall cloud - centric computing vision , yet after more than three months in beta , its market share remains abysmally small .
So while it might be the fastest beta - to - full launch offering from Google yet , will that be enough ?
( Full story below the fold . )
Google ’s V- P of search products and user experience , Marissa Mayer , ruined the official coming - out party of the Chrome browser when she said yesterday that the company would soon take it out of beta .
She spoke a day too soon — must be the jet lag , as she ’s been in Paris attending Le Web — for the release of Chrome ’s final version takes place today .
And while it might be the fastest beta - to - full launch offering from Google yet , the question remains :
Is that enough ?
On their blog , Google ’s Sundar Pichai and Linus Upson talk about improvements such as more stability , better video playback performance , and massive gains in speed .
The final version also has better bookmarking capability and privacy controls .
What more ’s , the company claims it ’s developing an extension platform , along with support for Mac and Linux .
It will need those versions in order to get broader adoption .
Despite being available for more than three months in beta form , Chrome ’s share of the browser market has remained abysmally small .
According to some estimates , it has a market share of less than one percent , below Microsoft ’s ( s msft ) Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox and Apple ’s ( s appl ) Safari .
There have been some recent gains in the browser ’s market share mostly because Google has been promoting the browser on its home page , according to browser tracker Net Applications ’
Hitlink , even though it had “ initially refused to place a one - word privacy link on their home page claiming a 28 - word limit for the page . ”
Google Chrome is available only for Windows platform for now .
The browser , it seems , has hit a bit of a plateau , a fact that ’s reflected in its share of traffic on this blog .
As you might remember , I wrote about the first one month of Chrome , noting that it had about 5.6 percent of the total traffic to GigaOM , and between 2.24 percent and 6.13 percent across our network of seven sites .
The information collected by Hitlink mirrors the plateau on Chrome ’s share on GigaOM , and it seems to have actually slipped to about 5 percent .
I guess Mozilla ’s John Lilly was right in not worrying too much about Google .
The marginal growth in the browser ’s market share is not good for Google , which needs the browser to grow as part of its overall cloud - centric computing vision .
This desktop share is critical for the company if it hopes that Chrome is going to be a dominant player on mobiles and other alternative devices .
Apple has shown this kind of desktop - to - mobile seamlessness ( well almost ) on its Safari browser .
Earlier this month , Google launched its extension framework for Chrome , which we pointed out was a way for the company to tie the browser into apps that run on Google ’s App Engine .
In other words , it was offering an entire ecosystem for cloud - based applications .
With the Chrome extensions , Google has made it possible for ISVs to launch ready - made niche applications for the cloud .
It ’s the same thing Facebook did with its API and Salesforce did with AppExchange ; in Google ’s case , ISVs now have a turnkey channel that can reach small businesses easily .
As we have noted time and again , Chrome is of critical importance to Google , but at its current market share , with moribund growth , the search giant is n’t going to realize many of its grand dreams anytime soon .

The machine formalism Described by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s , λ- calculus , is a formal system designed to investigate function definition , function application and recursion .
λ- calculus emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability , and together with Gödel 's Type System it is a paradigm of computer programming .
Several computer languages capable of functional programming such as Haskell , Lisp , Scheme , ML and Mathematica are based on these powerful ideas .
Among other features , they can automatically infer the types of most values without requiring explicit type annotations .
First described by Alan M. Turing in 1936 , a Turing machine is an extremely basic abstract device for symbol manipulation which , despite its simplicity , can be adapted to simulate any other machine .
A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a Universal Turing machine ( UTM ) .
Both Church and Turing used their constructions to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem and Turing proved that both formulations were equivalent .
The Wolfram 's Demonstrations project contains several visual examples of Turing machines .
Some years later all these ideas have materialized in what nowadays we know as digital computers .

Alan Turing
For the purpose of this contest it is necessary to stick to a formalism providing a framework .
For this contest the chosen formalism is the one used in the busy beaver competition for Turing machines .
In computability theory , a busy beaver ( from the colloquial expression for " industrious person " ) is a Turing machine which , when given an empty tape writes the largest number of 1s on its tape before halting .
This Demonstration program shows the behavior , step by step , of all known busy beaver machines so far .
In his 1962 paper [ 66 ] , Tibor Radó introduced the busy beaver game .
Since then , the Turing machine formalism for the busy beaver competition has beenas follows :
The Turing machine runs on a 2 - way unbounded tape filled with zeros ( no blank symbol ) .
At each step , two conditions : the machine 's current " state " ( instruction ) ; and the tape symbol the machine 's head is scanning
define each of the following :
a unique symbol to write ( the machine can overwrite a 0 or a previously written symbol ) usually denoted from 0 to n ; a direction to move in ( Left or Right but " none " is not allowed in this model except when the machine halts ) ; and a state to transition into ( may be the same as the one it was in ) usually numbered from 1 to m .
The machine halts if and when it reaches the special halting state .
In other terms : A Turing machine is a 5 - tuple of sets : M = ( Q , Sigma , delta , q0 , qH ) where
Q is a finite set of states including q0 and qH
Sigma is a finite set of input symbols ( there is no special ' blank ' character , the background is a list of zeros )
delta is a transition mapping Q- {qH} x Sigma to Q x Sigma x { 1, - 1,0}
q0 is the initial state ( 1 ) in F
qH is the halting state ( 0 ) in F
F is a finite set of final states
A transition is a five tuple : from - state input - symbol to - state symbol - to - write move .
Every input entry must be an integer .
The transition rules are flattened 5 - tuples of the form :
' s_i_1 ' ' c_i_1 ' ' s_n_1 ' ' c_n_1 ' ' d ( 1| - 1 ) ' ... ' s_i_k ' ' c_i_k ' ' s_n_k ' ' c_n_k ' ' d ( 1| - 1 ) '
for k rules ( the number of rules is 2*s with s the total number of states )
Each rule encoded as :
' s_i_1 ' ' c_i_1 ' ' s_n_1 ' ' c_n_1 ' ' d ( 1| - 1 ) ' ... ' s_i_k ' ' c_i_k ' ' s_n_k ' ' c_n_k ' ' d ( 1| - 1 ) ' for k rules ( the number of rules is 2 *s with s the total number of states )
Each rule encoded as : s_i from - state ( 1 , ...j ) ( starting state is always state ' 1 ' )
c_i input - symbol ( 0|1 , otherwise change ' symbols ' variable )
s_i to - state ( 1 , ... , j ) ( the halting state is always state ' 0 ' )
c_n symbol - to - write
d the head direction , either left ( ' - 1 ' ) , right ( ' 1 ' ) or none ( ' 0 ' when it enters into the halting state )
Program - size complexity
Also called algorithmic complexity or program - size complexity , the program - size complexity K(s ) of a string s can be measured by the length of the shortest program that produces s running on a universal Turing machine or in some fixed description language .
It is said that a program p is a description of string s on a Turing machine T if T ( p ) = s.
The length of the shortest description is denoted by K(s ) = { |p| : T( p ) = s } with |p| the length of the program p.
An example of a very short implementation with program size of 158 operational characters producing the 2400 first decimal digits of the number pi written in ANSI C : int a=10000 , b, c=8400 , d , e , f[ 8401 ] , g;main ( ) {for ( ; b- c ; )
f[b++]
=a/5; for( ;d=0,g=c*2;c-=14 , printf ( " %.4d " , e+d/a ) ,
e=d %a ) for ( b=c ;d+=f [ b ] * a , f[ b ]
=d%--g,d/=g--,--b;d*=b );}
Emil Post Emil Post
All theorems in algorithmic information theory depend on additive constants , which depend on the size of the universal Turing machine .
One might decide to encode a universal machine following a different computational model such as combinatory logic , a cellular automata or a Post tag - system , to name a few , in order to reduce the size length .
However , because the contest constrains the implementation to an input / output in terms of a Turing machine encodig ( among other reasons because it gives sense to compare and test different implementations ) , the size of the translator / compiler that converts from one formalism to another may undermine any substantial decrease in size .
We think that this is an interesting question per se .
Goals and motivation
The contest is premised on the fact that program - size complexity is not computable .
Hence it is always an open question whether a particular implementation of a universal machine is the shortest .
We think that the contest will motivate others --- as it is motivating us --- to conduct research into the possible size ratios among different computational models when constrained to input / output as a particular model of computation ( in this case a Turing machine ) .
Furthermore , even when by the invariance theorem we know that the shortest description of a string s under T1 is at most a constant number of bits longer than the shortest description under T2 , because there is always a way to write a translator between T1 and T2 , the length of an actual implementation is highly dependent on the chosen programming language -- although we have recently suggested a way to overcome this problem and provide a stable definition of program - size complexity [ 21 ] .

For instance , in quest of an utterly simple computer model , John Tromp has written a short program universal binary lambda computer [ 73 ] using combinatorics and from the same motives as those driving this contest , viz . to define and shed light on algorithmic information theory .
Implemented in Haskell , the description and source code can be found here .
Gregory Chaitin [ 8 ] has also written short versions of self - delimiting universal Turing machines in a dialect of Lisp he has written , the source code can be found here .
In Mathematica , the function TuringMachine is a universal Turing machine implementation by itself but if one wants to avoid calling a function that does all the work , it is possible to write an impressively short universal Turing machine without any dubious call to a function .
The shortest implementation , among three different implementations [ 77 ] of a universal Turing machine in Mathematica is :
s=1 ;a[ _] =0 ;n=0 ; Do[ {s , a[ n ] , d}={s , a[ n ] } /. rule ; n+=d , {t} ]
so one can , for example , simulate the 2,3 Wolfram Turing machine just by providing the rule { {1 , 2} -> { 1 , 1 , - 1} , { 1 , 1} -> { 1 , 2 , - 1} , { 1 , 0} -> { 2 , 1 , 1} , { 2 , 2} -> { 1 , 0 , 1} , { 2 , 1} -> { 2 , 2 , 1} , { 2 , 0} -> { 1 , 2 , - 1}} and setting a value for the number of steps t.
This notebook contains the code above for 10000 steps and shows what the first 100 cells of the output tape look like .
The fact that all these languages are Turing - equivalent means that , strictly speaking , one can write any program in any of them .
However , implementations of a Turing machine in lower - level or structured programming languages may require several lines of code .
We think that the contest may shed some light on the relations among several models of computation , since if one chooses a particular language or model for an implementation , the compiler may turn out to be long enough to counteract any effort to reduce the total size of the implementation .
To confirm this and to understand how it happens , we are randomly fixing a language and a model , bearing in mind that ANSI C/C++ and a Turing machine are a very well known standard programming language and a very well known standard abstract machine respectively .
The rules of the contest require the input / output to be as for a Turing machine , which obligates any implementation following any other model of computation to include a translator / compiler and figure out how to keep its implementation short enough .
One may perhaps find that the translator together with the machine code will always approach the size of an implementation following the model of computation for which the input / output was designed .

For example , there is a Lisp interpreter in C written by Kernighan and Ritchie and published in their The C Programming Language book , that one would require in order to compile the Greg Chaitin Turing machine written in Lisp in C language .
There is also a Mathematica program able to interpret Chaitin 's universal Turing machine in Lisp here .
For an interesting account of the comparison between programming languages in terms of algorithms implementation length , read Paul Graham 's Revenge of the Nerds [ 32 ] and his collection of canonical solutions to the same problem in a number of languages .
By employing several implementations one can begin trying to find out what the ratio between different models and compilers may be .
Also whether there is a convergence in output distribution from several different models of computation for which one could define " naturalness " for certain expected behaviors ( disregarding the implementation size ) , as Jean - Paul Delahaye and Hector Zenil have recently suggested in [ 21 ] .
General Rules
In the spirit of the busy beaver competition [ 66 ] but related to our interest in program - size complexity — following our own research on the program - size complexity for short sequences and in pursuit of a stable definition of program - size complexity [ 19,20 ] independent of additive constants -- we challenge contestants to write the shortest universal machine implementations in any standard programming language and the simpler in terms of program - size complexity of a Turing - universal machine .
The contest is open - ended and it is open to anyone .
To enter , a competitor must submit a universal machine implementation with smaller size values than the latest published records on this page .
Gregory Chaitin
The size of a universal machine implementation will be given by the operational characters necessary to compile the source code by using a standard public available compiler ( the same compiler will be used for all contestants ) .
For C++ for instance , g++ version 4.0.1 under Mac OS X 10.5 will be used .
Only operational characters will be counted .
An operational character is a non-space , non-part of a comment ASCII character , disregarding variables and constant name lengths .
In other words , if an operational character is removed the source code would not compile .
Variables and constant names each count for 1 character ( so naming a variable longer or shorter does not affect the final calculation , but it does if fewer are required ) .
So make your code legible by choosing self - explanatory variable names , and indenting and commenting on the code .
All other characters will be taken into account in ascertaining the final sum .
The combination of the following sizes -- the source code in characters ( K_sc ) , the compiled file in bytes ( K_c ) and the compressed ZIP ( K_cc ) file in bytes ( lossless data compression ) of the compiled version using the Deflate algorithm -- needs to be smaller than the previous champion implementation in order to take its place in the ranking .
Once a program is submitted and accepted no further changes will be allowed , but new submissions are always welcome as long as they fulfill the prescribed requirements .
A lower bound of the program - size length of the source code may be calculated with this Mathematica program .
This Mathematica program will provide an approximation to the actual operational - characters length of the source code .
However , submitters will have to perform the following steps and provide the exact calculation of their program length together with their submission :
Remove all comments .
Globally replace each variable / constant name with a unique single - character replacement .
Concatenate all lines if possible ( i.e. , all except preprocessor directives ) in editor , remove all whitespace except minimal required .
Compile and test the manually compressed version , to confirm that it still compiles and operates correctly .
Count every character and send the final sum together with your submission , the manually compressed version ( with that number of characters and still compilable ) and the readme file .
If the final count of the compressed version of the program is missing in the submission , it will be approached using the Mathematica program and it will be considered a lower bound and marked on the record holders table with a tilde symbol preceding the program - size value if it is clear that it is shorter than the previous implementations .
Later the original author or any of the organizers can decide to replace the count by the actual verified value , specially if there is any hesitation on whether it is the shortest or not .
It is strongly suggested that contestants include a readme .
txt file in the submission package , highlighting the code carrying out the computation of the machine implementation , if they do n't then their submission email ( or the part in which the program is specified ) may be used instead as a readme file .
It must also manage the input / output properly , so that one need only provide the specific transition rules in order to get the output either in a file or directly on - screen with no further computation or decoding .
For C++ only the standard iostream ANSI / ISO C++ library is allowed in the competition , and only for input / output purposes .
The output , then , must simply be the string written on the tape where the machine head went through , in the same language as the input , along with an integer indicating the total number of steps before halting .
For non-Turing machine implementations an embedded compiler has to be included such that one can still provide the same input and get the expected output in the output form of a Turing machine in a finite ( and reasonable ) period of time .
We know this favors a native Turing machine implementation rather than any other kind since the Turing machine would not need any further I/ O encoding , but we have to stick to a particular formalism in order to compare capabilities .
If the encoding is simple enough in computational terms ( so that the encoding is not evidently universal by itself ) it will not count as part of the original program size .
The fact that we are requesting output in a fixed form in a finite ( and reasonable ) time also stresses a time - complexity related dimension of the implementations .
Time - complexity has figured integrally in the formulation of this contest , as we seek answers to the question of whether there is any practical trade - off between time and program - size complexity .

Old convention ( before January 20th . 2009 ) :
Input syntax convention :
TuringMachine n transition_rules
with ' n ' a long integer and ' transition_rules ' a list of transition rules as integers .
' n ' is the max number of steps
Input example :
bash $ ./ TuringMachine 6 1 0 2 1 -1 1 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 1 0
where ' 6 ' was the max number of steps and ' 1 0 2 1 - 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 1 0 ' are the four transition rules according to the busy beaver for 2 states , for example .
-- New convention ( no more step limit ) :
Input syntax convention :
TuringMachine transition_rules
with ' transition_rules ' a list of transition rules as integers .
' n ' is the max number of steps
Input example :
bash $ ./ TuringMachine 1 0 2 1 -1 1 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 1 0

FAQs
Because we do n't want to stifle any unexpected creativity , and because contests with C/C+ + or any other programming language programs as entries are not easy to conduct , an excessive specification of rules has been deliberately avoided .
If as a result the organizers are unclear , do n't hesitate to ask for clarification .
Any possible issue that might be left open will be resolved by the organizers , in consultation with record holders at the time , and based on the merit of the submission and in keeping with the spirit of the contest ( in technical terms ) .
Together with the rules stated on the previous sectionparticipants must adhere to the following technical rules that we have formulated in a question / answer style :
What is this contest for ?
A : On one hand , it would be interesting to know if there can be verydifferent implementation algorithms for a single model of computation or if the model of computation completely determines the implementation algorithm of the actual encoding .
On the other hand , it would be interesting to know whether following other models of computation an implementation can be shortened in terms of program length and what is the one that may allow shortest implementations of a universal machine ( although the question in general is undecidable , actual instances are possible ) .
It would be also interesting to find whether any gained program size reduction is always lost once an interpreter from one model to another is included ( e.g. SK combinators simulating Turing machines ) , and the impact that such a simulation may have in terms of computational time as well .
Having several implementations of a universal machine may provide some empirical results .
Who is allowed to participate ?
A : The contest is open to everybody .
Q : Is the contest constrained to the Turing machine model ?
A : Not at all .
Actually we encourage people to follow other models of computation ( sk combinators , rewriting systems , cellular automata , tag systems , neural networks , register machines , etc. ) and write down the shortest implementation you can come up with and write an encoder / decoder to accept the required ( Turing machine - style ) input syntax and fulfill the required output format of the contest .
Of course that may undermine any possible length reduction ensuing from the chosen model , but that is precisely the issue we want to address .
Is n't it ironic that the function to implement was only primitive recursive ?
A : Yes it was .
Implementations before January the 20th .
2009 are loop programs that always halt .
They are only universal when the step limit , that was required as input by the former rules , is dropped .
To do so , in terms of coding is quite easy since one would just delete the aditional condition for reaching the given maximum of steps .
The possibility of unbounded computation is essential to a universal machine .
One could write a C++ simulator that could simulate any halting program for a suitably big sizeof ( int ) == sizeof ( void *) and corresponding memory .
A nice paper on the complexity of loop programs is [ 82 ] .
For that reason , starting on January the 20th .
2009 we have changed the rules regarding the step limit .
From that day on all submissions are capable of unbounded computation .
See the Rules section with the new input convention or ask the contest organizers if you have any question .
Since the program - size of the implementations that were initially submitted following the old convention ( with a step limit ) would remain very close to the original size if the step limit were dropped , the comparison list of record holders with mixed step limit and non-step limit versions remains still valid but notice that a readme file point out to the place in time when the rule change was made and applied from then on .
Q : Is the contest constrained to ANSI / ISO C ++?
A : Not at all .
Implementations in different programming languages are grouped and ordered by size for publication in this site .
Q : Will only the winning universal machines be published ?
A : No .
We encourage participants to send their universal machine implementations if they consider them interesting enough .
The organizers will then decide whether to publish them in a special section devoted to interesting machines .
For example , machines following different models of computations even if they are not smaller than the previous record holders , machines illustrating encoding / decoding interesting facts such as undermining any gained reduction in length , very efficient or inefficient machines , or machines following a previous model of computation but using a very different and interesting algorithm .
Q : Why 2 - symbol Turing machines ?
A : Since discrete information and any Turing computation can be reduced to a binary language , we have decided to set the number of symbols at 2 for all implementations ( as a hint to shorten the first submission since it is capable of computing with an arbitrary number of symbols ) .
Q : Why the so called busy beaver test ?
A : A busy beaver Turing machine bb(n ) is the most complex halting Turing machine in the class of the n-states Turing machines in terms of behavior since it either writes more non-zero symbols than any other and / or moves more ( in terms of number of steps ) than any other , so that if the machine is capable of simulating the behavior of the busy beavers it is likely to simulate any other machine in the same class .
Among other tests ( such as the running of non-halting Turing machines ) , each submitted entry will be required to compute all known busy beaver Turing machines .
We have chosen this test because we think that :
Conjecture ( Zenil ) : For all n> 2 , bb(n ) the n-state busy beaver Turing machine is a ( weak ) universal Turing machine .
If so , this conjecture characterizes an interesting countable infinite set of universal Turing machines .
Cris Calude [ 6 ] has recently proposed a definition of simplicity in terms of whether ZFC or PA are capable of providing a proof of the universality of a Turing machine , which is an interesting open question related to the possible path to take for proving this particular set of universal Turing machines determined by the behavior , starting from a blank tape , of a Turing machine , and whether they are simple in Calude 's terms .
The busy beaver test also allows us to test the input / output requirement from the rules , also working as a stressing test as well ( because of the traditional complexity in terms of head movement that busy beavers use to exhibit ) .
Q : Why might this be an interesting challenge ?
A : There are several open questions related to the nature of the encoding / decoding process and the notion of universal computation .
One such question is whether an implementation of a universal machine is efficient in terms of its code length compared to the encoding / decoding performance .
The supposition is that a short description is only useful if the string can be reconstructed in a reasonable amount of time .
It could turn out that when a universal machine implementation gets shorter the encoding / decoding of the input / output is longer and harder in terms of computation steps ( time complexity ) , as intuiton would suggest .
However , Neary and Woods [ 78,79 ] proved that some very small ( weak ) universal Turing machines are ' efficient ' ( in polynomial time ) simulators of the tag systems they emule .
In the literature some authors make a technical distinction between machines that start with a blank tape as initial configuration and those that start with a non -blank ( but still simple enough ) initial configuration , such as a periodic background [ 52 ] .
An open question is whether any configuration of one type can be translated into the other via a simple compiler without adding states or symbols , and what the compiler would look like in terms of program - size and time complexity .
Is there an effective and efficient encoding for each non-periodic encoding preserving universality ?
Will the encoding always be more complex if the machine is simpler ?
If so there is a relation to be discovered . ,
If not , it is known that by adding states / symbols a non-blank configuration can become a blank one ( it suffices to use the extra states / symbols to reproduce the original background ) .
However , to our knowledge , the actual relation is currently unknown .
It would be interesting , for instance , to find out if there is a precise polynomial ( or exponential ) trade - off between program - size complexity and computational complexity ( time / space complexity ) relating the encoding / decoding , the number of symbols / states necessary to convert one into another and among different computational formalisms .
One can think about computational complexity ( time / space complexity ) and program - size complexity as two axes , with program - size complexity minimizing along one axis and time / space complexity along the second axis .
Little work has been done on simultaneous minimization and their actual relation , if any .
We think this challenge is a good hands - on chance to think about these issues and hopefully shed some light on them .
Some thoughts about the nature of different initial configurations and the foundations of universal computation at the decidability / universality frontier can be found ( draft and incomplete version ) in this Mathematica notebook or pdf .
Q : What ANSI C/C++ libraries are allowed ?
A : None but ' iostream ' ( arbitrarily chosen after one of the organizers wrote the first record holder to be beaten using ' cout ' ) .
' stdio.h ' will not be allowed since we do n't want to add / subtract whatever the compiled version of one program takes in bits as a consequence of using one or the other .
No other library will be allowed .
Since we are not concerned with program efficiency in terms of memory or programming best practices , the use of memory management ( such as the use of malloc , calloc , realloc and free , included in ' stdlib.h ' ) is optional .
The only command allowed in ' iostream ' is ' cout ' streaming with destination to the screen .
Q : What about using the preprocessor ( # define etc ) ?
A : It is allowed and will count as operational characters like any others .
Q : How many states and symbols should the Turing machine be able to carry out ?
A : Any arbitrary number of states up to that allowed by the variable int ( the actual value depends on the compiler / computer , but we specify a minimum of 16 bits ) .
Q : What runtime lengths should the universal machine implementation be capable of ?
A : The max number of steps must be only restricted to the values of the ' long ' internal variable type handling the machine execution , so any implementation should be able to compute as much as it ( preferably unsigned ) .
The same type constraints apply to the rest of the values [ the number of allowed states ( n ) and all the products in play : 2n ( number of rules ) , 5 * 2n ( the 5 - tuple elements per rule ) , and the total number of machines ( 4n+2 ) ^( 2n ) ] .
Q : What format must the output be in ?
A : A contiguous string of binary digits with the content of the tape after halting , unique symbols if the machine does not halt after t steps , and in either case , the number of steps that the machine went through before halting or reaching the given maximum number of steps .
In general , a rule entering into the halting state should make no movement either to the left or to the right but to stay in the same cell ( indicated by a 0 in the shift rule place ) , otherwise authors would need to manage to print out only what the head actually printed on and no other blank character from the background .
Q : Do explicit zeroes written actively to the tape need to be printed even when they appear left of the leftmost non-zero or right of the rightmost non-zero ?
A : Yes .
In other words , just ' 1 ' instead of ' 01 ' would not be a permissible output if the head actually wrote " 01 " on the tape .
Q : Should the implementation run on the following input ?
./TuringMachine 1 0 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 1
01
2
A : It is not mandatory .
You can assume that the input determines a complete deterministic and consistent ( not ambiguous ) rule table .
If implementations handle these cases gracefuly however , and still behaves as expected for the complete and consistent input case the implementation will be considered valid .
Q : What is the required input for the Turing machine before execution ?
Would this be a valid input ?
./TuringMachine 1 0 2 1 1 2 0 2 1 1
A : No .
It is assumed a complete and consistent rule input .
This Turing machine has 2 symbols and 2 states .
Consequently it is necessary to provide the full transition table of 4 rules in this case ( the halting state ' 0 ' does not require an extrarule definition ) .
In general it is required 2n rules with n the number of states ( halting state not included ) .
Q : Are authors allowed to change their submissions or readme files ?
A : Yes they are as long as they do n't change their position in the winners table .
If the position in the table is changed after a change then it will be considered a new submission .
Of course fixes and improvements to the functionality of their implementations are encouraged but avoid sending changes that are not worth to make .
Changes to the comments or the readme file will not count as an update , but try to make them seldom .
Other considerations :
Restrict your code lines to a maximum length of 80 .
This will help when printing it on paper .
The number and specification of the rules ( and the number of symbols and states ) is constrained by the variable types of the programming language and code itself .
One could use a library for infinite arithmetic precision to get around this issue , such as the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library or GMP , but since it is not the purpose of the contest to actually ( but only potentially ) be able to compute any Turing machine to any runtime , we will only test it up to the allowed values of the specified variable types .
Programs would be disqualified if they :
• dump core or have compiler warnings ( unless you warn us in the ' remark ' header item and it does n't affect the results of the tests we will perform ) .
• wo n't compile under a standard compiler for the chosenlanguage .
• depend on a utility or application .
• abuse the build file to get around the size limit .
• are too similar to previous winners .
• are identical to previous winners or losers .
We suggest that you format your program in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines .
What we have learned so far
We have encouraged the submission of implementations of universal machines written in any language following formalisms other than the Turing machine model , e.g. Cellular Automata , Tag systems or SK combinators .
John Tromp has reasonably pointed out that it's no fun to write a TM simulator in SK combinators because one has to implement natural numbers from scratch .
As long as the input describes a transition table and the number of transitions to iterate , the implementations will be heavily biased toward imperative languages .
It would appear that even when different formalisms of computation reach the same computational power they are highly dependent on the implementation language in which they are written , as long as the input / output format is determined .
It ’s as if it is the formalism thatwould determine the programming paradigm to be followed in order to keep the implementation down to a minimal size .
While a Turing machine formalism seems to be favored when encoded into an imperative programming language , others like SK and Tag systems appear to be better suited for functional programming languages .
But they do n't seem to be readilyly compatible with each other , in the sense that encoding a simulator of one into the other takes as many resources as the original implementation itself .
On the other hand , the formalism of Cellular Automata seems to be equally implementable ( in program - size terms ) in at least these two programming language paradigms , being perhaps midway between the transitional iterative behavior of a Turing machine and the expression re-writing of lists such as Tag systems .
This is something that should be perhaps studied further .
We also did n't quite anticipate that there were going to be some inconsistencies between the program - size complexity evaluated in terms of what we call “ operational characters , ” the program - size complexity obtained after compilation , and the compressed version of the compilation .
However this is not very surprising since both the compiler and the compression algorithm rely on many particularities that becomemore readily evident when very short programs are involved .
Most of the program - size shortenings have involved better memory management ( the use of re-allocation and dynamic memory ) as well as re-use of variables .
However it now seems hard to reduce the number of variables involved to less than the following : the maximum number of steps ( from the input ) ; the content of the tape at any given time ; the machine head pointer ; the tape boundaries ; at least one iterator variable ; a state variable , and a step counter .
This is already very close to the number of variables used in the definition of the Turing machine 5 - tuplet formalism .
No submission has really come up with a very different approach other than sequential improvements to the original code based on the nested cycle ( " do - while " , or " for " ) imposed by the iterative transition table format and characteristic of a Turing machine input / output specification , which at the same time constitutes the operators making the implementations in C++ capable of universal computation .
In other words , this seems to be where the imperative paradigm outperforms any alternative approach , since imperative programming languages reach their Turing - completeness through the power of the cyclic operators .
We are interested in bibliography on this issue , papers proving the Turing completeness of different programming paradigms rather than particular programming languages ( although we are interested in references for the particular languages as well ) .
We also wonder if there is research on the minimal set of operators making a given programming paradigm Turing - complete .
Of course the best way to prove that a programming language is Turing - complete is by programming a Turing machine in that language .
Here is an example of such a work , and we are aware of some other references , but we are also looking for more abstract generalized results on language paradigms and minimal languages .
What makes a programming paradigm Turing - complete ?
I think the answer is quite clear for the imperative paradigm in its quest to achieve unbounded computation through cycles or loops , but perhaps less so for the other cases , although it is clear some of them ( such as Haskell and Prolog ) reach Turing - completeness through recursion .

Long - time Maine medical marijuana and marijuana legalization advocate Donald Christen is innocent of marijuana cultivation and trafficking , a jury found last week as it acquitted him of the charges .
The verdict could have far reaching effects in the state , according to Christen 's lawyer , Walter McKee .
" We had raised the affirmative defense that the marijuana being cultivated or being furnished was medical marijuana , " McKee told the Kennebec Journal after the verdict .
" Don acknowledged that he cultivated marijuana and he acknowledged that he possessed it with the intent to furnish it , but indicated that what he was cultivating and what he had possessed with the intent to furnish was medical marijuana , for one patient in particular . "
The jury 's acquittal came after Justice William Anderson told jurors Christen had met the criteria for medical marijuana under the state statute .
Christen was arrested on the charges in December 2004 when police raided his home , which had served since the previous October as the Medical Marijuana Distribution Center .
He was growing plants for a handful of patients .
Under Maine 's medical marijuana law , there are provisions to protect patients from prosecution , but none for allowing them to obtain their medicine .
Christen filled that gap , and now he has broken new ground with his acquittal .
This is just the latest poke in the eye of Maine authorities from Christen .
The veteran gadfly has bedeviled police and politicos in the state for more than a decade as founder of the legalization group Maine Vocals and organizer of the annual Maine Hempstock celebration .
Do n't count on him to rest on his laurels now .

Glaciologists have long agreed that many of the first visible signs of global warming would appear in Earth ’s frozen regions .
This knowledge has focused attention on the polar regions and how they might change in the near future .
To understand how the physical and ecological conditions at high latitudes might change , scientists must understand how the current conditions developed .
Detailed records of climate change over the past few million years , however , are sparse , in part because the landscape has been repeatedly scoured by massive ice sheets .
One area that offers a glimpse into the Arctic ’s distant past is the lake bed below Lake El’gygytgyn .
Lying some 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Russia , Lake El’gygytgyn rests inside an impact crater .
The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite took this picture of the crater and its surroundings on August 18 , 2008 .
In this false - color image , red indicates vegetation , gray - brown indicates bare land , and deep blue indicates water .
The vegetation is Arctic tundra , with low - lying plants that have short growing seasons .
A network of naked ridges and vegetated valleys surround the crater lake , and just one river exits the lake , the Enmyvaam ( or Enmivaam ) River .
The El’gygytgyn crater results from a 3.6 - million - year - old meteorite impact .
About 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) across , the crater is surrounded by an uplifted ridge some 18 kilometers ( 11 miles ) across .
Outside the crater , the land slopes gently , but inside the crater , walls descend steeply to a fairly flat - bottomed bowl , now filled by Lake El’gygytgyn .
Because the meteorite impact occurred in a region of the Arctic that escaped widespread glaciation during the Pleistocene Ice Age , the rocks in this area survived intact .
As a result , the lake bed sediments contain a continuous record of past Arctic conditions , all the way back to the meteorite impact , making them extremely valuable to paleoclimate researchers .
By examining chemical compositions of cores extracted from lake bed sediments , scientists can piece together past climatic conditions of a given region .
In November 2008 , a drilling project began at Lake El’gygytgyn , and drilling was expected to continue through the spring of 2009 .
The project ’s ultimate goal was to use the lake bed cores to assemble the longest continuous record of climate change in the terrestrial Arctic and to compare that record to records extracted from lower latitudes .

Back at Comic Con in 2008 Ralph Bakshi gave an amazing interview on how to survive in tough times .
As a creative working person this inspires me a great deal , so I ’d like to share some of my take away points from Bakshi ’s insights .
But first you have to understand something about Ralph Bakshi :
He started his career in the 60s after Disney had passed in both the physical and creative sense .
The 30s and 40s were a golden age for theatrical animation , and in the 50s television killed all of that .
Also Alfred Hitchcock killed the theatrical short by insisting that there be no cartoons before his film Psycho — the result killed an already pressured animation industry .
By the 60s opportunities looked bleak — the field was already packed with established artists who had payed their dues , and the big companies were in decline .
Ralph Bakshi ’s solution was brilliant : Instead of dreaming of the past he made his own films that were aimed at adults ( example : Fritz the Cat ) .
By doing this Bakshi created a career that lasted into the early 90s while Disney almost went under in the early 80s .
So here ’s what I ’ve learned from Bakshi :
• Tough Times are a Chance to Reinvent an Industry
• Do n’t Work for the Big Studios , Work For Yourself
• Technology Allows You To Take on the Big Guys
• Develop New Markets for Your Work
• Creatively Zig When Everyone is Still Zagging
• What ’s Been Successful For Years Can Become Stale
And here ’s the video for your inspiration :
By the way it should be noted that the animation industry itself hit a high point during the great depression .
In the early days of the 20s the industry was crowded with many startup studios , but the 30s thinned the heard and forced the survivors to innovate .
It ’s out of this period that we see Snow White which was the first full length feature animated film — in a sense Disney reinvented the medium .
What ’s interesting is that Bakshi sort of acknowledges this when he ’s putting down the Disney shorts of the early 30s which were quite dull ( Mickey was a much more fun character in his black and white films ) .

Today we 're going to sail the oceans blue , through the wind and spray , at least until we become mired in two remote wastelands said to be the bane of mariners :
The Sargasso Sea in the middle of the Atlantic , and its companion on the other side of the globe , the Pacific Trash Vortex .
Both areas are encircled by swirling ocean currents , and are said to collect their debris in the center .
Both are the subject of tall tales .
Both are ripe for skeptical inquiry .
The Sargasso Sea
Let 's start in the Atlantic .
The Sargasso Sea is actually a named sea , and it's the only one in the world with no shorelines , being completely enclosed within the North Atlantic Ocean .
It 's a 2,000,000 square mile oblong oval stretching across the Atlantic , centered on about 30 °N latitude , bounded by major clockwise ocean currents .
It 's best known in stories for being a dense mat of solid seaweed , a tangled mass that no ship can penetrate .
You hear tell of ancient mariners finding abandoned wrecks trapped , or starving crews who tried to walk out .
Most famously , Christopher Columbus wrote about the Sargasso Sea in his log .
Upon encountering the seaweed , he thought he must be near land , but when no land appeared after days of sailing his crew almost mutineed .
Jules Verne 's Nautilus visited the Sargasso in his novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea :
Such was the region the Nautilus was now visiting , a perfect meadow , a close carpet of seaweed , fucus , and tropical berries , so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly tear its way through it .
And Captain Nemo , not wishing to entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass , kept some yards beneath the surface of the waves .
The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word " sargazzo " which signifies kelp .
This kelp , or berry - plant , is the principal formation of this immense bank ...
Above us floated products of all kinds , heaped up among these brownish plants ; trunks of trees torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains , and floated by the Amazon or the Mississippi ; numerous wrecks , remains of keels , or ships ' bottoms , side - planks stove in , and so weighted with shells and barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface .
In 1910 , the steamer Michael Sars took a party of scientists out to study the Sargasso Sea for three months , and their report was among the first that debunked these legends .
They found the patches of seaweed to be small and sparse , rarely larger than a doormat , and in no way a hazard to navigation .
They also found the waters of the Sargasso Sea to be warmer , clearer , bluer , and with less oxygen than the surrounding Atlantic .
For this reason they declared the Sargasso Sea to be a type of desert , largely bereft of sealife .
This notion was challenged in 2007 when research published in the journal Science found that phytoplankton blooms were the reason for the decreased oxygen .
The rotation of the huge eddy draws up salty , nutrient rich water from the ocean floor , enriching the sunlit upper layers of water , and kick - starting an unusually active ecosystem .
Thus the Sargasso " desert " is actually quite the opposite , and the relative proliferation of sargassum seaweed is due to nutrient rich growing conditions , not vortex suction action .
What of the tall tales of ships becoming trapped , and stranded sailors dying ?
It so happens that the Sargasso Sea is a convergence of several conditions , not just the nutrients from the deep , but also weather conditions at its latitude .
30 -35° latitude , both North and South , is the location of the subtropical ridge between the trade winds .
Conditions here are variable winds and low precipitation .
Sailors call it the doldrums .
Sailing vessels entering the Sargasso Sea are virtually certain to come to a grinding halt in a dead calm .
Throw in some strange seaweed and we have all the ingredients for a nautical epic .
The Pacific Garbage Patch
But if we spin the globe and look at the center of the North Pacific Ocean , we see a phenomenon that is due to vortex suction — the Pacific Trash Vortex , also called the Pacific Garbage Patch .
One guy emailed me that he'd looked for it on Google Earth ; he'd heard there was a giant island of solid floating garbage twice the size of Texas in the middle of the Pacific Ocean .
The North Pacific Gyre is a clockwise rotation of ocean currents in the North Pacific .
Wind and currents combine to drive floating matter toward its center .
You might have heard of the Pacific Garbage Patch before , and are probably just now wondering why you 've never seen any photographs of a giant island of trash .
In fact , Hawaii is right in the center of the Gyre , and if there were a Pacific Garbage Patch , Hawaii would be in its exact center .
The answer is simple :
No such floating island of trash exists .
Despite the fact that there is a huge amount of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean , and despite the fact that the Gyre does drive it all toward the center , there is no floating island .
How do we corroborate these two seemingly mutually exclusive facts ?
One proposed explanation , put forward in a map created by Greenpeace , shows the garbage patch as two separate patches on either side of Hawaii , both well clear of it ; thus nobody ever sees them .
The map also gets East and West reversed , and is dramatically wrong in its depiction of ocean currents , splitting the North Pacific into two counterrotating swirls , instead of one big one like it actually is .
So let 's set aside Greenpeace 's claim for the moment , and go back to the origin of the story .
In 1988 , Robert Day , David Shaw , and Steven Ignell submitted a report to NOAA ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) detailing the results of four years of sample collection and analysis of plastic fragments found floating in the Pacific Ocean .
They found concentrations highest in the North Pacific Gyre .
The authors cited wind and currents as the primary force driving the higher concentrations to the center of the Gyre.
Concentrations of what ?
Number one , monofilament fishing line fragments ; and number two , something called neuston plastic .
Neuston plastic refers to particles that have been broken down to a small size and are now floating just at or below the surface of the water .
Most plastic floating in the open ocean degrades quite quickly , due primarily to ultraviolet radiation .
It becomes brittle and crumbles .
When it reaches microscopic size , it competes with phytoplankton as a food source for zooplankton , and enters the food chain .
That 's not good for anyone .
The authors used 203 sample stations , each about 450 square meters in size .
52.2 % of these contained plastic fragments .
Got that ?
Only half of NOAA 's football - field sized sample areas , in the center of the densest part of the Pacific " Garbage Patch " , contain even detectable levels of microscopic plastic .
Unacceptable to be sure ; but hardly a solid island .
The reason is that getting to the center of the Gyre takes more than enough time for plastic to break down .
Oceanographer and sailor Charles Moore estimates that garbage from Asia takes about one year to reach the Gyre , and about five years from the United States .
Moore is largely responsible for bringing the issue into the public eye .
Upon his return voyage from the 1997 Transpac ocean race from California to Hawaii , he wrote :
There were shampoo caps and soap bottles and plastic bags and fishing floats as far as I could see .
Here I was in the middle of the ocean , and there was nowhere I could go to avoid the plastic .
Although Moore is doing important work , some of his more overly dramatic descriptions like this one have helped to launch the popular belief in Texas sized garbage patches .
Bringing attention to the issue is good ; presenting an overdramatized representation of the facts to do so , not so much .
Now , I 'm not here to defend the dumping of trash at sea , which is the default criticism I 'm going to receive for pointing out that there is no Texas - sized island of trash surrounding Hawaii .
I remember once while sailing from Newport Beach to Cabo San Lucas , about 100 miles offshore we crossed the path of a cruise ship that had passed in the night .
It actually left a visible path : mainly an oil slick , dotted with party balloons , plastic cups , and other junk .
Very nice .
I also remember the first time I saw a garbage scow being towed out to sea , loaded with an acre of trash , to be dumped .
I grabbed a marine chart and saw there was actually a marked area offshore designated for such dumping .
I could n't believe it .
So while I do have opinions on the subject , on Skeptoid we focus on the truth of the stories about huge islands of trash floating in the middle of the Pacific .
And the truth is there is n't one .

Divorce lawyers and the courts are seeing a surge – expected to become a " flood " – of requests from men seeking to slash their support payments to their ex-wives and children , citing job losses or drastic drops in bonuses , salaries and stocks .
At the same time , many couples who had hoped to move on with their lives are finding themselves in a hellish kind of legal and emotional limbo – unable to sell their homes and cash out .
" People always ask , ` Do couples separate more in good times than in bad times ? ' " says Philip Epstein , a veteran divorce lawyer .
" Normally , the answer is that they separate in both .
" No one 's ever asked the question , ` Do they separate in cataclysmic times ? ' "
Especially devastated have been men who separated last summer and are now finding themselves essentially forced , by law , to hand over a share of assets to their ex-wives wildly out of whack with their current value , leaving some of them virtually bankrupt .
Just this week , family law lawyer Martha McCarthy finalized a settlement for a couple in which the husband , a high - paid executive , had opted last August to hang on to $ 1 million in stocks and options .
This week he should have , under law , written a $ 500,000 cheque to his ex-wife – half their value as required under Ontario 's Family Law Act – but , since they 've now plummeted to just $ 300,000 she agreed to be " generous " and accept less .
Many ex-wives have n't .
" Those are the people who are most bitter .
They gave away half of everything and , 15 minutes later , the half they kept was worth half , or even less .
Their deals are done , inked , cheques written , " says McCarthy .
Divorce experts – not to mention people simply trying to get out of loveless marriages and on to new lives – are finding themselves so " paralyzed " by all the uncertainty , many lawyers are n't even bothering to have houses appraised , says McCarthy , a $ 500 process that 's been considered critical in assessing a couple 's worth .
" Why would we bother ?
Nobody knows what their houses are worth right now , " she says , adding that she 's not seen this kind of " uncertainty " in 19 years as a family law lawyer , including the 1991 recession .
Instead , both sides are trying to reach a consensus on house values , " and where it might go , " she says .
" Everyone " is awaiting the outcome of what McCarthy calls a " watershed " appeal , Serra v. Serra , that divorce lawyers are hoping will set some new rules for how couples split assets that have been decimated by factors beyond their control .
Ironically , Serra is a bitter and acrimonious divorce case that predates the recent downturn .
Husband Harold Serra has told the court he can't afford to pay his wife the $ 4.1 million she 's technically owed under the law because , since their 2000 split , his Ajax - based textile company has been hard hit by competition from China that 's left Canadian textile businesses " on the verge of extinction . "
His ex-wife , Barbara , has accused him of " creative accounting " and has refused to sell their Florida condo , which was worth more than $ 2 million U.S. before the housing collapse .
Lawyers are expecting to see a decision from the Ontario Court of Appeal soon , but no matter which way it goes , the case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada , leaving divorcing couples , their lawyers and the courts struggling for two more years to come up with decisions getting them out of failed marriages – with their rightful share of assets – in the midst of the most debilitating financial meltdown since the Depression .
A complicating factor during this unusually severe and rapid downturn , family law lawyers say , has been Ontario 's Family Law Act .
That act was introduced in 1986 and set a strict date for a divorcing couple to assess their worth – V - day or valuation date – the day of separation .
Family law lawyers have been sickened to see even the most civil of couples who separated in 2007 or early 2008 – who 've moved as quickly as possible with lawyers , financial advisers and even family counsellors to finalize a settlement that best protects their children – hard hit by tanking stocks , RRSPs , pension plans and house values even as they talked .
Settlements have proven to be particularly tricky in some acrimonious cases where the husband has been forced to " look to his wife to be fair and reasonable , " says family law lawyer Avra Rosen .
" In law , she does n't have to be because she could say , `Look , we separated in '07 .
You had a year and a half to be a nice guy and pay me what I was owed and you chose not to .
So now , because you 've been dragging your heels and we 're fighting about the kids , you want me to be nice ?
Forget it .'
" That 's already happening out there . "
Other lawyers , such as Judith Huddart , has had eight recent cases where ex-wives have agreed voluntarily to ignore the V - day provisions of the act and divide assets based on their current value , so as not to bankrupt their husbands and further harm their children .
But more women have been calling their lawyers in a panic the last few weeks , saying that their husbands – from Bay St. brokers to Big Three assembly - line workers – are talking about having to reduce , or even stop paying , support in light of bonus and salary cuts , or layoffs .
In fact , requests for cuts in payments now outstrip the more usual requests to increase payments filed the last few weeks in the Ontario Superior Court , says Epstein , who sits on a panel of senior family law lawyers who review such applications to vary support payments .

Other couples are finding themselves unable to sell their biggest asset – their home .
All the economic uncertainty is forcing lawyers to look at more " open- ended " divorce settlements that can be revisited in months – or years – as things stabilize , says Huddart , who helps couples settle through collaboration .
" I 'm looking forward to seeing more creative solutions ( especially among divorcing couples forced , by economics , to co-habit indefinitely ) .
Somebody who 's already found a new person might be anxious to move , but I hope that new person has a house ... because ( in some cases ) it ain't going to happen any other way .
I think part of our job as lawyers is to help our clients manage their expectations . "

Mr. Crafton , 41 , who became fluent in Japanese after serving in the Navy in Japan in the 1990s , said he also believed that encouraging immigrants to learn English would help them assimilate .
Jonathan Z. Crisp , a former chairman of the county Republican Party and a supporter of the proposal , said : “ Our opponents talk about Nashville being the ‘ Athens of the South . ’
But if you go to the other Athens , in Greece , all of the government workers are speaking Greek . ”
Thirty states , including Tennessee , and at least 19 cities have declared English the official language , according to Rob Toonkel , a spokesman for the U.S. English Foundation , which advocates such policies .
But most of the cities are small , places like Hazelton , Pa. , and Culpeper , Va .
In Nashville , which has a population of about 600,000 , two factors have been driving interest in Mr. Crafton ’s proposal : the booming immigrant population and the faltering economy .
In the 1990s , the number of immigrants in Nashville tripled , according to government estimates , and more than 10 percent of residents were born outside the country .
But over the past year , as the state unemployment rate rose to 6.9 percent from 5 percent , experts say , immigrants came under greater criticism .
“ While the immigrant population burgeoned , there was very little organized anti-immigrant attitude , ” said Daniel B. Cornfield , a sociology professor at Vanderbilt University .
“ But the anti-immigrant sentiment seemed to mobilize as the economy slowed down . ”
Steinway Installing World 's Largest Solar Cooling System
January 26th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Steinway &
Sons recently announced that it is installing the world ’s largest solar - powered rooftop system to dehumidify its factory and protect the pricey pianos inside .
A grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority helped fund the $ 875,000 system , which is a beta site for the tri-state area .
Steinway ’s system pumps solar - heated water into an 80 ton double - effect absorption chiller that acts as a heat exchanger .
The chiller removes the heated water , and cool air is left for dehumidifying .
In the winter , steam from the system will be used to heat the factory .
If you want to get a firsthand look at the solar cooling system , it will be finished next spring at Steinway ’s Queens , NY headquarters .

The rise of a space elevator could throw its spacecraft “ passengers ” tens of kilometres off course ( Illustration : Pat Rawling / Liftport )
The simple act of climbing could throw space elevators off track and potentially into harm ’s way , a new study suggests .
Fixing the problem could require agonisingly slow trips lasting nearly a month or the careful choreography of multiple climbers .
Space elevators have been proposed as a cheap alternative to expensive rocket launches to send cargo , and perhaps even humans , into space .
The elevators would be made of a cable ( also called a tether or ribbon ) that would be anchored to the Earth ’s surface and balanced by a counter - weight in space .
Lasers on Earth would beam power to “ climbers ” that would crawl up the tether with their cargo .
But the concept has been stuck on the ground floor for decades , not least because current materials are not strong enough to handle the strain on the tether .
Carbon nanotubes may work , but they need to be longer and purer than those manufactured today .
Advertisement
Even with adequate materials , space elevators might be highly unstable .
Gravitational tugs from the Moon and Sun , as well as pressure from gusts of solar wind , could shake the tether , potentially causing the elevator to crash into nearby satellites or space junk .
Thrusters might be needed to keep the tether in line .
Now , it seems that the act of climbing itself could also cause the tether to wobble .
Earth ’s spin
The culprit is the Coriolis force , which deflects objects that are moving in a rotating system .
On Earth , the planet ’s rotation sets up a Coriolis force that deflects air currents and water .
In this study , the space elevator would stand vertically from a point on Earth ’s equator .
As the climber ascended , its motion would cause the Coriolis force to pull the climber , and thus the cable , in the opposite direction of Earth ’s rotation .
This would pull the elevator away from its vertical resting position , causing it to oscillate back and forth like a pendulum , say mechanical engineers Arun Misra of McGill University in Montreal , Canada , and Stephen Cohen , now at MDA Space .
Wrong orbits
The motion of cargo up the elevator might only cause the cable to wobble back and forth by a fraction of a degree , says Misra .
But the tether ’s swing could either boost or reduce the velocity of any spacecraft exiting the elevator .
That could send them into orbits that are tens of kilometres too high or too low , Misra says , adding that significant amounts of fuel might be needed to correct the problem .
“ Because it ’s a huge structure , this small deviation can make large errors in the orbit that will be reached by the payload , ” Misra told New Scientist .
The wobbles induced by climbing cargo might also help send the elevator into harm ’s way .
Slow crawl
The faster a climber goes , the larger the effect , Misra told New Scientist , so the simplest way to minimise a climber ’s effect on the cable is to slow its ascent .
Slowing the climb would allow the space elevator to be drawn back to its stable point , perfectly vertical above the Earth ’s equator .
But this could also make trips into orbit agonisingly slow , adding nine days or more to a climb that – at several hundred kilometres per hour – might already take about 15 days .
Alternatively , the speed of climbs might be fine - tuned as the trip progresses , Misra says .
Multiple climbers could also be sent up the tether at the same time , in a carefully orchestrated ballet .
“ I think we are finding that building a space elevator is a lot more complicated than simply stringing up a ribbon and whizzing up and down it , ” says Anders Jorgensen of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro , US , who has studied space elevator stability .
Speed limit
“ Needing to impose a particular climber schedule and speed could have implications for the economical viability of a space elevator , so it is a very important question to answer , ” Jorgensen says .
“ Traffic - phasing will likely play a role , ” agrees David Lang , a consultant based in Seattle , Washington , who has also studied the effects of climbers .
But other methods , involving coupled space elevators arranged side by side or one - way traffic that occasionally reverses direction , might also help .
“ I would say that it is too early to establish the best way to do this , ” Lang told New Scientist .

Dissent Over Descent : Intelligent Design 's Challenge to Darwinism by Steve Fuller ( Icon , £ 12.99 )
Christian creationists in the US have cooked up the name " Intelligent Design " for their theology in order to try to smuggle it into school biology lessons , because they fear that evolutionary theory harms the moral fabric of society .
They were humiliated in a 2005 trial , in which parents successfully prevented the Dover school board from mandating the use of their creationist textbook .
UK - based sociologist Steve Fuller appeared as a witness for the creationists at that trial , embarrassing many of his colleagues in the field of " science and technology studies " .
His amazingly bad new book is not likely to reassure them .
Once upon a time , Fuller points out , most science was inspired by the possibility of understanding God 's creation .
That is true , but it does not mean , as Fuller pretends , that contemporary " ID " is an alternative method of doing science : its remit is strictly anti-science , cynically positing a " God of the gaps " for political reasons .
For his part , Fuller happily adopts ID 's rhetorical tactics : speaking of biologists ' " faith " ; forgetting to mention ( or merely being ignorant of ) the wealth of evidence for evolution in modern biology that was n't available to Darwin himself ; and even muttering about the " vicissitudes " of fossil - dating , thus generously holding the door open for young - Earth creationists , too .
The book is an epoch - hopping parade of straw men , incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish , as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to " action at a distance " , except that the distance is in time rather than space .
It 's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name .
A Million Words and Counting : How Global English Is Rewriting the World by Paul JJ Payack ( Citadel Press , £ 11.99 )
After the peculiarly triumphalist introduction about how more and more people are speaking English , which is more word - crammed than ever , this book devolves into one of those jokey surveys of modern corporate , computer and political vocabularies .
The author has a bee in his bonnet about what he calls " the Political Correctness movement " , but happily is n't quite so bothered about being Linguistically Correct .
We are told that " nappy - headed " is British slang for " childish thinking " , though it is a derogatory US term for African - Americans that dates back to 1896 .
Meanwhile , to " get up one 's nose " is described as " Global Youthspeak " , even though it was already recorded by Eric Partridge in 1951 .
Payack rarely misses an opportunity to plug his own website , the grandiosely named " Global Language Monitor " , but on this showing the OED wo n't exactly be quaking in its boots .

The House Appropriations Committee released their initial version of the $ 825 billion stimulus package , and not surprisingly it contains no money for food banks , which have seen a doubling of demand in the past 6 months .
Vicki Escarra , president and chief executive officer of Feeding America , a network of 205 food banks said , “ This package contains many positive provisions that will help our economy begin to recover , but the House Committee must keep in mind that food banks nationwide are reporting a 30 percent increase , on average , in the number of people turning to them to help put food on their table .
Many of the people we see are recently unemployed and do not currently qualify for food stamps , or are waiting for benefits to be approved ” ( Story continues below ) .
Escarra said that if the government can afford $ 300 billion for banks , it can afford $ 300 million for food banks , “ We are heartened by President - elect Obama ’s longtime commitment to fighting hunger in America , and his renewed sense of commitment in his pledge to end child hunger by 2015 .
The Economic Recovery legislation is the first opportunity for a new President and new Congress to make progress toward eliminating hunger .
If we can afford more than $ 300 billion to bail out banks , surely we can afford $ 300 million to help our food banks . ”

It is beyond comprehension that the government would use taxpayer money to help Bank of America , which ironically is not even based in America , but ignores the need for food , by the poor and newly unemployed .
The newly unemployed rarely have savings , and it can take weeks to qualify for food stamps , so in many have to rely on food banks and pantries .
Instead of spending more money for DTV converter cards , Congress should be directing that money towards actually helping people who have lost their jobs due to this recession eat .
I would rather spend $ 300 million than $ 20 billion any day .
This is another example of the misplaced priorities of our government .
A space elevator would extend 22,000 miles above the Earth to a station , and then another 40,000 miles to a weighted structure for stability .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists from Cambridge University have developed a light , flexible , and strong type of carbon nanotube material that may bring space elevators closer to reality .
Motivated by a $ 4 million prize from NASA , the scientists found a way to combine multiple separate nanotubes together to form long strands .
Until now , carbon nanotubes have been too brittle to be formed into such long pieces .
And a space elevator - if it ever becomes reality - will be quite long .
NASA needs about 144,000 miles of nanotube to build one .
In theory , a cable would extend 22,000 miles above the Earth to a station , which is the distance at which satellites remain in geostationary orbit .
Due to the competing forces of the Earth 's gravity and outward centrifugal pull , the elevator station would remain at that distance like a satellite .
Then the cable would extend another 40,000 miles into space to a weighted structure for stability .
An elevator car would be attached to the nanotube cable and powered into space along the track .
NASA and its partner , the Spaceward Foundation , hope that a space elevator could serve as a cost - effective and relatively clean mode of space transportation .
NASA 's current shuttle fleet is set to retire in 2010 , and the organization does n't have enough funds to replace it until 2014 at the earliest .
To fill the gap , NASA is hiring out shuttles to provide transportation to the International Space Station from private companies .
So NASA could use a space elevator , the sooner the better .
Space elevators could lift material at just one - fifth the cost of a rocket , since most of a rocket 's energy is used simply to escape Earth 's gravity .
Not only could a space elevator offer research expeditions for astronauts , the technology could also expand the possibilities for space tourism and even space colonization .
Currently , the Cambridge team can make about 1 gram of the new carbon material per day , which can stretch to 18 miles in length .
Alan Windle , professor of materials science at Cambridge , says that industrial - level production would be required to manufacture NASA 's request for 144,000 miles of nanotube .
Nevertheless , the web - like nanotube material is promising .
" The key thing is that the process essentially makes carbon into smoke , but because the smoke particles are long thin nanotubes , they entangle and hold hands , " Windle said .
" We are actually making elastic smoke , which we can then wind up into a fiber . "
Windle and his colleagues presented their results last month at a conference in Luxembourg , which attracted hundreds of attendees from groups such as NASA and the European Space Agency .
John Winter of EuroSpaceward , which organized the conference , thought the new material was a significant step .
" The biggest problem has always been finding a material that is strong enough and lightweight enough to stretch tens of thousands of miles into space , " said Winter .
" This is n't going to happen probably for the next decade at least , but in theory this is now possible .
The advances in materials for the tether are very exciting . "

Velato is an esoteric programming language by User : Rottytooth , which uses MIDI files as source code .
Programs in Velato are defined by the pitch and order of notes .
Velato is intended to allow for flexibility in composition , so functional programs will not necessarily sound like random notes .
There is a tendency for Velato programs to have jazz - like harmonies .
Language overview
The first note sounded in a Velato program is the " command root " note .
All intervals are read from this note until a new command root is established .
The command root can be changed between statements , to allow for more musical ( or at least less repetitive ) progressions .
Notes played as chords are interpreted in the order the notes appear within the MIDI track , regardless of a zero duration between them .
Commands
Command Intervals differentiate between major and minor intervals .
Fourths and fifths are always perfect .
Depending on the compiler used , other intervals return syntax errors or are ignored .
Command Second note
Third note Followed by / Notes Change Root Note Major 2nd New root note Let ( assignment ) Minor 3rd Variable as single note , then expression Declare variable Minor 6th Variable as single note , then type Blocks Major 3rd While Major 3rd Expression End While Perfect 4th If Perfect 5th Expression Else Major 6th End If Major 7th Special Commands Major 6th Print to screen Perfect 5th Expression to print Input Major 6th Variable to store string
Commands can be followed by any number of expressions .
Notes used for expressions do n't differentiate between major / minor or perfect / diminished .
To avoid ambiguity , no augmented intervals can be used .
So a tritone is always interpreted as a diminished 5th , not an augmented 4th .
Expression First note Second note
Third note Followed by / Notes value 3rd variable 2nd Name of variable ( single note ) pos. (+ ) int 5th

He was already a show business veteran who had worked as an actor and stuntman in movies , TV shows and on the vaudeville stage when he was tapped by Lost In Space creator Irwin Allen to play the Robinson family 's loyal metal sidekick in the hit series that debuted in 1965 .
She has n't quite expanded her family to 101 , but Button has still produced a pretty impressive number of little dalmatians .
The three - year - old dog has given birth to a litter of 18 , just a year after having 16 pups .
Her litter is thought to be the largest born to a dalmatian in the UK .
The average is about eight or nine .
Button 's bumper litter :
Her 18 pups jostle for a feed
Button 's father was in the Disney film 102 Dalmatians and the acting talent appears to run in the family .
Two of the pups from her first set already have TV contracts , with one appearing in Taggart .
For the moment , though , all Button 's time is taken up with the 18 newborns .
Her total brood is now 34 .
There are so many pups she needs the assistance of owners Adam and Nicola Morley , and their three sons , to feed them .
Button and the Morleys work in shifts 24 - hours a day : Button feeds one group of pups , while the family feeds the other two , then an hour later they swap .
Button 's litter is the largest ever born to a dalmatian in Britain and she has now had 34 pups
' We 're bottle feeding them and it 's very tiring , especially as I have to work , but it's also very nice , ' said Mrs Morley , 31 .
' We thought she would have a standard size litter of eight or nine but we had a scan at the vets the day before and they said there were too many to count .
' We were shocked when 18 were born and they were all alive and healthy . '
Mr Morley , 40 , added : ' We feed all the pups several times a day because Button can't feed them all constantly .
We all take it in turns - mine 's at 3 o'clock in the morning . '
Give us a lift :
One of the pups hitches a ride on the head of Thomas Morley , 7 , while a sibling looks on and , right , he comes nose to nose with one of the 18 - strong litter
Each pup weighed about 2lb when they were born by Cesarean section at the Chine House Veterinary Hospital in Sileby .
Veterinarian Con Hassett , who performed the operation , said : ' I delivered all 18 puppies in about nine to 12 minutes as the surgery itself is reasonably straightforward , but it 's the aftercare that 's harder .
We had to have five or six nurses there to revive and tend to the puppies afterwards . '
' I never heard of any breed of dog giving birth to 18 .
The real miracle is that they 've survived this long because it 's so hard to rear that many pups . '
British Dalmatian Club chairman Pat Wilson added a litter of 18 was very rare .
' I bred Dalmatians for 25 years and my largest litter ever was 11 , ' she said .
Despite the round - the - clock care , the Morleys , from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire , wo n't have to keep it up for long as they only plan to keep one puppy .
The rest will be sold or give to family and friends who had dalmatians from the previous litter .
' We will have to sell some as the cost of looking after the pups is astronomical , ' said Mrs Morley .

For nearly 15 years , the world watched with a mixture of fascination and awe as Ireland transformed itself from one of Europe 's poorest countries into one of its wealthiest , earning itself the nickname the Celtic Tiger .
But the roar of yesteryear has turned to a whimper as the economy has been poleaxed by the global slump and a housing crash that has been worse than Britain's .
Prices are down 30 % , compared with around 16 % in the UK .
So bad have things become that the Republic 's third largest lender , Anglo Irish Bank , was nationalised last Thursday amid a crisis of confidence that saw large - scale depositor withdrawals .
A day earlier , in an atmosphere described as febrile by analysts , the Irish government was forced to deny that it was seeking emergency help from the International Monetary Fund .
The deepening crisis in Ireland is underlined by the jobless numbers : unemployment is forecast to hit 400,000 , or 11 % of Ireland 's four - million population , by the end of 2009 .
Everywhere , the trappings of wealth and confidence are beginning to fade : Dublin airport used to be littered with private jets and luxury cars outside the terminal , but there are fewer nowadays as the country edges towards a new era of austerity .
At the Curragh racecourse , costly expansion has been put on hold to conserve cash , while from Limerick in the south - west , to Louth in the north - east , businesses are shedding labour and , in some cases , going into liquidation .
The rot has set in remarkably quickly : it is hard to believe that unemployment was just 4 % at the end of 2007 , or that GDP growth could plunge to minus 4 % in 2009 against growth of 6 % two years ago .
" We are facing extreme short - term difficulties , " says Rossa White , chief economist of Davy , the Irish stockbroker .
Last week , John Browett , chief executive of electrical goods retailing giant DSG , said that while the British recession was following past norms , the situation was " more serious " in Ireland .
Experts say that the severity of the Irish downturn is partly explained by the uncomfortable truth that the boom in housing and financial services ( similar to what happened in Britain ) has masked a number of underlying " structural " problems .
Fergal O'Brien , senior economist at the Irish Business and Employers Federation , says that wage inflation has been running out of control and today stands at 20 % above the European norm .
" Our wage costs have doubled in the last four or five years ; that means we have lost our historic , competitive advantage and it will be a long , slow and painful process to restore it , " says O'Brien .
For evidence of the consequences of wage inflation , look no further than Dell , the US computer company , which earlier this month announced that it was axing nearly half its 4,300 - strong workforce and shifting its manufacturing operations from Ireland to Poland as part of a cost - cutting drive .
The entire Irish production of laptops and desktop computers are being moved to Lodz , Poland 's third largest city , where labour costs are two - thirds lower than in Ireland .
Dell is not a two - bit player : it 's Ireland 's second - largest private sector employer , the country 's biggest exporter and in recent years has contributed around 5 % to GDP .
The sting in the tail was that in the past , Polish workers have flocked to Dell 's Limerick factory for work and training .
" Now they are taking our jobs , " was a predictable response in some quarters , reflecting anxiety that a steep rise in domestic unemployment could lead to social tensions .
Ireland has been hit on another front : currency .
The euro ( which Ireland joined in 1999 ) has remained relatively strong against a plummeting British pound ( 25 % of all Irish exports are to the UK ) and a weakened dollar .
The decline against sterling has had unforeseen consequences with Irish shoppers flocking to Northern Ireland in search of bargains .
O'Brien estimates that " cross - border trade now accounts for between 2 % and 3 % of Irish consumer spending " .
Newry Chamber of Commerce in Northern Ireland estimated that over Christmas at least 40 % of its customers crossed the border to shop in its main retail centres - the Buttercrane and the Quays .
The exodus prompted Ireland 's finance minister , Brian Lenihan , to appeal to shoppers ' " patriotism " .
But the call was largely ignored .
Jane Smith from Kilbarrack , a north Dublin suburb , who recently returned from a shopping spree in the north , said : " I probably paid 20 % less there than I would have done in Dublin .
Cleaning products , babywipes , headache tablets are all cheaper . "
More importantly , Irish exporters cannot compete with their British counterparts , who have seen the pound devalued against the euro by 25 % in the past year .
O'Brien says that export trade is critical for the Irish economy as " 80 % of what we produce here is sold abroad " .
The question that many people ask in the republic is whether the country can return to the halcyon days between 1994 and 2007 when GDP growth regularly touched an astonishing 10 % a year .
Alan McQuaid , chief economist at Bloxham stockbrokers says " almost certainly not " as Ireland in the 1980s had a lot of catching up to do .
" But we have a young , English - speaking and highly educated workforce and as long as we tackle our problems , there is no reason to suppose that we could n't record 2 % or 3 % GDP growth annually . "
Already Ireland is taking action to point the country in a direction that could herald a recovery in two or three years ' time .
Private companies are asking their employees to take a pay cut in view of harsh economic conditions .
The upshot , if the medicine is more generally administered , will be to make Ireland more competitive , not only with western Europe , but with eastern and central Europe too .
One company that is applying the knife to pay is Independent News & Media , where the tycoon Tony O'Reilly has called on staff at his Irish operations to accept pay cuts of up to 10 % , with employees on high salaries asked to make bigger sacrifices than those further down the pay scale .
Elsewhere , the Irish construction industry is seeking to impose a 10 % pay cut on more than 200,000 workers , telling unions that it 's the only way to save jobs .
Just as pressing is a need to cut pay in the public sector to plug a hole in government finances that analysts fear could hit £ 14bn in two years .
As government and unions draw battle lines for the struggle ahead , the Irish prime minister , Brian Cowen , last week said that a trade unionist was right to warn that the IMF could impose cuts on the public sector unless it agrees to freeze or reduce pay to employees , which has ballooned over recent years .
It was that assertion that sparked fears , unfounded it turned out , that Ireland was looking for an IMF lifeline .
For now , Cowen is confining himself to working with unions in a bid to lop £ 1bn from the budget this year by persuading staff to agree to pay reductions .
But that will be a hard sell .
Paul Sweeney , economic adviser to the Irish TUC , said : " There is no evidence whatsoever that cuts in wages lead to reductions in prices .
In a small , open economy , inflation is largely determined externally .
He added that the government should be held to account for stoking the boom by giving subsidies to property investors and cutting taxes .
However , structural issues must be addressed , says White , and sooner rather than later .
" The problem is that we have relatively low taxes but high expenditure , and that is unsustainable .
Something has to give , " he says .
Low taxes were one of the bulwarks of the Celtic Tiger economy , luring foreign multinationals to relocate to Ireland and fuelling the expansion in employment that saw many qualified Irish professionals and other skilled workers return home after moving overseas in search of work in the 1980s and early 1990s .
Other factors were at play : it 's generally agreed that membership of the EU was key to Ireland 's ability to attract high - profile companies such as Intel , Google and Gateway .
Many leading US companies use Ireland as a platform from which to operate in the European market .
One analyst says : " The rapid growth in the US during the 1990s , together with a resurgence of EU trade , was undoubtedly a major contributor to Ireland 's success . "
For a long time , Ireland was a net recipient of EU aid , which helped to modernise the country 's infrastructure and educational system , while the adoption of the euro provided much needed currency stability .
Another critical reason behind the rise of the Celtic Tiger , say researchers , was the fall in the birth rate after the legalisation of contraceptives in 1979 .
That had an impact on the ratio of workers to those they financially support .
The ratio fell dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s , so that by 2000 it had caught up with the European norm .
That led to a seismic , demographic shift and a huge economic boost : from 1960 to 1990 , the annual growth rate of income per capita in Ireland was about 3.5 % ; in the late 1990s , it jumped to 5.8 % , well in excess of any other EU country .
But there is widespread gloom in Ireland today , summed up recently in an Irish Times article that said : " We have gone from Celtic Tiger to an era of financial fear with the suddenness of a Titanic - style shipwreck , thrown from comfort , even luxury , into a cold sea of uncertainty . "
The same , of course , could be said about most other countries in the world , in the wake of the near breakdown of the international banking system and the need for governments everywhere to pump in billions to support depositors and to avert a global depression .
But as Tom Lynch , chairman of biotech company Amarin , says : " There was immense euphoria in Ireland up to 2007 , perhaps unlike anywhere else .
Now we all need to sober up a bit .
We may not get back to the heady GDP growth rates we have had in the past , but that was when we were playing catch - up with the rest of Europe .
There 's no earthly reason , though , why the much maligned Celtic Tiger should n't get back on its feet . "
Quite so .
( CNN ) -- " Listen , listen to this ! " shouts Fida Qishta as the crackling of rockets is heard over her phone receiver .
Moussa El - Haddad , a physician in Gaza , talks to his daughter in his powerless living room .
" It 's difficult for anybody to imagine that in a second , maybe when I am talking to you on the phone , maybe something [ will ] happen to me or to my family , " the Palestinian blogger told CNN from her home in Gaza .
She has gotten little sleep during the past 10 days as Israel continues its attacks on her homeland , attacks the Jewish state says are designed to stop months of rocket strikes on southern Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza .
Qishta writes furiously , hoping to convey the horror she sees .
" The Israeli army are cannibals .
They do n't look for civilians , for children or women .
Most attacks happen on families , on their houses , " she said , her voice rising in anger .
For what Qishta cannot put into words , there are agonizing photographs : Bloody Palestinian children , their skin burned , lie limp in their helpless parents ' arms .
Hospitals , filled to capacity , redefine chaos as much - needed medical supplies are stalled a short distance away at the blocked border with Egypt .
At one hospital , a man bows his head and cries .
He rests his hand over the bellies of his two toddler relatives .
They look uninjured ; their eyes are shut .
They were both killed Monday .
They are the faces of a Palestinian death toll that has surpassed 500 .
" There 's always two sides to every story , " said Dov Hartuv , who lives close to the southern border in Israel 's Kibbutz Nahal Oz , which he says has been hit by Hamas rockets in the past .
Israel has said its campaign is aimed at stopping Hamas rockets from terrorizing its own civilians .
Asked about Fida Qishta 's strong comments , Hartuv said it 's hard not to react .
" But I am not going to argue with her , " he said .
" We are in the eye of the storm just as she is . "
At the Egyptian border , Antar Mahmood stands and waits .
At his feet are drums of cooking oil , food and a heavy bag of supplies he is trying to take to his family .
He says his house was flattened by the Israeli airstrikes .
Watch report from Gaza 's border with Egypt »
But Israeli and Egyptian guards are n't letting anything or anyone get through this part of the Gaza border .
" I just called home and asked what happened , and they said your son Mohammed has been wounded , " he said .
" He 's alive , but he 's wounded . "
In Israel , where four civilians and one soldier have been killed since the attack on Gaza began , Israelis have been gathering every morning on a southern hilltop to watch Apache helicopters .
Nearby , reporters who have been banned from entering Gaza set up tripods and position their long lenses .
" It is somewhat surreal to be standing on grassy hillsides with Israeli civilians sitting in chairs , watching the ongoing Israeli military offensive , " Dion Nissenbaum , a McClatchy Newspapers Middle East correspondent , said in an e-mail to CNN .
" They do n't seem to be bothered by the occasional Qassam rockets and mortar rounds that explode in the surrounding fields , " Nissenbaum wrote in his blog , Checkpoint Jerusalem .
" They have come to watch the war . "
Dov Hartuv , who describes himself as a fatalist , said he has a fortified safe room in his home .
" I 'm not really afraid for myself .
What will happen will happen , " he said .
" But it certainly is very frightening and nerve - wracking to live under these conditions , and I 'm sure everyone is affected by it .
...
We think about people on our side and on the other side who are suffering and hope that it will end as quickly as possible . "
From her part - time home in Durham , North Carolina , Palestinian mother and blogger Laila El - Haddad is constantly talking to her father in Gaza .
Cell phone coverage is spotty , but the two manage to video conference using Skype .
" I 'm thinking about my family all the time , " she said .
" I have lived through Israeli bombardments in the past , but this is much fiercer than anything ever before . "
A few years ago , during air raids by Israeli jets over northern Gaza , she was living with her son in Gaza City .
She tried to tell the 2 - year - old that it was just popcorn popping outside .
He replied , " I do n't like that kind of popcorn . "
Even today , in the quiet of an American suburb , the boy still cannot sleep through the night .
" He remembers the shelling and gets up and crawls into bed with me , " she said .

Her father , Moussa El - Haddad , is a physician who volunteered Monday at Gaza 's Shifa Hospital .
On Sunday , a Norwegian doctor at Shifa told reporters that the facility was overwhelmed with so many " patients lying everywhere " that they were dying before doctors had a chance to get to them .
Moussa El - Haddad says that after dealing with death at work , he comes home to robo-calls : " Urgent message : Warning to the citizens of Gaza .
Hamas is using you as human shields .
Do not listen to them .
Hamas has abandoned you and are hiding in their shelters .
Give up now . "
His daughter said he hangs up in disgust every time .
To ease the dark mood , Laila El - Haddad asked her father how his exotic pet bird is faring through the airstrikes .
" My dad has got a sense of humor , " she said .
" He told me that it used to go ' chirp , chirp , ' but now it goes ' boom , boom . ' "

Right , so this is a weird one : we 're getting tons of reports — tons — about failing Zune 30s .
Apparently , the players began freezing at about midnight last night , becoming totally unresponsive and practically useless .
Update :
The easy official fix here .

The crisis has been dubbed by Zune users ' Z2K9 ' , due to the apparently synchronized faceplantings across the country .
According to tipster Michael , the Zune users experienced something like this :
Apparently , around 2:00 AM today , the Zune models either reset , or were already off .
Upon when turning on , the thing loads up and ... freezes with a full loading bar ( as pictured above ) .
I thought my brother was the only one with it , but then it happened to my Zune .
Then I checked out the forums and it seems everyone with a 30 GB HDD model has had this happen to them

This report is consistently corroborated by literally hundreds of others across the various Zune support and fan forums .
What has n't emerged yet , largely due to the fact that MS 's support lines are n't yet open for the day , is why these devices are failing .
The evidence seems to point to a software glitch , but simple resets are n't providing any relief .
Some reports indicate that only Zunes with the latest firmware are affected , but this has n't yet been confirmed .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The proximity of the events to the New Year , which inspired the Y2K9 moniker , provides little more than a colorful backdrop ; it 's unlikely that the switching of years in the Zune 's internal calendar has anything to do with the failures ( besides , it has n't even happened yet ) .
If not for the uniform representation of events across the internet , I 'd be tempted to suspect this as a hoax , but it just does n't look that way .
The story , assuming the described problem is of the magnitude reported , will probably take a turn for the large when the majority of Zuners start waking up .
Let us know about your experiences in the comments .

RNC candidate says homosexuality a ' compulsion ' that can be ' repressed ' John Byrne
Published : Monday January 12 , 2009

The man who once unilaterally decided he'd refuse to accept any absentee ballots that were n't printed on 80 - pound paper stock is now looking for a better job .
Kenneth Blackwell , made famous by his role in the hotly contested 2004 presidential election in Ohio where he served both as honorary chairman of the Bush - Cheney reelection bid and as the state 's top elections official , is now campaigning to become chairman of the Republican National Committee .
But his past may yet come back to haunt him .
As Ohio's Secretary of State , he was instrumental in passing Ohio's gay marriage ban amendment , and he let some of his personal feelings slip in 2006 in an interview with the Columbus Dispatch .
Blackwell told the interviewer that being gay was like having a compulsion -- for instance , he said , a penchant for arson or kleptomania .
" I think [ homosexuality ] is a transgression against God 's law , God 's will , " he said .
" The reality is , again ... that I think we make choices all the time .
And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle .
Our expectation is that one 's genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac .
Do I think that they can be changed ?
Yes . "
Blackwell 's comments caused outrage in the gay press , but mainstream media articles about the RNC chairman 's race have tended to ignore the remarks .
On Monday , however , prominent gay radio host Michaelangelo Signorile posted a transcript of an interview he conducted with Blackwell last September .
In it , Blackwell reiterated the crux of his earlier comments .
" I believe homosexuality is a compulsion that can be contained , repressed or changed , " Blackwell said , according to the transcript .
" The fact is , you can choose to restrain that compulsion .
And so I think in fact you do n't have to give in to the compulsion to be homosexual .
I think that 's been proven in case after case after case . "
Blackwell was seen to be a rising star in the Republican political landscape , but his outlook dimmed after he lost an Ohio gubernatorial bid in 2006 .
Today he is Vice Chairman of the Republican National Committee 's Platform Committee .
In his radio interview , Sirius OutQ Radio's Signorile also asked Blackwell about his own sexuality .
" Did you choose to be heterosexual ? " Signorile asked .
" Did you wake up one day and say I want to be heterosexual ? "
" The answer is that I 've never had to make the choice because I 've never had the urge to be other than a heterosexual , but if in fact I had the urge to be something else I could have in fact suppressed that urge , " Blackwell said .
There is a dedicated fringe anti-vaccine movement .
They are dedicated to some permutation of the collection of beliefs that vaccines are : 1 ) not effective ; 2 ) have not reduced or eliminated any infectious disease ; 3 ) are not safe ; and 4 ) are a conspiracy of Big Pharma , the government , and paid - off doctors .
Specific claims have wandered over the years , but they have as a central theme that vaccines are bad .
When one specific claim collapses , they will move on to the next anti-vaccine claim .
While anti-vaccine cranks have been around as long as vaccines , it is only recently that they have captured the attention of the mainstream media and the skeptical movement and the battle has really been engaged .
Anti-vaccinationists have focused much of their recent efforts on the claim that vaccines cause autism .
At first the MMR vaccine was blamed , sparked by a now - discredited study performed by Andrew Wakefield .
This led to declining vaccination rates in the UK and a resurgence of measles .
As the MMR claim was in decline ( although by no means abandoned ) , attention shifted to thimerosal – a mercury - based preservative in some vaccines .
There are many flaws with the thimerosal hypothesis , and numerous studies have shown no link between thimerosal and autism or any neurological disorder .
But the fatal blow to the thimerosal hypothesis was struck when thimerosal was removed from the routine childhood vaccine schedule ( thimerosal , incidentally , was never in the MMR vaccine ) in the US by 2002 .
In the subsequent 6 years the rate of autism diagnoses kept increasing at their previous rate , without even a blip .
Only the most rabid ( or scientifically illiterate ) anti-vaccine fanatics still cling to the thimerosal claim .
So attention has shifted yet again .
Now the anti-vaccine crowd are hedging their bets with the “ toxin gambit . ”
They blame various “ toxins ” in vaccines for its alleged and unproven side effects .
Mercury is still on the list , but they have added aluminum , which is added to vaccines to make them more effective .
They cite hydrochloric acid , which they do n’t understand is added to balance the pH of vaccines .
They try to scare people by saying vaccines contain formaldehyde , but neglect to mention that formaldehyde is already naturally present in our blood in higher amounts than are found in vaccines .
They even make up some toxins ( aided by their limitless scientific ignorance ) by misreading chemical names .
Jenny McCarthy , for example , has repeated numerous times ( despite being called on it ) the canard that vaccines contain ether and anti-freeze – both untrue .
They also try the scare tactic of saying that vaccines contain viral proteins – uh , yeah , that ’s the point .
And that they may contain fetal tissue – which is a gross distortion .
Some vaccine components were cultured in cells that were derived years ago from fetuses .
( For a more thorough review of the science behind recent anti-vaccine claims you can browse through my many blog posts on the topic , or read this overview I wrote for the Skeptical Inquirer . )
The Anti-Vaccine Players
Active players on the anti-vaccine side include a number of organizations , such as Safe Minds and Age of Autism .
They have been given an incredible boost by the internet , as the skeptical movement has , and have been tireless in spreading their misinformation and ideology on their websites and blogs .
Andrew Wakefield , despite being discredited , has not recanted his claim that there is a link between MMR and vaccines .
He now portrays himself as a martyr to the cause .
As a doctor and researcher he remains an icon of the anti-vaccine movement .
Other anti-vaccine researchers include the father and son team of Mark and David Geier .
They have made a career publishing bogus studies claiming to show a statistical correlation between vaccine and autism .
Their studies crumble under peer - review , however .
They have also spent a lot of time as expert witnesses for attorneys suing over vaccine injury .
Their worst contribution to anti-vaccine nonsense , in my opinion , is a recent study in which they are treating autistic children with Lupron and chelation therapy .
They were only able to get approval for this ethically dubious study by putting together their own IRB board packed with cronies .
Dr. Jay Gordon is a “ pediatrician to the stars ” and prominent figure in the anti-vaccine pantheon , despite his coy and unconvincing protests that he is not anti-vaccine .
He is notorious for relying upon his gut instinct as a clinician rather than actual published scientific evidence , and makes a slew of anti-vaccine claims that are completely unsupported by evidence .
For example he is proponent of the notion that the childhood vaccine program gives too many vaccines too soon – without any scientific rationale or evidence .
J.B. Handley is the co-founder of generation rescue , a parent - based autism support group that is dedicated to the notion that autism is a vaccine - injury .
His group also favors and promotes a number of biological therapies for autism , such as chelation therapy , all based either on the mercury poisoning hypothesis , or any dubious alternative therapy that comes along .
David Kirby is a journalist who gave the thimerosal hypothesis a huge boost with his 2006 book Evidence of Harm .
In it he puts forward the claim that there is a vast conspiracy among the pharmaceutical industry , the government ( via the FDA and CDC ) and the medical establishment to hide the evidence that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism .
He has subsequently built his career around that book , and clings tenaciously to the thimerosal claim .
He blogs for The Huffington Post , where he repeats his anti-vaccine propaganda on a regular basis .
Kirby is most notorious for specifically claiming that autism rates should plummet following the removal of thimerosal from the vaccine schedule , and then subsequently moving the goalpost on his prediction .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer and environmentalist who has championed the hard - core conspiracy theories surrounding the anti-vaccine claims .
He wrote Deadly Immunity ( published simultaneously Rolling Stone magazine and Salon.com ) , and followed up with a ridiculous screed called Attack on Mothers .
He has been particularly shrill and paranoid in his writings , and just as scientifically clueless .
This was the primary reason for the controversy that erupted when his name was floated for an Obama appointment to head the EPA .
The reigning superstar of the anti-vaccine movement is actress Jenny McCarthy .
After deciding that her son , Evan , was an indigo child ( actually , she is an “ indigo ” and Evan is a “ crystal ” – divine manifestors here to save the earth , so they have that going for them ) McCarthy later decided that Evan had autism caused by the MMR vaccine .
So she shifted from crusading to spread the word of indigo children to the world to spreading anti-vaccine propaganda .
She has subsequently been relentless in spreading her scientific illiteracy and fear mongering , and was the primary force behind the “ Green or Vaccine ” march earlier this year .
She believes that we should listen to her “ mommy instinct ” rather than scientific evidence .
Eager for a celebrity face to put on their movement , McCarthy was rapidly positioned as the de facto leader of the anti-vaccine crowd .
Her celebrity has indeed made her dangerous .
She has also managed to rope in her boyfriend , Jim Carrey , who is also as clueless as he is famous .
Also a huge player in the anti-vaccine movement is the media .
In general the mainstream media have been mixed in the quality of their approach to this issue .
Sometimes a mainstream outlet does a decent job , but mostly they allow Jenny McCarthy and her ilk to have a free ride , with perhaps lame token skepticism thrown in .
But beyond mainstream media incompetence , there are several outlets that have actively promoted the anti-vaccine movement , and they deserve a large share of the blame for the harm that results .
This includes the Huffington Post , which I already mentioned as the blog home of David Kirby .
Larry King has also allowed his show to be used to promote anti-vaccine pseudoscience .
But the queen of shilling for dangerous quackery is Oprah Winfrey .
She has the largest and most adoring audience .
She has promoted Jenny McCarthy and Dr. Jay Gordon on her show numerous times .
She does n’t even bother with the token science .
There are many others , but those are the names that have been prominent in the media recently .
Defending Science
The list of players opposing the anti-vaccine movement is not as long .
The most prominent opponent is Dr. Paul Offit , a pediatrician and researcher who recently published a book on the topic called Autism ’s False Prophets .
He has endured personal threats in order to tirelessly attack the pseudoscience of the anti-vaccine crowd .
He is certainly their enemy # 1 .
He understands the issue inside and out and is an effective public speaker and writer .
Recently actress Amanda
Peet decided to go up against Jenny McCarthy in a celebrity death match over the issue ( or at least that ’s how the media likes to play it ) .
She has become a spokesperson for the vaccine program , and has specifically targeted anti-vaccine propaganda .
She also has made an effective swipe at McCarthy exploiting her celebrity to promote her own wacky ideas .
Peet stresses that she is not an expert , and that she defers to the scientific consensus on vaccines .
She is not trying to substitute her own opinion for that of experts , she is simply trying to get the word out that vaccines are a safe and effective public health measure .
But those who have been in the trenches countering anti-vaccine propaganda at every turn are skeptics and science bloggers .
I have been writing about the issue since 2005 , and in fact have been engaged directly by David Kirby and others .
David Gorski , who blogs for Science - Based Medicine and Respectful Insolence , has also been blogging very effectively on this issue for years .
Dr. Gordon , in fact , treats him as his personal nemesis .
Our allies across the pond include Ben Goldacre who write the Bad Science column .
Even non-physician skeptical bloggers will occasionally take on anti-vaccine nuttery .
Phil Plait , for example , will take time away from astronomy to dismantle the latest anti-vaccine pseudoscience .
There are others , and my apologies to anyone I did not specifically mention .
Some bloggers in the autism community , like the autism diva , have also opposed the anti-vaccine crowd , partly because in order to bolster their fear mongering the anti-vaccinationists have portrayed autism as a universally “ life sucking ” disorder .
It is not hard to understand why some autism parents would be offended at that characterization of their children , or why they would resent the use of autism to fear - monger about vaccines .
The government and mainstream medical community has been largely ineffective on the issue .
They try , with occasional official statements about the science , but they simply do n’t have the experience dealing with a dedicated pseudoscientific popular movement .
The Stakes
The consequences of this particular battle are quite high .
Obviously , everyone wants effective vaccine regulation and safety monitoring .
There is broad support for the vaccine compensation program , that streamlines the process of financially compensating children and families that have suffered legitimate side effects from vaccines .
On any particular claim , we want the scientific chips to fall where they may .
If some vaccine ingredient is causing harm , we need to find out right away and make the necessary changes .
Only a cartoonish , handlebar mustache - twisting villain would want to allow children to be harmed through compulsory vaccines .
Anti-vaccine hysteria , however , hampers effective vaccine safety by diverting attention and resources to false claims .
The most direct consequence of the anti-vaccine movement , and their recent successes with Jenny McCarthy and Oprah , is stoking public fears about the vaccine program leading to declining vaccination rates .
This has already resulted in increased outbreaks of measles and mumps .
Vaccine hysteria in Nigeria set back the goal of eradicating polio from the world for years .
Not having ones ’ children vaccinated does not only put your children at risk but others as well .
As vaccination rates drop , infectious diseases they would normally prevent are allowed to spread through the population .
This puts everyone at risk , but especially those people who cannot be vaccinated because of a medical contraindication .
The anti-vaccine crowd has also opposed attempts to shield vaccine manufacturers from liability .
No one is arguing that vaccine producers get a free pass – they are still responsible for their product , and are certainly tightly regulated by the government .
However , if they were vulnerable every lawyer trying to make a buck off of anti-vaccine pseudoscience , it would quickly become impossible to produce vaccines .
It would not be worth it for any company to sell vaccines – and of course that is the goal of the anti-vaccine movement .
They want to end vaccines , and harassing lawsuits are just one method .
This is partly why the government set up the vaccine compensation program – there is a small tax attached to every vaccine , and that tax goes into a pool that is then paid out to those injured by vaccines , as determined by a federal court .
This brings up another risk of the anti-vaccine movement .
There are now about 5,000 cases before the vaccine injury compensation program by parents who allege that their children ’s autism was caused by vaccines .
The courts now have to spend time and taxpayer money legally settling a question that the scientific community already has .
Conclusion
The anti-vaccine movement is a recent skeptical battleground , and one that is still very active .
This is certainly one of the biggest issues from 2008 , and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future .
Skeptics have been particularly effective in dissecting the claims of the anti-vaccinationists and pointing out the dangers of anti-vaccine hysteria .
But the anti-vaccinationists have the momentum , due largely to Jenny McCarthy and Oprah Winfrey .
Vaccine rates are declining .
It seems as if we may be seeing a momentum shift , however .
Next year will be very telling .
One thing is clear – the skeptical movement has to keep vigilant and keep the pressure on .
We have to oppose anti-vaccine pseudoscience at every turn .
We need to make ourselves available to the mainstream media and be effective at the public relations end of the game .
We need to get the mainstream scientific and medical communities more active and show them how it ’s done .
This is a fight we can win , and I think we are making headway .
Ever wondered " how many internet users are there in the world " ?
Now we have an answer .
The total global Internet audience surpassed 1 billion visitors in December 2008 , based on data from the comScore World Metrix audience measurement service .
The Asia -Pacific region accounted for the highest share of global Internet users at 41 percent , followed by Europe ( 28 percent share ) , North America ( 18 percent share ) , Latin- America ( 7 percent share ) , and the Middle East & Africa ( 5 percent share ) .
The group is made up of people aged 15 and older , using home and work computers .
It excludes traffic from public computers such as Internet cafes or access from mobile phones or PDAs .
China represented the largest online audience in the world in December 2008 with 180 million Internet users , representing nearly 18 percent of the total worldwide Internet audience , followed by the US ( 16.2 percent share ) , Japan ( 6 percent share ) , Germany ( 3.7 percent share ) and the UK ( 3.6 percent share ) .

Casper is trained to recognise the scent of cancer cells in urine A rescue dog from Oxfordshire is being trained by a medical charity in Buckinghamshire to sniff out cancer .
Spaniel puppy Casper had been living in the Blue Cross animal centre in Burford for months but was continually passed over because of his boundless energy .
This made him perfect for scientists looking for dogs for their project .
Now Casper is being taught to recognise the scent of cancer from urine samples .
It is hoped this will lead to earlier diagnosis and save more lives .
Claire Guest chief executive of Cancer and Bio-detection Dogs , based in Aylesbury , said : " Chances are lower for dogs like Casper to find a home as he has a very high drive and is incredibly energetic and bouncy .
" It can make them disruptive in the home but it makes Casper perfect for us . "
It 's like trying to recognise a certain ingredient in a soup
Claire Guest , Cancer and Bio-detection Dogs Dogs have already been known to be able to smell cancer cells .
A north Oxfordshire man credited his pet Rottweiller with sniffing out his skin cancer in November last year .
But the the scenting skills of cancer dogs are even more delicate .
The dogs are trained to recognise cancer cells in urine samples but the researchers say the training regime is very complicated .
Ms Guest said " It 's like trying to recognise a certain ingredient in a soup .
There are lots and lots of soups , some have them have it , some of them do n't . "
It is estimated that Casper will be a working cancer dog within four months .
Beamish the Rottweiler was credited with sniffing out his owners skin cancer
The ultimate aim of the project is to introduce a medical test where people can go into a doctor and get a full medical from a urine test and a breath test .
The Cancer Dogs charity said there is already an electronic nose device that aims to identify cancer from urine samples but they are way behind the dogs " simply because their sense of smell is so advanced " and they are making " great leaps all the time " , Ms Guest said .
Researchers said they want to see how the dogs work and upgrade their technology accordingly so people can have a simple non-invasive test to give them the earliest possible warning if they have cancer .
Ms Guest added : " We actually want to reduce some fear of cancer diagnosis - you hear so many people say - ' if I had it I would n't want to know ' , because they think their chance of survival is low but now with great advances in medication early diagnosis is the key to survival and cancer does n't have to turn into a terrible tragedy .
" It 's the people who do n't know they 've got it who do n't stand a chance - that 's the tragedy . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Rates on mortgage loans are the lowest in the 37 - year history of the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey , according to a weekly report released Wednesday .
The average 30 - year , fixed - rate loan issued to borrowers declined to 5.1 % , with 0.7 up - front points , for the week ending December 31 , according to the survey .
The rate dropped from an average of 5.14 % last week , which was the previous 37 - year low .
Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) began surveying lenders back in 1971 .
The 30 - year fixed was at 6.06 % a year ago .
The average for a 15 - year , fixed rate loan was just 4.83 % , its lowest level since March 25 , 2004 , when it hit 4.70 percent .
" Since the end of October of this year , these rates have declined by about 1 - 1/ 3 percentage points , or payment savings of approximately $ 173 a month for a $ 200,000 loan , " said Freddie 's chief economist , Frank Nothaft in a statement .
" As a result , the number of refinance applications for conventional mortgages jumped over 500 percent between the weeks ending on October 31st and December 26th . "
Housing wo n't budge
Unfortunately , the low interest rates have not spurred much of an increase in the number of new loans made to home buyers .
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association , nearly 83 % of all mortgage applications recorded last week were to refinance existing loans rather than to buy a home , indicating that low interest rates have so far failed to free up the frozen housing market .
Action from the Federal Reserve is also putting downward pressure on rates , according to Keith Gumbinger , of HSH Associates , a publisher of mortgage information that releases its own market survey .
The Fed announced in November that it will buy as much as $ 500 billion worth of mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) over the first six months of 2009 .
On Tuesday , it said it would start buying the securities next week .
" Just the fact that they said they 'd do that put downward pressure on rates , " said Gumbinger .
Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors , predicts the Fed action will help 30 - year mortgages hold steady at around 5 % or less over the next few months .
" The Fed is providing an additional buyer for the MBS , increasing demand for them and lowering rates , " he said .
That should eventually boost the housing market , which has been crippled lately .
Existing home sales fell 8.6 % month - over - month to an annualized rate of just 4.49 million units in November .
The full impact of the low rates may not be felt for a while , however .
" When rates fall , people respond , but the increase in sales usually follows by three to five months , " said Yun .
That would coincide with the normally brisk spring selling season and , along with home prices that are the most affordable they 've been in several years , could rejuvenate markets starting around March .
" Lower rates and falling house prices are making home ownership more affordable , " said Nothaft .
" House prices fell 18 % over the 12 - month period ending in October , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller 20 - city composite index . "
Despite these positive factors ,
Yun is still not totally optimistic about the boost they can provide housing markets .
" It 's hard to dictate the confidence of consumers , " he said .
Freddie Mac's is the longest running , and one of the most closely watched , mortgage market surveys around .
The company surveys 125 lenders around the nation , asking them what the average rates are for their best customers who are putting 20 % down on conforming loans , which generally have a cap of $ 417,000 in most markets or $ 625,00 in high - cost areas .
This year , FIRE has seen a number of colleges take steps to regulate online speech .
The Internet makes it easier than ever for people to communicate with one another , and thus presents a whole new world for would - be censors of campus speech .
FIRE has kept a close watch on the developing relationship between colleges and online speech in order to prevent the establishment of deleterious , and potentially unconstitutional , practices .
The most recent online FIRE case involved Michigan State University ’s ( MSU ’s ) attempt to regulate its students ’ and faculty ’s use of e-mail .
MSU found a student government leader guilty of spamming for sending out e-mails from her private account to 391 carefully selected professors regarding proposed changes to the school calendar .
As Adam detailed , the still - existing bulk e-mail guidelines MSU found the student guilty of violating are unconstitutional in numerous ways .
First , the guidelines are both vague and content - based .
The policy states that community members cannot send e-mails in bulk if they are " personal " or " political " in nature .
The vagueness of this policy is evidenced in the current case .
Even though the student was a student government leader writing solely to express her views on impending changes to MSU ’s official calendar — in other words , she was writing on clear matters of academic and public concern — the school found that her purpose in sending the e-mails was " personal . "
The fact that students cannot know which of their e-mails would be banned under these broad , undefined categories is just one of the constitutional infirmities of MSU ’s policy .
Second , for the categories of speech that community members could potentially send in bulk , MSU required the e-mailer to obtain permission from an administrator prior to sending the message .
Such prior restraints on citizen speech rarely pass constitutional muster .
The government must have a compelling justification for requiring citizens to obtain permission from government officials before speaking .
It also must provide " narrow , objective , and definite standards " to govern when approval will be given .
Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham , 394 U.S. 147 , 151 ( 1969 ) .
MSU failed to carry this " heavy burden " — reading the policy offers little hint as to when approval would be given , and no compelling justification was offered for the policy .
Neb. Press Ass’n v. Stuart , 427 U.S. 539 , 558 ( 1976 ) .
Restrictions on e-mail use , even if not content - based , must be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest .
Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 U.S. 781 ( 1989 ) .
MSU failed to meet the burden here as well .
MSU asserts two justifications for its policy : one , to reduce the amount of undesired e-mail arriving in community members ’ inboxes ; two , to keep its servers moving fast .
As to the former justification , it is unlikely the government has a substantial interest in shielding citizens ’ inboxes from other citizens ’ speech .
Only in very narrow and specific circumstances — such as inside citizens ’ homes — does the government have a substantial interest in shielding citizens from undesired , but protected citizen speech .
Even if MSU did have that interest , however , this policy is not narrowly tailored .
It blocks a great deal of wanted speech — for example , of the 391 e-mails the student sent in the current case , only one person complained .
This suggests a not insubstantial number of people did not object to receiving the e-mail .
New technologies , such as e-mail , do not eradicate well - established constitutional principles .
Consider , for example , if the government banned citizens from mailing out form letters to more than 30 people in two days —
MSU ’s numbers for " bulk " — and justified it by a perceived need to protect citizens and public officials from undesired " junk " mail arriving in their mailboxes , and second , by a need to keep the postal system running as fast as possible .
This content - neutral policy would clearly pose too great of an imposition on citizens ’ protected speech , as well as on citizens ’ right to petition the government .
E-mail differs from paper mail in the ease with which it can be sent , but it also differs in the ease with which it can be deleted .
The analogy between paper and e-mail is instructive for constitutional purposes , especially when it comes to matters of public concern .
If MSU wants to reduce the number of undesired e-mails in a narrowly tailored fashion , it can provide individuals with spam filters and a mechanism by which they can personally add e-mail addresses to their spam list .
This is the equivalent of writing " return to sender " on a letter , and it will effectively reduce undesired e-mail without MSU having to decide which categories of speech are most undesirable , which e-mails should be approved , or how many e-mails to other community members are too many — all questions a state institution has no business answering .
The other major regulation of online speech FIRE has seen this year is the selective blocking of websites based on their content .
Most of the controversy has revolved around juicycampus.com , a website which provides a forum for people to post anonymous gossip about various campuses .
Tennessee State University ( TSU ) , a public college , has gone so far as to block it , and a couple of student governments have passed resolutions urging their schools to do the same .
TSU ’s university counsel argued that the Supreme Court held that a public library could filter pornographic websites , and , therefore , TSU could ban websites it deemed disagreeable from its computers .
United States v. American Library Assn. , Inc. , 539 U.S. 194 ( 2003 ) .
This is incorrect for two reasons .
One , the Court ’s American Library decision hinged on the fact that any adult library patron could have the filter removed simply by asking the librarian .
TSU has not provided a way for university community members to access the blocked website on its network — it has simply blocked the website wholesale .
Second , the decision arose out of an analysis of the traditional function of the public library , and it relied on the fact that children were often in libraries and might accidentally view the pornographic websites at question in that case .
In contrast to a public library computer , a university computer is much less likely to be accessed by children .
Additionally , the university is traditionally a place where speech , no matter how offensive to some , is at its freest .
The Supreme Court has continually affirmed the university as being " peculiarly the marketplace of ideas . "
Healy v. James , 408 U.S. 169 , 180 ( 1972 ) .
When a university provides Internet access to nearly every website on the world wide web , it is obliged to not then step in and ban particular websites based on their " disagreeable " content .
While it is true that the network is a public resource , so is the public square , the postal system and the general student activity funds that the Court has repeatedly held must be distributed by colleges in a viewpoint - neutral manner .
Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth , 529 U.S. 217 ( 2000 ) .
When venturing into the online world , colleges should resist thinking that providing an e-mail service or a connection to the Internet means that they can disregard traditional First Amendment principles .
When a chancellor of one college tried to impose a content - based restriction on community members ’ e-mailing — ordering community members not to contact prospective student - athletes — a federal court not only found such a restriction to be a First Amendment violation , but it denied the chancellor qualified immunity — meaning it found the law in this area was settled and the chancellor could be held liable for that reason .
Crue v. Aiken , 370 F.3d 668 , 678 ( 7th Cir. Ill. 2004 ) .
Universities thus disregard traditional First Amendment principles in the online world at their own risk .
Generally , colleges should be extremely wary of blocking websites based on content or imposing onerous or vague restrictions on e-mailing .
Unless such policies are narrowly tailored to a substantial , or in some cases , compelling government purpose , it is unlikely that they will pass constitutional muster .
As Greg , Robert and Will have covered , this is for good reason : outside the classroom , a university should not attempt to determine which speech is " good enough " for students and faculty to have access to .
The world wide web makes it easier than ever for citizens to speak to one another .
A college should not try to squash this flourishing marketplace with restrictions and regulations which have no greater aim than to reduce the amount of protected speech or eliminate access to what it deems too offensive .
This may help explain some of what is going on :
The Israel Air Force used a new bunker - buster missile that it received recently from the United States in strikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on Saturday , The Jerusalem Post learned on Sunday [ last week ] .
The missile , called GBU - 39 , was developed in recent years by the US as a small - diameter bomb for low - cost , high - precision and low collateral damage strikes .
Israel received approval from Congress to purchase 1,000 units in September and defense officials said on Sunday that the first shipment had arrived earlier this month and was used successfully in penetrating underground Kassam launchers in the Gaza Strip during the heavy aerial bombardment of Hamas infrastructure on Saturday .
It was also used in Sunday 's bombing of tunnels in Rafah .
The attack on Gaza may be a test - run for Iran 's nuclear sites .
In that case , what we may be witnessing is Israel 's initiation of full - scale war with Iran .
That would certainly make as much sense as the current stated rationale for invading Gaza .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
A million and a half Palestinians are learning the hard way that democracy is n't so good if you vote the wrong way .
In 2006 , they elected Hamas when the US and Israel wanted them to support the more - moderate Fatah .
As a result , having long ago lost their homes and property , Gazans have endured three years of embargo , crippling shortages of food and basic necessities , and total economic collapse .
We spoke again Saturday with three of our longtime Gazan contacts .
They and their families , all Fatah supporters , were in their eleventh day without electricity , running water , or heat .
They are cowering in cold basements trying to protect their children from the storm of explosions that is filling Shifa hospital with amputees and the dead .
Our friends in Israel are likewise living in fear .
The 850 - plus dead Gazans , more than a dozen dead Israelis , and some 3,000 injured have since the end of the cease - fire become part of what Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice once called the birth pains of a new Middle East .
It did n't have to be this way .
We could have talked instead of fought .
Hamas never called for the elections that put them in power .
That was the brainstorm of Secretary Rice and her staff , who had apparently decided they could steer Palestinians into supporting the more - compliant Mahmoud Abbas ( the current president of the Palestinian authority ) and his Fatah Party through a marketing campaign that was to counter Hamas 's growing popularity – all while ignoring continued Israeli settlement construction , land confiscation , and cantonization of the West Bank .
State Department staffers helped finance and supervise the Fatah campaign , down to the choice of backdrop color for the podium where Mr. Abbas was to proclaim victory .
An adviser working for the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) explained to incredulous staffers at the Embassy in Tel Aviv how he would finance and direct elements of the campaign , leaving no US fingerprints .
USAID teams , meanwhile , struggled to implement projects for which Abbas could claim credit .
Once the covert political program cemented Fatah in place , the militia Washington was building for Fatah warlord - wannabee Mohammed Dahlan would destroy Hamas militarily .
Their collective confidence was unbounded .
But the Palestinians did n't get the memo .
Rice was reportedly blindsided when she heard the news of Hamas 's victory during her 5 a.m. treadmill workout .
But that did not prevent a swift response .
She immediately insisted that the Quartet ( the US , European Union , United Nations , and Russia ) ban all contact with Hamas and support Israel 's economic blockade of Gaza .
The results of her request were mixed , but Palestinian suffering manifestly intensified .
The isolation was supposed to turn angry Palestinians against an ineffective Hamas .
As if such blockades had not been tried before .
Simultaneously , the US military team expanded its efforts to build the Mohammed Dahlan - led militia .
President Bush considered Dahlan " our guy . "
But Dahlan 's thugs moved too soon .
They roamed Gaza , demanding protection money from businesses and individuals , erecting checkpoints to extort bribes , terrorizing Dahlan 's opponents within Fatah , and attacking Hamas members .
Finally , in mid-2007 , faced with increasing chaos and the widely known implementation of a US - backed militia , Hamas – the lawfully elected government – struck first .
They routed the Fatah gangs , securing control of the entire Gaza Strip , and established civil order .
Its efforts stymied , the US has for more than a year inflexibly backed Israel 's embargo of Gaza and its collective punishment of the Strip 's 1.5 million residents .
The recent six - month cease - fire saw a near cessation of rocket fire into Israel and calm along the border , yet the economic siege was further tightened .
Gaza 's economy has collapsed , and the population , displaced for decades from their farms and villages , relies ever more on food aid from Hamas and the UN .
The US expresses shock that Gazans resort to using smuggling tunnels for survival rather than passively accepting the suffering inflicted by the embargo .
What would we expect Americans to do in the same circumstances ?
With no easing of the blockade , the missile launches have increased in range and frequency , yielding massive Israeli response .
Our " good , " US - supported Palestinians did not vanquish the " bad " Palestinians any more than Washington 's Lebanese clients turned on Hezbollah , despite the suffering and death of the 2006 war with Israel .
Abbas sits emasculated in Ramallah .
The Israelis continue to build settlements while blaming Iran for their troubles , as though the Palestinians have no grievances of their own .
And we are further than ever from peace .
Cultural differences aside , Gazans , like Americans , unite in adversity .
Neither punishment , nor a cease - fire that extends the embargo will make them accept the loss of their property , 60 years of displacement , or life in squalid refugee camps .
Nor , as decades of experience have proved , will too - clever US manipulation make Palestinians pliable to US and Israeli wishes .
US financial and military support for Israel can maintain the status quo indefinitely , if that 's what we want , but it cannot resolve fundamental issues or bring peace .
For that , we need to talk , even if at arm 's length initially , and not leave the hard issues to the end .
That only leaves the radicals on both sides the opportunity to undermine peace efforts and extend the senseless loss of life .
Until we talk about real issues , both Palestinians and Israelis will be cowering in cellars .
Such dialogue wo n't be easy , but with concerted US - led effort , it is within reach .
A significant portion of the provisions that will constitute a comprehensive agreement , even on the most difficult issues , have already been put together by discreet , experienced Track2 negotiators .
The difficulty lies in the politics of giving concessions and selling them to the public .
Only the US has the influence to move the parties past their weaknesses with a comprehensive regional initiative , thereby defusing those who argue against concessions for any bilateral peace agreement while other enemies remain .
That 's why President - elect Obama must reconsider his plan to appoint a traditional Washington - based Middle East envoy , reportedly former envoy Dennis Ross , and instead pursue a course that signals change .
He should :
• Declare his determination to pursue from his first day in office , not the final six months , full peace between Israel and all its neighbors .
Only by doing so can he win support among Israelis , Palestinians , the Congress , and the international partners we 'll need to support this historic effort .
• Name an outstanding peace envoy to be resident full time in the region with authority over our missions in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem .
He or she must have the presidential backing and stamina to withstand the pressures and pitfalls of a comprehensive peace process over the long haul .
In addition , this envoy must have authority over all US interactions with the Palestinians and Israelis and later , with other parties , reporting directly to the president in collaboration with the National Security Adviser and secretary of State .
Assisted with staff comprising the US government 's foremost experts , this envoy would be the single US voice on this issue .
• Empower the envoy to engage with all parties to the conflict , regardless of current prohibitions , on all issues , overturning long - established policy .
• Fund a political and economic development process second only to those in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Only by an " all out " effort can we hope to convince all the parties , and a skeptical international community , that the US is determined to achieve peace and prosperity for all the peoples of the region .
• Norman H. Olsen served for 26 years as a member of the US Foreign Service , including four years working in the Gaza Strip and four years as counselor for political affairs at the US Embassy in Tel Aviv .
He was most recently associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the Department of State .
His son , Matthew N. Olsen , is the director of Explore Corps , a nascent NGO that uses outdoor education and youth programming to facilitate peace - building among young adults , with several current projects in the Gaza Strip .

The reclassification of cannabis as a Class B drug has come into effect in England and Wales amid complaints the new laws are " illogical " .
Ministers went against their advisors to upgrade the drug because of worries about its impact on mental health .
Magistrates welcomed the reclassification but said planned fines for possessing small amounts undermined the more serious classification .
They said it sent the signal cannabis is not as bad as other Class B drugs .
Plans to introduce a " three strikes " system for cannabis possession start with a warning , then an £ 80 spot fine for a second offence .
Scotland and Northern Ireland have opted out of this penalties arrangement for England and Wales , retaining the former system for class B drugs .
Only when a third offence is committed , will the person be liable to arrest and prosecution .
Penalties for drug offences
The spot fine proposal is due for further consultation after magistrates expressed concerns about taking offences away from the courts system .
The Magistrates ' Association argued that some of the offences were too serious to be dealt with out of court and that penalty payment rates were low .
The fines are to be debated in the Lords on Monday and are expected to come into force on Wednesday .

More from Today programme Currently , police can only warn or prosecute people caught in possession of cannabis .
The maximum prison term for possessing cannabis rises from two to five years with its reclassification .
Home Office minister Alan Campbell said : " Cannabis is a harmful drug and while fewer people are taking it than before , it poses a real risk to the health of those who do use it . "
He added : " We are reclassifying cannabis to protect the public and future generations . "
But John Fassenfelt , deputy chair of the Magistrates ' Association , said the fine system would send out mixed messages .
" What is that telling the youngster on the street ? " he said .
" Is it telling them well , you can have cannabis , it 's not so serious as other Class B drugs .
The reality is cannabis has been illegal for 80 years and it has made no difference whatsoever to its usage
Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies
The cannabis debate Send us your comments " It 's a dual justice system .
If you smoke or take another Class B drug you 'll be brought to court , if you take cannabis you 'll be given a fine .
Where 's the justice in that ? "
But Liberal Democrat MEP
Chris Davies said the changes were disproportionate to the harmfulness of the drug and that they would in any case be ineffective .
He told the BBC : " The reality is cannabis has been illegal for 80 years and it has made no difference whatsoever to its usage ...
The use of cannabis should be a matter of health policy not criminal law .
" The principle of a free society is that people should be able to do whatever they like as long as they cause no harm to other people . "
Brian Paddick , a former Metropolitan Police commander , also said the upgrade would be ineffective as the classification of a drug was not a factor drug users take into consideration .
However Debra Bell , who says her son became aggressive and dishonest after first smoking the drug aged 14 , told the BBC the age of users is falling and the damage to families is acute .
' Three times stronger '
She told the BBC : " Thousands across the UK who have written to us have talked about the damage to families ... our children are our future . "
A £ 2.2 m TV , radio and internet campaign will launch next month to warn young people about the dangers of using the drug .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith decided to reclassify cannabis despite an Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' review - commissioned by Gordon Brown - saying it should remain Class C. Ms Smith said stronger " skunk " varieties account for 80 % of the cannabis seized on the streets , and that the drug is nearly three times stronger than in 1995 .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " The move to Class B has got nothing to do with public health and education and everything to do with posturing on penalties .
' SKUNK ' CANNABIS
So-called because it has a very strong smell Contains much higher levels of the active ingredient - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
Now accounts for between 70 % and 80 % of samples seized by police Six years ago it accounted for 15 % of samples " This farce would have been avoided had ministers heeded the advice of the experts on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs . "
The advisory council 's report , Cannabis : Classification and Public Health , described the drug as a " significant public health issue " .
But it said it should still remain a Class C drug , saying the risks were not as serious as those of Class B substances such as amphetamines and barbiturates .
Class C includes substances such as tranquilisers , some painkillers , GHB ( so - called " liquid ecstasy " ) and ketamine .
Possession of Class C drugs is treated largely as a non-arrestable offence .
The Conservatives have said the government 's reversal of its earlier decision showed the downgrading of cannabis had been a mistake .

To many of the twitchers poised by the reed beds at the London Wetland Centre yesterday , this weekend 's Big Garden Birdwatch was a matter of sublime indifference .
While most people are being urged to spend an hour totting up anything with a beak in the back garden , the hardcore " professionals " out in force had only bitterns in mind .
The bittern , a wader so secretive it is described by twitchers as a " rarity " spot – there are said to be only about 100 in the country – had been seen earlier at the centre in Barnes , south - west London .
The hundreds of thousands of ordinary people expected to participate in Birdwatch this weekend are being urged to be a little less exclusive in their bird - spotting .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) stressed that casual watchers " certainly do n't need to be serious twitchers to take part .
All you need to do is record all the birds you see in your back garden or a public place for one hour . "
The event , billed as the world 's biggest wildlife survey , helps the charity get a clear picture of bird numbers in Britain .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The RSPB 's experts believe the variety of species to be seen this year could be greater than ever as a result of climate change .
Dr Mark Avery , the RSPB 's conservation director , said : " Milder winter temperatures in the UK mean birds are n't bothering to fly south .
In the past five years , birds such as blackcaps have been seen more often .
It would have been virtually unheard of to see these in UK gardens 30 years ago when the Birdwatch first started . "
Climate change has brought about a similar revolution in other aspects of British wildlife , according to the Woodland Trust , the environmental charity .
The trust 's Nature Calendar – a nationwide survey by thousands of volunteers who record things as varied as the first song of the song thrush , or sightings of the first butterfly or frogspawn – have warned that the latest evidence shows that climate change continues to transform springtime .
According to the trust 's extensive records , some of which date back to the 1700s , plants such as the snowdrop are emerging 15 days earlier than the average for the past 30 years , while frogs lay spawn two weeks earlier .
The Woodland Trust said the changes are a cause for concern .
Species fooled by mild winters into blossoming or breeding are vulnerable and can get caught out by a cold spell .
Richard Smithers , its UK conservation adviser , said : " Species are doing their thing earlier and earlier ; the danger is some may have got ' locked - in ' to their seasonal advance .
More likely , though , if we get a sudden warm spell , lots of things could start to happen , then it could switch to being cold and you 'll end up with species having real problems .
" Frogspawning is one of the most responsive events ... to climate .
In recent years , we 've had frogs spawning as early as October – which is quite ridiculous .
It 's almost as if spring is happening before autumn has ended . "
And frozen frogspawn , he added , could have " an impact on breeding success " .
Another potential problem outlined by the trust was that species could get out of sync with one another .
" A good example would be the orange - tip butterfly and garlic mustard – which is its [ larva 's ] food plant , " Mr Smithers said .
" If the butterfly responds faster [ to climate ] than garlic mustard , the butterfly could emerge in the spring to lay its eggs and there would be no garlic mustard around .
What does it do then ? "
Tony Blair still thinks “ many times ” every day of the death toll in the Iraq war , he has said , nearly six years after leading Britain into the conflict .
The former prime minister told The Times that , while he was not haunted by the decision , “ I reflect on it , and am troubled by it , and feel a great sense of responsibility for it . ”
“ The most difficult thing in any set of circumstances is the sense of responsibility for people who have given their lives and fallen — the soldiers and the civilians , ” Mr Blair continued .
“ If I did not feel that , there really would be something wrong with me , and there is not a single day of my life when I do not reflect upon it ... many times .
And that ’s as it should be . ”
However , he added : “ On the other hand you have to take the decision and I look at the Middle East now and I think , well , if Saddam and his two sons were still running Iraq , how many other people would have died and would the region be more stable ? ”
In total there have been 4,551 coalition deaths — 178 of them British service personnel — as well as civilian casualties estimated at anywhere up to a million .
Mr Blair also hailed new US President Barack Obama as part of his “ new generation ” of political leaders who were focused on practicalities rather than ideology and partisanship .
“ I think there is a new generation of political leaders who find the very traditional pigeonholing rather redundant , actually , ” he told the newspaper in an interview to be published today .
“ They have undergone this strange experience , certainly for me , but in a sense I think for Obama too , which is growing up with a left politics that was the politics of ideology and then , as we ’ve grown to political maturity and taken positions of power , we find that it ’s the right that ’s got ideology .
Of President Obama , he said : “ The thing he does brilliantly is to explain why certain sentiments are inconsistent with the future and can be put to one side . ”

Even though I have an LCD monitor , I always have the subpixel hinting switched off because it is just painfully ugly to my eyes .
Even when hinting is switched to maximum , the fonts are quite blurry ( if you do n’t believe me , type xmag and take a screenshot of your font .
You can see red and blue linese everywhere ) .
My eyes hurt when I see this .
Thanks to Johan Kivinemi
I have just found out how to bring back the excellent legacy subpixel hinting engine .
This has a much more crisp hinting , and uses subpixels only where it really is an improvement :
Just open these files in your home directory , and copy the content into them :
~/.fonts.conf
< fontconfig > < match target= " font " > < edit name= " antialias " mode= " assign " > < bool > true </bool > < / edit > < edit name= " hinting " mode= " assign " > < bool > true </bool > < /edit > < edit name= " hintstyle " mode= " assign " > < const > hintfull </ const > </ edit > < edit name= " lcdfilter " mode= " assign " > < const > lcdlegacy </ const > </ edit > < edit name= " rgba " mode= " assign " > < const > rgb </ const > < /edit > </ match > </ fontconfig >
~/.Xresources
Xft.antialias : true Xft.hinting : true Xft.hintstyle : hintfull Xft.lcdfilter : lcdlegacy Xft.rgba : rgb
This should work in Ubuntu 8.04 , 8.10 , and 9.04 too , and makes all fonts much more crisp .
Of course , your mileage may vary .
Comparison Screenshots
As promised on reddit , I got back from an awesome snowboard trip so I am able to put up extensive comparison screenshots of the two subpixel hinting engines .
Move your mouse over the following images to see the differences .
Watch especially out for letters like “ m ” where the spacing between the lines is very small .
You might have to wait a bit for the image to load .
I have used all of the most important fonts that I usually use , and just for fun I have added “ Dijkstra ” , which just looks cool .

As you can see , there is quite a difference between these two renderes .
Take an ordinary blog post , highlight a passage you want to comment on , and have it appear on the comment form without having to scroll all the way down .
Or mouseover a comment , then show replies to it as well as all other comments made by that person .
That ’s all in the spirit of Encouraged Commentary , which is a jQuery - powered script by Jim Jeffers .
Now this , I would say , is what JavaScript was meant to do .
Not that fading , zooming , and sliding around are pointless applications of JavaScript .
Impressing people is a lot less important compared to making them feel welcome , and that they ’re a part of something .
In this case , taking part is by quoting text or keeping track of conversations more easily .
Of course , what Jim did may seem more subtle an achievement than what designers and developers try to come up with , or what the ordinary blog visitor would appreciate .
But it ’s one more contribution to that great experience .
I ’ve talked about Issuu last time , so this counts as number two .
To that “ wow , I had a pleasant time commenting on your blog today , Jim , you ’ve made it so easy ! ” kind of feeling .
I hope that I encounter more examples of this — not just in commentary , but for every other aspect of a website .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The effort to delay next month 's scheduled death of analog television suffered a setback in Congress on Wednesday , despite warnings that millions of American homes will not be able to see broadcast shows in three weeks .
Will the end of analog television come in February , or sometime later ?
The answer is now up in the air .
The bill , which passed the Senate unanimously Monday , failed to get the necessary two - thirds vote in the House on Wednesday afternoon .
It was not immediately known whether or when another vote might be taken in the House .
Unless Congress acts quickly , older televisions wo n't pick up TV broadcasts without a digital converter after February 17 .
The switch will not affect cable or satellite subscribers .
On that date , all local stations are required to pull the plug on the analog transmitters they 've used since the invention of television .
The stations have begun digital broadcasts over the past several years
The transition to digital - only broadcasts has been set for nearly a decade , but 6.5 million households , mostly lower - income , have not bought the newer digital TVs or converters for their old sets , according to a study by the Nielsen Co .
In January , the incoming Obama administration urged Congress to extend the date because the switch " has not been adequately funded . "
" There is insufficient support for the problems consumers ( particularly low income , rural and elderly Americans ) will experience as a result of the analog signal cutoff , " transition team Co-chairman John Podesta said in a news release .
The bill , sponsored by Sen. John Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , would allow stations to keep their old transmitters turned on until June 12 .
Do n't Miss Senate OKs delay of digital TV transition
Senators , worried about the static they 'll see when the plug is pulled on analog television broadcasts in the United States , had approved the emergency measure Monday and rushed it to the House floor for a vote Tuesday afternoon .
But representatives put off the vote until Wednesday .
Two members of the Federal Communications Commission sent a letter to Rockefeller and Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , this month " to express our deep concern " that the country is " nowhere near " ready for the signal switch .
Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein called for a delay to give the government more time to get " boots on the ground " to help with the transition .
At least $ 200 million has been spent in recent years to explain to TV viewers how they need to prepare , but one key element of the federal government 's transition plans hit a bottleneck in recent months .
The FCC ran out of money in recent weeks for the $ 40 coupons to help people buy converters for their analog TVs .
The new digital signals also do n't reach some communities now served by the analog signals , the commissioners said .
The FCC opened a call center just last week to help consumers prepare for the analog - to - digital switch .
The four - month delay would come with a cost to local television stations .
Keeping their old transmitters turned on would bring higher power bills and maintenance expenses .

Barack Obama has promised the future First Daughters a dog , and his eldest , 10 - year - old Malia , has zeroed in on a so - called hypoallergenic breed to accommodate her allergies .
Her top pick is a goldendoodle , a cross between a golden retriever and a poodle , though the future prez has hinted about adopting a rescue dog , noting that " a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me . "
We asked Bernadine Cruz , a spokeswoman for the American Veterinary Medical Association , to explain the hypoallergenic concept .
Cruz is a veterinarian in Laguna Hills , Calif. , and in 2006 was also a paid spokeswoman for Allerca , a company that claimed to have bred a hypoallergenic cat .
For an update on Allerca and its research , see this story in The Scientist .
This is an edited transcript .
Why are some people allergic to dogs ?
For many people , being allergic to dogs is a matter of having a sensitivity to a protein in their saliva which also exudes through their skin .
Would a hypoallergenic dog be a good option for people who are otherwise allergic to pooches ?
There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic cat or dog .
One cat has been bred that 's considered hypoallergenic :
A company called Allerca in San Diego found a line of cats considered hypoallergenic because of a naturally occurring divergence ( mutation ) of the protein Fel d 1 .
The protein is ( normally ) found in cat saliva , urine and exudes from their skin .
I 've found people who are extremely allergic to cats who are able to play with them and not have the sneezing .
But in dogs , a mutation in any similar protein has not been found .
What types of dogs might be better for allergy suffers ?
Every person will have his or her own degree of reactivity to certain dogs — their saliva and proteins in their bodies .
Those dogs that are more universally less allergenic come from more specific breeds such as Poodles , Kerry Blue Terriers , Schnauzers , Bichons and Lhasa Apsos .
[ They ] do n’t shed a lot or they go to the groomer frequently and by getting their hair washed and trimmed , get the allergens off their skin .
When those dogs mate purposely or accidentally with breeds outside of those breeds , their offspring may be less allergenic .
But some people can have allergies to a Poodle and then be playing with a German Shepherd and have no problem .
What about the Peruvian Hairless Dog , which that country has offered to the Obamas ?
Is it better for allergy sufferers ?
They 're not going to be shedding a lot , but ( allergenic ) proteins will exude through their skin so that ’s not always going to be the answer .
Are purebred dogs healthier than other dogs ?
There 's no difference .
Are purebreds available at shelters , or only through breeders ?
Many times you will find them in shelters .
Going to shelters or breed rescues is a great way for the Obamas or anyone to get a pet .
Bob Chapman | January 14 , 2009
The concept of decoupling is dead on arrival .
The financial crisis is affecting every country throughout the world .
It is seeping into the real economy in every nation .
Export orders have fallen off a cliff just as consumer buying has .
In every nation the crisis has spread into the real economy via both unemployment and inflation .
The economists and analysts who scoffed at us almost two years ago when we announced that the recession , are all stumbling over themselves in announcing we may have a depression .
Already there is talk that exporters like Japan and China may not recover for years .
As you are aware we believe corporate earnings will be on a level in 2009 with that of a 6,000 Dow Jones Industrial Average .
We also believe that the consumer will take a holiday taking personal consumption down from 70 % to 72 % of GDP to 69 % or less .
We believe the global economy and financial markets will stay depressed for some time to come .
You can not use previous recessions or depressions as a yardstick .
This failure is nothing like we have seen in the past few hundred years .
The average post - war recession lasted about 10 months .
By our calculations we are into the 23rd month and there is no end in sight .
In fact , we are really just getting underway .
Thus far this recession is similar to 1982 , but much more like 1974 so far .
They lasted 16 months respectively .
This implies little to us .
As we said , we have only just begun .
Unemployment is going to be the over - riding factor in the economy .
The official Labor Department report was that in December there was a massive 524,000 decline in non-farm payrolls putting the unemployment rate at 7.2 % , the highest rate in 16 years .
What is compelling is that these statistics are lies .
This game of falsification has been going on since 1980 .
As usual we were treated to more downward revisions , which totaled 154,000 .
October ’s decline of 320,000 increased to 423,000 and November ’s total of 533,000 rose to 584,000 .
That is a total job loss of 678,000 .
For the year of 2008 “ official ” net job losses were 2.6 million , which we estimate to be well over 4 million .
Incidentally , that is the highest since 1945 .
These bogus figures are the result of birth / death modeling , which is simply a government tool to make the numbers whatever the government wants them to be .
Over 6 million jobs have been lost in the past eight years in great part due to free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing .
In December another 149,000 manufacturing jobs were lost .
The only way this can be reversed is by Congress implementing tariffs on goods and services .
If we do not have such legislation , America cannot survive as a first - class nation .
Other employment areas hit hard were trade , utilities , transportation and professional and business services .
The additions were 45,000 in the health care industry , which will help increase costs and 7,000 government jobs .
We ask , how long can state , county , city and local governments continue to hire when half the states are broke ?
In the pursuit of employment and stability the Obama New Deal will end up just as unsuccessful as FDR ’s was .
Controlled planning similar to that of Soviet or Fascist models did n’t work in the 1930s in America and they wo n’t work now .
Nationalization and cartelization did n’t work then and wo n’t work now .
Economic growth from 1933 to 1939 went nowhere .
Per capita GDP was lower in 1939 than it was in 1929 .
Unemployment in 1939 was 17.2 % , which was higher than in 1931 .
Today U6 official unemployment is 13.5 % and long - term unemployment is 17 - 1/2 % .
This was despite 100 % increases in monetary expansion .
Taxes had been tripled .
Employing people became more expensive due to unions and national income guarantees .
This kind of formula inhibits growth .
There were make - work projects - not projects that created permanent jobs .
Laws were passed that inhibited small and medium - sized companies from competing .
Those who dissented were pursued by government .
This went on straight through World War II .
FDR ’s economic and financial policies simply did n’t work and when the elitists saw that they had FDR lead us into war .
Just read John T. Flynn ’s book , “ The Roosevelt Myth . ”
What you saw in the 1930s and what you will see over the next several years is a power grab by elitist sources behind government .
You will see depression , hyperinflation and another contrived war .
Those who tell you that liquidation of assets offer you a fantastic buying opportunity are either dumb or they are deceiving you .
We see no immediate chance of deflation getting an upper hand , although in time it will .
The Fed has expanded its balance sheet to $ 1.2 trillion .
Reserve balances are at $ 600 billion .
Over the past month bank reserves are up over $ 300 billion .
This is immediately monetized .
This is money created out of thin air .
The insiders who want a show of inflation are still frightened by deflation and well they should be .
Their long - term inflation in the end will destroy them .
The real estate markets throughout the world will struggle to find a bottom for sometime to come .
The world ’s biggest market is southern California , a region covered in distressed properties .
The inventory overhang is monumental .
The mantra of the region that real estate never goes down is dead .
The psychology has been broken and may never prevail again .
The good years were great .
Where could you buy a home for 20 % down for $ 35,000 and 20 years later sell a home for $ 1 million ?
That happened to many others , and us but that game has come to an end .
The resetting of billions of dollars in Option ARMs , pick - and - pay loans have begun to hit the upper end of the market in full force .
The forced sale of these homes will devastate an already crippled market .
As California goes so goes the nation .
Currently more than 50 % of sales to mostly speculators are distress sales .
The affects of SB1137 , which delays the foreclosure process , will see its effects vastly dissipate very shortly .
It will end up like all price controls causing more harm than good .
This reality will send prices exceedingly lower .
Bottom line is this market should be reached in 2011 or 2012 , if the state and federal governments do not interfere .
If they do it could last longer .
Not only are ARMs resetting but also unemployment is spiking upward , the state is bankrupt , inventory continues to rise as well as foreclosures and the economy is falling apart .
Sixty percent of Option ARM loans are upside down and a majority of them are in California .
Unless you come up with the cash difference between equity and the loan you are not getting refinanced .
The economy the way it is will make it very difficult for many people to re-qualify .
In fact , more than 50 % wo n’t re-qualify .
It ’s not that politicians do not get it .
It is because the bankers , Wall Street and transnational corporations control the politicians with campaign donations and a bevy of other illegal perks .
Politicians do as they are told and that is approving things such as TARP to enrich the rich .
S&P Case Shiller sees Southern California home prices off 24.9 % in 2009 and 5.1 % in 2010 ; a net 50 % drop is seen and perhaps as much as 70 % from the peak prices .
That puts the $ 550,000 home at $ 275,000 or $ 165,000 .
It is no wonder that observers of the economic and financial scene are concerned when the net worth of US households fell by $ 2.8 trillion in the third quarter alone and by $ 7 trillion in 2008 .
This is the worst adjustment since the 1930s .
As we are seeing the net result is the public is finally reducing debt .
Unfortunately , the reduction in credit deflates the quantity of money in circulation and forces the Fed to print even more money .
In the third quarter mortgage and consumer credit together fell $ 117.4 billion yoy .
Now we have interest rates at zero as the Fed pushes on a string , and they are blindly followed by every major nation , all of which are waiting to get buried .
Wait until you see the dislocation when the Fed attempts to borrow $ 2 trillion in 2009 .
In 2008 , in real estate , stocks and commodities worldwide , $ 70 trillion has been lost .
These events have put the smell of panic in the air , both by individuals and corporations of government , all of which as yet have not totally grasped the gravity and seriousness of their problems .
As we have often said since June 2002 , the Fed is in a box and they can not get out without allowing the system to be purged .
Barron ’s is right , US Treasuries are a bubble and they will in time collapse taking yields considerably higher .
Investors are about to find out that there is no safety in US Treasuries .
Before the year is out these higher yields will force the stock market lower as well as real estate and other yield bearing entities .
As this transpires taxes will rise as government extortion continues apace and inflation will rage .
Government debt is no longer safe in America and that means neither is corporate or personal debt .
All the stimulation has costs - the costs of future debt service and inflation .
As yields rise , the face value of bonds fall and there is a loss .
Foreign nations hold 64.5 % of their foreign exchange reserves in US dollars .
That means a contraction of the value of their reserves , which forces their interest rates up as well .
While these events occur the value of the dollar will fall creating a double whammy on foreign central bank reserves .
At this juncture some foreign central banks and professional investors will panic and when that happens the reserve status of the US dollar – the world ’s reserve currency – will be invalidated .
We have talked about a fiscal 2009 US fiscal budget deficit of $ 1.3 to $ 2 trillion .
In finality we will see a deficit of about $ 2.3 trillion a tribute to the incompetence to the moron who is leaving the White House .
How can any sane investor accept a negative return or even 0.25 % on Treasury bills when inflation is 11 % ?
Stop and think for a second , interest rates cannot go any lower .
They can only go higher .
Even though this situation exists foreigners lend 60 % of their savings to US entities .
Needless to say , this cannot continue and as a result foreigners are in the process of pulling funds out of dollar denominated assets .
We do not have fourth quarter figures as yet , but for the nine months in 2008 foreigners withdrew $ 324 billion .
Unemployment is soaring mainly due to free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing .
We once had a manufacturing base that supplied 28 % of GDP .
Today it is 11 % and falling .
During that period the financial service sector rose form 12 % to 25 % .
The result is the most indebted nation in modern history and the destruction of a high paying job industrial base .
We as a result owe foreigners almost $ 17 trillion .
The US can never recover unless trade tariffs on goods and services are implemented .
Without that America is doomed to be a second world nation as is England .
Even with tariffs debt default has to happen and it will happen and it will occur within the next three years .
There is simply no way out .
This is why during this inflationary and hyperinflationary period you have to be almost totally in gold and silver related assets and eventually only in gold bullion coins .
A new stimulus package of $ 800 billion to $ 1 trillion is n’t going to solve the problem .
It is a package that should have happened two years ago , but our government , Wall Street , banking , economists and analysts refused to recognize the recession that began 23 months ago .
It was n’t politically acceptable and professionals were intimated from calling the economic situation what it was and is .
Most still have not publicly declared recession .
The package will come and go .
A quick jolt will be delivered to the economy lasting six months to a year .
It avoids addressing the systemic problems .
No jobs and a purging of the system .
That will come later with currency controls and debt default .
Remember , the US bond market is ten times the size of the US stock market and if the flow of funds in and out of the country is curtailed the financial world will be bedlam and the world economy will probably collapse .
Even with devaluation and a default , who will buy Treasury paper ?
That means debt internally will be all monetization and the US will be Weimarized .

A Tripod Makes it Brighter

Little Lights for the Big Boys
__________Using a cell phone as a light source is kinda like the old CSN song , " Love the One You 're With . "
Is it gonna light a group shot ?
No .
Is it gonna nuke the sun ?
Hardly .
But it is available .
And what itdo is to get a little kiss of light in there that can provide a nice accent in a low - light shot .
In a pinch it can be a quickie , hand - held key light at close range if you are shooting in very poor ambient .
Think twilight , or night shot , handheld with some of these ISO - Wonder Cameras like the D3 and 5D Mk II .
Shoot with your right hand , add a little close - up light in with your left .
Especially when you a shooting something moody against waning sunset , or just want a kiss of normal color light on someone 's face on a night street shot .
The phone is wireless , flat , can be taped anywhere -- lots of possibilities .
As long as you recognize its limitations ( low light only ) the ideas just start to pop into your head .
Of course , since the light is continuous , time ( and a tripod ) is your friend in a darkened room .
Additionally , you can move it around during the exposure , so you can make the light source do things that a static flash could not possibly do .
Reader Jann Lipka , of Stockholm , demonstrates by using his cell phone screen to " light paint " a photo which was shot with a PhaseOne back .
( How 's THAT for a budget mismatch ! )
You may at first write this off as a gimmick , but just realizing you always have that little light source with you can spark you to find ways to use it .
Hollywood has already latched onto the idea .
If you happened to pick up a DVD of the movie " , " with Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox , check out the extras on disc 2 .
There is a feature on how they filmed all of the car scenes at night without lighting the exteriors .
They just cranked the gain ( it was shot digitally ) and let the exteriors light themselves .
This left the interior of the car far too dark -- but remember that exposure level was very low .
Enter flat - panel lighting .
Michael Mann used ( if memory serves ) flexible panels which were originally designed to be backlights for laptop screens .
He simply covered the interior of the back of the car in black velcro ( ceiling , backs of the seats , etc. ) so he could position the flat - panel LEDs wherever he wanted for the different shots .
This is way cool , IMO , and brings a whole new ethic to lighting the scenes .
You are letting the ambient do the heavy lifting , and shaping up your primary subject matter with small lights that do not need to be very powerful .
Sound familiar ?
You can see the results of this " shaped ambient " style of lighting throughout the whole movie .
I like it , and hope to do some low - light shooting with this technique first chance I get .
If you wanna play like Mann but need a little more light than your cell phone , you 'll want to pick up a Rosco LitePad HO , pictured at left .
These are far brighter than you cell phone , and can run on 110v , cig lighter , or AA's .
It is essentially a matrix of LEDs in a stiff , flat panel that is about 1 / 4 " thick .
They start at about $ 100 US for a 3x6 " panel which is rated at 6000 K for color .
For still shooters , they would be pretty specialized .
But for the PJ's out there who are looking to do multimedia with a 5D Mk II or a D90 , the LitePad would certainly merit a little space in your Domke .
They are small , thin and rugged -- and ready to go whenever you need an accent in a low - light situation .
Have you put a normal cell , an iPhone or a store - bought panel into service for a shot ?
If so , hit us in the comments with a URL to the results .
A slew of layoffs have been announced recently .
And it ’s not just the precious auto manufacturing jobs , either .
It ’s half a million jobs , including white - collar , financial layoffs .
Bank of America plans to axe 35,000 jobs .
Google it .
I find it interesting that Bank of America is going to receive billions of dollars from the federal government , with little to no oversight , yet late last year ( after the toxic financial instruments had been revealed ) they bought subprime lender , Countrywide Financial .
And they just finalized a deal to purchase Merrill Lynch , for $ 50 Billion , with a Federal guarantee ( If I remember correctly , the reason they did n’t buy Lehman Bros is because the Feds were n’t willing to back it ) .
Bank of America ’s strategy , it seems , has been to become the next bank that legislators will deem too big to fail , virtually ensuring that the Feds will bail them out if and when they need it .
Lycanthropes .
They are playing with my money , with your money , hell — with their former employees ’ money : buying other banks and investment firms that are worth less than a steaming turd .
I ’m not defending the jobs , many of which probably needed to go in the first place , but it just strikes me as improper , to be taking billions of dollars in federal aid and guarantees , using that money to buy other crap companies , and then laying off a significant portion of the workforce .
This is the type of thing you should consider when I talk about how those in charge have engineered a depression .
Do n’t you think Bank of America is absolutely thrilled to be able to buy these companies with $ Billions of your money — while at the same time the government absolves them of any possibility of failure ?
( again , with your money ! )
Does this sound like your idea of how to fix the economy ?
I love this Photoshop Evolution Design image !
I personally am not a Photoshop user , but it is always fun to see the Evolution of a product side by side .
In this specific image from PantherHouse , it shows the Photoshop Evolution and the changes that took place with the ongoing years .
If you remember , there was also the Cellphone Evolution Video that provided images through the years from 1985 of the changes , sizes , and designs of many of the popular mobile phones many of us saw as we grew up .
In addition , there is also a great History of PC Hardware given in images , that is also a lot of fun .
It would have helped if Obama had the courage to talk about what everyone in the Middle East was talking about .
No , it was n't the US withdrawal from Iraq .
They knew about that .
They expected the beginning of the end of Guantanamo and the probable appointment of George Mitchell as a Middle East envoy was the least that was expected .
Of course , Obama did refer to " slaughtered innocents " , but these were not quite the " slaughtered innocents " the Arabs had in mind .
There was the phone call yesterday to Mahmoud Abbas .
Maybe Obama thinks he's the leader of the Palestinians , but as every Arab knows , except perhaps Mr Abbas , he is the leader of a ghost government , a near - corpse only kept alive with the blood transfusion of international support and the " full partnership " Obama has apparently offered him , whatever " full " means .
And it was no surprise to anyone that Obama also made the obligatory call to the Israelis .
But for the people of the Middle East , the absence of the word " Gaza " – indeed , the word " Israel " as well – was the dark shadow over Obama 's inaugural address .
Did n't he care ?
Was he frightened ?
Did Obama 's young speech - writer not realise that talking about black rights – why a black man 's father might not have been served in a restaurant 60 years ago – would concentrate Arab minds on the fate of a people who gained the vote only three years ago but were then punished because they voted for the wrong people ?
It was n't a question of the elephant in the china shop .
It was the sheer amount of corpses heaped up on the floor of the china shop .

Sure , it 's easy to be cynical .
Arab rhetoric has something in common with Obama 's clichés : " hard work and honesty , courage and fair play ... loyalty and patriotism " .
But however much distance the new President put between himself and the vicious regime he was replacing , 9/11 still hung like a cloud over New York .
We had to remember " the firefighter 's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke " .
Indeed , for Arabs , the " our nation is at war against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred " was pure Bush ; the one reference to " terror " , the old Bush and Israeli fear word , was a worrying sign that the new White House still has n't got the message .
Hence we had Obama , apparently talking about Islamist groups such as the Taliban who were " slaughtering innocents " but who " cannot outlast us " .
As for those in the speech who are corrupt and who " silence dissent " , presumably intended to be the Iranian government , most Arabs would associate this habit with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ( who also , of course , received a phone call from Obama yesterday ) , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and a host of other autocrats and head - choppers who are supposed to be America 's friends in the Middle East .
Hanan Ashrawi got it right .
The changes in the Middle East – justice for the Palestinians , security for the Palestinians as well as for the Israelis , an end to the illegal building of settlements for Jews and Jews only on Arab land , an end to all violence , not just the Arab variety – had to be " immediate " she said , at once .
But if the gentle George Mitchell 's appointment was meant to answer this demand , the inaugural speech , a real " B- minus " in the Middle East , did not .
The friendly message to Muslims , " a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect " , simply did not address the pictures of the Gaza bloodbath at which the world has been staring in outrage .
Yes , the Arabs and many other Muslim nations , and , of course , most of the world , can rejoice that the awful Bush has gone .
So , too , Guantanamo .
But will Bush 's torturers and Rumsfeld 's torturers be punished ?
Or quietly promoted to a job where they do n't have to use water and cloths , and listen to men screaming ?
Sure , give the man a chance .
Maybe George Mitchell will talk to Hamas – he's just the man to try – but what will the old failures such as Denis Ross have to say , and Rahm Emanuel and , indeed , Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton ?
More a sermon than an Obama inaugural , even the Palestinians in Damascus spotted the absence of those two words : Palestine and Israel .
So hot to touch they were , and on a freezing Washington day , Obama was n't even wearing gloves .
Google may be preparing to lay off thousands of workers , if a Silicon Valley information service is to be believed .
WebGuild cites anonymous inside sources as saying up to 10,000 Google jobs could be on the way out , with smaller scale layoffs already underway .
Quiet Cutbacks
" Hundreds " of employees have been let go in the past few months , the company 's sources claim -- and , they say , a loophole has allowed Google to keep quiet about the cutbacks .
The trick , WebGuild reports , all comes down to categories : Google classifies about 10,000 of its workers as " temporary operational expenses , " which means their positions are not official and could be eliminated without public notification .
( Google officially reports having just over 20,000 full - fledged employees on staff .
The additional 10,000 " temporary " positions speculated would bring the actual total to 30,000 . )
" Google has hundreds of lawyers figuring out how not to get caught , " WebGuild President Daya Baran suggests .
" One of them is by moving workers from job to job every few months so that their status remains temporary .
That is why you probably have never spoken to the same person twice at Google and that is also why there is somebody new on the job and most times you know more about their job than they do , " he says .
Google has yet to publicly comment on any of the speculation .
Searching for Signs
Google 's revenue and profit were up in the third quarter -- a rarity in Silicon Valley this season that could be seen as an indication the rumors may not hold much merit .
Still , if one is searching for signs of possible scaling back , such indications can be found .
The search company is trading its traditionally lavish holiday bashes for more subdued and small - scale celebrations this year , reports released just before the weekend suggest .
Known for its jam - packed parties complete with giant ice sculptures and virtual reality entertainment , Google this year has opted to go for " more economical " activities , such as group volunteering outings followed by casual dinner parties , sources have indicated .
Wrong Rumors
It 's worth noting that cutback rumors have surfaced at Google before , only to end up holding little to no actual truth .
Just a few months ago , reports filled the blogosphere that Google was ending its famous free dinner program for employees -- a perk said to cost the company $ 72 million a year .
It did n't take long for Google to knock the rumor down , however , insisting nothing had changed and it did n't know where the falsehood originated .
Scaleback Speculation
If a Google scaleback were in the works , what would it mean ?
Hypothetically speaking , one might suspect some of Google 's less profitable projects could get less focus .
The company has previously maintained a " 20 percent time " policy for engineers , requiring them to spend one day each week on projects of their own choosing .
Google is also frequently trying out random Labs projects -- everything from the new Gmail themes to the joke - inspiring Google Goggles program debuted in October -- not to mention its various gags and jokes pulled off throughout the year .
The loss of 1,000 workers could theoretically affect these sorts of non-crucial endeavors .
At this point , though , it 's all speculation , and all from limited and unidentifiable sources .
Only time will tell whether or not the rumors prove to be true -- and , until Google decides to address the buzz , all the searching in the world will bring no definite answers .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
Less than a minute into his presidency , Barack Obama committed his first gaffe .
The new president of the United States said in his inaugural address that " Forty - four Americans have now taken the presidential oath . "
That 's wrong .
Forty - three Americans , including Obama , have taken the oath of office .
Israel 's bombardment of Gaza , which has killed hundreds of Palestinians , has outraged many in Iran and throughout the rest of the Muslim world .
Israel says it launched its campaign in retaliation for Hamas rocket fire aimed at civilians in southern Israeli towns .
Teenager ' seriously ill ' with bird flu
By Qian Yanfeng ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-01-20 07:43
A 16 - year - old boy in Hunan province is seriously ill after contracting the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus , the Ministry of Health said Monday .
The teenager , surnamed Wu , is the fourth confirmed case this year , it said on its website .
A native of Guizhou province , Wu fell ill at home on Jan 8 .
On Friday , he was admitted to hospital in Huaihua , Hunan , after his condition worsened , the ministry said .
It did not say if the teenager had received any treatment in his hometown or explain why he was taken to a Hunan hospital .
People close to Wu were given medical checks but no one else was found to have symptoms of the flu , the ministry said .
Prior to the announcement of Wu's case , a ministry official had forecast that more people would become infected with bird flu , but said the risk of an epidemic was low .
Winter is the peak season for the flu , so the chances of people becoming infected are higher , Shu Yuelong , director of the flu control center under the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention , was quoted by the People 's Daily as saying yesterday .
The likelihood of families being infected is on the rise , he said .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) yesterday also warned of the rising threat of bird flu in China and urged people to " maintain normal precautions " against it .
With the Chinese New Year holiday less than a week away , people will be " more exposed to birds as poultry consumption rises " , it said in a statement .
People are therefore urged to " ensure all poultry is well cooked and always wash their hands after contact with raw meat " , it said .
Bird flu claimed its second victim in China this year , when a 27 - year - old woman surnamed Zhang from Jinan , Shandong 's provincial capital , died on Saturday .
A 2 - year - old girl surnamed Peng from Shanxi province who contracted the virus and fell ill on Jan 7 is still " in a serious condition " in hospital , the Ministry of Health said .
On Jan 5 , Huang Yanqing , a 19 - year - old woman in Beijing , became the first Chinese to be killed by the H5N1 virus this year .
Authorities in Shandong and Shanxi said they have stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the virus .
The Shanxi health bureau has launched a slew of emergency measures to counter the risk of bird flu in the wake of the new case .
Provincial cities have been asked to keep a close watch for new cases , while authorities in Luliang , the city in which the 2 - year - old girl lived ; and Taiyuan , the provincial capital where she is now in hospital , have set up a daily reporting system .
The bureau has urged health workers to try every means possible to save the girl 's life , and also reminded doctors to take precautions against potential infection from contact with the virus .
The Shanxi agricultural bureau has urged governments of all levels to examine and eliminate potential sources of the virus , especially at chicken farms .
Since its reemergence in China in 2003 , the H5N1 strain has claimed 22 lives from 33 cases .
The WHO has set its global pandemic alert level at Phase 3 , indicating " no or very limited possibility of human - to - human transmission " .
Although the H5N1 virus has remained largely confined to birds , experts fear it could mutate and be transmitted between people , which would put millions of lives at risk around the world .
ARepublican senator is trying to muscle Atty .
Gen.- designate Eric H. Holder Jr. into promising not to conduct “ witch hunts " -- code language for criminal prosecutions -- of intelligence operatives who engaged in torture during the Bush administration .
It ’s an outrageous demand , and it would be unethical for Holder to accede to it .
Sen . John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , who insisted on a delay in a committee vote on Holder ’s nomination , wants Holder to say “ what his intentions are toward our intelligence personnel who were operating in good faith based on their understanding of what the law was . ”
Cornyn was reacting to Holder ’s entirely appropriate description of waterboarding as torture .
Cornyn ’s own attitude toward what are euphemistically called “ enhanced ” interrogation methods was evident when he rhetorically asked Holder if the nominee would oppose waterboarding if it saved “ perhaps tens of thousands of lives . ”
Cornyn is free to endorse torture and to vote against Holder ’s confirmation in the Judiciary Committee ( which is expected to vote today ) or in the full Senate .
But asking that a prospective attorney general commit in advance to prosecute -- or not prosecute -- potential defendants crosses an ethical line .
Cornyn , a former state Supreme Court justice , should know that .
No less than a nominee for the federal courts , a prospective attorney general should n’t put himself in the position of prejudging cases in exchange for Senate confirmation .
Opponents of any criminal investigation of CIA interrogators -- or of Bush administration lawyers who gave them cover -- argue that President Obama himself has hinted that he is n’t eager to launch prosecutions .
It ’s true that when the president was asked whether he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate torture and wiretapping under the Bush administration , he said that “ we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards . ”
But , in the same interview , Obama said : “ I do n’t believe that anybody is above the law . ”
As this page has argued , Obama would be unwise to succumb to political pressure and announce an open - ended criminal investigation of Bush administration anti-terror policies .
Such a knee - jerk initiative , as Holder said at his confirmation hearing , would “ criminalize policy differences ” between the Bush and Obama administrations .
Moreover , it would be permissible , as a matter of prosecutorial discretion , for the attorney general to conclude that it would be impossible to convict Bush - era officials who acted as part of a post - 9/11 response to terrorism .
But those decisions require a review of evidence , which Holder , at this point , does not have .
A conscientious attorney general will weigh many factors in deciding whether to bring criminal charges .
Pleasing a senator who voted to confirm him is n’t one of them .
Protestors of Proposition 8 in California ( the marriage amendment ) shoved aside a 69 - year - old woman who was bearing a cross .
They reportedly spit on her and stomped on her cross .
They then aligned themselves in a human barricade , blocking the media from getting to or interviewing the woman .
Prop. 8 supporter Jose Nunez , 37 , was assaulted brutally while distributing yard signs to other supporters after church services at the St. Stanislaus Parish in Modesto .
Calvary Chapel Chino
Hills was spray painted by vandals after they learned that the church served as an official collection point for Prop. 8 petitions .
Letters containing white powder ( obviously mimicking anthrax ) were sent to the Salt Lake City headquarters of the Mormon church and to a temple in Los Angeles .
( Thankfully , the FBI said the substance was nontoxic . )
The 25 - year artistic director of the California Musical Theatre , who also happens to be a Mormon , was muscled to resign because of his $ 1,000 donation to the campaign to ban gay marriage in California .
A pro-homosexual , pro-anarchy organization named Bash Back marched into the middle of a church service and flung fliers and condoms to the congregants .
They also hung a banner from the balcony that featured two lesbians in provocative positions at the pulpit .
And lastly , the tolerance - preaching activists also have taken their anger to the blogosphere , where posts have planted ideas ranging from burning churches to storming the citadels of government until our society is forced to overturn Prop .
8 . You even can find donor blacklists online .
The lists include everyone who financially backed Prop. 8 -- even those who gave as little as $ 46 -- with the obvious objective that these individuals will be bantered and boycotted for doing so .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Lots .
First , there 's the obvious inability of the minority to accept the will of the majority .
Californians have spoken twice , through the elections in 2000 and 2008 .
Nearly every county across the state ( including Los Angeles County ) voted to amend the state constitution in favor of traditional marriage .
Nevertheless , bitter activists simply cannot accept the outcome as being truly reflective of the general public .
So they have placed the brainwashing blame upon the crusading and misleading zealotry of those religious villains : the Catholics , evangelical Protestants , and especially Mormons , who allegedly are robbing the rights of American citizens by merely executing their right to vote and standing upon their moral convictions and traditional views .
What 's surprising ( or maybe not so ) is that even though 70 percent of African - Americans voted in favor of Proposition 8 , protests against black churches are virtually nonexistent .
And everyone knows exactly why : Such actions would be viewed as racist .
Yet these opponents of Prop. 8 can protest vehemently and shout obscenities in front of Mormon temples without ever being accused of religious bigotry .
There 's a clear double standard in our society .
Where are the hate - crime cops when religious conservatives need them ?
There were many of us who passionately opposed Obama , but you do n't see us protesting in the streets or crying " unfair . "
Rather , we are submitting to a democratic process and now asking how we can support " our " president .
Just because we do n't like the election outcome does n't give us the right to bully those who oppose us .
In other words , if democracy does n't tip our direction , we do n't swing to anarchy .
That would be like the Wild West , the resurrection of which seems to be happening in these postelection protests .
I agree with Prison Fellowship 's founder , Chuck Colson , who wrote : " This is an outrage .
What hypocrisy from those who spend all of their time preaching tolerance to the rest of us !
How dare they threaten and attack political opponents ?
We live in a democratic country , not a banana republic ruled by thugs . "
Regardless of one 's opinion of Proposition 8 , it is flat - out wrong and un-American to intimidate and harass individuals , churches and businesses that are guilty of nothing more than participating in the democratic process .
Political protests are one thing , but when old - fashioned bullying techniques are used that restrict voting liberties and even prompt fear of safety , activists have crossed a line .
There is a difference between respectfully advocating one 's civil rights and demanding public endorsement of what many still consider to be unnatural sexual behavior through cruel coercion and repression tactics .
One thing is for sure :
The days of peaceful marches , such as those headed up by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , seem to be long gone .
The truth is that the great majority of Prop. 8 advocates are not bigots or hatemongers .
They are American citizens who are following 5,000 years of human history and the belief of every major people and religion : Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman .
Their pro-Prop . 8 votes were n't intended to deprive any group of its rights ; they were safeguarding their honest convictions regarding the boundaries of marriage .
On Nov. 4 , the pro-gay community obviously was flabbergasted that a state that generally leans left actually voted right when it came to holy matrimony .
But that 's exactly what happened ; the majority of Californians -- red , yellow , black and white -- voted to define the margins of marriage as being between one man and one woman .
California is the 30th state in our union to amend its constitution in doing so , joining Florida and Arizona in this election .
Like it or not , it 's the law now .
The people have spoken .
Britain's ' Erin Brockovich ' wins landmark battle against pesticides being spread on fields near homes
Inspirational : Georgina Downs after her High Court victory yesterday
A judge has backed a campaigner 's claim that the Government had failed to protect the public from exposure to toxic cropspraying chemicals .
Georgina Downs won a stunning High Court victory yesterday against the current pesticide safety regulations .
The ruling could force ministers to change the rules to bring them in line with EU guidelines , following evidence that thousands of people living near sprayed fields have suffered burns , cancers and neurological disorders .
Miss Downs has campaigned for seven years to expose the flaws in the Government 's assessment of the chemicals .
She claimed victory yesterday despite being faced with a raft of lawyers and scientists hired by Whitehall to defend its rules .
Miss Downs called for the resignation from the Government of former food and farming minister David Miliband - now Foreign Secretary - for turning his back on the victims of the scandal .
She also called for the heads of senior Government advisers who drew up the flawed safety regime that has now been ruled illegal by the High Court .
Georgina celebrates outside the High Court following her victory against the current pesticide safety regulations
The case centred on a complaint that the safety regime for chemical sprays fell short of safeguards required by EU directives .
The Government had concluded pesticides were safe on the basis that there was no harm caused to residents who only come into contact with chemical sprays rarely and for a short period .
But Miss Downs argued this system - known as the bystander model - did not take into account the long - term effects of repeated exposure to chemicals .
Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich in the film of the same name .
She won an Oscar for her portrayal of the campaigner
She has campaigned for an immediate ban on crop -spraying near homes , schools , playgrounds , workplaces and other public areas .
The campaigner , from Sussex , took action after she and her family fell ill .
She produced two DVDs carrying testimony from other victims whose health had been blighted by living close to fields treated with pesticides .
Georgina , from Chichester , West Sussex , was named the Daily Mail 's Eco Woman of the Year in May
Symptoms included rashes , itching , sore throats , burning eyes , blistering , headaches , nausea , stomach pains and burnt vocal chords .
Many had developed cancer , asthma and ME .
Earlier this year , Miss Downs became the first recipient of the Daily Mail 's Inspirational Eco Woman of the Year Award in recognition of her campaigning .
The judge in the case , Mr Justice Collins , said she had successfully produced ' solid evidence that residents have suffered harm to their health ' .
He urged the Government to change the rules so that farmers are required to give residents 48 hours ' notice of spraying , adding that there was a strong case for buffer zones around homes .
Outside the court , Miss Downs said : ' The fact that there has never been any assessment of the risks to health for the long - term exposure for those who live , work or go to school near pesticide - sprayed fields is an absolute scandal considering that crop -spraying has been a predominant feature of agriculture for over 50 years .
' This is obviously a very significant and landmark ruling for the potentially millions of residents throughout the country who , like myself , live in the locality to pesticide - sprayed fields . '
The food and farming department , DEFRA , defended its record .
A spokesman said : ' The protection of human health is paramount .
' Pesticides used in this country are rigorously assessed to the same standards as the rest of the EU and use is only ever authorised after internationally approved tests . '
Georgina has campaigned against crop spraying near her West Sussex home .
She blames years of illness on pesticides
The campaign by Miss Downs bears a striking resemblance to the one fought by Erin Brockovich in the United States .
She was an unemployed single mother who became a legal assistant and almost single - handedly brought down a power company accused of polluting a city 's water supply .
Her story was made into an Oscar - winning film starring Julia Roberts .
The woman on a mission
Doctors were baffled when Georgina Downs was struck down with a mysterious illness at the age of 13 .
The talented singer and actress , tipped for stardom in the West End after performances at the National Theatre in her early teens , was plagued by tinnitus , severe headaches , muscle wastage , giddiness and lapses of memory , making it impossible for her to accept theatrical roles .
By 19 her weight had plunged to six stone , and her throat was often so swollen with black blisters that she was unable to sing .
But it was n't until 1992 that she first realised crop spraying on farmland behind her family home in Chichester , West Sussex , could be to blame .
It was to mark the start of a long , personal crusade which has led to her being dubbed the ' pesticide nun ' .
The 35 - year - old has no time for a job , a steady romance or a social life , and often works from 9 am to 3am .
Her investigations have uncovered clusters of unexplained illnesses in communities surrounded by crop - sprayed fields .
She said : ' For this campaign I put everything on hold .
I just decided to try to do everything I could to change the Government 's policy on pesticides . '
Remember the cool girls , huddled together in high school restrooms , puffing their cigarettes ?
Well , here ’s consolation for the nerds in the crowd :
Those teen smokers are more likely to experience obesity as adults , according to a new study from Finland .
Girls who smoke 10 cigarettes per day or more are at greatest risk , particularly for abdominal obesity .
Their waist sizes are 1.34 inches larger than nonsmokers ’ waists are as young adults , according to the study in the February 2009 issue of the American Journal of Public Health .
But smoking in adolescence did not necessarily predict weight problems for men , according to the study .
Scientists know a correlation exists between women ’s weight and smoking , said lead study author Suoma Saarni , a researcher with the Department of Public Health in Helsinki .
However , she added , “ We do not know why smoking did not affect men ’s weight , as we do not know why smoking affected women ’s weight . ”
The study followed twins born between 1975 and 1979 with questionnaires mailed shortly after their 16th birthdays .
Researchers collected more data on the 2,278 women and 2,018 men when the twins were in their 20s .
Scientists looked at twins to take into account familial or genetic factors affecting smoking and weight gain , Saarni said .
Half of the participants had never smoked , and 12 percent were former smokers in adolescence .
About 15.5 percent of men and 9.4 percent of women smoked at least 10 cigarettes daily .
By the time participants reached their 20s , weight problems became evident .
By age 24 , roughly 24 percent of men and 11 percent of women were overweight .
However , male smokers were not necessarily more prone to become overweight than nonsmokers .
The young women who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were 2.32 times more likely to become overweight than nonsmokers , according to the study .
The difference could be either biological or cultural , Saarni said .
Biologically , it might be that tobacco and gender specific hormones interact differently in girls and boys in ways that affect appetite and fat distribution .
“ My hunch is that women are more likely to smoke for weight control , especially in adolescence , ” said Sherry Pagoto , assistant professor in clinical psychology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School .
“ When people do quit smoking , one of the reasons they gain weight is that they increase their consumption of foods .
They ’ll start snacking at the times they used to smoke . ”

Advertisement Thousands of rioters across Greece have clashed with police in a third day of violent protests over the fatal shooting of a 15 - year - old boy .
Police used teargas against protesters roaming the streets of Athens throwing petrol bombs and setting fire to buildings , vehicles and rubbish bins .
Dozens of people have been injured throughout the country and there are reports of looting in some areas .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has gone on television to appeal for calm .
He said " extreme elements " were taking advantage of the situation to engage in vandalism and pledged to compensate businesses damaged .
The riots began on Saturday after Alexandros Grigoropoulos was shot dead by police in the Exarchia area of Athens .

Television pictures on Monday evening showed small fires burning in the centre of Athens and hundreds of people wandering through the streets , some attacking banks , businesses and vehicles .
A large Christmas tree in central Syntagma Square was set on fire and windows were smashed on hotels , government buildings and departments stores .
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant , in a hotel in the city surrounded by demonstrators , said he could see petrol bombs , flares and rocks being thrown towards parliament while protesters cheered .
There was a smell of tear gas and black smoke rising from the square , obscuring the famous Acropolis .
Joast Meijerink , a guest at an Athens hotel set on fire , told the BBC the rioters had caused significant damage to the capital .
" Everything that could be demolished was demolished , " said Mr Meijerink .
Protests have also taken place at Greek embassies in Berlin and London , but there was no reported violence .
Politically motivated Earlier on Monday , hundreds of students clashed with riot police in Thessaloniki , Greece 's second biggest city .
Students of the city 's Aristotle university were reported to have stockpiled petrol bombs on campus , protected by laws preventing security forces from entering the grounds of schools , universities and polytechnics .
There was also trouble in the central city Trikala and police stations were attacked in Piraeus , Corfu and Thessaloniki , where an officer was injured .
Our correspondent says opposition parties are capitalising on the national sense of outrage and the government is getting the blame for an individual policeman 's actions .
The government is extremely vulnerable , reeling from a series of scandals and only has a majority of one in parliament , he adds .
' Deeply saddened '
In a nationally televised address on Monday , Prime Minister Karamanlis called for calm , unity , restraint and a sense of solidarity with the dead boy 's family .
" Unfortunately , extreme elements have exploited this sad event for their own purposes , " he said .

Mr Karamanlis condemned the attacks on property by rioters as unjustified and said he had asked the economy minister to ensure that those who had suffered losses would be compensated .
A post -mortem is being carried out on the body of Alexandros Grigoropoulos to determine the trajectory of the bullet that killed him .
Two police officers have been arrested in connection with the incident .
The officer who fired contends it was a ricochet from a warning shot , but witnesses told Greek TV it was a direct hit .
The boy 's family has hired an independent pathologist to ensure there is no cover - up .
On Sunday , the prime minister wrote to the boy 's parents : " In these difficult moments please accept my condolences for the unfair loss of your son .
Like all Greeks I am deeply saddened . "
However , analysts say nothing the politicians or authorities can say or do is likely to reduce the anger that is building .
A similar shooting incident in 1985 led to a lengthy vendetta between the youths and police , with violence continuing for years .

This is an elementary Latin course accompanied with a detailed grammar based upon Kennedy 's Public School Latin Grammar designed to introduce one to the world of classical languages .
A basic understanding of grammatical terminology would be helpful ; however , it is not required .
Basic definitions of terms will be explained in Lessons 1 and 2 , and later elaborated as needed .
For detailed explanations and examples of English grammatical terms , please consult the English Grammar textbook .
However , Latin grammar is quite different from that of English , and thus it requires different grammatical terms to explain the concepts .
These will be taught as needed .

WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama is preparing to scrap the way President Bush oversaw domestic security in the White House and name a former Central Intelligence Agency official to coordinate counterterrorism , people close to the transition said Wednesday .
The plan being discussed would eliminate the independent homeland security adviser ’s office and assign those duties to the National Security Council to streamline sometimes overlapping functions .
A deputy national security adviser would be charged with overseeing the effort to guard against terrorism and to respond to natural disasters .
Democrats close to the transition said Mr. Obama ’s choice for that job was John O. Brennan , a longtime C.I.A. veteran who was the front - runner to head the spy agency until withdrawing in November amid criticism of his views on interrogation and detention policies .
His appointment would not require Senate confirmation .
Mr. Obama has made no final decision about how to structure domestic security in his White House , and advisers plan to wait until his inauguration to conduct a formal review .
But many key advisers have publicly advocated folding it into the National Security Council , and those involved in discussions said the only real questions appeared to be how to do that and how to explain it without looking like domestic security was being downgraded as a priority .
The government - funded British Council promotes British culture abroad A disk containing sensitive personal details of about 2,000 staff of the British Council - the UK 's worldwide cultural body - has been lost .
The disk , which was mislaid in December by courier firm TNT , contained names , salaries , national insurance numbers and bank account numbers .
But the British Council said the data could not be accessed as the disk was securely encrypted .
It is the latest in a series of cases of official data being lost .
Taking steps A British Council spokesman said : " It was sent according to our agreed process with the usual secure TNT courier service but was not received by our human resources team .
" TNT has informed us that they are still taking steps to find the disk .
" The data only included staff records and no information about external British Council contacts is involved . "
It is clear that Whitehall 's culture of carelessness about confidential data has not ended
Chris Huhne MP
The disk was not an ordinary CD - ROM or DVD but an optical disk that can only be read by a particular type of reader - but a full investigation of how data is handled at the British Council has been ordered .
The spokesman added : " These precautions ensure that the data is extremely secure in the unlikely event that the disk should fall into the wrong hands .
The system for transferring data is being reviewed and in the meantime data is not being sent . "
Another warning
The loss of the disk was revealed a day before the second reading of the Coroners and Justice Bill in the House of Commons on Monday .
The act would give government departments more power to share data .
RECENT LOSSES
Nov 2007 : 25 m people 's child benefit details , held on two discs Dec 2007 : 7,685 Northern Ireland drivers ' details Dec 2007 : 3 m learner drivers ' details lost in US Jan 2008 : 600,000 people 's details lost on Navy officer 's stolen laptop June 2008 : Six laptops holding 20,000 patients ' details stolen from hospital July 2008 : MoD reveals 658 laptops stolen in four years Dec 2008 : 5,000 nursery - age children 's details lost by Leeds City Council Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne , who discovered the loss , said : " Despite the prime minister 's assurances after the last data loss on a memory stick in a pub car park , it is clear that Whitehall 's culture of carelessness about confidential data has not ended .
" This is another warning that ministers cannot be trusted with the information that they seek on all of us as part of the identity card database . "
He added : " It is a curious way for the government to celebrate European Data Protection Day on Wednesday . "

PRESIDENT
Obama did not offer his patented poetry in his Inaugural Address .
He did not add to his cache of quotations in Bartlett ’s .
He did not recreate J.F.K.’s inaugural , or Lincoln ’s second , or F.D.R. ’s first .
The great orator was mainly at his best when taking shots at Bush and Cheney , who , in black hat and wheelchair , looked like the misbegotten spawn of the evil Mr. Potter in “ It ’s a Wonderful Life ” and the Wicked Witch of the West .
Such was the judgment of many Washington drama critics .
But there ’s a reason that this speech was austere , not pretty .
Form followed content .
Obama was n’t just rebuking the outgoing administration .
He was delicately but unmistakably calling out the rest of us who went along for the ride as America swerved into the dangerous place we find ourselves now .
Feckless as it was for Bush to ask Americans to go shopping after 9/11 , we all too enthusiastically followed his lead , whether we were wealthy , working - class or in between .
We spent a decade feasting on easy money , do n’t - pay - as - you - go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture .
We did so while a supposedly cost - free , off - the - books war , usually out of sight and out of mind , helped break the bank along with our nation ’s spirit and reputation .
We ca n’t keep blaming 43 for everything , especially now that we do n’t have him to kick around anymore .
On Tuesday the new president pointedly widened his indictment beyond the sins of his predecessor .
He spoke of those at the economic pinnacle who embraced greed and irresponsibility as well as the rest of us who collaborated in our “ collective failure to make hard choices . ”
He branded as sub-American those who “ prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame . ”
And he was n’t just asking Paris Hilton “ to set aside childish things . ”
As Linda Hirshman astutely pointed out on The New Republic ’s Web site , even Obama ’s opening salutation 
“ My fellow citizens , ” not “ fellow Americans ”  invoked the civic responsibilities we ’ve misplaced en masse .

When someone goes through a stressful experience they usually require some time off to clear their head , regain focus , and recover from the pain and suffering .
Of course , in white culture these experiences are most often defined as finishing high school , making it through three years of college , or working for eleven months straight with only two weeks vacation and every statutory holiday ( “ they do n’t count because I had to spend them with family . ” )
Though you might consider finishing school or having a good job to be “ accomplishments ” many white people view them as burdens .
As such , they can only handle them for so long before they start talking about their need to “ take a year off ” to travel , volunteer , or work abroad .
It is most common for the person taking the year off to use this time to travel ( see Post # 19 for reasons why ) .
Generally , they will start off with a set amount of money that will use to travel for as long as possible .
This explains why a white person with an $ 800 backpack will haggle with a poverty - stricken street vendor about a $ 2 dollar plate of food .
If you work with this person , be sure to give them a FAKE email address on their last day on the job or you will be inundated with emails about spiritual enlightenment and how great the food is compared to similar restaurants back home .
Also , within the first five days following departure , this person will come up with the idea to write a book about their travel experience .
Sadly , more books about mid-twenties white people traveling have been written than have been read .
Some of the more enterprising white people will extend their time off by working abroad as a bartender , ski lift operator , or english teacher .
Their stories , emails , and publishing plans will be identical to the previous white person but will include additional stories about working and complaints about “ tourists . ”
Finally , there is the white person who takes a year off to volunteer at home or abroad .
Though they are equally likely to write long emails about their experience , these people are often using the experience as an excellent resume pad for their application to law school .
This way they are able to put off real life without the crippling derailment of a career or education .
Regardless of how a white person chooses to spend their year off , they all share the same goal of becoming more interesting to other people .
Sadly , the people who find these stories interesting are other white people who are politely listening until they can tell their own , more interesting story about taking a year off .
Thankfully , there is an enormous opportunity for personal gain .
You see , whenever a white person takes a year off it opens up a valuable apartment , job opportunity or admissions slot .
Consider it to be the most pretentious form of affirmative action .

This past summer , a group of seven amateur astronomers from Italy worked on an observation campaign of Pluto , with hopes of capturing an image of its moon , Charon .
“ Imaging Charon is very difficult and nobody has spotted it with amateur equipment , so far , ” said Daniele Gasparri , one of the members of the group .
The team made several attempts , and finally , one member of the group , Antonello Medugno , took this interesting image .
“ After many calculations , ” said Gasparri , “ we are sure that this image shows clearly Pluto and Charon , for the first time with amateur equipment . ”
Comparing the image to the graphic which shows the position of Pluto and Charon on the same date , it ’s obvious , they nailed it !
This is quite a feat considering their equipment was an “ amateur ” 14 - inch telescope !
Also , as The Bad Astronomers points out , Charon was n’t discovered until 1978 , and then a 61 - inch telescope was used !
Compare their image to one taken by Hubble :
Not bad !!
Gasparri is an astronomy student , and a contributor to the Italian astronomy magazine Coelum .
With the support of the magazine , he coordinated the effort to image Charon .
Medugno used an 14 ″ Schmidt - Cassegrain telescope , a Starlight Xpress SXV - H9 CCD camera and a R - IR passband filter .
The image was processed using the Lucy - Richardson Algorithm of the RAW image , composed of 21 frames of 6 seconds of exposure each , with a focal of 8900 mm .
“ All data confirm the image : the magnitude , separation , and position angle , ” said Gasparri .
Nice work !
Check out Gasparri ’s website of more astronomical images he has taken .
Teachers ' behaviour outside of school will also be under scrutiny Teachers in England will have to act as " role models " both in and out of school under a proposed new code of conduct .
They could face losing their status if they get drunk and into arguments while out socialising , or do not get help for drink or drug problems .
The draft code has been published by the General Teaching Council for England ( GTCE ) .
GTCE chief executive Keith Bartley said the code set out to teachers that they had to consider their place in society .
' Responsible profession ' Sarah Stephens , director of policy for the GTCE , said : " What it means is to act as a role model , holding the bar for children in terms of your own conduct outside the classroom . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Teachers are human beings .
Their private lives should not be the subject of scrutiny by anybody Keeves , Horsham , UK The document says teachers should " uphold the law and maintain standards of behaviour both inside and outside school that are appropriate given their membership of an important and responsible profession " .
The GTCE said the behaviour of teachers could still be inappropriate even if it did not involve doing something illegal .
GTCE head of professional regulation David James said : " You might have an incident in a pub , someone has had too much to drink and there 's been some pushing and shoving .
" It has n't resulted in a criminal offence , but we would look at it in great detail .
It is not something we would want teachers to do , but professionally would it have an impact on their registration status ? "
On alcohol or substance abuse , he said : " We have the ability to impose restrictions on registration , ways you can remain as a teacher , but you must undertake some training , or counselling or you must give us a medical report . "
' Slippery slope '
Teachers could also be disciplined if they fail to pass on suspicions about child abuse .
The code says they should " take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and young people under their supervision ; endeavour to pick up on and address issues that impact adversely on them at the earliest possible stage " .
The GTCE is conducting a consultation on the document until February .
Nansi Ellis , head of education policy at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , voiced concern about the code .
She said : " We urge the GTCE to tread carefully with its proposed code of conduct for teachers .
" It is treading a potentially slippery slope if it creates a code of practice which covers teachers ' behaviour in their private lives . "
John Bangs , head of education at the National Union of Teachers , said teachers were already aware that serious misconduct would lead to disciplinary action .

Carlos Castaneda , an anthropology student at UCLA , had an incredible story to tell about his peyote - fueled adventures with an old Indian sorcerer he met at a bus depot on the Mexican border .
He first wrote it up as " field notes " and turned it in as his master 's thesis .
His magical mystery tour through the " Yaqui Way of Knowledge " was published in 1968 , and by the early ' 70s Castaneda was a best - selling author and worldwide spiritual celebrity .
The Indian " brujo " who took Castaneda under his wing was Juan Matus , but Carlos called him " Don Juan . "
On his way to shamanic enlightenment , Castaneda learned how to fly , talked to a bilingual coyote and encountered amazing columns of singing light .
His early books , especially " Journey to Ixtlan , " were full of vivid descriptions of the barren beauty of the Mexican desert and the American Southwest .
It was magical .
It was inspiring .
But was it true ?
Was it fiction ?
Was it symbolic ?
Or was it the hallucinogenic fantasy of a Latino con man ?
Did Don Juan really exist ?
Nobody knew , but we bought the books by the millions -- 10 titles in 17 languages .
Castaneda was on the cover of Time magazine on March 5 , 1973 , but his death on April 27 , 1998 , went uncovered by the news media .
He was a cultural icon , but it took nearly two months for the news of his death -- in his Los Angeles home at age 72 from liver cancer -- to make it into the newspapers .
During his life , and into death , Castaneda went to great lengths to avoid the public spotlight .
He scrupulously avoided having his picture taken , his background investigated or his personal life revealed .
For Castaneda , mystery was better than reality .
Few envisioned this articulate author and " impeccable warrior " for what he was -- a short , pudgy Peruvian .
His ex-wife once said he looked like a Cuban bellhop .
But he had charm and charisma and loved to appear at celebrity parties in Southern California .
And that 's where Castaneda met the writer Irving Wallace and his 17 - year - old daughter , Amy , in 1973 .
Thirty years later , Amy Wallace has written an intimate , engaging memoir of her life and love affair with the mystery man of the shamanic ' 70s .
" The Sorcerer 's Apprentice -- My Life With Carlos Castaneda " ( North Atlantic Books , 424 pages , $ 25 ) is the story of a spiritual seeker , troubled daughter , spurned lover , and , as Wallace describes herself , a " typical educated California hippie . "
Her sexual affair with the sorcerer did not begin until the 1990s , when Castaneda resurfaced to lead pricey workshops for a small circle of devotees .
Among the spiritual techniques taught in the sessions were " magical passes , " an esoteric series of body movements supposedly passed down through Don Juan and 27 earlier generations of secret masters .
As it turned out , Castaneda had another sort of pass to make at Amy Wallace .
There were martinis , dinner and an awkward encounter in a seedy motel room in Los Angeles .
Once they got in bed , Carlos Castaneda proved to be no Don Juan .
" Carlos was so nervous that he insisted we leave our clothes on .
He seemed anxious to complete the act quickly and was strangely businesslike , evidently struck with performance anxiety , " Wallace writes .
" As he fumbled with buttons , I stopped him and whispered , ' Let 's relax for a while -- Carlos , let 's kiss for a while . ' "
Wallace soon lost her " sorceric virginity " and began an on - again , off - again affair with her spiritual teacher .
Looking back on it now , Wallace sees herself then as emotionally damaged and adrift , struggling with the death of her famous father and literary collaborator .
" When the father I adored died in 1990 , within two years I had found a surrogate in Carlos .
I was ' engaged ' to a substitute daddy -- virtually the same age as him , an equally best - selling and ground - breaking author for a generation .
I was only half - aware of my motivations . "
Wallace 's portrayal of Castaneda as a manipulative , deceptive and often cruel lover echoes the 1997 portrait painted by his ex-wife , Margaret Runyan Castaneda , in her memoir " A Magical Journey With Carlos Castaneda . "
Two other critical looks at Castaneda 's career were published in 2000 -- " Castaneda 's Journey : The Power and the Allegory " by Richard DeMille ; and " Carlos Castaneda : Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties " by Jay Courtney Fikes .
Wallace tells the tale from the perspective of devotee and lover , and that 's both the book 's strength and weakness .
Her story is almost too raw .
There 's too much gossip and too many sour grapes .
It 's poorly edited , and 100 pages too long .
But it has many fine moments and hilarious anecdotes about the peccadilloes of a neo - pagan cult .
To her credit , Wallace does n't turn her beloved guru into a crazed cult leader .
" Carlos was not a shifty huckster but a misguided philosopher whose experience of power was corrupting , " she writes .
" Thus he damaged many lives , at the same time exalting many others . "
In the end , " Sorcerer 's Apprentice " stands as a cautionary tale about the dangers of New Age charisma posing as true love and ultimate truth .

Fun with Functional Dependencies
or ( Draft ) Types as Values in Static Computations in Haskell
Abstract
This paper illustrates how Haskell 's type class system can be used to express computations .
Since computations on the type level are performed by the type checker , these computations are static ( i.e. , performed at compile - time ) , and , since the type system is decidable , they always terminate .
Haskell thus provides a means to express static computations , and has a clear distinction between static and dynamic computations .
Instance declarations define predicates over types , or in the case of multi- parameter classes , relations between types .
With functional dependencies , multi- parameter classes directly specify functions , and thanks to them you can get the type checker to compute the values of function applications , rather than just checking that the result of an application is what you say it is .
This way of expressing computation gives us the power of a small , first - order functional programming language , with pattern matching and structural recursion .
We can easily define things like booleans , natural numbers , lists , and functions over these types .
We give some examples of completely static computations , the most elaborate one being an implementation of insertion sort .
We also give examples where static and dynamic computations are mixed .

If you think Paul Shanklin ’s “ Magic Negro ” parody is offensive , please take a moment to watch Dave Chappelle ’s “ Blind White Supremacist ” routine and prepare to go through the roof .
This episode of adult humor is about a blind black man named Clayton Bigsby who is brought up white and becomes a white supremacist .
Needless to say , Chappelle often takes aim at attitudes about racial matters .
He makes liberal use of the “ N ” word .
“ Do n’t let the liberal media tell you how to think and feel , ” Bigsby proclaims from inside his white hood , his identity protected as he rants and raves before a white audience .
“ If you have hate in your heart , let it out . ”
When his hood is finally taken off , exposing Bigsby as black , the head of a white person in the audience explodes .
Others express shock or disgust .
It ’s all about confronting racial stereotypes .
It is laugh out loud funny .
I confess that I am the owner of several Paul Shanklin CDs and Dave Chappelle DVDs .
Republican Party chairman candidate Chip Saltsman ’s distribution of Shanklin ’s “ Magic Negro ” song , which first aired on the Rush Limbaugh show , has been viewed by some commentators in the liberal media as a disgusting indication of how the Republican Party is insensitive on matters of race .
Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has criticized Saltsman for distributing the CD with the song .
It is one song among many in the “ We Hate the USA ” Shanklin parody .
The liberal Washington Post has now weighed in on the controversy , running an editorial praising two of Saltsman ’s opponents , Mike Duncan and Saul Anuzis , for agreeing that it was inappropriate to distribute such a song .
But if Duncan and Anuzis ca n’t stand up to the liberals in the media for concocting this phony controversy , how can they take on the liberals in the Democratic Party ?
What if Saltsman had distributed Chappelle ’s “ Blind White Supremacist ” DVD instead of the “ Magic Negro ” CD ?
This is far more “ offensive ” than the “ Magic Negro . ”
The answer may lie in the fact that Shanklin is white and Chappelle is black .
Plus , “ Chappelle ’s Show ” airs on Comedy Central , a source of much of the news that amuses the liberals on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
In other words , this kind of humor is okay .
Factors such as the color of who is saying what can matter a lot to the liberal intelligentsia .
Their peculiar standards of discourse require not a discussion of what is being said , but who is saying it , and why .
That is why they are cheerleaders for “ hate crimes ” legislation , which mandate an inspection of one ’s mental condition .
But it is the liberal mental condition that bears scrutiny .
It used to be called political correctness but in the modern era is also known as Obamamania .
It has authoritarian tendencies .
In the liberal world , a white person cannot under any circumstances use the term “ Negro , ” even if it originated from a Los Angeles Times article by a black liberal , as it did in the “ Magic Negro ” case .
Here ’s how the Post put it : “ There is a difference between an African American writer using the word ‘ Negro ’ in an ironic way and the Limbaughs and Saltsmans of the world thinking it is acceptable in common usage . ”
Acceptable in common usage ?
Remember that Saltsman distributed a funny CD .
What ’s more , the song notes that the term came from the Los Angeles Times article .
The Post , of course , knows all of this .
That is why it is so difficult to take the editorial seriously .
But it does demonstrate how a major liberal paper intends to use this made - up “ controversy ” in order to try to influence the direction of the Republican Party .
That is what this entire “ scandal ” is all about .
In the privacy of their editorial offices , the liberals must be laughing at the Republicans who take this controversy seriously .
Maybe they do have a sense of humor after all .
Can you believe that we have reached the point in this country that a major liberal paper would devote an editorial to the political implications of somebody distributing a funny song ?
By the way , the Shanklin “ Magic Negro ” CD is about Barack Obama but features an Al Sharpton - type character complaining about Obama ’s blackness .
This is something worth commenting on , not only because Obama is becoming President of the U.S. but because Sharpton continues to be a major figure in the Democratic Party , even making regular appearances on the “ conservative ” Fox News Channel .
In this context , did you notice that Sharpton was in the news recently ?
Like many others in the media , Keith Richburg of the Post noted that Caroline Kennedy went out to lunch on December 18 with Sharpton in New York , apparently feeling that she needed his help to get an appointment as senator .
But like others in the media , Richburg failed to note that Sharpton makes vile and racist accusations against white people , such as the well - documented case of his involvement in helping perpetrate the Tawana Brawley hoax .
That ’s when a black woman falsely accused white men of raping her .
Of course , all of this is forgiven and forgotten by the liberal media .
And they do their best to make sure we forget it , too .
But you can bet they will never let the public forget that Chip Saltsman distributed a funny CD about the “ Magic Negro . ”
Thanks to people like Newt Gingrich , they will keep hammering this until the Republican National Committee elects its chairman in late January .
Notice that Caroline Kennedy is never asked about the propriety of associating with somebody like Sharpton and seeking his endorsement of her Senate bid .
This shows , as if we need more proof , that there is one standard for Democrats and another for Republicans .
Democrats can do and say almost anything they want on racial matters .
Republicans are supposed to be condemned for distributing funny songs .
What is happening in the brouhaha over Saltsman is another attempt by the liberal media to decide what we can talk , write and even joke about .
More than that , it is an effort to determine who is entitled to be chairman of the Republican Party .
But the target is not only Saltsman ; it is Limbaugh , who originally aired the parody .
If the liberal media can defeat Saltsman ’s bid for RNC chairman , on the basis of phony charges , they can then take on the real offender , in their view , who is Limbaugh ―and others like him in the conservative talk - radio community .
It is tragic and pathetic that a figure like Gingrich would join the media lynch mob .
It is another indication that Gingrich is in business now to please the liberal media and take the GOP in a left - wing direction .
Perhaps he will change his mind on the matter .
He changed his position several times on the Wall Street bailout .
In Chappelle ’s “ Blind White Supremacist ” routine , the Bigsby character proclaims , “ America is at war with al Qaeda but we ’re still losing the war against Al Sharpton . ”
There ’s a lot of truth in that quip .
That Sharpton can remain on the political scene as a power broker in the Democratic Party , while a Republican is savaged in the media for distributing a funny CD , illustrates the real problem and danger .
The forces on the political left want to give a pass or a blank check to the Sharptons of the world but they want to control what conservatives think , say , write , and even laugh about .
Any sensible conservative has to see in all of this the laying of the groundwork for federal measures , including a “ Fairness Doctrine , ” restricting what can be said or aired in the media .
The kind of attitude we see in the liberal media should not be pandered to or negotiated with .
Nothing can be gained by surrendering to it .
It must be confronted and ridiculed .
And we should also maintain our sense of humor .
Indeed , in the future it would be better to laugh at the media rather than take their phony “ scandals ” seriously .
Economy claims ' conservative MoveOn ' John Byrne
Published : Tuesday December 9 , 2008
Print This Email This With casino suffering , Freedom 's Watch drowns
The conservative lobbying group whose message was trumpeted by former Bush Press Secretary Ari Fleischer is no more .
Freedom's Watch , a group aimed at bolstering the " War on Terror , " has gone the way of the Dodo on the back of economic woes for the group 's largest donor , casino heavyweight Sheldon Adelson .
Fleischer , Bush 's press secretary when the US invaded Iraq , served as a member of the Board .
Billed as being the right - wing alternative to MoveOn.org , the group 's financing dissolved as Adelson 's Las Vegas Sands casino company hemorrhaged .
Sands ' stock value has plummeted 95 % this year -- costing Adelson some $ 16 billion .
Sands is saddled with massive debt .
" The group funneled millions into congressional and Senate races , but failed to make a major impact in the 2008 election where Democrats captured the White House and grew their majorities in both chambers of Congress , " the Wall Street Journal noted Monday .
Freedom's Watch 's demise was first reported on Politicker.com .
The site said the group was " plagued by staff shake - ups , early loses in House special election in which they invested heavily , " and Adelson 's financial losses .
Due to Adelson 's losses , the conservative lobbying effort had less cash to throw around in November -- though it spent $ 30 million through the 2008 election , its original plans had called for $ 200 million .
They did , however , finance opposition to Democrat Jim Martin in Georgia , who lost his senatorial bid to incumbent Republican Sen.

Did you , too , get that frisson of déjà vu when you first heard about the bank bailout and its rationale ?
If you do n’t hand over untold trillions of dollars in the next five minutes , the economy is going to explode .
This was how the PATRIOT
Act got rammed through Congress in record time , before anyone had a chance to even read the voluminous bill , surrendering what ’s left of our liberties and giving the president dictatorial powers : give us your freedom , or else the terrorists are going to blow the country up .
This was also how the Bush administration and its neoconservative amen chorus whipped up war hysteria against Iraq : " We do n’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . "
Unless we invaded Iraq immediately , we were told , Saddam would unleash his legendary " weapons of mass destruction "  yes , even against the continental United States .
The methodology at work here might be called the Dershowitz Principle , after America ’s most famous theoretician of torture , who maintains that what qualifies as torture is defensible in an extreme situation .
That is , when life suddenly morphs into a Jack Bauer - like scenario , in which the clock is ticking and you have to torture the evil terrorist or else they ’ll l blow up the White House , Capitol Hill , and the corner grocery for good measure .
It seems the clock is always ticking .
We live in a state of perpetual " emergency , " and every day we ’re faced with fresh ultimatums .
I ’ve had boyfriends like that .
" If you do n’t do such - and - such immediately , I ’m going to hold my breath until I turn blue  and then you ’ll be sorry . "
The first few times I fell for it ; after all , I did n’t want a medical emergency on my hands .
Now that I ’m wiser , though not all that old yet , my response is more measured : " Blue really is n’t your color , you know . "
The Dershowitz Principle is that morality and truth bend under extreme conditions , like even the strongest steel  if it ’s hot enough .
The idea , then , is to raise the temperature and create a crisis , or at least convince enough people to panic .
The resulting stampede tramples liberty and the accouterments of human civilization underfoot .
That ’s the Dershowitz Principle in action : subject people to extreme conditions  or convince them that some Armageddon - like event is about to take place  and they will do anything .
Pass the PATRIOT Act .
Go to war .
Yes , even engage in torture [ pdf ] .
As long as the effects of the hysteria last  and how long was it before the country began to recover from its 9/11 - induced madness ?
 people are infinitely malleable .
Or so the pattern would seem to suggest .
However , there ’s a catch : after a while , the pattern becomes all too obvious .
If it ’s always an emergency , the numbing effect on the public eventually inures it to this appeal .
The passage of the PATRIOT Act and the march to war were propelled by the politics of fearmongering , with the sole argument being that if we do n’t do this , unimaginably horrible events will shortly follow .
This view was pushed , in every possible way , by a small but well - connected and media - savvy group of intellectuals and policy wonks known as the neoconservatives .
The neocons had an agenda , and a very specific goal , formulated well before 9/11 : war with Iraq , to be followed by wars of " liberation " throughout the Middle East .
Already ensconced in the Bush administration , they were in a perfect position to take full advantage of a fluid situation and manipulate the emotions unleashed by 9/11 to make the case for war .
That case , as we know , was a veritable anthology of fantastic fiction , a multi- threaded narrative of imaginative albeit not particularly artful lies that , in retrospect , often seem like the script of a mediocre made - for - television movie , the kind they show at the crack of dawn .
This is now the generally accepted view , yet it was n’t always so .
Why , it seems like only yesterday that Antiwar.com and a few other skeptical ( mostly online ) voices were raised against the war hysteria , challenging the rationale for the invasion and opposing the conventional wisdom that took the government ’s war propaganda as fact .
The hate mail we received was massive , and it continued for months : how dare we have a Web site opposing war  at a time like this !
It was n’t that we were insufficiently patriotic ; we were " traitors . "
That was the recurrent theme of these rude missives .
As time wore on , however , and the facts  or , rather , the lack of them  began to emerge , the clock - is - ticking crowd was put on the defensive .
When no WMD showed up in Iraq and the hunt for them by the U.S. military was finally called off , the pundits and the public began to revise their understanding of the truth .
That is , they engaged in " revisionism , " which is not , contra certain televised airheads , a watering down of the truth but a clarification of what actually occurred in light of new information .
The Iraq war revisionists began to discover that all the stories  the " links " to al - Qaeda , the secret Iraqi nuclear program , the plot to bomb American cities using drones laden with biological weapons  all of it was a tall tale dreamed up somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon .
The perpetrators of these lies were government officials who deliberately misled Congress and the American people , profited from the misperception , and used government resources to do it .
Now totally discredited , the " experts " and " patriots " of yesteryear are today ‘s prime candidates for an investigation by a federal prosecutor .
We ’ve come full circle , and then some , because we supposedly have a similar " crisis " on the domestic front , an economic 9/11 , in which " emergency " powers were demanded , and  in spite of initial balking on the part of some  quickly granted , without much discussion .
Now we are being told  or , at least , Bloomberg News is being told  that we have no right to know how the ransom money paid to these mystery men is being dispensed , or any details beyond the unimaginable sums being bandied about .
And the economy , supposedly crippled by a lack of liquidity and the complete absence of lending , is said to be still in the grip of a serious " crisis . "
What gives ?
What gives is a replay of the prelude to war with Iraq , only this time we ’re talking about the road to complete government control over the economy , with the banks  the big banks  calling the tune .
That old clock is ticking away , and the sound of it is getting louder with each passing day , with daily appeals from new quarters  the banks , the Big Three , every county and city in the country .
To satiate these growing crowds of supplicants , a huge " stimulus " package will no doubt pass , along with an addendum of " reforms , " with so many special interests feeding at the trough that a few are bound to drown in their own slop .
As the system of free enterprise , infamously called capitalism , but in reality just good old American individualism , passes from the scene , along with our constitutional liberties  felled by the previous administration  our half - forgotten childhood of adventurous intensity and love of freedom passes into history .
Bypassing adulthood completely , we fall into a static senescence and fearful inflexibility .
As President - elect Barack Obama ushers in a new era of all - pervasive government control over the economic life of the nation , an economic version of the PATRIOT Act , all attention is fixed on the " crisis , " the rationale for this sudden radical shift .
Applying the Dershowitz Principle and bending both economic and moral sense to rationalize the world ’s biggest heist , both parties ( including both presidential candidates ) signed on to the bank bailout on the basis of " emergency " ethics : the idea that principles and good sense do n’t always apply , and , besides , there ’s no time to think , only to act .
This is precisely the method that got us into our present predicament in Iraq , and one has to wonder if the same phony " crisis " atmosphere is being generated to advance someone ’s agenda .
The banks , according to the conventional wisdom , just are n’t lending , there ’s a " credit crunch , " and the economy will very shortly come to a grinding halt  unless we hand over our wallets and trust the government to solve the " problem . "
Except there is n’t really all that much of a problem , according to analyst Octavio Marenzi , head of the Celent financial services consultancy ,
" The credit crunch is not nearly as severe as the U.S. authorities appear to believe , and public data actually suggest world credit markets are functioning remarkably well , a report released on Thursday says .
As a result , governments are pumping masses of public money into the economy across the world because of the difficulties of a few big , vocal banks and industries such as car manufacturing , which would be in difficulty anyway , according to the report published by Celent , a financial services consultancy . "
" It ’s just stabbing in the dark with trillions of dollars , " said Marenzi .
Yes , well , there ’s someone there in the dark taking all that cash as quickly as it ’s being handed over , and we are forbidden to shine a light on these bag - men .
This Reuters dispatch goes on to report that Marenzi ’s work , which " is based on U.S. Federal Reserve data , challenges a long list of assumptions one by one , arguing that there is indeed a financial crisis but that , on aggregate , the problems of a few are by no means those of the many when it comes to obtaining credit . "
If the government ’s own data contradicts the crisis atmosphere they ’re generating , then are they just making this stuff up ?
It ’s not that they ’re fabricating the trouble some industries and companies are in , because that ’s real enough .
It ’s that they ’re " taking the situation of a handful of institutions and generalizing that to the market as a whole , incorrectly , ” says Marenzi .
The credit bubble and the real estate bubble , not to mention the auto industry ’s woes , have been building for quite some time .
This is nothing new .
Aside from that , Marenzi ticks off a number of metrics that do n’t jibe with the alleged credit freeze we ’re supposedly experiencing , such as the rate of overall bank lending in the U.S.  which is up to " its highest level ever , and has grown during the present financial crisis . "
Interbank lending is up 22 percent since the bottom fell out of the stock market , with lending rates at record lows .
A key point made by Marenzi is that the way the crisis - mongers are gauging the level of interbank lending is incorrect , because it is " based on daily observations of eight banks , many of which were banks with particularly severe difficulties of their own . "
The decline in corporate bond issuance has been compensated for by an increase in commercial lending .
Consumer credit is also on the upswing , in spite of the fact that people are returning to more prudent spending habits .
The crisis - mongers are pleading the case for a bailout of certain financial interests , who benefit from the bailout , and want to avoid the market correction of a massive malinvestment at all costs .
Where have we seen this kind of skewing the intelligence before ?
Not only that , but the economic crisis - mongers are also engaging in a favorite practice of the War Party , especially during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq : cherry - picking .
Go Google that word , and type in " Office of Special Plans " or " neocons , " and see what you come up with .
So the pattern repeats itself once again : government insiders manufacture then take advantage of a crisis  openly describing it as an " opportunity , " as Rahm Emanuel put it  to pursue a preexisting agenda , one that will have enormous consequences down the road in terms of blowback .
We ’ll be deep at the very bottom of a financial quagmire , wondering how we get out of it , long before folks like Marenzi are listened to .
By then , of course , it will be too late .
I realize that many of my readers do not share my libertarian views on economic matters , but you do n’t need to be an advocate of laissez - faire [ . pdf ] to see the pattern of deception and the uses to which it is put .
Always the goal is to extend and expand the power of government , whether it be over the economy or over some faraway province that no one has ever heard of .
The Dershowitz Principle , in practice , is never applied in order to lessen the power of some individuals over others : individual freedom is the first casualty of every " emergency . "
Brilliant and accomplished , Carol Chomsky taught for many years at Harvard 's Graduate School of Education and wrote oft - cited articles about how young children learn to read .
And yet , she possessed talents that did n't easily fit on a curriculum vitae .
" She was a pretty remarkable person , " said Judith Chomsky of Philadelphia , who is married to the younger brother of Dr. Chomsky 's husband , Noam .
" She was very athletic , and , until she was ill , she was fishing and water skiing and doing things people would n't normally associate with her .
She played the accordion .
She could fix a car .
She was mechanical .
I mean , she was the one who fixed everything at the house . "
Through her work in language development and psycholinguistics , Dr. Chomsky also helped young children learn the mechanics of reading , and by doing so gain greater social acceptance in their classrooms .
Dr. Chomsky died of cancer yesterday at her Lexington home .
She was 78 .
" She was a very upbeat , happy kind of a person , " said Sylvia Schatz of Burlington , who is Dr. Chomsky 's sister - in - law .
" She was also a very giving person , of herself and of her thoughts , of her ideas , of her suggestions .
And she was very generous , both in material things and with her support and help in many ways . "
Among Dr. Chomsky 's duties was , at times , acting as a de facto gatekeeper for those seeking access to her husband , a linguistics professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose writings and political activism made him famous in ways neither of them could have imagined when they married in 1949 .
Take two years ago , when Hugo Ch ??vez , president of Venezuela , held up one of Noam Chomsky 's books during a fierce speech at the United Nations , turning it into an overnight bestseller .
Dr. Chomsky fielded phone calls at their house and kept reporters at bay .
" Everyone wants to know what his reaction is , " she told the Globe in September 2006 .
" And that 's on the level of gossip and of no consequence at all . "
Of consequence was her work , her family , and her friends .
Carol Schatz grew up in Philadelphia , and her mother taught at a Hebrew school where Noam Chomsky 's father was principal , she said in an e-mail interview with The Pennsylvania Gazette , a publication of the University of Pennsylvania .
Because of the family connection , she met Noam when she was 5 , but they did not date until they were attending the university .
" I loved it there , " she told the Gazette .
" I found my interests ; had many excellent , even wonderful professors ; and looking back , received a quite satisfactory intellectual grounding . "
A New Yorker profile of Noam Chomsky in 2003 noted " Carol was then , as she is now , small and slightly built , though her hair was shorter - now white , it grows nearly to her shoulders .
She decided in her teens that she disliked wearing lipstick , and she has stuck to that . "
There ’s a hole in airline security big enough to get Osama bin Laden himself onto a domestic flight , Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff acknowledges , but that ’s no reason to ditch watch lists or ID checks at the airport , he says .
Chertoff told Threat Level in an interview last week that the government was aware of , and patching , the so - called boarding - pass loophole , which just came back into the public eye after a recent Atlantic magazine story where a reporter got though security using a fake boarding pass .
That loophole lets a known terrorist who is on a government watch list board a plane without needing a fake ID .
All that ’s needed is a home computer , a printer and a little skill at HTML .
“ On the issue of switching boarding passes , that is a loophole we are aware of , ” Chertoff said .
Security guru and Wired.com columnist Bruce Schneier argues this and other loopholes show that the current airline security methods are just theater , that hardened cockpit doors were the best response to 9/11 and that we’d be just as safe without hassles over shoes and liquids and watch lists .
But the government and airlines are working on a transformation in virtual boarding passes , according to Chertoff — one that would still allow hurried travelers to check in from home , but prevent them from modifying the name on the new virtual boarding passes .
“ We are testing using electronic boarding passes with something on your phone to make it well - nigh impossible to make a phony one , ” Chertoff said .
“ That would plug that loophole . ”
And even though that ’s only a pilot project , that does n’t mean that the terrorist watch list and the mandatory identification requirement should be tossed aside , Chertoff said .
“ For me , it ’s a no - brainer to ask for ID to get on a plane , ” Chertoff said .
DHS 's Transportation Security Administration is currently testing an encrypted 2 - D bar code that includes all the information from a boarding pass and is digitally signed to ensure the data has n’t been altered .
In the pilot , passengers show the bar code to TSA identity checkers , who use a scanner to read the image off the passenger ’s smartphone , and then check the person ’s identification against the decrypted information .
Continental now uses the technology in eight airports , including its three hubs , and more than 300,000 customers have used the option so far , according to Continental spokeswoman Mary Clark .
Business travelers are big fans , Clark said .
“ They can check in in the cab on the way to the airport and do n’t have to stop at the kiosk , ” Clark said .
The system also works using public - key cryptography , which lets the TSA use scanners that do n’t need to connect to airline databases , and they do n’t store records of who is traveling .
That gets the program a thumbs - up from security researcher Christopher Soghoian , who earned fame and an FBI raid of his home for creating a fake boarding - pass generator online .
“ The security is pretty good , ” Soghoian said .
“ It ’ll be difficult to make fake passes . ”
The 2 - D program is more than just a pilot .
All the major airlines are required to adopt the bar codes for printed boarding passes by 2010 , as well .
Once that ’s in place , and every TSA ID checker verifies the boarding pass ’s information , the hole will be officially closed , almost five years after a Slate magazine writer first announced it to the larger world ( Schneier , of course , noticed it first in 2003 ) .
Soghoian hedges his praise for the belated fix .
“ This , of course , does n't actually guarantee that terrorists will be kept off planes , ” Soghoian said .
“ It does , however , mean that the government will have a fairly good idea of who [ is ] getting into the secure areas of the airport . ”
Chertoff says the new system is better than nothing .
Just because someone can come up with a real scenario that would let an adversary avoid a layer of security does n’t mean that layer should be peeled off and discarded , Chertoff argues .
That thinking ignores the number of times the imperfect procedure has helped .
“ That argument means you do n't believe in seat belts and airbags , ” Chertoff said .
“ If you hit an 18 - wheeler head - on , you will be as flat as a pancake .
But there will be some accidents where they will help you . ”

Advertisement A British inventor 's new fingerprinting technique has given fresh impetus to half a dozen unsolved cases and could help police identify the killer of a man shot dead 10 years ago in the US .
For detectives in the American city of Bristol , Connecticut , the 1998 murder case of Louis " Pete " LaFontaine remains the only unsolved killing on their books .
The local police team are determined to find the killer and that has prompted local detective Garrie Dorman to travel 3,500 miles to see if a little bit of British inventiveness can help .
He arrived carrying a polythene evidence bag containing shell cases from the scene of a shooting that has left US police baffled for nearly a decade .
In February 1998 electrical repairman Louis " Pete " LaFontaine was shot dead as he slept at his home in an affluent part of Bristol .
' Top 50 inventions '
There was no sign of forced entry and as far as the police could tell the 53 - year - old , who was divorced with a son , was popular and well liked .
After many hours of work , and numerous dead - end leads , the case had gone cold .
The search for a breakthrough has brought Detective Dorman across the Atlantic to visit Wooton Hall , the headquarters of Northamptonshire Police .
REVEALING A HIDDEN PRINT
When a bullet casing is fired or wiped , any surface residue like a fingerprint is removed .
But John Bond can find it .
First an electrical charge is applied .
This charge is greater on clean brass than on surfaces corroded by sweat .
Finely charged particles are poured over the casing .
They tend to stick where the potential is lowest .
Fingerprint starts to reveal itself .
Heating the casing brings the print up more fully .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
He said : " My hope was always to find a new forensic technique that would enable us to identify Mr LaFontaine 's killer .
But I had no idea it would ever bring me to England . "
Det Dorman came to meet Dr John Bond , the scientific support manager for Northamptonshire Police and a fellow of the University of Leicester .
He has developed a technique that can reveal " hidden " fingerprints on metal - especially shell casings - by detecting the minute traces of corrosion on the surface caused by salt in the sweat on human fingers .
Such corrosion cannot be wiped off , is impervious to the heat generated when the weapon is fired , and does not deteriorate over time .
It has been described by Time magazine as one of the top 50 inventions of 2008 .
' Wire and gaffer tape ' Dr Bond said : " Normal fingerprinting requires a residue of sweat to be left on the metal , but my technique does n't need that , and it can work when conventional techniques fail .
" I 'm confident that if there 's any corrosion on Det Dorman 's shell cases , then we can find it within days . "
The process is deceptively simple .
The shell case is held in contact with an electrical terminal that charges it with 2,500 Volts .
One American policeman walked in and said ' I can't believe I 've come all this way for a cardboard box and a popsicle stick '
Dr John Bond
Then similarly charged ceramic beads are poured on to it .
The beads are coated with very fine black powder which is transferred on to the casing , but only where it has suffered corrosion .
" The black powder just reveals where the corrosion pattern is , then we heat the sample to bake the powder in place and photograph it for standard fingerprint comparison , " Dr Bond added .
" We often get prints from the forefinger or thumb , where the person loading the weapon has pushed bullets into the magazine . "
Dr Bond is an almost stereotypical British inventor .
His device was assembled at home and the parts are homemade and joined together by twisted wire and gaffer tape .
" One American policeman walked in and said ' I can't believe I 've come all this way for a cardboard box and a popsicle stick ' , " he said .
But his technique works , and has already given fresh impetus to half a dozen cold case investigations , nearly all in the US .
" The Americans seem quicker to embrace new technology than we are , " he said .
Det Dorman hopes to crack his police department 's only unsolved murder Dr Bond is reluctant to talk about cases in the UK he is working on .
The technique is so new that many people are still awaiting trial .
But he confirmed he has been asked to examine a shell case left at the scene of the murder of village post office worker Craig Hodson - Walker in Worcestershire recently .
In the laboratory , Det Dorman is optimistic .
He said : " If we get a fingerprint there are certainly a few possible suspects in the frame for Mr LaFontaine 's killing that we'd like to compare it with to include or exclude or we 'll just have to go to our regular database of prints . "
Apart from bringing a killer to justice , there is a professional pride at stake for a detective wanting a satisfactory outcome to the only unsolved murder on his police department 's books .
" We have a fairly good rate at solving murders in the past and this is one that really kind of sticks with everyone , " said Det Dorman .
" It 'd be real nice to see this one come to a positive close . "

Apple keeps springing surprises on us , some very pleasant , some a little harder to swallow .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There was the surprise of Apple not attending Macworld this year , although when you looked at the history it was clear Apple had been successively pulling out of major Mac - related events .
Really , us Apple watchers should not have been surprised , but hey , Macworld was the ultimate Mac conference and it still came as a blow .
It was a surprise that the iPod touch had improved sales figures over the December period right up to Christmas Day .
App
Store sales have indicated a big spike in downloads from the touch model , despite it being a premiere model of iPod .
Some pundits were predicting , somewhat gleefully , Apple 's decline - but here it was still selling premium priced products at a healthy rate .
Apple 's latest earnings figures will probably surprise as well - the last three months have not been good for most computer and consumer electronics companies .
With the exception of IBM , most stocks went down , but Apple has fared OK ; in fact , it has continued to grow , reporting nine per cent unit growth over the year - ago quarter for Macs , three per cent unit growth in iPod sales and 88 per cent unit growth for the iPhone .
It was a bit of a surprise that the new guitar and piano lessons feature of GarageBand '09 only works on Intel Macs , but once again , maybe we should n't have been surprised .
Apple deleted the G- series of PowerPC processors in Macs years ago already and is in the latter stages of its full transition to Intel .
Who knows if Snow Leopard will support the G4 - G5 CPU family at all ?
It may be time to upgrade your hardware .
The future could hold any number of surprises .
Intel has made quad - core chips and even dropped prices significantly , lately - these could end up in new iMacs or even Mac Pros , with octa-core towers a possibility .
Snow Leopard 's ‘ Grand Central ' is designed to help developers better exploit multithreading in these multi-core CPUs .
Other developments could include developments from touch - screen patents filed last year , not to mention LCD screen technology developed by Apple that allows monitors to capture images .
But I like today 's surprise a lot .
When Apple released new MacBooks - the aluminium so - called unibodies , slimmer , with better graphics chips that could at last handle modern games - Apple left one model of the older Polycarbonate MacBook in the line - up .
This meant you could still get a white entry level MacBook , but hey , it had that limiting Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 .
Well , that changed today .
Apple sneaked in a proper NVIDIA GeForce video card , which means even the cheapest MacBook can now drive a bigger screen ( although not the 30 - incher ; external resolution is limited to 1920x1200 ) and will run ‘ proper ' games ( maybe even Call of Duty 4 , for example ) .
Apple also bumped installed RAM from one to two GB .
The frontside bus has been accelerated to 1066MHz .
While the processor did get slowed down a little , from a 2.1GHz to a 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo , and it still only uses 667MHz DDR2 RAM instead of the faster DDR3 RAM of its aluminum brethren , Bluetooth has also been improved , going from v2 to v2.1 + EDR .
Not bad for a machine that retails for the same price , even if it is made from that glossy white and not - quite - so - green Polycarbonate stuff .
Otherwise the Poly MacBook is exactly the same - it has the 13.3 - inch glossy 1280x800 pixel LCD , 802.11n Airport Extreme , a 120 GB 5400 RPM hard drive and the 8x SuperDrive optical drive .
Notably , the Poly MacBook retains the FireWire 400 port , so if you need FireWire 400 support in a little MacBook , it 's a more attractive option now with its better video and a faster architecture .
And please note that Apple has often created a ‘ best of brand ' model shortly before final deletion .
This also means Apple could get the NVIDIA card into the mini , so that might be the next little ‘ surprise ' .

Did you enjoy a warm and cozy Thanksgiving with family , gorging yourself ?
Zac Sunderland did not .
The 16 - year - old from Thousand Oaks was aboard Intrepid , his 36 - foot sailboat , eating Costco spuds while sailing into a headwind off Madagascar , pointed toward Durban , South Africa .
If that is n't a sad story , two days later he turned 17 , alone , not terribly far south of a red - hot pirate zone , celebrating by snacking on a just - add - water microwavable cake and opening presents stuffed in a box and stowed on his vessel long beforehand by family and friends .
" Zac is well and entering the danger zone as far as weather off of Africa , " Marianne Sunderland , his mother , says .
" So far he has had pretty light winds and so though he 's not making great progress , he is happy to not be getting his butt kicked . "
That is the best birthday gift of all , as the danger zone Marianne speaks of is notorious for cyclones beginning about this time of year .
“ Investigators are looking into various theories , including that the murder was linked to the victim ’s professional activities , ” Vladimir I. Markin , a spokesman for the investigative wing of the Prosecutor General ’s Office , said of Mr. Markelov .
The murder bore the characteristics of a contract killing , a not - uncommon phenomenon in Russia .
Even so , the audacity of Mr. Markelov ’s murder surprised some commentators .
“ Even when organized crime in the 1990s was rampant , such a killing would have been considered bold and horrific , ” said a correspondent from Vesti television .
Mr. Markelov , who was the director of the Rule of Law Institute , a civil liberties group , gained prominence recently representing the family of Elza Kungayeva .
She was an 18 - year - old Chechen whom Mr. Budanov , the former tank commander , admitted strangling in his quarters in March 2000 , just as the second post - Soviet war in Chechnya was beginning to rage .
Mr. Budanov was sentenced to 10 years in prison but was given early parole for good behavior .
Mr. Markelov , at the news conference just before his death , told reporters that he might file an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against the early release of Mr. Budanov , who was a decorated colonel of the Russian Army before he was stripped of his rank .
In an interview last week with The New York Times , Mr. Markelov said he might also file a lawsuit against the administration of the prison that released Mr. Budanov last Thursday .
News headlines broke earlier in the week with the announcement that President - elect Barack Obama had chosen anti-gay pastor Rick Warren to be part of the inauguration .
This alone sparked a media frenzy and anger from liberal and LGBT organizations .
Now in an interview with NBC's Ann Curry , Pastor Warren responds to the question of how he would deal with homosexuality if it proves to be biologically based .
The insinuation that we are somehow underdeveloped and " immature " and that all LGBT people are " promiscuous " is a lie and downright offensive .

US President Barack Obama has issued executive orders on government ethics and transparency as part of a packed first full day in office .
The measures include curbs on lobbying and a pay freeze for senior White House staff .
Federal employees will have to sign up to new ethics procedures .
The new president said he was beginning " a new era of openness " in government .
Later Mr Obama and his advisers are to discuss the economic crisis - as well as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Earlier judges suspended several of the military trials of terror suspects at Guantanamo , following Mr Obama 's call for all cases to be suspended , made hours after his inauguration .
Mr Obama arrived at the Oval Office at 0835 on Wednesday , the White House said .
Families are tightening their belts , and so should Washington

The first 100 days Born on Obama 's inauguration day In pictures : Obama 's first full day
The new president read the note left to him by his predecessor George W Bush in an envelope marked " To : # 44 , From : # 43 " .
Mr Obama telephoned four Middle Eastern leaders - President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel , King Abdullah of Jordan and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas .
" He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab - Israeli peace , " the White House said .
The president later attended a prayer service at Washington 's National Cathedral - a tradition dating to the time of George Washington .
President Obama 's first day was packed with duties After returning to the White House , Mr Obama announced his first executive orders saying he wanted a " clean break from business as usual " .
The new rules ban aides from lobbying the administration when they leave his staff and emphasises the importance of " qualifications , competence and experience " in the recruiting of government staff .
Officials are also banned from receiving gifts from lobbyists .
Announcing the pay freeze for senior officials , Mr Obama said : " Families are tightening their belts , and so should Washington . "
Stimulus
The economic crisis is expected to be high on his agenda on his first day .
The president is due to meet advisers to discuss his $ 825 bn rescue plan , which Congress is expected to approve next month .
Mr Obama is also due to meet military advisers .
He has promised to withdraw combat troops from Iraq within 16 months .
GUANTANAMO BAY
Q&A : Guantanamo detentions ' Struggle ' over Guantanamo
He said that on his first day in office he would give commanders there a new mission - to end the war .
On the Guantanamo cases , military judges have agreed to suspend six trials .
They include proceedings against five men accused of plotting the 11 September attacks .
The judge halted their trial despite the fact that four of the five - including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - opposed the proposed suspension during a court hearing on Wednesday .
Earlier , the judge in the separate trial of Omar Khadr - a Canadian man accused of killing an American soldier in Afghanistan in 2002 - also agreed to suspend the case .
Meanwhile the US Senate , which traditionally moves swiftly to approve a new president 's Cabinet , has confirmed the appointment of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state .
She was endorsed by a 94 - 2 majority on Wednesday .
The vote had been postponed after a Republican senator demanded a debate about foreign donations to a foundation headed by her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
Apology On Tuesday the Senate approved six Cabinet members , including Janet Napolitano as homeland security secretary and Steven Chu as energy secretary .
Several other positions are still to be confirmed .
Timothy Geithner , the nominee to head the treasury department , faced the Senate finance committee on Wednesday to explain his initial failure to pay payroll taxes he owed while working for the International Monetary Fund .
He apologised to the committee , saying he had been careless but that he had " paid what I owed " .
Mr Obama last week called Mr Geithner 's tax problems an embarrassment but an " innocent mistake " .
Other Obama nominees still to be confirmed are Eric Holder as attorney general , and Tom Daschle as head of health and human services .

Syrian - Kurdish news agency ANHA has published footage of a suspected ‘ IED factory ’ operated by the so - called Islamic State .
Thinkdust is an indepented design studio founded by Alex Haigh who worked for great companies like Nike , Sony and made the website for Volkswagen UK .
In this interview we 'll talk about the coming projects of Alex .
visit Alex on behance and on Thinkdust.com
1 . First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to provide abduzeedo.com with this interview .
Please tell us more about your art and design background and what made you become an artist and designer ?
2 . Your work is pretty unique and full of creativity .
Where does your inspiration come from ?
3 . Could you describe for us your typical ' start to finish ' workflow when working on a design ?
Since the age of 8 I used to design different type of trainers on sheets of A4 paper .
It became a bit of an obsession with over 430 single A4's containing 6 trainer designs at one point .
From then I kind of fell into design through educationInspiration is a strange tool .
It 's something that 's not physical and you may find in the most unexpected places .
I think my inspiration comes from past experiences , and with that every new piece of work I am producing is focused towards developing and becoming stronger .
Music has recently started to influence a lot of my work which is currently not live , just concentrating on getting the right message for the brand and using that concentration to produce something unique for them .
Well , my workflow is quite varied .
Sometimes it 's quite difficult to completely focus 100 % on a project during the day , due to emails , phone calls , and other communication which is a small distraction in my level of concentration .
Usually
If I think a piece of work has more to give I will start at 11 pm and work through the night , completely undisturbed , focused and inspired .
It 's not the most practical way of doing things but I am finding the results are far more creative when I go through this pattern
4 . What are your tools of the trade , both hardware and software ?
5 . What , for you personally are the pros and cons of being a designer ?
Sketchbook , photoshop , freehand and around a dozen sheets of A4 's stuck on the wall .
These usually have scribbles on , where I 'll not any ideas I have thought about throughout a project and then start the process of refining everything .
For me personally it 's all positives .
I could mention the fact that sometimes it's not easy working a straight week 20 hours a day and sometimes not getting any sleep at all .
However I love what I do , I 'm obsessively passionate , focused and determined to develop , become stronger , more creative , and produce better results .
For me it 's a craft , and with craft comes practice , which is the only way to develop .
6 . How does your job as an artist and designer influence your life ?
Do you feel that you see things around you differently for example ?
7 . What are your coming projects ?
100 % influenced .
If I am out and about it 's constant analysis of typography , colour , product placement , balance , grids , layout , impact .
Sounds pretty lame I suppose , but it 's just the way my brain works now .
I 'm sure most designers find this to be true .
I 've got some incredible projects on at the moment , with a endless to do list .
One of the projects at the moment is a new online digital type foundry , HypeForType .
This is a foundry with a difference .
I am currently teaming up with some of the most respected designers out there to create a series of extremely unique creations .
At the moment everything is currently being set up , however you can go over to the website to sign up for the official launch this year at www.hypefortype.com HypeForType will comprise of an individual catalogue of typefaces , alongside our special designer volumes released every 3 months .
Volume one which is confirmed so far will have creations from the likes of Si Scott , Alex Trochut , Jon Burgerman , HelloHikimori , and Luke Lukas .
I 'm incredibly excited about this project , and it 's extremely hard work so I would really appreciate it if any of you guys could help support us and sign up for the official launch over at the website , Hypefortype.com .
Other projects are a bit more secret at the moment .
However I will be launching a brand new Thinkdust later this year with over a years worth of brand new work .
8 . What are your favourite 5 websites , and why ?
9 . Once again , thank you very much for the interview .
As a final word , do you have any tips for upcoming artists and designers ?
Could n't possibly list them , I have so many .
At the moment I am in love with twitter , and the way in which you can find out so much information and connections so easily .
This is a revolution to social networking in my opinion .
I also check out the FWA regularly which has superb work as alwaysMy advice would be stay hungry , never give up and work on your craft as much as possible .

pony ...or...a.... MANATEE !!!
So we 're tooling around the Georgetown Botanic Garden in Guyana , South America , in a light afternoon shower , looking at flycatchers and jacanas and greater anis , and at some distance I see this boy running back and forth from the edge of a small waterway to a patch of lush grass .
He 's pulling grass and running back to the canal , just as you would if you ... were ... feeding ...a.. AGGGGH !!!
You cannot imagine how excited I was to come into contact once again with manatees .
The Science Chimp 's every hair stood on end , she pant - hooted and hugged herself .
You see , I have an enormous soft spot for manatees , ever since having shared their space at the Amazonian Research Institute in Manaus , Brazil as a lonely college student in 1979 .
I came to know several individuals housed there under the auspices of Robin Best 's Projeto Peixe - boi , and loved them from the first kiss on their smooth rubbery noses .
I held tiny orphaned Amazonian freshwater manatees , no bigger than a piglet , in my arms and watched their Brazilian caretakers feed them with baby bottles .
Oh my goodness .
Manatees .
It all came flooding back .
So this boy is pulling grass and offering it to the eager manatees , and I got right in and pulled grass with him .
Knowing manatees as I do , I knew they love to be spoken to and fondled -- they 're very sensual animals , endlessly sweet and affectionate .
The other members of my group looked at me as if I 'd been out in the sun too long when I knelt and hugged them as best I could , given the soggy substrate .
Sure , they were in scuzzy water of uncertain origin ; sure , they are the oddest and most foreign of beasts , but behind those minuscule eyes and that soft , questing muzzle is the gentlest of souls .
Food motivated ?
You betcha .
But there 's much more to manatees than meets the eye .
Tomorrow : Zick gets down and personal with the manatees .
Feed me .
Feed me good .
But first , love me all up .
Rub me down .
Kisses would be fine .
If there is a living Schmoo , the Amazonian manatee is it .

Cash and cash - equivalent investments - traditionally stodgy options for advisors - are gaining appeal as extreme market volatility pushes many clients beyond their comfort zones .
Advisors typically suggest that clients limit cash exposure to between 5 % and 10 % of their portfolios , or maintain a reserve that is equivalent to between 18 and 24 months of living expenses , in the event of a bear market .
But some advisors are increasing their clients ' cash holdings and exposure to other " cashlike " short - term investments , particularly to U.S. Treasurys , a safe haven in a brutal market .
" Cash is looking better for a few different reasons , " says Donald B. Cummings Jr. , an investment advisor with Blue Haven Capital in Geneva , Ill .
Cummings says he was concerned that some municipal money - market funds would potentially " break the buck " - or fall below $ 1 per share .
He preemptively moved client funds into plain - vanilla U.S. Treasury money - market funds .
Cummings recognizes that Treasury yields are low .
For example , the current seven - day yield for the Dreyfus 100 % U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund ( DUSXX ) is 0.51 % .
However , the strategy is more tolerable for the short term , he says .
" People expect volatility , but no one wants to lose three and four percent on their money - market funds , " says Cummings .
He 's not entirely sold on the Treasury Department 's temporary guarantee program for money - market funds , he says , which protects certain shareholders of money - market mutual funds from losses if their funds are unable to maintain a $ 1 net asset value .
The program offers protection for money - market holdings valued as of Sept. 19 .
Cummings says he 's concerned about jeopardizing funds deposited after that time .
" We 're telling everyone to hold tight for a few months and see how this plays out , " he says .
Advisors are also being judicious about investing new cash from clients since the bear market onset in October 2007 .
Cathy Curtis , a financial planner based on Oakland , Calif. , says she 's been particularly cautious with several new clients she took on last October , when the market started its decline , whose accounts average about $ 500,000 .
Curtis says she invested about 50 % of their money at the time and left the rest in cash , including the Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund ( SWBXX ) .
" I have been investing it slowly - even over the last month , " she says - about $ 2,500 at a time .
Franken officially wins in MN : ' I work for you now ' ; Coleman camp says they 'll sue David Edwards and Mike Sheehan

By a slim margin , Democrat Al Franken was today declared the winner of Minnesota 's bitter Senate contest , defeating Republican incumbent Norm Coleman .
The satirist and former Saturday Night Live writer and performer officially bested Coleman by 225 votes , according to the Minnesota Canvassing Board .
Coleman had asked the state supreme court to include additional absentee ballots in the recount totals in a last - ditch effort , but the court denied the request , ensuring Franken 's victory - - for now .
Coleman 's lead attorney said that a lawsuit protesting the result was " inevitable , " which could extend the tussle over the Senate seat " for months . "
" I am proud to stand before you as the next senator from Minnesota , " said Franken , speaking to the press outside of his Minneapolis home .
" This victory is incredibly humbling .
...
" I want every Minnesotan to hear this : I work for you now , and I will work hard to earn your confidence , " Franken declared .

They include attempting to assassinate the Pope , a priest abusing the confidentiality of the confessional by revealing the nature of the sin and the person who admitted to it , or a priest who has sex with someone and then offers forgiveness for the act .
Massively multiplayer online developer CCP is considering leaving its home country of Iceland , due to the growing economic crisis which has hit the small island country hard .
One of the first global economics to feel the full effects of the global financial crisis , Iceland 's banking sector is left with debts that have risen to as much as $ 14 billion - 10 times the country 's GDP .
All three of the country 's major banks have had to be nationalized , with inflation now at 17 percent and unemployment in double digits .
As reported by British newspaper The Guardian , restrictions on access to foreign currency have proven disastrous fordeveloper CCP , which also runs offices in Atlanta and Shanghai .
Sci-fi themed massively multiplayer online gamehas 300,000 subscribers worldwide -- as much as the actual population of Iceland .
" To make new games , we need foreign investors , " said CCP 's Eyjolfur Gudmundsson .
" The present currency restrictions are putting us in a straitjacket .
We are in talks with the government , but if we can't let capital in , we might be compelled to leave Iceland , even though this would be against our wishes . "
The first beta release of KDE 4.2 , the next major version in the KDE 4 series , was made available for download last week .
Thousands of bugs have been fixed since the 4.1 release and many aspects of the environment are starting to feel very smooth and polished .
Although it still lacks stability and has some noticeable bugs , the new beta provides a much stronger desktop experience than 4.1 .
The Plasma components that provide the core elements of the desktop environment are where you will find the most welcome and noticeable improvements .
The panel system is shaping up nicely and has a few new capabilities that I particularly like .
My favorite is the progress notification feature .
When you initiate a file operation of any kind , the progress will be displayed in a notification bubble that pops up out of the panel .
It will stack progress bars for multiple operations and let you control them individually .
This is really useful because it eliminates the need to have progress dialogs appear when moving or copying files with Dolphin , KDE 's file manager .
It appears to be tapping into KIO , the KDE filesystem abstraction layer , and seems to show any KIO - based file operation , not just ones that are performed with Dolphin .
The notification bubble can be hidden by clicking the associated tray icon .
The bubble can also be snapped out of the panel and dropped onto the desktop like a regular plasmoid .
I was very impressed by this feature , and I think it 's a good demonstration of the kind of seamless user interfaces that Plasma was designed to facilitate .
There are a lot of other little features that have been added to the panel to make it more friendly .
The task list supports a multiple - row layout and can also group related windows .
These features work well , but still need a little bit of refinement .
The multi-row layout , for example , is going to require some theming adjustments before it 's perfect .
The panel also gained support for autohiding , a feature that has been sorely missed by many users .
The folderview plasmoid , which displays the icons of files in a specific folder , also got some improvements in this release .
Icon positions within folderview plasmoids will be preserved now .
It is also finally possible to set a folderview plasmomid as the main desktop activity .
Users who prefer the conventional desktop icon paradigm can get equivalent functionality in KDE 4.2 by setting the Desktop Activity Type to " Folder View " in KDE 's Desktop Settings configuration dialog .
There are a few new plasmoids in 4.2 , including a calendar , a pastebin uploader , a system monitor , and a file preview tool .
Plasma has also gained support for displaying Google Gadgets ( video demo here ) and plasmoids written in Ruby or Python .
Another intriguing aesthetic feature is support for procedural wallpaper .
Instead of displaying a static desktop image , users can display a slideshow or select a plugin that displays dynamically rendered background content .
This is similar to the concept behind the DreamScene feature in Windows Vista .
The current beta only supports static images and slideshows , but there is already an experimental plugin under development that will draw Mandelbrot fractals .
In addition to all of these improvements to the core environment , there are also a ton of little improvements to the individual KDE applications .
Last week , I wrote about one of my favorites : the new Vi input mode option in KDE 's Kate text editor .
I 'm really impressed with this beta and I think that 4.2 is going to be a huge step forward for KDE .
The innovative aspects of Plasma really started to shine through in 4.1 and they are even more apparent in 4.2 .
The software is available for download from the KDE web site .
Packages are also available for OpenSUSE , which is what I used for this review .
For more details , check out the official release notes .
In an attempt to be on the cutting edge of the absurd , the Swiss government has added an amendment to their plant rights law .
It is now illegal to humiliate a plant .
" Where does it stop ? " asks Yves Poirier , a molecular biologist at the laboratory of plant biotechnology at the University of Lausanne .
" Should we now defend the dignity of microbes and viruses ? "
If the Swiss have their way , nobody will be eating twice - shamed potatoes at my house anymore .
After the first 11 interviews with my brother Police Officer and Detective Howard Wooldridge of Lansing , Michigan ( retired ) concerning the “ War on Drugs ” , more and more Americans understand the underpinnings of how the U.S. government protracts a national taxpayer fraud .
How big a fraud ?
Taxpayers forked over $ 1 trillion in 38 years paying for the impotent “ War on Drugs . ” Results ?
America suffers more drugs , major drug networks , cheaper drugs and more potent drugs !
“ The civil government in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico has collapsed .
In El Paso 's sister city of 1.5 million — murders , mutilation , torture , kidnappings and extortions are committed with impunity .
Beyond the cost in human lives and safety , it also threatens to imperil the economic renaissance in this region and the over $ 2 billion spent by Mexican nationals in our local economy .
And there is the very real national security threat , that this brutality and lawlessness could extend throughout Mexico and lead to a flood of refugees who would overwhelm our border , our city and our country and make today 's undocumented immigration problem seem insignificant by comparison . ”
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey
“ These are not the random thoughts of some blogger , ” said El Paso city councilman Beto O’Rourke .
“ Citizens in El Paso hear the gunfire from the across the Rio Grande , ” said Officer Howard Wooldridge .
“ Mr. O'Rourke has called for a national discussion on legalizing drugs in order to make the Mexican Cartels disappear .
He knows what www.leap.cc knows and every student of history ; namely absent prohibition , the Mexican Drug Cartels will quickly wither and die , same as the Al Capone type organizations died 75 years ago .
Ciudad Juarez , Tijuana and all other cities and states in Mexico could return to normal .
“ As Councilman O'Rourke wrote those words , he proved to be a man of action also .
He drafted a resolution asking for a national , open discussion on the legalization of drugs as a method to destroy the Mexican Cartels .
The El Paso City Council agreed with him and passed it 8 - 0 .
However , the mayor vetoed at the last minute .
The stage was set for a brouhaha which eventually rumbled through the corridors of the United States Congress .
El Paso Congressman
Reyes wrote the council and urged them to sustain the mayor 's veto .
Otherwise , he wrote the city 's portion of the upcoming stimulus package could be reduced .
The council vote rumbled through power brokers in Austin enough to cause the five El Paso area legislators to write a letter to the council which also threatened the loss of funds .
As our brave soldiers fight and die for our freedoms in Iraq and Afghanistan , the freedom of speech was destroyed as the council caved in and voted only 4 - 4 for override .
Thus we see the power of the money interests in DC and Austin who profit from the War on Drugs .
Can you spell Private Prisons Inc. who love mandatory minimums ?
“ The six northern Mexican states bordering the US are in a state of semi or near complete collapse .
The local police are paralyzed with fear to handle routine police matters like assault , rape , theft , robbery .
As the drug gangs and the Zetas battle each other and the Federales , commerce suffers .
American businesses now often require money upfront to sell something , rather than extending even short term credit .
Experts are professing the real possibility of true economic & drug war refugees which would require US taxpayers to help them .
“ Two years ago Mexican President Calderon decided to tackle the ‘ narcotraficantes ’ of the Mexican Drug Cartels .
Today the heads of police officers and federal soldiers roll down the streets of cities all over central and northern Mexico .
Since Calderon started this effort in 2007 , some 8,000 Mexicans have been murdered .
The Cartels put up one billboard that taunts and threatens the police and another offering them a lucrative job , if they join the Cartels .
This is the reality of law enforcement in Mexico : plato o ploma - silver or lead .
The average American cannot imagine what it would be like to live in such an environment : no rule of law , no police protection , no sense of security or hope that it will end , profound despair .
And for what ?
“ Our country has been having gunfights and dead bodies by the thousands since the mid ' 80s .
Our drug dealers shoot and kill each other as needed to get rid of the competition .
The Department of Justice recently announced that the Mexican drug gangs in America are the greatest new threat to our society .
Tens of thousands of American citizens have been killed but the press barely mentions that it is the drug trade which causes the violence . ”
Abraham Lincoln said it best , " Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance .
It is a species of intemperance within itself , for it goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man 's appetite by legislation , and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes .
A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded . "

For eight years , George W Bush hurt my country deeply .
He pushed every button to the extreme , in every which way , and heightened the madness that 's possible in this country .
He heightened the violence and he heightened the greed .
Then came last week and with it hope , elation and great joy .
Barack Obama 's election was not a landslide , that was clear .
He did not carry a lot of the rural areas , and that 's going to remain an issue .
But it is the beginning of a beginning .
What we are hearing is a wonderful message , both to ourselves and the world , that America is capable of change .
Bush was , I believe , the grandson of Richard Nixon in many ways .
Now I genuinely hope that Obama can be the heir to John F Kennedy , who was a great spirit and to whom very strong goodwill was granted .
I felt that in 1960 and I feel it now with Obama .
The majority is rooting for him .
He 's good - looking .
He has a beautiful family and people wish him well .
He has that youth and that outsider feel , that leanness of mind and spirit .
As with Kennedy , he carries the refreshing spirit of human freedom .
The issue of colour only goes so far .
I have the optimist 's world view of America as a tolerant place , where anyone can grow up to be the President .
It 's an amazing mythology and remains the central reason why people want to come here .
Of course we have far from lived up to that ideal .
I grew up in New York City , where benign racism was harder to spot than in other parts of America .
When I went into the US army in Vietnam I noticed it on another level completely because there was such a divided culture between black and white , and I got into that heavily , having dealt with it , to some degree , in my films Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July
That division between race , gender and culture empowered Nixon in the long run .
He achieved office on a platform of ' law and order ' , emphasising the polarities and splitting the country .
Bush followed this path of splitting the country again .
He used the terrorist attacks of 9/11 to create a pre-emptive war state , that divided and recreated the fear , appointing himself as the provider of hope .
It was the classic Nixon approach : spread fear and then give them hope and then get elected again , and then spread more fear , and then give them more hope .
This is a form of tyranny - the tyranny of fear .
They call it many things , but in Nixon 's case it was law and order , whereas in Bush 's case it was called the ' war on terror ' , which is such a dangerous terminology .
Even as late as Thursday , he was outrageous enough to describe this transition as the first wartime presidency transition , warning us against any kind of softening attitude towards his view of the ' war on terror ' .
It will go down in history as a great con trick , one of those distortions like the Crusades .
' War on terror ' : it sounds like a religious term .
It angers me that we still live in a war state .
With luck , Obama can be the antidote .
His legs may be skinny , as Arnold Schwarzenegger said , but I think his will is strong .
He 's got lean , ' basketball ' strength .
I met him twice and was highly impressed with him .
His biggest problem is going to be the huge amount of pressure from establishment forces that will seek to push him into corners , into gridlock .
To resist those pressures will take tremendous will and purpose .
But he 's shown goodwill and vision and stick - to - it - ness in his thinking .
He 's as good as it gets in the American mould .
He 's a smart cat and I think that he can handle it .
Thanks to the likes of Nixon and Bush we 've spent a lot of money on war , on creating war , on feeding it , on living off the concept of security , and it 's undermined the concept of what America stands for .
Whenever the agenda gets set in this country , it 's based on security , war and money .
Like the Romans had many gods , we worship three - a god of violence , a god of greed and some sort of a Judeo - Christian god of indeterminate vengeance , great authority and spiritual determinism .
Take your pick .
We are spending close to a trillion dollars on our Pentagon budget .
You spend a trillion dollars on that , but spend so little on the things that matter to the people who live in that national security state that all priorities go out of whack - you do n't take care of your own family .
Why can't this new President decide the agenda ?
Could he determine that maybe he would like to make healthcare reform or welfare or education his first priority ?
For Obama it would be very difficult to say , as a first point in his agenda , let 's cut 25 per cent of the defence budget .
If he insisted on reinvesting money in that way , it would shock the world ; there would be such resistance to it .
Special interests , lobbyists , corporate interests are so strong in this country ; they have n't gone away .
There 's a hard - line security party in opposition , led by McCain and Bush , that 's a frightening and daunting machine for Obama to go up against .
As I put in my film W , we have bases in 120 countries .
Despite our democratic intentions , we are a military empire .
We do n't call ourselves that , but we function as that .
We have this enormous support structure of men and women overseas .
It 's a form of national employment , but it 's a profoundly mendacious , dangerous , costly worldwide position to maintain , so similar to Winston Churchill 's impossible dream during the Second World War of preserving the British Empire .
Obama will have to decide : do we continue this debacle of empire ?
There is no doubt the job is enormous .
It 's equivalent to what Franklin D Roosevelt faced in 1932 .
There 's that sense of a huge change in America .
And I think the expectations are so high of him they become dangerous because they can lead our egos to the edge of disaster .
The mood this weekend is similar to the dawn of Kennedy 's Camelot .
But perhaps it is more accurate to say that Obama has the potential to be a Roosevelt .
I do n't know that he can change things radically , but he can start to move things in another direction .
He has talked about serious alternative energy research , climate control , co-operating with our allies , racial tolerance and diversity , education , reassessing security , changing the concept of the war on terror into something more manageable and real .
He can do so much .
Just changing the angle of perception a little bit in another direction , and educating a younger generation to think in a more humble way about our empire and its real goals , is an epochal choice still available to us .

Passionate race drives a massive turnout
The tug of history , concern about the economy and a pair of compelling candidates propelled voters to the polls Tuesday , putting new turnout records in reach and electing Democrat Barack Obama to the presidency .
Voting experts said turnout could match or exceed the high - water mark set in 1960 , when Democrat John Kennedy faced Republican Richard Nixon and nearly 64 % of eligible citizens voted .
They also predicted record turnout among blacks and among voters under 30 .
Black voters accounted for 13 % of the electorate , up 2 percentage points from 2004 , in surveys of voters as they left the polls .
Young voters increased their share from 17 % to 18 % .
The two groups overwhelmingly supported Obama .
For black voters , it was nearly unanimous .
Curtis Gans , head of American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate , said voters have not been as massively dissatisfied with their president , the economy or the direction of the country since 1932 .
That mood drove turnout , he said , as did Obama 's intensive get - out - the - vote efforts and " strong affirmative feelings " about him among voters .
A final tally of turnout hinged on hard vote counts from all states , which could take weeks .
Based on returns Tuesday night from five states , " We should see roughly an 8 % bump in turnout " over 2004 , said Donald Green , director of Yale 's Institution for Social and Policy Studies .
That would take it to a record 65 % .
More than half of Colorado and Nevada voters had already voted by Election Day , as had about 40 % in Florida and North Carolina .
States without widespread early voting , such as Michigan , Missouri , Pennsylvania and Virginia , reported long lines Tuesday .
Robert Ware , 63 , an election monitor at the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners , visited six polling places by 10 a.m. and found more people in line than in 2000 and 2004 combined .
" The past election was a trade wind blowing , " he said .
" This feels like a hurricane . "
Issues , history pull voters
At polling stations across the country , people said they were concerned about jobs and health care , moral values and experience .
Many were first - time voters drawn by the sour economy or Obama 's historic quest .
Black Americans were acutely aware of a moment they could hardly believe had come : a black nominee on a major - party ticket .
Robbie Sellers , 34 , waiting to vote in Detroit , said her father , 84 , already had voted for Obama .
" He never would have dreamed of this day , " she said .
Heavy black registration and turnout in North Carolina helped Obama run well in the traditionally GOP state .
" It 's really a major event , " said Mary Chance , 60 , a first - time voter from Raleigh .
In Virginia , Sonja Crisp , 41 , waited to vote at a middle school down the road from Reb Yank Drive in a town , Manassas , that was the site of two major Civil War battles .
An Obama win , she said , would mean that finally " we are equal with anyone . "
Republican John McCain won a vote from Carol Clauss , 40 , an executive secretary from Tampa .
" I wanted someone who has experience , " she said .
Camille Smith , 41 , of Sterling Heights , Mich. , a mother of four , said family values kept her in the GOP fold .
" McCain is not for abortion , " she said .
In Parker , Colo. , Peter Thurmes , 51 , voted for McCain three weeks after he was laid off as a construction superintendent .
He said businesses would hire fewer people under Obama , because " they know they 're going to be spending more on taxes . "
Obama elicited the first vote ever from David Gonzalez , 44 , a Denver painter who said he can no longer find work and has slept in a church for three weeks since he and his girlfriend became unable to afford their rent .
Gonzalez said he was turned off by politics in the past , but " I see good things in Obama .
I feel in my heart that he means well for this country . "
Young people get involved
In Missouri , Saint Louis University opened the first campus polling station in memory .
Scott Smith , dean of students , said the campus had a record 2,200 new voters , and 250 people were in line at the 6 a.m. poll opening .
Sophomore Kasia Sullivan , 19 , a McCain backer , said the presidential election was all the talk on campus .
" There 's more excitement among young people than there ever has been , " she said .
Tim Pilkenton , 24 , of Raleigh , a National Guardsman who has been deployed to Kuwait and Germany while trying to finish engineering studies at Wake Technical Community College , said young people were key for Obama .
" Every person I know " voted for Obama , he said , including many first - time voters .
People age 18 to 29 are 21 % of the U.S. population , said youth vote expert Peter Levine at Tufts University , so at 18 % of the electorate , " They 're not punching up to their weight . "
On the other hand , he said , they 're boosting their share even as other ages turn out in growing numbers .
As for turnout , Levine said 55 % of eligible people under 30 voted in 1972 , the first year 18 - to - 20 - year - olds could vote .
That 's the record and " they could easily beat that " in 2008 , he said .
The national exit poll showed Obama won 66 % of voters under 30 , higher than Ronald Reagan 's 59 % in 1984 and the highest in data available since 1976 .
A landside for black voters
Fully 95 % of black voters backed Obama , the exit poll showed — breaking the record of 90 % for Walter Mondale in 1984 .
Their 13 % share of the electorate was also a record ; they 'd never before passed 11 % .
The upshot for 2008 : Blacks accounted for 23 % of Obama 's votes .
In 2004 , 56 % of eligible black citizens voted .
David Bositis , a black - vote expert at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , estimated black turnout in 2008 was 65 % to 70 % — well above the previous record of 58 % in 1968 , the first election after the Voting Rights Act passed .
Bositis said Obama 's opposition to the Iraq war and plans to revive the economy were part of his appeal to blacks , along with " the emotional component " of helping him make history .
Daniel Baxter , the elections director in the 83 % black city of Detroit , got at that emotional component in a plea for patience to voters faced with long lines .
" What is five hours , " he asked , " in comparison to waiting for 300 years for this moment to arrive ? "

Ramalinga Raju resigns , reveals shocking details
January 07 , 2009 11:35 IST
Last Updated : January 07 , 2009 15:41 IST
Satyam [ Get Quote ]
Computer on Wednesday plunged into a deep crisis , as B Ramalinga Raju resigned as its chairman after admitting to major financial wrong - doings and saying his last - ditch efforts to fill the " fictitious assets with real ones " through Maytas acquisition failed .
The beleaguered IT giant , already under scanner over the aborted acquisition of firms promoted by the chairman 's family , received a rude shock days ahead of its January 10 board meeting , with Raju stepping down along with his brother and Managing Director B Rama Raju .
" It was like riding a tiger , not knowing how to get off without being eaten , " Ramalinga Raju said in a letter to Satyam 's board of directors , wherein he listed major financial wrong - doings over the years to inflate the profits .
Listed at New York Stock Exchange , the company could face regulatory action in the US , analysts said .
While Raju recommended DSP Merrill Lynch be entrusted the task of " quickly exploring some merger opportunities , " the company informed the stock exchanges that the investment banker has terminated its engagement with Satyam .
Noting that every attempt to eliminate gaps in balance sheet , purely on account of inflated profits over several years , failed , Raju said : " I am now prepared to subject myself to the laws of the land and face consequences thereof . "
Low percentage of promoter equity in the company , where four independent directors resigned in the last two weeks over the acquisition fiasco , could lead to a takeover and expose the gap , he said in the letter , also sent to regulator SEBI .
The promoters ' share in Satyam has now dipped to just over 3 per cent that too is pledged with lenders .
Shares of Satyam plunged by over 40 per cent immediately after the announcement of resignations , necessitating an overhaul of the Board and management .
Raju will continue as chairman till the Board finds a replacement , even as speculation was rife that Satyam President Ram Mynampati would take over as Chairman .
Rama Raju would also continue as Managing Director , but only till the time the Board is expanded .
Ramalinga Raju requested the Board to " hold together " to take some important steps , while hoping that one of the Board members T R Prasad was " well - placed to mobilise support from the government at this crucial time . "
Satyam is the country 's fourth largest IT firm and has has over 51,000 employees .
Giving details of the financial irregularities , Raju said the company 's balance sheet as of September 30 carries " inflated ( non-existent ) cash and bank balances of Rs 5,040 crore ( as against Rs 5,361 crore reflected in the books . "
The balance sheet also carries " an accrued interest of Rs 376 crore which is non-existent , an understated liability of Rs 1230 crore on account of funds arranged by me ( Raju ) , an overstated debtors position of Rs 490 crore ( as against Rs 2651 crore reflected in the books , " Raju said .
He further said that Satyam reported a revenue of Rs 2700 crore ( Rs 27 billion ) for the September quarter and an operating margin of Rs 649 crore ( 24 per cent of revenue ) as against the actual revenue of Rs 2112 crore ( Rs 21.12 billion ) and an actual operating margin of Rs 61 crore ( 3 per cent of revenue ) .
" This has resulted in artificial cash and bank balances going up Rs 588 crore in Q2 alone , " Raju said .
" The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits over a period of last several years ( limited only to Satyam standalone , books of subsidiaries reflecting true performance ) .
" What started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years , " Raju further said .
" It has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of the company operations grew significantly ...
The differential in the real profits and the one reflected in the books was further accentuated by the fact that the company had to carry additional resources and assets to justify higher level of operations thereby significantly increasing the costs , " he said .
" The aborted Maytas acquisition deal was the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones .
Maytas ' investors were convinced that this is a good divestment opportunity and a strategic fit .
Once Satyam 's problem was solved , it was hoped that Maytas ' payments can be delayed .
But that was not to be , " he said .
Raju , however , claimed that neither he , nor the Managing Director ( including our spouses ) sold any shares in the last eight years - excepting for a small proportion declared and sold for philanthropic purposes .
Raju further said he or the company 's MD did not take " even one rupee / dollar from the company and have not benefited in financial terms on account of the inflated results . "
Meanwhile , reacting to the Satyam fiasco Sebi chairman C B Bhave said that the Satyam chairman 's ' confession to the board is an event of horrifying magnitude ' .
“ If the surgeon general or the secretary of health or the head of the C.D.C. would come out and make a really strong statement on this , I think the whole thing would go away , ” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez , president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute , who has a severely autistic daughter whose disease , he argues , is genetic .

Asked why public health officials have been reticent , the acting surgeon general , Dr. Steven K. Galson , issued a statement saying that “ childhood immunizations are one of the greatest achievements of all time ” and that “ scientific evidence clearly shows that vaccines do not contribute to autism . ”
He has spoken on issues like obesity , tobacco , air travel and exercise , but his office said he had not been questioned by journalists about vaccines and autism .
Dr. Offit ’s book , published in September by Columbia University Press , has been widely endorsed by pediatricians , autism researchers , vaccine companies and medical journalists who say it sums up , in layman ’s language , the scientific evidence for vaccines and forcefully argues that vulnerable parents are being manipulated by doctors promoting false cures and lawyers filing class - action suits .
“ Opponents of vaccines have taken the autism story hostage , ” Dr. Offit said .
“ They do n’t speak for all parents of autistic kids , they use fringe scientists and celebrities , they ’ve set up cottage industries of false hope , and they ’re hurting kids .
Parents pay out of their pockets for dangerous treatments , they take out second mortgages to buy hyperbaric oxygen chambers .
It ’s just unconscionable . ”
His opponents dismiss him as “ Dr. Proffit ” because he received millions in royalties for his RotaTeq vaccine .
One group he criticizes harshly in the book is Generation Rescue , which advocates treating autistic children with wheat - and dairy - free diets , vitamins and chelation to remove mercury from the body .
Ms. McCarthy , her companion , the actor Jim Carrey , and Deirdre Imus , wife of the radio host , are all on its board .
J. B. Handley , who founded Generation Rescue in 2005 , rejected Dr. Offit ’s attacks , saying : “ We have hundreds of fully recovered children .
I ’m very frustrated that Dr. Offit , who ’s never treated an autistic child , is spending his time trying to refute the reality of biomedical recovery . ”
He scoffed at the idea that Dr. Offit had had numerous death threats but condemned threats generally , saying he had received some himself .
“ No one should ever do that to another human being , ” he said .
The hike is long and dusty , across two miles of shrub - strewn desert , south of Apple Valley .
But Lisa Fernandez , a Web designer and hot springs enthusiast , has often made the trek from the trail head to the pools of steaming water .
She believes the payoff is worth it : a day of soaking in undeveloped , natural hot springs in the shade of pine and willow trees at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains .
The naturally heated water at the Deep Creek Hot Springs increases her heart rate , soothes her tense muscles and , she says , detoxifies her skin .
“ I just love it , ” she said .
But just as nature lovers swarm to Deep Creek and other rustic hot - water oases to stave off the chills of winter , a spate of tainted - water fatalities and related studies have raised questions about the health risks of soaking in hot springs .

In April , the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assigned a team of scientists and physicians to study a recent spike in deaths caused by Naegleria flowleri , an amoeba found naturally in bodies of warm fresh water , such as lakes and hot springs .
The group was formed in response to six deaths in 2007 in Arizona , Florida and Texas , all attributed to the amoeba , which typically enters the body through the nasal passages and then attacks brain tissue .
Infections are almost always fatal .
Between 1998 and 2007 , the U.S. recorded 33 cases ; all but one was fatal , according to the CDC .
The six deaths in 2007 represented the sixth - highest annual number of cases in the last 70 years .
Locally , anxiety over the infection grew when Naegleria fowleri claimed another victim this summer , a 9 - year - old boy , who officials believe contracted the amoeba while swimming in Lake Elsinore in Riverside County .

An ’07 spike in cases
The recent CDC research could not explain what caused the spike in Naegleria flowleri cases in 2007 .
And the group warned that , although the number of infections has been relatively low compared with the millions of swimmers who enter warm freshwater pools each year , scientists still do n’t know why certain people get infected and what concentration of amoeba in the water poses a significant risk .
The CDC group recommended public health agencies disseminate more information on the infection to potential swimmers .
In a separate study conducted in 2003 by Montana State University , researchers tested the waters at 23 hot springs in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks and found Naegleria flowleri and other amoebas present in the hot - water pools .
The study concluded that the amoeba is not a transient organism but rather thrives in some hot springs .
“ These amoebae may pose health risks to people who use the hot springs for recreation , ” according to the study , published in Applied and Environmental Biology in October 2003 .

In fact , three cases of Naegleria fowleri infection ( known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis , or PAM ) have been contracted at Fernandez ’s favorite hot spring , Deep Creek , since 1971 , according to the CDC .
The U.S. Forest Service has since posted a sign near the pools , warning about the dangers of the amoeba infection .
Overall , health officials note , the odds of infection from Naegleria fowleri are slim and can be reduced to nearly nil with the proper precautions .
And of the 121 cases ( all but one were fatal ) of Naegleria fowleri reported in the United States from 1937 to 2007 , four have been tied to hot springs , according to the CDC .
By comparison , there were more than 36,000 drowning deaths in the U.S. between 1996 and 2005 , according to the CDC .
“ It ’s a very rare disease but obviously deadly , ” said Dr. Michael Beach , who co-chaired the CDC working group .

The amoeba can survive in just about the hottest water that humans can tolerate , Beach said .
The Deep Creek hot spring usually bubbles up at a steamy 103 degrees .
So why do so many more infections occur after swimming in warm lakes and rivers than in hot springs ?
Beach points out that the amoeba enters through the nose , and so swimmers who splash or submerge themselves in the water are more likely to get infected .
Hot springs enthusiasts typically soak quietly , without submerging their heads .
That was the scene during a recent visit to Deep Creek Hot Springs , where about half a dozen visitors lounged about in one of several natural and artificially deepened pools , near the banks of Deep Creek .
The water gurgles up from fissures in a battleship - sized mound of milk - colored boulders .
One of the deepest pools was made years ago by volunteers who used river rocks and concrete to form a tub about three feet deep .
Other pools are formed where spring water gathers naturally in large , shallow hollows in the rocks .
The smallest pools are the hottest and all are clothing - optional .
Fernandez , founder of www .hotspringsenthusiast.com , an online source of maps and other information about hot springs across the U.S. , believes the health benefits of soaking in hot springs far outweigh the risks .
Advertisement
Both Fernandez and Beach say bathers can reduce the chances of contracting the amoeba by plugging their nose or wearing nose plugs in a hot spring pool to keep water out of the nasal passages .
( Infections do not occur from drinking contaminated water . )
But because scientists have yet to determine when the risk of infection is highest , medical experts cannot regulate or enforce a standard to protect swimmers from the infection , according to the CDC report .
Tests to determine if Naegleria fowleri exists in a pool of water take weeks to grow and identify the amoeba .
--
Health warnings
After the death of the boy in Riverside County , public health officials issued an advisory , suggesting swimmers take precautions , such as wearing nose clips to reduce the chances of infection .
But Riverside County public health officer Eric Frykman said the risk of contracting the amoeba from swimming is so slim that the average person has a higher risk of dying in a car accident while driving to and from a swimming hole .
Advertisement
“ The risk is exceptionally low , ” he said .
Still , the infection is particularly vicious , coming on with flu - like symptoms such as headaches , a stiff neck , vomiting and fever .
Later , the victim can become disoriented and suffer from seizures and hallucinations .
Death usually follows within three to seven days after the symptoms appear .
The CDC report concluded with this warning : “ The only certain way to prevent Naegleria fowleri infection is to refrain from water - related activities . ”

You 've got to hand it to Boston .
In 30 short years , it 's built a highway that 's launched countless corruption scandals , seen record cost overruns and even killed someone .
The $ 15 billion Big Dig is truly a gift that just keeps on giving .
And now it seems it is n't even doing what it was intended to do - reduce congestion .
An analysis by the Boston Globe found the 3.5 - mile tunnel under the center of town has actually doubled commute times in some areas , proving two things :
First , major road projects need parallel investments in mass transit .
And second , it 's all but impossible for cities to pave away traffic problems .
The nation 's single most expensive underground road construction project has gained international acclaim as a highway project gone wrong .
The Big Dig was designed to replace the notorious Central
Artery , a double - decker elevated highway that bisected the city and routinely saw traffic jams that lasted hours .
One study concluded the Central Artery would be gridlocked 16 hours a day by 2010 if something big was n't done , and done quickly .
That something was the Big Dig .
The project faced huge obstacles from the moment it was conceived in the 1970s , not the least of which included tunneling through a huge expanse of landfill and doing it without disrupting any of the 190,000 or so cars that traversed the Central Artery each day .
And then there were the myriad neighborhood concerns about the Dig 's impact on ordinary Bostonians .
It was a Herculean task , which is why it took the better part of three decades to complete .
When the bulk of the project opened to traffic five years ago , the Dig 's budget had swelled from an $ 2.8 billion ( inflation adjusted ) to $ 14.6 billion .
And it was n't long before the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority discovered thousands of leaks in the tunnel walls .
Things went from bad to worse in 2006 when a three - ton panel fell from the ceiling , killing a motorist .
Despite being a national embarrassment , advocates say the Big Dig has alleviated traffic , and to a large degree they 're right .
Getting across town on the Central Artery could take as long as 15 minutes ; these days you can do it in three minutes or less .
Back in the day the Artery might be bumper - to - bumper for 14 hours .
Nowadays , the Dig is a breeze .
But get out of downtown and things do n't look so rosy .
The Globe examined reams of state highway records and concluded that congestion has gotten worse north and south of the city - in some cases a lot worse .
One 11 - mile stretch of highway just north of Boston saw commute times double from 12 minutes to 25 .
Similar delays were seen on other highways leading to the tunnels .
It 's easy to see why .
The Dig has encouraged more suburbanites to drive , which might have been OK had the highways leading to the tunnels been expanded to handle the added traffic .
But of course they were n't .
When the Central Artery still stood , traffic flowed through an hourglass , with the roads leading into and away from the Artery wider than the Artery itself .
The Dig reversed that - the roads leading into and out of the tunnels are narrower than the tunnels , so everyone creeps toward the Dig , speeds through it , then creeps away from it .
In other words , the Dig did n't solve the bottleneck , it just pushed it out of central Boston .
It has n't helped that funding for public transit has n't kept pace with the need .
The MBTA , which runs Boston 's subway and commuter rail network , is spending money where it can on new vehicles and tentatively extending lines further into the suburbs .
But it 's also drowning in debt , limiting its options .
In 2005 , then - Gov. Mitt Romney proposed a transit funding plan that provided money for maintenance but little in the way of expansion .
It 's no wonder Boston area motorists saw the completion of the Big Dig as an opportunity to get behind the wheel and start driving into the city .
The Big Dig is a telling case study .
Build new roads to alleviate traffic and you invite more drivers to hit the road .
That causes more backups , which leads to increased demands for more highways .
It 's a vicious cycle .
Do n't get us wrong – the Big Dig has done some great things for Boston .
The giant green monstrosity that bisected the city is gone , reconnecting neighborhoods and creating new space for pedestrians , bikers , and greenery .
The new suspension bridge built as part of the project is world class .
And if you 're only trying to get across town ( as opposed to trying to get into town ) , the Dig has made it a breeze .
But the Big Dig was first and foremost meant to alleviate congestion .
If it has failed to do that , as the Globe analysis suggests , then it is $ 15 billion down the tube .

" Well , again , we 're wondering here whether or not Barack Obama in fact is the president of the United States , " Chris Wallace told Fox News viewers , well over an hour after Obama had taken the oath of office today .
Fox News replayed the swearing - in moment when President Obama and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. each bobbled the words to the constitutional oath .
" They had a kind of garbled oath , " Wallace said .
" It 's just conceivable that this will end up going to the courts , " Wallace speculated .
A bit of wishful thinking on behalf of ( presumably conservative )
Fox viewers ?
Perhaps .
But Wallace quickly added : " As Brit Hume rightly pointed out , if it goes to the Supreme Court , certainly Chief Justice Roberts will say that he took the oath . "

Hospital Refuses to Admit 1.4lbs Preterm Baby
On December 18 , 2008 , in Zhu Ma Dian City , China , Yu Lan Zhou ’s pregnant daughter - in - law , who was only 7 months pregnant , gave birth to a preterm baby boy in a local clinic .
Born way too early , he weighed only 1.4lbs at delivery and could not breathe properly on his own .
The newborn boy ’s heartbeat was very weak and his arms and legs were the size of an adult ’s fingers .
The clinic suggested that the family take the baby to a hospital for immediate medical attention .
Zhou took her grandson to a local military hospital , but they refused to admit the baby when she could not come up with the required advance payment of 10,000 yuan , about $ 1,500 .
In tears , Zhou held her grandson to her chest and returned to her home , which has none of the badly needed medical equipment to keep her grandson alive .
At home , with no incubator , no oxygen tubes , and no medication , Zhou holds her grandson against her chest to keep him warm against the cold , which sometimes gets below freezing in her house .
To help the boy breath , she gently blows air near his face and struggles to feed him .
â€ œI can only use a dropper to feed him because his mouth is too small to suck on any bottles , and it takes an hour to feed him in the beginning , now he can slowly suck on his own , â€ she said happily .
With Zhou ’s loving care , her grandson has lived 11 days now at her home .
“ For a preterm baby this small to live this long without intensive care has to be a miracle , ” said a Pediatrician from the Hong Kong Chinese University .
There is no way to tell if the baby will survive another day without proper medication and as of today , we have heard no news of the baby being admitted to any hospital .
Edit : Reports indicate that because of the publicity the story had , many people from all over the world offered to send money to cover the medical costs .
The local hospital also agreed to admit the baby on the evening of the 28th , but the weather was too cold to move the fragile baby .
Unfortunately the boy was not strong enough to make it to the hospital and passed away at 4:00 am on the 29th .
Reports indicate the boy passed due to lack of oxygen .

“ Keep in mind that social networking sites like MySpace did not exist until recently , ” said Nick Akerman , a New York lawyer who has written and lectured extensively on the act .
“ This case will be simply another important step in the expanded use of this statute to protect the public from computer crime . ”

Other computer fraud experts said they found the verdict chilling .
“ As a result of the prosecutor ’s highly aggressive , if not unlawful , legal theory , ” said Matthew L. Levine , a former federal prosecutor who is a defense lawyer in New York , “ it is now a crime to ‘ obtain information ’ from a Web site in violation of its terms of service .
This cannot be what Congress meant when it enacted the law , but now you have it . ”
Ms. Drew , who showed little emotion during the trial , sat stone - faced as the clerk read the jury ’s verdict and left the courtroom quickly , her face red and twisted with rage .
Her lawyer , H. Dean Steward , said outside the courthouse that he believed the trial was grandstanding by Mr. O’Brien in an effort to keep his job , with the coming change in the White House .
“ I do n’t have any satisfaction at all , ” Mr. Steward said of the verdict .
Judge
Wu scheduled a hearing on the request for a new trial for late December .
Since the story surrounding the suicide became public last year , Mr. O’Brien has discussed with his staff how his feelings as a parent motivated him to bring the charges against Ms. Drew .
He alluded to those feelings on Wednesday at a news conference .
“ This was obviously a case that means a lot to me , ” he said .
The case has been a collection of anomalies .
Judge
Wu appeared ambivalent regarding some key issues at the trial , like whether any testimony about Megan ’s suicide would be allowed ( he did allow it ) and how to rule on a defense motion to throw out the charges ( he had not ruled as of Wednesday ) .

「 TOEIC は簡単な勉強で800点取れる」みたいなエントリがしばしばホッテントリ入りしますが、本当に「英語が使えること」の真価が発揮されるのは、英語で情報を仕入れられるようになってからです。そして、英語で情報を仕入れるには、英語をある程度早く読むことができないといけない。
あの無教養なアメリカ人でさえ、平均して毎分200単語程度読むのに対し、日本人で毎分200単語読める人は稀です。ちなみに私は、この方法の実践によって、400〜900単語／分*1程度で読めるようになりました。理解の程度は、ゆっくり読んでいた頃と変わりありません。むしろ、英文になれたおかげでよくなったと言えるかもしれません。
本エントリで紹介する方法を実践すれば、1ヶ月で毎分300〜600単語の英文読解が可能になります*2。日本の大学生のトップ1パーセントでさえ、この速度で読めないのではないでしょうか。なお、本エントリは、TOEICで650点以上、基礎的な文法がそれなりにできている人を対象としております。
速読を阻 む3 つの「壁 」 ここでは、英文の速読を阻む3つの「壁」を紹介します。乗り越えるべき「壁」を知ることは、目的を達成する際に欠くべからざる過程であります。
ま ず1つ目は、 「読み返し」。パラグラフ･リーディングという言葉からも分かるように、英文はパラグラフごとに大きな意味があります。しばしば読んでいる英文の意味が分からないからといって前に戻って読む人がいますが、これはあまり意味がありません。むしろ、分からないことがあれば先に進み、パラグラフを読み終えるべきなのです。また、人は無意識的に読み返しをしており、無意識の読み返しを排除すれば、最低でも10％読む速度が上がるといわれています。
2つ目の壁は、「 subvocalizing」。日本語に訳すのは難しいのですが、小さな声を出したり口を動かしながら読んだり、あるいは頭の中で音として再生しながら読むのがこれに当たります。この場合、目で見たデータを音声変換して、それからその意味を脳味噌で処理するので、目で見たものを直接脳味噌で処理するのに比べて、無駄な工程が一つ増えます。言い換えれば、「文字（視覚）→音→理解」と進むより、「文字（視覚）→理解」と進んだ方が効率的だ、ということです。
3つ目は、 「きちんと読みすぎること」。赤文字でないのは、1つ目と微妙に被っおり、それほど重要でないからです。とりあえず、「理解したのにも関わらずもう1度読んだりする」のは非効率だということを覚えておいてもらえれば良いです。
指を使って読 む 右手*4で握りこぶしを作り、人差し指をまっすぐ伸ばします。m9（＾Д＾）
次に、その人差し指で読んでいる行の下をなぞりながら読んでいきます。最初はそれほど早くなくてよいので（一行3〜6秒程度）、止まったり戻ったりせずに、同じペースで読み進めてみてください。こうすることで、先に挙げた「読み返し」を防ぐことができるのです。
ここで重要なのは、止まったり戻ったりしないこと、そして、一定の速さを保つことです。一定の速さを保てるよう、2〜3ページ練習してみましょう。分からない単語はいちいち調べずに、後で調べるなり無視するなりしてください。ラダーシリーズやナビつき洋書シリーズは、単語や全体の解説が日本語で載っているので、結構役に立つと思います。
ここでもう一度、3分でどれだけ読めるか測ってみてください。読み返しがなくなっていれば、先ほどよりも速く読めているはずです。そして、読んだ単語数を3で割り、1分間にどれだけ読めたか確認してみてください。
指を使うのに慣れたら、次のステップへ行きましょう。
2-2-2-2法 まずは、2-2-2-2法という練習方法を行います。2分間のリーディングを4回連続で行うのでこの名がつきました。以下の手順に従って練習してください。
読み始めの場所にマーク（1）をつける。
（1）から読み始める。制限時間は2分間。2分で読めたところにマーク（2）をつける。
再び（1）から読み始める。制限時間は2分間。2分で読めたところにマーク（3）をつける。マーク（2）を超えられるようにする。

Not content with merely throwing money at the automakers , the Fed has new plans to become the world 's largest auto dealership .
Details of the plan were buried in this announcement : Fed Opens TALF Loans to All Borrowers , Extends Term .
The Federal Reserve revised its $ 200 billion program aimed at reviving credit to consumers and small businesses , extending the term of loans to three years from one year .
Under the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , or TALF , the Fed will also loan to all eligible borrowers rather than through an auction process , the central bank said today in a statement in Washington .
The change is designed “ to provide more certain investor access , ” the Fed said .
The central bank pledged Dec. 16 to “ employ all available tools ” to restore economic growth , including the TALF and other emergency lending .
The Fed has already expanded its balance sheet to a record $ 2.3 trillion to stem the worst credit crisis in seven decades .
Under the TALF , the Fed will lend to holders of AAA - rated asset - backed securities backed by “ newly and recently originated ” loans .
Those loans include education , car and credit - card loans , and borrowing guaranteed by the Small Business Administration .
The Fed intends to have the TALF running by February .
The Fed said that it would accept securitized auto credits , including leases and auto dealer floor plan loans .

Sea of Unwanted Imports

Gleaming new Mercedes cars roll one by one out of a huge container ship here and onto a pier .
Ordinarily the cars would be loaded on trucks within hours , destined for dealerships around the country .
But these are not ordinary times .
For now , the port itself is the destination .
Unwelcome by dealers and buyers , thousands of cars worth tens of millions of dollars are being warehoused on increasingly crowded port property .
And for the first time , Mercedes - Benz , Toyota , and Nissan have each asked to lease space from the port for these orphan vehicles .
They are turning dozens of acres of the nation ’s second - largest container port into a parking lot , creating a vivid picture of a paralyzed auto business and an economy in peril .
“ This is one way to look at the economy , ” Art Wong , a spokesman for the port , said of the cars .
“ And it scares you to death . ”
“ We ’re supposed to move things , not store them , ” Mr. Wong said .
Kurt Golledge , 48 , was one of just two truckers loading his green , 75 - foot - long hauler with cars last week .
Mr. Golledge said eight of his colleagues were laid off this month because Toyota dealers did not want more deliveries .
“ I was dropping cars in Henderson , Nev. , about a month ago and the dealer told me : ‘ Take ’em somewhere else and dump ’em , ’ ” said Mr. Golledge , who works for a company called Allied Systems .
“ All the dealers are telling us the same thing . ”
“ The ships keep coming , but there ’s nowhere for the cars to go , ” Mr. Golledge said .
He said he believed the vehicles he was loading would be his last before he was laid off , and he was already considering where he might find a new job .

This system is available in most NFL stadiums :
Fans still are urged to complain to an usher or call a security hotline in the stadium to report unruly behavior .
But text - messaging lines — typically advertised on stadium scoreboards and on signs where fans gather — are aimed at allowing tipsters to surreptitiously alert security personnel via cellphone without getting involved with rowdies or missing part of a game .
As of this week , 29 of the NFL ’s 32 teams had installed a text - message line or telephone hotline .
Three clubs have neither : the New Orleans Saints , St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans .
Ahlerich says he will “ strongly urge ” all clubs to have text lines in place for the 2009 season .
A text line will be available at the Super Bowl for the first time when this season ’s championship game is played at Tampa ’s Raymond James Stadium on Feb .
1 .
“ If there ’s someone around you that ’s just really ruining your day , now you do n’t have to sit there in silence , ” says Jeffrey Miller , the NFL ’s director of strategic security .
“ You can do this .
It ’s very easy .
It ’s quick .
And you get an immediate response . ”
President Barack Obama and his economic team will soon attempt to convince Congress that spending upwards of $ 1 trillion tax dollars ( more or less ) will shorten the recession .
A good part of the spending will be on public works and infrastructure projects that aim to create ( or save ) many millions of jobs .
Some of the spending will be in the form of grants to state governments to prevent cutbacks in education and medical services .
And a smaller ( and laudable ) part of the program provides tax relief to some individuals and corporations .
Although some economists supported the bank and auto bailouts and although many more support a major federal stimulus package , this economist holds that both measures are counter - productive .
Both are likely to prolong the economic slump and not shorten it .
This may seem harsh but the ultimate cure for a recession is recession .
Economic booms " malinvest " labor and capital and recessions are necessary to " clean out " these malinvestments .
Declining prices allow consumers to more easily purchase products ( homes , autos ) in excess supply ; inventories are reduced and supply and demand are brought into balance .
And declining profits weed out business organizations and their managers that have invested poorly during the boom ; bankruptcy allows resources to flow to more profitable areas of the economy .
A sustainable recovery is now possible .
It should be obvious that random bailouts can short - circuit the recovery process by propping up poorly performing companies and slowing resource reallocation .
With tens of billions in lost profits , General Motors and Chrysler have demonstrated vast inefficiency ; yet taxpayer bailouts will preserve their poor management and high - cost union jobs .
Worse , other more efficient automobile suppliers will lose sales to these Detroit ’s dinosaurs and may , themselves , require subsidies .
It just never ends .
The case for bailing out spendthrift state governments or for additional infrastructure spending is equally flawed .
Supporters constantly argue that " since consumers wo n’t spend , governments must spend ( to create more jobs ) . "
And since it ’s claimed that there are vast unmet public sector needs , what better time to undertake major road construction or help state governments fund programs such as Medicaid .
Some public policies are wrong in both theory and practice ; infrastructure spending and bailing out state governments to shorten recessions are examples .
In theory , the money to fund the stimulus will have to come from either massive federal borrowing , substantial tax hikes , or pure money inflation by the Federal Reserve .
But none of this can remotely promote recovery in the private sector of the economy .
All it will do is substitute some private / public sector jobs in one part of the economy for other private / public sector jobs in another part of the economy .
Public spending on major infrastructure projects to fight recession is especially problematic .
( Think " Big Dig " in Boston . )
Which programs will be undertaken ?
In which congressional districts ?
And where will the labor resources come from ?
Supporters of public works automatically assume that the current increase in unemployment provides a vast army of workers to fill new jobs .
Not so fast .
Unemployed workers with vastly different skill levels are scattered unevenly throughout the economy .
It is simply unimaginable that even a tiny percentage of them would have the proper skill requirements or would relocate to the politically determined infrastructure projects .
In addition , these projects require extremely long lead times ( sometimes many years of permits and planning ) and are unlikely to begin soon enough to have any near - term effect .
The experience in the 1930 ’s is instructive .
Even though federal government spending increased from $ 9.8 billion in 1934 to $ 14.2 billion in 1940 , the unemployment rate in 1940 was still a staggering 14.6 % .
A 45 % increase in New Deal spending in 6 years did not end the Depression .
Contrary to economist Paul Krugman and others , the federal government cannot spend us out of our economic quagmire .
The best that the government can do is not make things worse .
We do n’t need more corporate or state bailouts and we do n’t need vast public works programs costing many hundreds of billions .
We do need more prudent private and public spending , lower taxes on income and investment , and a responsible monetary policy from the Federal Reserve .
And we still need lower prices and bankruptcies to finally correct the mistakes of the boom .
The Best of Dom Armentano
11 year - old Judson King , after becoming a Sonic the Hedgehog follower , decided that he desired his own hedgehog .
Unfortunately for him , there was just one problem : Lawrence law in Kansas made owning such animals illegal in the area .
King ’s mother did n’t really mind that her son would n’t be able to purchase one .
After all , she was n’t too thrilled about her son having a hedgehog as a pet in the first place .
She said , “ I thought , that ’s my out .
Now I do n’t have to get him one .
Then he said , ‘ How do we make them legal ? ' ”
From that point on , both King and his mother worked their tails off .
The two spent three years conducting research and gathering pictures in order to fight the Lawrence law .
Thankfully for King , commissioners finally agreed to let Judson speak at the city hall after a few months .
The commissioners were unable to find a reason why such a law was in place and overturned the law .
King received his very own hedgehog for Christmas this year .
Though , the fact that the commissioners could n’t find a good reason why owning hedgehogs should be illegal makes one wonder why hedgehog ownership was against the law originally , does n’t it ?
At least it can be said that , thanks to Sonic and King , anyone can now have their own hedgehog in Lawrence .

Fox analyst : Franken victory ' the bottom ' for GOP David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Al Franken has been certified the winner in the Minnesota Senate race but ousted incumbent Norm Coleman is planning to challenge the results of the recount in court .
Meanwhile , some conservative Republicans , including Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh , have begun charging Franken with " stealing " the election .
Fox 's Steve Doocy asked a group of political analysts on Friday , " Is there some funny business going on in Minnesota ? "
In response , Republican commentator Andrea Tantaros insisted that , although she does not hold Franken personally responsible , " Democrats are stealing this election .
...
There are more ballots in some counties than there are actual voters . "
" I know Republicans thought we hit the bottom on Election Day , but this is the bottom , " Tantaros later added .
The claim that there are more ballots than voters in some counties has been a common refrain amount those raising charges of fraud .
For example , pundit Dick Morris recently asserted , in a column titled , " Stop Al Franken From Stealing the Election , " that " in Ramsey County , 177 more votes have been counted than people who voted on Election Day . "
However , Talking Points Memo notes that claims like these refer to situations where " the votes tallied in the recount were more than were counted on Election Night , with no reference to what was on the voter register .
The whole point of a recount is to find votes that the machines failed to pick up at first . "
Tantaros herself has drawn attention in recent months by her " gratuitous insults " of Democrats and her attempt to defend Sarah Palin 's erroneous claim that the vice - president " is in charge of " the Senate .
Among Doocy 's other panelists , Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund , who has been a long - time proponent of the idea that Democrats routinely steal elections through " voter fraud , " largely agreed with Tantaros , saying , " Al Franken is not stealing the election -- but the canvassing board which conducted the recount made some very controversial calls . "
However , Democratic consultant Dan Gerstein commented , " There 's naturally going to be questions raised , but I think the Republicans are playing with fire by making accusations of stealing the election .
There 's no evidence that Al Franken has done anything wrong , and John Fund just confirmed that . "
" What 's wrong is to suggest that ... the canvassing board is partisan , " Gerstein concluded , noting that there is only one Democrat on the board , while the other members are Republicans or non-partisan .

You can make money from your hobby .
Whether you knit , or write , or make photographs , or grow a vegetable garden , or tinker with cars , or build web sites , or collect ancient coins — you can make money from your hobby .
I 'm not saying it 's possible to get rich by playing your violin at weddings , or by weaving baskets from pine needles , but earning money from a hobby is a nice way to get paid for doing something you would do anyhow .
This article is the first in a series that will explore how to turn a hobby into a source of side income .
In the weeks and months ahead , I 'll describe general best practices , discuss potential pitfalls , and provide case studies culled from my friends , and from the stories of readers like you .
( If you 'd like to share your experience , please drop me a line . )
First , by way of introduction , here are some ground - rules for making money from hobbies .
Focus on Something You Love
Pursue something you 're passionate about .
Choose a hobby that you enjoy , and find a way to make money from it .
Do n't choose a hobby simply because it might make money and then dive into it with that aim in mind .
You should be doing this hobby because you love it ; any side - income should be secondary .
I love to write .
I was struggling with debt .
I began to read personal finance books , and then to summarize what I 'd learned for my personal web site .
From this , Get Rich Slowly was born .
Now I make over a thousand dollars a month writing about personal finance .
But I did n't start this for the money — I started this because I was passionate about the subject .
Keep it fun .
Do n't let it become a chore .
Be Creative
If you 're interested in making money from a hobby but do n't know where to start , think outside the box .
What skills do you have that others do n't ?
Define the term “ hobby ” broadly .
Find something that you can do that most others cannot , something for which other people might be willing to pay .
At my day job , I have a customer whose wife loves to cook .
She turned this hobby into a part - time job as a personal chef .
She prepares meals in advance for wealthy clients .
She spends a few hours a day preparing a week - long menu for people who pay her handsomely for her time .
I have a friend who likes to travel .
One day he discovered that he could subsidize his journeys by writing about the places he visited , and by taking photographs .
Now every couple of years he takes an all expense paid vacation .
He 's doing something he'd do anyhow , and it does n't cost him a dime .
Do n't Force It
Your hobby will not make you rich .
In most cases , it wo n't even net you enough to allow you to quit your day job .
It 's quite possible , however , to earn enough money to make the hobby self - sustaining , to keep yourself in new tools and equipment .
My brother builds speakers and works with audio equipment as a hobby .
He makes some money at it .
( “ Spending money , ” he says . )
Jeff notes , “ It 's not hard to make money from a hobby .
What 's difficult is trying to turn it into an actual business .
Moving from a hobby to a business is a pain - in - the - ass . ”
Often when you try to take your hobby to the next level , the joy goes out of it .
Suddenly the extra income just is n't worth it .
When I tried to turn my computer - building hobby into a business , I hated it .
There 's a balance to be achieved , and if you can find it , you can have a fun while earning extra income .
Do n't Underestimate Your Ability
It 's easy to discount your abilities .
When you truly love something , your prolonged experience can give you skills and knowledge that you do n't appreciate .
For example , I have a love for early 20th - century American pop culture .
My brain is filled with facts and anecdotes about once - famous recording artists .
I sometimes find myself under the impression that everybody knows who Billy Murray was , or is familiar with the song “ Ukulele Lady ” .
But this is n't common knowledge — it 's specialized .
The same concept holds true for you and your hobby .
Know a lot about Napoleonic warfare ?
Start a blog about Admiral Nelson .
Spend time tinkering with bicycles ?
Open a small - scale bike repair service .
Not everybody knows what you know .
Do n't sell yourself short .
Market Yourself
This can be difficult .
In order to actually earn income , you need customers .
But just as most people have a tendency to underestimate their abilities , they also tend be uncomfortable with self - promotion .
There 's no shame in mentioning your money - making hobby to friends , family , and neighbors .
You need n't be pushy .
Just mention it at natural points in the conversation .
If you 've decided to do some woodworking for cash , mention this when your uncle mentions he wants to buy a new bookshelf .
Marketing can be subtle , but it's an absolute necessity if you hope to earn money from your hobby .
People need to know you 're available before they can hire you .
Hone Your Skill
Practice , practice , practice .
The more time and energy you 're willing to devote to your hobby , the better you will become .
The better you become , the more likely that you 'll be able to earn money from it .
Photography is a terrific example .
If you 're willing to make a hundred images a day , you can improve your skills quickly , especially if you teach yourself about composition .
You may never become a professional photographer this way , but you can develop your skill to the point where you can sell images to stock photo agencies , or enter ( and win ) photography contests .
Some people are born with natural talent .
Most of us have to work at it .
Conclusion
Why should you care about making money from hobbies ?
Remember : the wealth equation has two sides .
You accumulate wealth by reducing expenses and by increasing income .
Often we only focus only on our careers when it comes to “ increasing income ” .
But there are other ways to make money .
One of the best is to harness a hobby .
This is an especially good technique if you 're stuck in a low - wage job .
And sometimes a person can turn a money - making hobby into a career .
Who does n't want a job doing something he loves ?
Future articles in this series will cover topics such as :
Making money from photography
Using the web to make money from a hobby
Making the leap to full - time
Creating web sites about your hobby
Teaching your hobby ( thanks , Donna ! )
)
And , of course , plenty of anecdotes from people who have turned their hobbies into money - making ventures
Most of all — whether or not you make money from your hobby , enjoy the time you spend with it !
Hobbies help make life fun .
The Morris Ring says there are more than 14,000 morris dancers in the UK Morris dancing could be " extinct " within 20 years because young people are too embarrassed to take part , a UK Morris association has warned .
The number of people taking part in the English folk dance is falling while the average age of the dancers is going up .
The Morris Ring , which represents 200 troupes , hopes a recruitment drive will revive the flagging tradition .
" There is still time for new blood to get ready for the spring fertility offensive , " said the ring 's Paul Reece .
Morris dancing involves teams of dancers - often wearing hats and bells on their legs - wielding handkerchiefs , sticks or swords , to the accompaniment of folk music .
It dates back centuries , though its origins are unclear .
Once we 've lost this part of our culture it will be almost impossible to revive it
Charlie Corcoran
The Morris Ring Charlie Corcoran , bagman of the Morris Ring , said : " There 's a distinct possibility that in 20 years ' time there will be nobody left .
" It worries me a great deal .
Young people are just too embarrassed to take part .
" This is a serious situation .
The average age of Morris dancing sides is getting older and older .
" Once we 've lost this part of our culture , it will be almost impossible to revive it . "
Dancing season
The Morris Ring aims to encourage the performance of Morris dancing and maintain its traditions .
It says there are more than 14,000 Morris dancers in the UK dancing for more than 800 sides .
There is a serious danger that , in less than a few decades , Morris dancing will be confined to the history books
Paul Reece
The Morris Ring
The association hopes younger people will join over the coming months in time for the main dancing season in the spring .
Mr Reece , chairman of the ring 's advisory council , said : " Such customs and activities were once a common sight around the country .
" Today they are carried out by an ever - dwindling stalwart band of enthusiasts who are determined to keep them alive .
" But there is a serious danger that , in less than a few decades , Morris dancing will be confined to the history books . "

Merb on JRuby 2009-01-09T00:00:00.000Z
My company is developing a commercial cheminformatics Web application with Ruby on Rails .
Due to the nature of the problem domain , this application will require interaction with MX , an essential cheminformatics library written in Java .
This article will first explain how and why Merb entered the picture and then explain how to get Merb installed on a clean JRuby - 1.1.6 installation .
JRuby on Rails : Express - Service Deployment , but a Trainwreck for Development
The initial approach , JRuby on Rails works amazingly well for deployment ( especially using Glassfish and Warbler ) , but is nothing but heartache for development and testing .
My biggest complaints include :
Startup time is prohibitively slow .
It typically takes anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds for JRuby and the Rails environment to completely load on my system .
This leads to the next point …
It typically takes anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds for JRuby and the Rails environment to completely load on my system .
This leads to the next point …
RSpec on JRuby : FAIL 10 - 15 seconds startup time may not sound like a big deal , but consider that in Behavior Driven Development with RSpec you do n't even begin writing application code until you first write a failing test , then watch it fail , then write a small bit of code to make the test pass , then write another test , and so on .
At every point in this process , you need to wait 10 - 15 seconds ( compared to 1 - 2 seconds on MRI ) for JRuby and Rails to startup up .
All of which leads to a lot of waiting around and all of which is anything but Agile .

All of which leads to a lot of waiting around and all of which is anything but Agile .
Autospec on JRuby : FAIL Autospec runs in the background , constantly monitoring modifications to your project and automatically running tests .
It 's a wonderful idea that , that once you 've tried it , will make it very difficult to go back to manually running tests .
The problem is that Autospec is broken on JRuby : ( 1 ) rspec only runs by monkeypatching the startup scripts and then dies when the first failing test is run ; ( 2 ) spec_server does n't work .
One Solution : Encapsulate Java Dependency in Web Service with Merb on JRuby
Given that the interaction with the MX library actually affects very little of the Rails application , one possibility would be to factor out this functionality into a private Web serivice .
One way to do that would be with Merb on JRuby .
At that point , the Rails application could be run under MRI for development and testing , and under JRuby for deployment .
For the unfamiliar , Merb is a lightweight , fast , MVC framework for Ruby ideal for building simple , restful Web services .
Installing Merb on JRuby
Despite reaching the version 1.0 milestone , getting specific information on installing Merb under non-standard platforms like JRuby is not easy .
My solution was based on information provided by Arun Gupta in a recent article .
Starting with a clean installation of JRuby - 1.6 , here 's what worked for me :
jruby - S gem install merb - core -- no - ri -- no - rdoc jruby - S gem install merb - more -- no - ri -- no - rdoc jruby - S gem install activerecord -- no - ri -- no - rdoc jruby - S gem install merb_activerecord -- no - ri -- no-rdoc jruby - S gem install mongrel -- no - ri -- no-rdoc
The problem we need to solve is that trying to install the full Merb metagem itself will complain due to a dependency on DataMapper , which uses native extensions and is not yet available for JRuby , so you 'll get something like this if you try :
jruby - S gem install merb -- no - ri -- no-rdoc Building native extensions .
This could take a while ... / home / rich / local / jruby - 1.1.5/lib/ruby/1.8/mkmf.rb:7 : JRuby does not support native extensions .
Check wiki.
jruby.org for alternatives .
( NotImplementedError ) from / home / rich / local / jruby - 1.1.5/lib/ruby/1.8/mkmf.rb:21 : in `require ' from extconf.rb:21 ERROR : Error installing merb : ERROR : Failed to build gem native extension .
/home/rich/local/jruby -1.1.5/bin/ jruby extconf.rb install merb -- no - ri -- no-rdoc
Gem files will remain installed in /home / rich / local / jruby - 1.1.5/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/do_sqlite3-0.9.10.1 for inspection .
Results logged to /home / rich / local / jruby -1.1.5/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/do_sqlite3-0.9.10.1/ext/do_sqlite3_ext/gem_make.out
Installing only merb - core and merb - more along with ActiveRecord and Mongrel gives us everything we need to create a simple Merb on JRuby application .
A Simple Merb on JRuby Application
We need to tell Merb to use ActiveRecord as the ORM rather than DataMapper when the project is created .
Let 's call our project 'ws ' :
jruby - S merb - gen core -- orm activerecord ws cd ws jruby - S rake db: create nano config/database.yml.sample ... mv config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml jruby - S merb
Pointing your browser at http://localhost:4000/
should render a page .
It will complain about " No routes match the request : / " , but that 's to be expected since we have n't created any .
Conclusions
Merb is n't the only way to create a fast , private , restful web service for accessing Java libraries .
One alternative would be to use a pure - Java solution such as Restlet .
Still , with Merb on JRuby installed and running , it 's possible to explore the tradeoffs .
And the coming merge of Merb and Rails for Rails 3.0 makes doing so all the more compelling .
The Pirate Bay has established itself as the largest BitTorrent tracker , and helps to distribute millions of files a day .
Today , the Pirate Bay team adds yet another service to its arsenal , a free video converter that allows users to put their favorite movies and TV shows on almost every mobile device .
With the wide range of video formats out there , it can be quite a challenge to find a tool that can easily convert these to a format that is supported by your mobile device .
The Pirate Bay , one of the greatest video libraries online , now has an application that does just this .
The ViO converter reduces AVI , MPEG , MP4 , WMV and others videos to 20 % of its original size without any reduction in image quality , and claims to do it faster than any other converter .
The tool is completely free and comes with pre-configured settings for the most wisely used mobile devices , including the iPod , iPhone and BlackBerry .
The converter can be downloaded for free , but strangely enough a . torrent is not available .
The ViO website is currently accessible at a subdomain of The Pirate Bay , complete with a nifty marketing pitch claiming that “ ViO proprietary compression delivers better video quality , higher resolution and smaller file sizes , than anything else on the market today . ”
When ViO is installed there is an optional toolbar that can be installed with it .
The application itself is easy to use , and does indeed a good ( and fast ) job at converting different video files we ’ve tried .
If this takes off , it might even reduce the number of pirated downloads of some of the commercial alternatives .
Update : Some readers noted that ViO violates the GPL for at least 2 projects ( 1 and 2 ) , The Pirate Bay will put the source online to resolve this issue .
A message from the group which has been occupying Athens Polytechnic in response to the death of a 15 - year - old at the hands of police has been published on Athens Indymedia .
" On Saturday December 6 , 2008 , Alexandros Grigoropoulos , a 15 - year old comrade , was murdered in cold blood , with a bullet in the chest by a cop in the area of Exarchia .
" Contrary to the statements of politicians and journalists who are accomplices to the murder , this was not an “ isolated incident ” , but an explosion of the state repression which systematically and in an organised manner targets those who resist , those who revolt , the anarchists and anti-authoritarians .
" It is the peak of state terrorism which is expressed with the upgrading of the role of repressive mechanisms , their continuous armament , the increasing levels of violence they use , with the doctrine of “ zero tolerance ” , with the slandering media propaganda that criminalises those who are fighting against authority .
" It is these conditions that prepare the ground for the intensification of repression , attempting to extract social consent beforehand , and arming the weapons of state murderers in uniform !
" Lethal violence against the people in the social and class struggle is aiming at everybody ’s submission , serving as exemplary punishment , meant to spread fear .
" It is part of the wider attack of the state and the bosses against the entire society , in order to impose more rigid conditions of exploitation and oppression , to consolidate control and repression .
From school and universities to the dungeons of waged slavery with the hundreds of dead workers in the so - called “ working accidents ” and the poverty embracing large numbers of the population …
From the minefields in the borders , the pogroms and the murders of immigrants and refugees to the numerous “ suicides ” in prisons and police stations … from the “ accindental shootings ” in police blockades to violent repression of local resistances , Democracy is showing its teeth !
" From the first moment after the murder of Alexandros , spontaneous demonstrations and riots burst in the center of Athens , the Polytechnic , the Economic and the Law Schools are being occupied and attacks against state and capitalist targets take place in many different neighborhoods and in the city centre .
Demonstrations , attacks and clashes erupt in Thessaloniki , Patras , Volos , Chania and Heraklion in Crete , in Giannena , Komotini and many more cities .
In Athens , in Patission street –outside the Polytechnic and the Economic School - clashes last all night .
Outside the Polytechnic the riot police make use of plastic bullets .
" On Sunday the 7th December , thousands of people demonstrate towards the police headquarters in Athens , attacking the riot police .
Clashes of unprecedented tension spread in the streets of the city centre , lasting until late at night .
Many demonstrators are injured and a number of them are arrested .
" We continue the occupation of the Polytechnic School which started on Saturday night , creating a space for all people who fighting to gather , and one more permanent focus of resistance in the city .
" In the barricades , the university occupations , the demonstrations and the assemblies we keep alive the memory of Alexandros , but also the memory of Michalis Kaltezas and of all the comrades who were murdered by the state , strengthening the struggle for a world without masters and slaves , without police , armies , prisons and borders .
" The bullets of the murderers in uniform , the arrests and beatings of demonstrators , the chemical gas war launched by the police forces , not only cannot manage to impose fear and silence , but they become for the people the reason to raise against state terrorism the cries of the struggle for freedom , to abandon fear and to meet –more and more every day - in the streets of revolt .
To let the rage overflow and drown them !
State terrorism shall not pass !
We demand the immediate release of all those arrested in the events of 7th - 8th December .
We are sending our solidarity to everyone occupying universities , demonstrating and clashing with the state murderers all over the country .

In 1953 , when Sylvia A. Earle began studying algae , the marine plants and related microbes were often considered weeds or worse .
Boaters ridiculed them as scum that turned patches of sea into pea soup .
Today , Dr. Earle notes that just one type —
Prochlorococcus , so small that millions can fit in a drop of water — has achieved fame as perhaps the most abundant photosynthetic organism on the planet .
It daily releases countless tons of oxygen into the atmosphere .
The tiny organism is estimated to provide the oxygen in “ one in every five breaths we take , ” Dr. Earle said in an interview .
And it is just one of thousands of types of marine algae and photosynthetic microbes — everything from invisible cells to plantlike growths to kelp forests .
A student of the big and the small , Dr. Earle is a co-author of “ Ocean : An Illustrated Atlas , ” published recently by National Geographic .
Its maps and graphs , prose and pictures detail how discoveries like the surprising ubiquity of Prochlorococcus are illuminating the sea , its immense impact on the planet and its habitability .

Coca - Cola ending ‘ Classic ’ label
One of the most famous blunders in marketing history is quietly coming to an end .
The Coca - Cola Co. is dropping the “ Classic ” from its red labels , the company said Friday .
The Classic designation , which appears under the Coca - Cola script on labels , was added to the packaging in 1985 , to distinguish the original formula from a sweeter , wildly unpopular new version of Coke .
Ten weeks after introducing the new Coke , and after publicly vowing that the original formula was gone for good , company executives brought it back .
New Coke has since disappeared from shelves , making the Classic qualification unnecessary .
Scott Williamson , a company spokesman , said Coca - Cola decided to make the change as it launches a new global marketing campaign it is calling “ Open Happiness . ”

Freddie Mac aims to cut vacancies
The goal of the new policy , announced Friday , is to prevent properties from becoming vacant so they wo n’t fall into disrepair .
Freddie Mac also said it will allow renters to remain in their homes even if their landlord enters foreclosure .
Fannie Mae , which announced similar plans earlier this month , said it has stopped about 20,000 foreclosure sales and halted 6,300 evictions of owners or renters this winter .
Under Freddie Mac ’s new policy , tenants and former property owners need to demonstrate that they have enough income to pay the rental bill .
Freddie Mac also said it would consider reinstating a mortgage for those borrowers who can qualify for a modified loan .

Ron Paul : Gaza crisis is blowback for past US interventions David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) spoke on Friday in opposition to a non-binding House resolution ( pdf ) expressing " strong support for Israel " in its invasion of Gaza and decrying Hamas as a terrorist organization that has put " hundreds of thousands of Israelis in danger . "
" I rise in opposition to this resolution , not because I am taking sides and picking who the bad guys are and who the good guys are . "
Paul stated .
" I 'm looking at this more from the angle of being a United States citizen , an American , and I think resolutions like this really do us great harm . "
" The weapons being used to kill so many Palestinians are American weapons , and American funds , essentially , are being used for this , " continued Paul .
" There 's a political liability , which I think is something that we fail to look at , because too often there 's so much blowback from our intervention in areas that we should n't be involved in . "
Paul pointed out that if Hamas now has too much power , it is the fault of past actions by Israel and the United States .
" We first , indirectly and directly through Israel , help establish Hamas , " he noted , " then we have an election [ in Gaza ] , then Hamas becomes dominant -- so we have to kill them .
It just does n't make sense . "
" There 's a lot of reasons why we should oppose this resolution , " Paul concluded emphatically .
" It is not in the interests of the United States .
It 's not in the interests of Israel , either . "
Paul 's statement was consistent with his past positions .
Last March , he was the sole member of Congress to vote against a one - sided condemnation of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians .
Paul stated on that occasion , " I believe it is appalling that Palestinians are firing rockets that harm innocent Israelis , just as I believe it is appalling that Israel fires missiles into Palestinian areas where children and other non-combatants are killed and injured .
Unfortunately , legislation such as this is more likely to perpetuate violence in the Middle East than contribute to its abatement .
... I strongly believe that we must cease making proclamations involving conflicts that have nothing to do with the United States .
We incur the wrath of those who feel slighted while doing very little to slow or stop the violence . "

Partial transcript
PAUL : So we definitely have a moral responsibility and especially now , today , the weapons being used to kill so many Palestinians are American weapons and american funds is essentially being used for this .
But there 's a political liability which I think is something that we fail to look at because , too often , there 's so much blowback from our intervention in areas that we should n't be involved in .
You know , Hamas , if you look at the history you 'll find out that Hamas was encouraged and really started by Israel because they wanted Hamas to counteract Yasser Arafat .
You say , " Yeah , it was better then and it served its purpose but we did n't want Hamas to do this . "
So then , we as Americans say , " Well , we have such a good system we 're going to impose this on the world .
We 're going to invade Iraq and teach people how to be democrats .
We want free elections . "
We encourage the palestinians to have a free election .
They do and they elect Hamas .
So , we first indirectly and directly through Israel help established Hamas .
Then we have an election that Hamas becomes dominant so we have to kill them .
You know , it just does n't make sense .
During the 80's , you know , we were allied with Osama bin Laden and we were contending with the Soviets .
It was at that time our C.I.A. thought it was good if we radicalize the Muslim world .
So we financed the madrassa schools to radicalize the Muslims in order to compete with the -- with the Soviets .
There 's too much blowback .

A special surprise awaits you in the last one ...
la tijlan , 2012-09 - 10 [ 1 ] :
Yesterday somebody called my attention to the " Lojban Anthem " created by lojbab and nitcion [...]
It has interesting key modulations , and I was curious to give it a new arrangement .
With the nature of Lojban root word etymologies in mind , I went for the ' world ' genre : Lojban anthem Lojban Anthem ( with vocal guide )
:
History
Lojbab wrote [ 2 ] the original lyrics saying " If I can write Lojban poetry , anyone can " .
Nick Nicholas suggested some rewordings , so that the two stanzas could be actually singable to the same tune .
He also added a short chorus , because the tune went in different directions in his brain , and corrected some out of date place structures ( as pointed out by la tsali : lojban Anthem English translation . )
I was flown in on Wednesday evening and put up in a fairly nice hotel near the FANX ( .
The PBT
Thursday morning came , and I was a bit nervous .
Got there promptly at 7:00 .
It looked like for the people who drove , they were searching their cars with K - 9 units ... glad I did n't have to go through that .
They tell you to get there really early , but it 's not so bad - the waiting lobby at FANX has a large plasma TV with the news on , plus a lot of magazines ranging from " Diversity Today " , " Men 's Health " , and even " Country Living " .
I chose a National Geographic - no idea if they 're going to analyze this , but I figure there 's no harm in reading the most intellectual choice on the rack .
There 's about 13 of us there for the first time .
They take us into a computer lab and talk for a bit about what the psych test is about , then they let us have at the 250 + questionnaire .
I got questions like :
" I sometimes think people can read my mind "
" I sometimes see in black and white "
" Drugs help me cope with stress at work "
" I feel as though I may kill myself soon "
With available answers of " Never true " , " Sometimes true " , " Mainly true " , and " Always true " .
You should answer these as accurately as possible .
The system is measuring how many character flaws you " admit " to , and the first score on the printout is how accurate it believes you are .
I have no idea what this score is based on , so do n't over analyze it and just answer !
Keep in mind that the PBT is shared with the polygraphers !
The psych doctor who evaluated me after the test did mention this , but I wanted to make sure people realized that this test is NOT aggregated - they can tell what you answered on every single question !
You 'd better not go in claiming that you 've never had problems with alcohol , and then indicate on your test that you " sometimes " go overboard with alcohol .
After the test is done , you then have to fill in a questionnaire that kind of summarizes the security questionnaire - drug use , alcohol use , military service et al .
The last page is a " fill in the blank " response , with phrases starting off like :
" I feel that most men _______ "
" I wish my father__________ "
" I frequently feel __________ "
I believe there were about 16 of these .
After all the testing , you spend an hour with the psych doctor .
He basically talks about every single response on the questionnaire ( why even bother writing this stuff if they just ask you AGAIN ?! ) , and then will discuss anything they find " interesting " on the 250 + PBT .
The system will ' flag ' any unusual response .
I had two questions that I was asked about .
NOTE : They also asked about any downloading / copyright infringement .
I admitted to downloading music a few times in high school , and was asked if I sold it .
After indicating I had n't , that was the end of their interest on that topic .
This is also where they asked some sexual questions like if I 'm into bestiality , child porn , group orgies etc .
Not fun , but not nearly as bad as I was expecting .
These were not asked at all in the polygraph .
After all the questioning , the doctor showed me a chart of my results .
It said that I had a high " accuracy " rate ( meaning it felt I answered very truthfully ) , and then about 8 - 10 character ratings .
Actually , this test was incredibly accurate .
He described how I probably reacted in social / work / personal settings , and was spot - on all of them .
The Polygraph
Let me preface this by saying that , from what I read on here , some parts of the poly were called exactly right , and some seemed way off .
Your mileage may vary with this ... but it was one of the most stressful situations of my life .
My polygrapher was maybe two years older than me ( late 20's ) , and about three inches shorter .
He was very cordial with me - not too chummy , but not detached , either .
I signed a document that said the polygraph was voluntary , I still retained my constitutional rights , and was not being held against my will .
After this , he proceeded to explain that the polygraph measured my body 's " flight or fight " response to his questioning - I was pretty impressed with this guy 's representation of the device actually , because he never really painted the polygraph as something that detected lies .
He was always very careful to indicate that it measured responses , and that they were looking for sudden changes in my response .
He showed me all the instruments , and then went over the " days of the week " directed - lie test , instructing me to say no when he asked if today was Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday etc .
I was to say " no " for every single one of these .
I was attached to the polygraph , and did the test .
He showed the printout to me with the day I had ' lied ' about , and said that my bodily responses clearly indicated when I was uncomfortable with an answer , and that I clearly felt that telling the truth was important .
He unhooked me from the polygraph , and then talked about the security questions .
He said he would ask me a number of " easy response " questions like " Is your name X " , " Were you born in 1986 " , " Did you grow up in XXXXX " , " Is your father 's name X " , " Is this now the year 2010 " , and " Is this the month of December " .
He actually asked all these several times to make sure I would ' get it ' .
He then went into the " important questions " , which for my first phase was :
" Are you engaged in espionage against the US ? "
" Are you secretly involved with foreign nationals ? "
" Have you engaged in acts of terrorism against the US ? "
" Have you ever mis-handled US - classified information ? "
He proceeded to meticulously explain the meaning of every single one of these questions for the next half - hour , defining things like ' terrorism ' , ' sabotage ' , ' secret ' , ' classified ' , ' foreign nationals ' ... just about everything , in fact .
He then asked me to summarize what I felt the definitions were after this .
He asked me the questions about three times , just to make sure I was clear , and then asked them again with the " unimportant questions " thrown in .
I was beginning to feel like they thought I was an idiot !
After all the ' dry run ' questioning , I was hooked back up to the polygraph , and he moved my chair to face the wall .
He pumped up my pressure collar , warned me that the test was beginning and not to move , and then asked me the questions the first time .
After asking about 7 or 9 questions , he deflated the collar , told me I could move , and then wrote some things on my printout .
We repeated this two more times - with him asking me before the third time to define what all the questions meant AGAIN .
Sheeesh !
By this point , I was feeling great .
The test was going fast ( except all the stupid repetition ) , I was passing with flying colors , and my heart was n't beating so fast that I felt like I was going to pass out .
He then went over the second phase questions , which were :
" Have you ever committed a serious crime "
" In the last 7 years , have you used an illegal drug "
" Have you witheld / lied about anything on your security forms "
He was very careful to define serious crime as being " rape , murder , molestation , child exploitation , larceny , any tickets over $ 250 , or anything you could be fired for .
I 'm not looking for file sharing , downloading stuff off the internet , underage drinking , cheating in college , or things like that . "
He then defined the illegal drug question as " Use , distribution , inhalation - ANYTHING of substances like marijuana , crack , cocaine , LSD , PCP , methaphetamines , sniffing glue " and on and on .
At this point , I was really quite pleased .
I looked at my watch , and was going to get out a full two - and - a - quarter hours earlier than they had scheduled me to .
He started the test , asked the questions , and scored the computer printout , and then did it a second time .
This is when things got ugly .
He said " One of the questions is really bothering you , X , and I think you know which one it is . "
I blinked twice and was trying to think - actually , NONE of the questions bothered me , and I was feeling much better than I had when I came in !
I told him that I had no clue .
He showed me both tests he had just taken , pointed to two spikes on both of them , and said " You 're having trouble with the drug question .
Something is bothering you about it .
X , you need to tell me what 's on your mind . "
I told him nothing was , and that I was really shocked because I had been feeling so good .
He said " Well , something is obviously bothering you about your response to this question , and you need to tell me what it is , because at this point , you 've failed the polygraph .
We can't go any further .
If you want me to go to bat for you with my superiors {gesturing out the door} , we need to work through this .
You need to let me have it all .
I have to be able to explain this to the folks in the security office .
I 'm on your team here , and you 've got to help me help you . "
In case you had n't recognized this , this is almost verbatim from the
After all this , he told me " X , I appreciate your honesty .
I know what you 've done here was hard today .
Let 's keep going " .
He asked me the second set of questions two more times , and then - completely cordial again , of course - told me " Great !
We 're done with everything today .
We 've collected a good amount of data , which will make it easier during our analysis . "
He indicated that at this time , I should discontinue any illegal drug use from this point forward ( umm ... were you even HERE for the last two hours , buddy ? ) , and that if I obtained a clearance , the NSA reserved the right to deny me travel outside of the US and limit my association with foreign nationals .
He shook my hand , escorted me back to the waiting area , and that was that - like none of it had even happened .
My total time in there ?
Four hours and eight minutes .
Some things I noticed :
* The ' spike ' on the directed - lie days - of - the - week test and the spike on the supposed " drug question " looked COMPLETELY different .
Not even remotely similar .
Also , the " days of the week " test had the point at which he had asked the questions clearly labeled , whereas the second charts he showed when I was accused of doing drugs had no such markings .
In retrospect , this spike could 've been when he asked if I had really been born in the year 1986 for all I know .
* He was clicking things and typing on his computer keyboard - quite a bit , actually - during the test , even when I was answering ( not just between questions ) .
I have absolutely no way of knowing what he was doing there , and wondered if he had the ability to " enhance " certain results to make me nervous .
* Filesharing came up twice in two branches .
Both times , they eagerly asked me if I had sold the few songs I downloaded , and when I answered no , they became totally disinterested on the topic .
Anyway , after describing this to the HR rep and a few other NSA employees afterward , they told me it sounded like I had passed .
I have no idea what could 've led them to believe that , as I felt absolutely awful !
The title of this post was edited to make it clear from the outset that the narrative concerns the NSA .
In addition , a hyperlink regarding the NSA 's Friendship Annex building and a hyperlink to The Lie Behind the Lie Detector have been added .

I just got back from my poly yesterday , and wanted to write all this down while it was still fresh in my mind ... I was flown in on Wednesday evening and put up in a fairly nice hotel near the FANX ( Friendship Annex ) building at BWI .
No big secrets here - in fact , there 's a giant sign that says " FANX > " , and it 's the only building with fences and razor wire on the streetThursday morning came , and I was a bit nervous .
Got there promptly at 7:00 .
It looked like for the people who drove , they were searching their cars with K - 9 units ... glad I did n't have to go through that .

In case you had n't recognized this , this is almost verbatim from the " Lie Behind the Lie Detector " PDF on this site .
At this point , I wanted to puke .
Out of all the questions on the second phase , the drug one was the one I was LEAST concerned about .
I have n't so much as taken aspirin when I really did n't need it , let alone sniff glue or smoke pot .
I reaffirmed my answer , and he started to get irate with me .
This is when the true interrogation began .
For the next hour and a half , I was strapped to this chair and he was asking if I had maybe swallowed some accidentally , or maybe it was because I was blocking it out because I was ashamed , or maybe I had found religion , become saved , and felt like the drug use was in my " old " life .
He said " We know everyone has used drugs .
We KNOW that .
We just need to know that you can be honest and completely forthright with us about it . "
I poured my soul out .
I let him know about the small eraser I stole when I was nine from the Scholastic book fair , that I felt like the Old Testament was boring and I hated to read it , that I had downloaded a couple of songs in high school , and that I had resented my dad for years for making me move in the middle of 9th grade halfway across the country .
He kept pressing me for more , yelling a couple of times , and leaving twice .
I was pretty much on the verge of tears for 10 - 15 minutes or so , and I 'm not the crying type .
After all this , he told me " X , I appreciate your honesty .
I know what you 've done here was hard today .
Let 's keep going " .
He asked me the second set of questions two more times , and then - completely cordial again , of course - told me " Great !

In retrospect , this spike could 've been when he asked if I had really been born in the year 1986 for all I know . *
He was clicking things and typing on his computer keyboard - quite a bit , actually - during the test , even when I was answering ( not just between questions ) .
I have absolutely no way of knowing what he was doing there , and wondered if he had the ability to " enhance " certain results to make me nervous . *
Filesharing came up twice in two branches .
Both times , they eagerly asked me if I had sold the few songs I downloaded , and when I answered no , they became totally disinterested on the topic .
Anyway , after describing this to the HR rep and a few other NSA employees afterward , they told me it sounded like I had passed .
I have no idea what could 've led them to believe that , as I felt absolutely awful !
Revealed : US spends more than $ 52 billion a year on nukes John Byrne
Published : Monday January 12 , 2009
Print This Email This The United States spends more than $ 52 billion a year maintaining , upgrading and operating its nuclear weapons arsenal each year , a little - heralded study revealed Monday .
Outside of the hefty price tag , equally significant is the way the money is spent .
The US devoted just 1.3 percent -- or $ 700 million -- to preparing for the consequences of a nuclear attack .
The amount of money spent on America 's nuclear programs dwarfs the amount spent on diplomacy and foreign assistance ( combined ) , effectively leaving US diplomatic efforts abroad in the long shadow of America 's ballistic missiles .
" Nuclear security consumes $ 13 billion more than international diplomacy and foreign assistance ; nearly double what the United States allots for general science , space , and technology ; and 14 times what the Department of Energy ( DOE ) budgets for all energy - related research and development , " the Carnegie Institute for Peace noted in a study posted to the Federation for American Scientists ' Secrecy News blog Monday .
Nuclear weapons or related programs account for 67 percent of the Department of Energy 's Budget .
They also account for 8.5 percent of the FBI budget , 7.1 percent of the Pentagon budget and 1.7 percent of the budget for the Department of Homeland Security .
Most US spending on nuclear weapons programs is unclassified , Secrecy News editor Steven Afternood notes .
But the amount spent is masked by the number of budgets that contain provisions for such programs , making a composite total difficult to ascertain .
Speaking of the $ 52 billion figure , Carnegie author Stephen Schwartz was quoted as saying ,  That s a floor , not a ceiling ,  noting that it does n't take into account classified nuclear weapons programs or nuclear related intelligence programs .
Most of the money doled out to America 's nuclear weapons is spent on upgrading and maintaining the country 's aging arsenal .
According to estimates , the United States has a stockpile of about 9,600 nuclear missiles , including those kept in non active service .
 The disparity [ in spending ] suggests that preserving and enhancing nuclear forces is far more important than preventing nuclear proliferation ,  Schwartz said .
The Carnegie Institute offered a series of recommendations as a result of their study .
Among them :
* Require the executive branch to submit both an unclassified and a classified annual accounting of all nuclear weapons - related spending .
Without an accurate understanding of the costs of nuclear spending , Congress and the executive branch cannot conduct essential oversight or devise the most effective policy .
* Place greater emphasis on programs that secure and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons , weapons material , technology , and expertise .
* Develop better measures to explain and quantify nuclear weapons - related intelligence expenditures .
Greater transparency and insight could lead to a more effective allocation of intelligence assets .
* Release an accurate accounting of the number of veterans who have received or been denied compensation and care for radiation exposure during atmospheric nuclear tests between the 1946 and 1962 , along with the total cost of such compensation and care .

Charlie Brooker is to launch a spin - off from his BBC Four show Screenwipe , concentrating on TV news .
Charlie Brooker 's News Wipe , which will air on BBC Four in the spring , is billed as a ‘ funny , thoughtful and scabrous digest of recent news events ’ .
He said : ‘ This is new territory for me – I 'm no current affairs expert .
Just like , I suspect , many people , when I tune into the news I often feel like I 've wandered into episode 389 of the world 's most complex soap opera .
So it 's also about me trying to make sense of a bewildering and often bloody stupid world . ’
Brooker 's credits include Nathan Barley , which he co-wrote with Chris Morris , and the recent thriller Dead Set .
The six - part series , commissioned by former BBC4 controller Janice Hadlow and BBC controller of comedy Lucy Lumsden , will be made by production company Zeppotron , a subsidiary of Big Brother producer Endemol .
Last month , Chortle reported how Brooker will soon be hosting a new Channel 4 comedy show about the workings of TV , You Have Been Watching , in which he will be joined by guests in front of a live studio audience .

RIO NEGRO , Costa Rica ( Reuters ) - Some U.S. gourmet coffee roasters have come up with a new solution to the problem of guaranteeing consistent quality in beans they sell to top - end restaurants and coffee bars : buy the farm .
Coffee connoisseurs pay attention to where and how coffee is grown , just as lovers of fine wines look to certain grape - growing regions .
Brooke McDonnell , owner of the Equator Coffee company which imports , sells and roasts gourmet coffee , began to worry a few years ago about the supply of the rare “ geisha ” trees found in Panama ’s highlands near the border with Costa Rica .
The geisha ’s sweet jasmine flavors are prized internationally but only a few farmers grow the variety , which can fetch more than $ 100 a pound at online auctions .
Instead of scrambling with competitors to scoop up enough beans to keep her customers happy , McDonnell decided to grow them herself .
Now she travels regularly from California to Panama to check on the harvest at a farm she bought a little over a year ago .
“ It ’s a hands - on business , ” McDonnell told Reuters .
“ We view this as a combination labor of love and business venture . ”
Traditionally , coffee farmers and drinkers have been separated by a complex nexus of intermediaries , with coffee passing from growers , to local buyers , to exporters , to roasters , to cafe owners .
More coffee exporters have begun selling crops directly from certain farms to particular roasters , locking in prices with long - term contracts to avoid the volatile coffee market .
Only a few adventurous roasters have gone the more extreme route of becoming farmers themselves .
NOT WITHOUT RISKS
Texas - based Distant Lands , which owns a coffee farm in Rio Negro , Costa Rica and several others in Latin America , views the investment to grow and mill its own beans as essential to maintaining a reputation .
Distant Lands looks for a specific flavor known in the industry as a “ cup profile ” for its coffee .
By controlling the production of beans it cuts out the hassles of dealing with multiple suppliers .
The company uprooted parts of its 281 hectares of farms in Costa Rica to make sure only one variety of trees , known as “ caturra , ” are planted and harvested .
“ At this time we are looking for the cup profile that caturra provides us in this zone , ” the company ’s agronomy manager Jorge Jimenez said , looking at rolling hills covered with coffee trees .
But the risks and work of running a farm is not for everyone , especially now as some in the specialty coffee business worry that a slowing U.S. economy will hurt consumption of expensive espresso .
Jesus Mountain Coffee , headquartered in Stockton , California , started working in Nicaragua over a decade ago but has expanded with farms , roasters , and coffee shops in Hawaii .
“ It is a tough business to make a profit , ” company founder Mike Atherton said .
NOTED BY CAFR1 : Knowing the extent of the organized suppression taking place on the Internet , the release date was a tactical move by CAFR1 .
The release date I scheduled was right before the long 4 - day Christmas holiday weekend where I knew most Google staff and Government official would be on vacation and thus Google 's stats would be on automatic mode and not subject to human intervention due to most being on vacation .
The tactical release worked , and the Biggest Game in Town video jumped right through to # 1 in all categories by day - two after release .
When Google and government executives came back after the long holiday , SNIP on the stats and standing as # 1 in all video view categories by human intervention !
I additionally note that on day - 4 after release I did a general Google search for the word " Government " which yielded a gazillion hits ( several hundred million ) .
Guess what hit was # 1 on day - four after release ?
The Biggest Game in Town video .
When the boys came back from vacation and saw this , that was their Oh , s**t moment . :)
After human intervention upon returning from their long holiday vacation , snip , Nada , gone .. [ Light of Day ]
UPDATE :
The video " The Biggest Game in Town " was uploaded on 12/22/08 to Google video , CAFR1 then did a NATIONAL POST on 12/23/08 of the release , and when I looked at the stats on the Google 's stat view pages each day after release , on 12/31/08 it was apparent to me that Google by human intervention was fudging the number of views and other statistics after and as they were being logged on to their automated view tracking system .
The video stats several days after original release were blocked by what appeared to be human intervention .
Well , Google just slipped and " I GOT EM "
This morning , January 2nd 2009 this article went out to the CAFR1 National email list .
On 12/31/08 before human intervention could catch it , the automated system showed the " true view stats " 540,000 views just in the USA and as can be seen in the charts and numbers , on the last image , the effect of " stripping the stats from their system " .
Before the true stats could be taken down from view on my Google account stat pages , I took screen snap shots of the stat pages as evidence ..
The " Biggest Game in Town " since release on 12/23/08 over the next several days was in the top viewed on Google Video " World Wide " in the English speaking countries .
Also # 1 for Top downloaded ; most liked , etc .
Several of the snap shots are below " locked in as evidence " and make sure to read my note at the end of the Snap Shots copied below .
The psychology behind the controllers fudging the stats is to make the " individual " who comprehends the information think they are the minority when in fact they may be the majority .
If the controllers can make the majority think " they are the only ones who know and have learned something " as if they were in a small minority .
Psychologically they make you timid and shaky to discuss what you know with others and the blackout from the Networks validates you thinking you are in a very small minority when actually you are in the majority .
Very effective manipulation by them folks and let me tell you :
The world is not flat and Government took it all over by investment years ago and are consolidating for absolute control internationally at this time !
Pay attention here folks , your futures and ownership of this country are at stake .
Walter Burien - http://CAFR1.com
The following are for downloads of the video in the USA and Canada : 540,000 VIEWS JUST IN THE USA !!!
90,000 Views in California !
See Snap Shot Below - Dark Green on the color coded map = 90,000 Views !
GOT EM !!!!!
The above shows what actually happened with the stat views when Google 's stat monitoring was not fudged and the effect of human intervention to block the stats from showing .
The following snap shot below is what stats Google showed after what appears to be fudging the numbers .
Here in the snap shots above and then below is a clear showing of intent to keep the video " The Biggest Game in Town " from showing as the # 1 video viewed on Google video out of millions of other videos there to be viewed .
By Google fudging their automated stats and blocking the video from appearing at the top of their search engine it kept the video from appearing on their " Front Page " of " Movers and Shakers " or " Most Popular " or " Most Downloaded " where if automatically allowed to happen , the views from those seeing it in the " Headliners " out of curiosity to view what they were not aware of would have jumped the view stats to 5 million views breaking Google 's all time records for a video in views of this length ( 2 hours - 16 Minutes ) over a few days time period !!!
The Cat is out of the bag for Google and Google 's # 1 stock holder ( Controller ) ; the Government wealth base of investment funds coming from the thousands of local and federal accounts !!!
Thanks Google for the slip today from your accurate automated system in giving the true stat proof for the " Biggest News Story " of the century !
The People are seeing and learning the " Biggest Game in Town ! "
The Remedy you ask ?
http://TaxRetirement.com
ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN you guys have an iron grip and do n't slip up to often , you better brief Google on controlling their slip ups !
And PS : What a Good job you guys did on blacking out Ron Paul before the election to create your own staged outcome of : " The only two candidates to vote on "
( or that are seen that is )

RESIDENTS HAVE WIDE - RANGING VIEWS RESIDENTS HAVE WIDE - RANGING VIEWS
There 's both boom and concern among businesses and workers on Wilmington 's Market Street .
A look at what 's going on :
DuPont 's international headquarters at 1007 N. Market St. , the state 's largest private industrial employer , reported that its third - quarter earnings declined 30 % , in part because of the depressed auto and housing markets .
Employees at Wachovia Bank , located in a 900 block building , wonder what the future holds after the bank merges with Wells Fargo .
Developers of a luxury apartment building in the 900 block of North Market Street have been the most active in Wilmington since 1999 .
Now , they 're coping with a huge inventory of residences for sale and lease citywide .
Business is booming for bankruptcy lawyers who practice in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in the 800 block .
The court , the preferred home for corporate reorganizations , has handled the most Chapter 11 filings in 2008 since the 2001 recession .
Students at the Delaware College of Art and Design in the 600 block are wondering what job prospects will be like in a recession .
Restaurants in the 800 block report business is off .
Some have had to rethink their strategies .
HOW'S MAIN STREET DOING ?
HOW'S MAIN STREET DOING ?
Perry , Iowa :
Shaky economy shakes up retailers Indianapolis : City builds in anticipation of recession 's end Wilmington , Del. : Business of bankruptcy bustles on Market Street Phoenix : Pain on Main Street : Timing proves bad for Phoenix Sioux Falls : South Dakota city 's downtown area builds on its rich past ABOUT OUR SERIES ABOUT OUR SERIES
As a national recession deepens and the federal government bails out Wall Street , Americans are increasingly concerned about the economic health of Main Street .
That phrase evokes images of family - owned businesses in small towns .
Yet , every city has a Main Street -- a major boulevard of commerce in its downtown business district .
To find out how these communities are doing , USA TODAY visited five Main Streets in different - size cities around the country .
In their long topcoats and dark suits , the men and women bustling down this city 's main street might be mistaken for funeral directors .
But they 're actually lawyers handling the burial of businesses : bankruptcies .
Here in the center of Corporate America , where more than 60 % of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated , the billable clock is ticking .
" It 's the bankruptcy capital of the world , " says Lynn LoPucki , a law professor at Harvard and UCLA .
Amid one of the worst downturns since the Great Depression , scores of companies have come to the federal bankruptcy court on North Market Street to die or restructure themselves .
More than half of all large public company bankruptcies filed this year have been filed here , including those of media giant Tribune , Washington Mutual , Linens 'n Things , Sharper Image and Mervyns , a California - based department store chain .
As of Dec. 11 , Chapter 11 filings were more than four times greater than in 2007 .
" Last year at this time , we'd have time to breathe in between cases .
Now , it 's a constant thing , " says Clerk of the Court David Bird .
A small part of this activity is spilling over into the small - business community along Market Street , including restaurants , caterers and office supply outlets .
But the city 's bankruptcy boomlet is n't translating into a boom for them .
" If you talk to someone who says business is booming , they 're lying , unless they 're a bankruptcy lawyer , " says Leonard Simon , who owns Wright & Simon , a men 's clothing store near the bankruptcy court .
" I 'm a tiny little business owner , and believe me , it 's challenging right now . "
Boom times for some
The biggest beneficiaries of the bankruptcy boom are Wilmington 's approximately 300 bankruptcy lawyers and their firms .
Some firms are expanding their practices , assigning new associates to bankruptcy or moving lawyers from other areas , such as real estate .
" We have people working sometimes round the clock , " says Mark Collins , chairman of the bankruptcy group at Richards Layton & Finger , which was named the most active debtors ' counsel for the first half of 2008 by Bankruptcy Insider , a trade publication .
The firm is lead counsel for Linens 'n Things and co-counsel to Washington Mutual .
About 20 % of its new associates in 2008 were assigned to bankruptcy .
Law professor LoPucki says the industry generates professional fees of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually nationwide .
Half those fees will be awarded in the bankruptcy court in Wilmington .
( Some fees will go to out - of - state firms arguing in the bankruptcy court here . )
For Laura Davis Jones , the national drumbeat of bad economic news is frightening — until she shows up for work .
Jones is one of the managing partners of Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones , a national bankruptcy firm that has an office here .
" It 's uncharted waters , " Jones says .
Clients pay for more than just their lawyers ' time .
During a big hearing , Jones ' firm might spend $ 200 or more to provide lunch for 20 to 25 lawyers .
" Plus , we have to have beverages and snacks all day , " she says .
In the Linens 'n Things bankruptcy , Collins says he was putting in more than 100 hours a month .
The firm has eight lawyers working on the case .
" You 're dismantling the entire company .
It 's more time - consuming , " he says .
Jones says it 's not unusual for her office to have three to five attorneys working full time for a few months when a company first files for bankruptcy , then again when the case is ending .
The results on the bottom line are noticeable : 2008 revenue for the Delaware office of Pachulski Stang is above last year and 2006 , Jones says .
" The ironic part is , it does take money to file bankruptcy .
" The more sophisticated the company , the more money it takes . "
No boom for others Retailers and small businesses on Market Street say they do n't see much trickle - down effect .
" Downtown is an office park now , " says Jack Buckley , co-owner of Ninth Street Book Shop , just off Market Street .
" They drive in , and they drive out . "
Office workers swell the downtown population by about 40,000 during the workweek , says John Rago , communications director for Mayor James Baker .
Even those retailers who directly serve law firms say it's not clear whether the bankruptcy business will be enough to offset the overall downturn in the local economy .
Like the rest of the nation , Delaware 's economy is officially in a recession , says John Stapleford , senior economist at Moody's Economy.com .
The number of jobless is at levels not seen since the recession of the early 1980s , according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data .
While unemployment in Delaware historically has tracked below the nation overall , the jobless rate in the city of Wilmington during October was 6.7 % , compared with the nation 's rate of 6.5 % , according to data from the Delaware Department of Labor .
What 's more , the financial services sector , which has propped up the state 's economy for more than two decades , has been shedding jobs since 2002 .
Two of the state 's top private employers — Bank of America and DuPont — recently announced job cuts .
Tim Pawliczek , owner of Cavanaugh 's Restaurant in the 700 block of North Market Street , says he 'll be happy if the legal business keeps him even or slightly ahead .
" It 's not , ' Ha , ha , we 're doing great . '
Because that 's definitely not the case , " says Gail Ashe , general manager at Movable Feast , a Wilmington - area caterer that provides lunches and dinners to the city 's law firms .
" The law firms are pretty strong .
Let 's hope that additional business keeps us stable . "

It just would n’t be right if Microsoft did n’t have its own barcode technology too , which is why today Microsoft Tag ( Beta ) was announced at CES 2009 .
Much like other 2D barcode technologies including the popular but underwhelming QR Code , Microsoft Tag allows data to be stored in a graphical bitmap using shapes and colors .
But with a twist .
If you were to assume Microsoft Tag is just a clone of QR Code , you ’d be wrong .
In fact you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking about it .
Microsoft Tag is based on a whole new technology called High Capacity Color Barcodes ( HCCBs ) , which was invented in - house by Microsoft Research .
The difference is not using square pixels , but triangle shapes and colors to store data .
The following diagrams show off its advantages .
Unlike other tag technologies too , the Microsoft Tags do n’t actually store the information .
You see , all it stores is a unique ID which it then sends to Microsoft ’s servers .
This way , you can include much more information , and more variety of information , then if it was just on the tag itself .
A nice side - effect of this is also the ability for publishers to gather reporting data on how many times it was seen .
To read these tags , Microsoft is making available today a downloadable application to a handful of mobile platforms including Windows Mobile , J2ME , iPhone , Blackberry , and Symbian S60 phones .
A camera and internet connection is obviously required .
To get the application , point your phone ’s browser to http://gettag.mobi.
I ’ve only played with Microsoft Tag for a few minutes on my Windows Mobile phone , but its a noticeably better experience than I ’ve had with other 2D barcodes in the past .
For example you can read it from a very far distance , from a very side angle and even if it ’s partially blocked .
In addition , it would n’t just be a Microsoft platform without developer tools .
That is why starting today the “ tag maker ” service is also available so anyone can create these tags .
For the moment this is a free service , but out of beta , one could potentially see this is where Microsoft plans to make a buck .
I created a few tags of my own so you can try it out .
Update : Microsoft
Tags work in monochrome too , unofficially .

Excerpts from Reviews
" This beautiful book presents , at a level suitable for advanced undergraduates , a fairly complete introduction to the problem of counting lattice points inside a convex polyhedron . [...]
Most importantly the book gives a complete presentation of the use of generating functions of various kinds to enumerate lattice points , as well as an introduction to the theory of Ehrhart quasipolynomials . "
Mathematical Reviews
" The authors give a coherent and tightly developed picture that encompasses the Frobenius coin- exchange problem , Bernoulli polynomials , Ehrhart polynomials for lattice point enumeration , Dehn - Sommerville relations on numbers of faces of polytopes , magic squares , the Birkhoff - von Neumann polytope , finite Fourier series , Dedekind sums , Brion 's Theorem on decomposition of polytopes , Euler - Maclaurin summation , volume via solid angles , and Green 's Theorem in the plane .
The book is written as an accessible and engaging textbook , with many examples , historical notes , pithy quotes , commentary integrating the material , exercises , open problems and an extensive bibliography . "
Zentralblatt MATH
" You owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of Computing the Continuous Discretely to read about a number of interesting problems in geometry , number theory , and combinatorics , all of which are interconnected and all of which can be built up pretty quickly from very elementary techniques .
Even people who are familiar with the material would almost certainly learn something from the clear and engaging exposition that these two authors use . "
MAA online book review column " Read This ! "
" The main topic of the book is initiated by a theorem of Ehrhart [...]
This is a wonderful book for various readerships .
Students , researchers , lecturers in enumeration , geometry and number theory all find it very pleasing and useful .
The presentation is accessible for mature undergraduates . [...] it is a clear introduction to graduate students and researchers with many exercises and with a list of open problems at the end of each chapter . "
Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum
" Many [ mathematics ] departments recognize the need for capstone courses in which graduating students can see the tools they have aquired come together in some satisfying way .
Beck and Robins have written the perfect text for such a course . [...]
The book develops a consistant theme -- the relation between the ( continuous ) volume of a polytope and its discrete volume , namely , the number of integer points that lie inside it .
With these familiar tools , the authors lead students to a host of results that will seem simultaneously concrete and magical and almost certainly unfamiliar .
Summing Up : Highly recommended . "

Heavy security surrounds the US embassy in Grosvenor Square
It is an iconic focus of protest in Britain - a four - storey modernist concrete fortress , topped with an oversized golden eagle .
For over 40 years those taking issue with American policy abroad have been journeying into the heart of London 's exclusive Mayfair - to shout , pray and occasionally try to break into the US embassy in Grosvenor Square .
The building is at the British heart of the US / UK " special relationship " .
It is famous for its glamorous four - yearly election night parties and as a compulsory destination for anyone who wants to visit or work in the United States .
Now all is set to change , as the embassy prepares to shut up shop in central London and move to a brand - new building - in somewhat less salubrious surroundings on the south bank of the river Thames .
The reason - the perceived increased danger of terror attacks post 9/11 , and concerns that the existing location is just too hard to protect .
And London is not alone - several other US embassies worldwide are currently being upgraded or rebuilt on different sites .
The embassy 's decision to move has been welcomed by Mayfair 's residents , who are frightened of becoming collateral damage in a bomb attack .
They also say the intense security within the square : armed police , huge metal bollards and closed roads have disrupted their daily lives and lowered the value of their multi-million pound homes .
Times have changed , and moving the embassy is a brave and necessary change
Lord Rogers
Glancing round the prosperous - looking leafy square , quiet in the winter sunshine , it is hard to imagine it as a target of the counter - culture movement in the late 1960s .
Orderly queues of visa seekers snake through the gates , while police in body armour and carrying automatic weapons patrol the pavement .
They are quick to interrogate anyone who lingers too long with a camera or notebook .
But former CND member Mick Brown remembers a very different scene - violent protests outside the embassy in March 1968 when thousands of anti-Vietnam war demonstrators clashed with police .
He recalled : " When people got into the square itself they started pulling bits of the fence off and throwing it towards the embassy .
" The police told people that if we had got into the embassy the Americans would have shot us . "
Describing the clashes that followed as " a general melee " Mick remembered being hit on the head by a policeman as he bent to rescue a young girl trapped beneath a fallen horse .
He was arrested soon afterwards and charged with assault - something he said " finished his demonstrating career off " .
Four decades later , visiting Americans Marjorie and Charles Bosk , from Philadelphia are outside the embassy to admire its architecture - the work of Finnish American modernist Eero Saarinen .
The building is said to clash with its neo-Georgian neighbours Both were critical of the impending move .
" I like my protests in a pretty place , " said Charles , sardonically .
But Marjorie said the fact that security concerns have driven her fellow citizens from central London makes her feel " deeply sad " .
She added : " We have been displaced from the heart of the city . "
There are no regrets from Anthony Lorenz , chairman of the 800 - strong St James and Mayfair Residents Association .
Describing fears of bomb attacks and a square " littered with barriers " following the attack on New York 's Twin Towers in 2001 , he looked forward to the eventual clearance of the square and possible demolition of the building itself , which he described as an " eyesore " in its neo-Georgian surrounds .
Embassy officials acknowledge the embassy 's unpopularity with its neighbours was a factor in their decision to move .
In 2003 there was talk of legal action against the US government to seek redress for the falling property prices .
Violent protests outside the embassy in March 1968 resulted in 200 arrests
And last year Grosvenor Square residents took out two - page advertisements in American and British papers accusing the authorities of " moral failure " by exposing them to terror attacks .
At a press conference on Friday US Ambassador Robert Tuttle revealed that plans to shut down and relocate the embassy had been in train since before his appointment to London in 2005 .
He described the new embassy 's eventual location - a brown - field site in the London borough of Wandsworth currently surrounded by vehicle dealerships and warehouses - as " fabulous " .
" We will still be close to the places we need to be - No 10 Downing Street , parliament and Whitehall , " he said .
The ambassador made no mention of a dispute with transport authorities over the embassy 's long - standing refusal to pay London 's congestion charge for its staff .
Officials later confirmed embassy policy would remain unchanged after the move .
" We will continue not to pay the charge because we regard it as a local tax , from which diplomats are exempt , " said one .
Ambassador
Tuttle was speaking at the launch of an international jury which will select the design of the new embassy .
The architectural firm that wins the contest will be an American firm " with the required security clearance " , although design teams may include UK partners " with local expertise and international experience . "
It is hoped the new , larger , site will be easier to protect , away from potentially litigious neighbours and allow for a building with an iconic status equal to , or exceeding that of , Grosvenor Square .
Muslims pray outside the embassy against the " desecration of the Koran " Jury member and award - winning British architect Richard Rogers was pragmatic about the move .
" Times have changed , and moving the embassy is a brave and necessary change , " he said .
He said the relocation would help to regenerate the area around the new embassy - much as new developments have helped to boost the local economy further down the Thames .
Embassy employees themselves are said to be happy with the plans .
About 1,000 of them - two thirds of them UK citizens - work in a building designed for 750 people .
Most " are not fans " of the current building 's architecture , said an embassy insider .
But some long - term opponents of American foreign policy see the relocation as bad news for future protests .
Author and activist Tariq Ali , a veteran of the original Grosvenor demonstrations in 1968 , recently wrote : " Until now , we could all meet happily in central London .
" A long march to south London is far less enticing . "
Other protesters are more optimistic .
Lindsey German of the Stop the War coalition said : " It says something about US policy worldwide that they are moving their embassies .
" But I can assure the US ambassador that we will continue to protest as long as US foreign policy remains unchanged .
In fact , I think it 's a location that far more ordinary people will able to attend . "

Why is no one willing to call things by their proper names , and instead resort to euphemism and double - speak ?
A New York Times story today , “ On Wall Street , Bonuses , Not Profits , Were Real , ” makes its most important point in its headline , and managed to get some good data points on how rich investment bank compensation was in the peak years , but otherwise glosses over the fundamental nature of what went on .
It was looting , and it is high time the media starts describing it in those terms .
Let us turn the mike over to Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof and Paul Romer .
From the abstract of their 1993 Brookings paper :
Our theoretical analysis shows that an economic underground can come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society ’s expense ( to loot ) instead of to go for broke ( to gamble on success ) .
Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting , lax regulation , or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations .
Bankruptcy for profit occurs most commonly when a government guarantees a firm ’s debt obligations .
The most obvious such guarantee is deposit insurance , but governments also implicitly or explicitly guarantee the policies of insurance companies , the pension obligations of private firms , virtually all the obligations of large or influential firms .
These arrangements can create a web of companies that operate under soft budget constraints .
To enforce discipline and to limit opportunism by shareholders , governments make continued access to the guarantees contingent on meeting specific targets for an accounting measure of net worth .
However , because net worth is typically a small fraction of total assets for the insured institutions ( this , after all , is why they demand and receive the government guarantees ) , bankruptcy for profit can easily become a more attractive strategy for the owners than maximizing true economic values …
Unfortunately , firms covered by government guarantees are not the only ones that face severely distorted incentives .
Looting can spread symbiotically to other markets , bringing to life a whole economic underworld with perverse incentives .
The looters in the sector covered by the government guarantees will make trades with unaffiliated firms outside this sector , causing them to produce in a way that helps maximize the looters ’ current extractions with no regard for future losses … . ”
Re-read the key phrase : “ pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations . ”
This has happened en masse in what formerly were investment banks who have now become wards of the state .
But no one is willing to call this activity for what it was .
In fact , some are still urging that we not squelch “ financial innovation , ” which Martin Mayer described as
… a way to find new technology to do what has been forbidden with the old technology … .
Innovation allows you to go back to some scam that was prohibited under the old regime .
But we digress .
Dick Fuld reportedly spends much of his days allegedly wondering why he did n’t get a bailout .
He should instead be thanking his lucky stars he is not in jail .
Bankruptcy fraud is criminal , and fraudulent conveyance is subject to clawbacks .
How could Lehman possibly have been producing financials that showed it had a positive net worth , yet have an over $ 100 billion hole in its balance sheet when it went under ?
No one has yet given an adequate answer on where the shortfalls were .
Commonwealth countries have a much simpler solution .
If a company is “ trading insolvent , ” that is , continuing to do business when it is in fact broke , its directors are personally liable .
We have said repeatedly that one of the triggers for the crisis was permitting investment banks to go public ( prior to 1970 , no NYSE member firm could be listed ) .
We had dinner with one of our long - standing colleagues who was responsible for Sumitomo Bank ’s investment in Goldman Sachs and had ( and continues to have ) close and frequent dealings with the firm .
He said that the change in the firm ’s behavior after it went public was dramatic .
Before , it would deliberate ( one might say agonize ) important business decisions , .
Waiting two years to enter a new field was not unheard of .
But after the partners cashed in and were playing with other people ’s money , the firm quickly became aggressive in its use of capital in expanding the size and scope of its activities .
But the New York Times article gives an anodyne portrayal :
As regulators and shareholders sift through the rubble of the financial crisis , questions are being asked about what role lavish bonuses played in the debacle .
Scrutiny over pay is intensifying as banks like Merrill prepare to dole out bonuses even after they have had to be propped up with billions of dollars of taxpayers ’ money .
While bonuses are expected to be half of what they were a year ago , some bankers could still collect millions of dollars .
Critics say bonuses never should have been so big in the first place , because they were based on ephemeral earnings .
These people contend that Wall Street ’s pay structure , in which bonuses are based on short - term profits , encouraged employees to act like gamblers at a casino — and let them collect their winnings while the roulette wheel was still spinning …
For Wall Street , much of this decade represented a new Gilded Age .
Salaries were merely play money — a pittance compared to bonuses …
While top executives received the biggest bonuses , what is striking is how many employees throughout the ranks took home large paychecks .
On Wall Street , the first goal was to make “ a buck ” — a million dollars .
More than 100 people in Merrill ’s bond unit alone broke the million - dollar mark in 2006 .
Goldman Sachs paid more than $ 20 million apiece to more than 50 people that year , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Goldman declined to comment .
The bulk of the piece is about Dow Kim , former co-president of Merrill ’s fixed income business , and does deliver some detail about how Kim and his subordinates were paid .
But it fails to delve into how the profits were illusory , the bad decisions made , how the fixed income area in particular lead to the end of Merrill ’s independence .
Perhaps the author , Louise Story , assumed the tale has been well told elsewhere .
However one effort to demonstrate the business was on the wrong track , falls woefully short .
It discusses a CDO deal that went bad , but fails to establish whether Merrill took losses by virtue of retaining a big interest ( “ The losses on the investment far exceed the money Merrill collected for putting the deal together ” does not clearly say that Merrill , as opposed to investors , suffered .
One assumes so , but the drafting is ambiguous ) .
Even more glaring , the story mentions Merrill ’s disastrous , end of cycle $ 1.13 billion acquisition of mortgage originator First Franklin , without mentioning that deal came a cropper ( Merrill shut the unit down only a year and a couple of months after it completed the transaction ) .
Other stories have given some of the sordid details about Merrill ’s ill fated mortgage expansion ( a Wall Street Journal piece , “ Merrill Upped Ante as Boom In Mortgage Bonds Fizzled , ” is one of many examples ) , Giving short shrift to the staggering level of strategic errors and lax risk oversight means the article fails to pin responsibility clearly for the mess on Kim and his fellow business heads .
The article simply assumes the connection , but by talking about the profits without giving sufficient detail on the colossal errors , it makes Kim and his lot seem far more innocent than they really were .

Mac Mini Media Centre
01 Apr 2008
( This post is a work in progress , that I will continue to update and tweak .
The comments are great , with a whole variety of suggestions and details of other setups .
I ’ll try and keep the comments open as long as I can )
Apple TV or Mac Mini ?
No getting away from it - I still yearned for a Mac based media centre .
I ’d hoped Wii Transfer would fit the bill , but the quality of the video streaming is n’t good enough ( yet ? ) .
That meant either a Mac Mini or an Apple TV , but that ’s a hard decision .
Apple TV has the ease of use that makes it ideal for the home .
No fiddling about , but no PVR functionality either .
In the end , I went for the Mac Mini ’s potential over the Apple TV ‘ just works ’ , and using FrontRow and EyeTV to provide the interface .
But , I ’d dabbled with a Mac Mini media Centre a couple of years ago , with a G4 Mini hacked to use FrontRow .
I gave up on it a few months after , but recently decided that the time was now right .
So what ’s different this time around ?
Front Row built into Leopard - rather than tied to particular machines and requiring a hack to make it work .
Front Row 2 also adopts the plugin ‘ appliance ’ architecture of Apple TV , as well as supporting sharing from other macs .
As far as I can see it only lacks the YouTube feature of the Apple TV .
Screen sharing - After using other VNC clients , the inbuilt screen sharing facility is easy and responsive .
I can barely notice a difference in performance between administering the Mac Mini and working on my MacBook Pro .
Intel Mac Minis - Compared the original G4 Mac Mini
I was trying to use , the new Intel Mac Minis are faster , have larger hard drives and Bluetooth and airport as standard ( which the G4 did n’t have ) .
They also come with a built in remote and receiver .
I previously used a bluetooth phone and Salling Clicker , which works , but it is n’t the kind of ‘ slick solution ’ you can hand to someone else and expect them to want to use it .
The Apple remote works very well , and is n’t too simple ( it is easier to lose though , and you ca n’t ring it to find out where it is . )
Leopard brings everything you need to run a media centre , with the exception of a PVR , and an automagic system for adding new content to the Mini .
Finally , I was trying to run the last system through our old CRT telly , that only had 2 scart inputs .
It looks like ass .
Now that we have an LCD , it does n’t .
So after studying the Apple Refurb Store for a few weeks , I picked up a good deal :
So , onto the setup …
Preferences
One of the first things you ’ll want to do is minimise the possibility of the OS giving you messages , so go to System Preferences >
Bluetooth , and make sure this option is n’t ticked :
Otherwise you ’ll get interfering messages , worrying about the lack of a keyboard attached .
Likewise , go to System Preferences >
Software Update and make sure it is n’t checking for updates .
Hardware
This is how my hardware is setup : A Mac Mini sends video to the TV with a DVI to HDMI cable , while the sound is sent through my stereo with a headphone to dual composite cable .
If I was n’t playing music , I would just send the audio to the TV .
I ’m using a Western Digital MyBook external drive to store everything on , but I ’d like to replace this with something larger , quieter and ( if possible ) no blinking lights !
The only other piece of hardware is the EyeTV Hybrid dongle .
Essential Apps and plugins
You probably have a different list of essentials , but having tried a lot of potential apps , these are the ones I ’ve settled into using :
A plugin that allows playback of .avi , .flv ( amongst many others ) in Front Row .
Installs as a System Preference .
I use this to automate the adding of new content from my MacBook .
You set the Mac mini to subscribe to however many Macs you want , and as long as its open on both , it will suck in any new tracks , movies etc .
Works really well , I just wish it had some way of letting you know on the MacBook end that all new tracks have been imported .
For Movies though , I ’m finding it easier to share the Movies folder on the Mini and just drop the files in there , rather than try and get them into iTunes .
For ripping your DVDs , everyone should know about this !
Along with an Elgato Hybrid stick , this provides the PVR functionality , along with more recording features than my DVD Recorder does .
Being able to set up smart recording schedules is genius , and I tend set every recording to automatically export as Apple TV , which adds it to iTunes for me .
A ‘ Front Row Appliance ’ , which adds an EyeTV menu item to Front Row .
This has now reached version 1 , is easier to install , and the transitions between EyeTV and FrontRow are smoother .
Also , I have n’t tried it yet , but Sapphire looks interesting .
Moving the iTunes Library
I soon ran out of space on the Mac Mini , and while I was loathe to add yet another bloody plug to the overloaded adaptors behind the telly , it had to be done .
( An external hard drive does n’t tend to be as quiet as the Mac Mini either ! ) .
Relocating the Movies folder to the external hard drive was as easy as using an alias , but the iTunes library is a bit more troublesome .
It should be as easy as choosing the new location in iTunes Preferences >
Advanced , but I could n’t manage to do this and retain paths .
Everytime I wanted to play something , I had to select the new path to the file .
Instead , I created a folder on the hard drive , and rather than copy across everything manually , I chose this new folder as the library location in the advanced preferences , and used ‘ consolidate library ’ .
This not only copied everything across , but this time updated the paths to the media files , and everything plays as it should !
Switching between FrontRow and EyeTV
Everything works well in this setup , with the exception of navigating between the 2 applications - Frontrow and EyeTV .
There are a few ways around this :
Before launching FrontRow , I make sure that EyeTV is open , and on fullscreen mode ( see below ) .
Then I can go back to EyeTV by pressing the menu button on the FrontRow main screen .
Pressing and holding the menu button in EyeTV shows it ’s onscreen menu ( in which you can do almost all the work that you ’ll need to do ) .
Pressing menu once will return you to FrontRow .
Sometimes it can be annoying if you do n’t remember to press and hold in EyeTV , and you get whisked away to FrontRow .
The Pye TV plugin for FrontRow adds an EyeTV menu , from which you can launch FrontRow , its recordings , or the programme guide .
Setting recordings to automatically export to Apple TV means that they will appear in FrontRow ’s ‘ TV Shows ’ menu a few hours afterwards ( depending on the length of recording , processor speed etc ) .
Finally , you ’ll want to make sure that Syncopation , EyeTV and FrontRow are all set to open at startup .
If EyeTV is set to ‘ Start EyeTV in full screen ’ ( Preferences > Full Screen ) , then when the Mac restarts everything is ready to go .
Downsides
When it works , it ’s great .
The trouble is that 15 % of the time something happens - EyeTV crashes , iTunes has been updated and wo n’t let you play anything until you ’ve accepted terms and conditions , or another app is telling you that an update is available .
For these times , I do n’t have an easy solution , other than to screen share and sort it out with the MacBook .
Sometimes ( like in the instance of EyeTV crashing ) you just have to restart .
I ’ll add more detail and photos when I can …
This is the season when food and wine articles in the national media suggest that the advent of colder weather calls for seasonal dishes ( daubes , pork roasts , apple desserts ) and richer , heftier wines ( Zinfandel , Barolo , Port ) to stave off winter ’s chill .
True , except that our version of “ chill ” can be downright temperate ; before heading to the farmers market and the wine shop , I sometimes still have to slather on sunblock and grab my wide - brimmed hat .
Such is the disconnect at this time of year , when instincts and habits tell us to braise lamb shanks and pull out the Cabernet , but the Southern California weather often refuses to cooperate .
There is a beverage that suits our local version of the season , though , combining the traditional flavors of fall with the refreshment and lightness of beer , and that ’s cider .
Not the chilled , brownish - colored stuff from the supermarket , but alcoholic or “ hard ” cider .
Hard cider is made from fermented apple or pear juice or , in the case of some large - production brands , juice concentrate , and the finished product has an alcohol content ranging from about 3 % to 8 % .
Most mass - market hard ciders are not very interesting , but a select number of producers are using artisanal techniques and varieties of fruit bred specifically for cider , yielding juice with higher acidity and tannins , which makes a well - structured drink with the complexity and depth of a fine microbrew .
Since the flavor of lighter ciders is akin to off - dry white wines or sparklers , they make ideal aperitifs , brunch drinks or simply to savor on their own .
Sweeter , richer ciders are terrific with cheese or apple pie .
Distinguishing a quality artisanal cider from a commercial , large - production bottling is easier than it might seem .
Price is one indicator ; better ciders usually cost upward of $ 10 for a 750 - milliliter bottle , and some are $ 20 or more .
But the ingredients ’ list tells the real story .
Here ’s one from a popular pear cider made in the U.K. : pear wine , water , high fructose corn syrup , carbon dioxide , caramel color , citric acid , sodium metabisulfate ( to preserve freshness ) .
Contrast that with the ingredients list from a bottle of cider produced by Wandering Aengus Ciderworks of Salem , Ore. : fermented apple juice from certified organic cider apples .
Which would you rather drink ?
Devoted following
Quality hard cider has a cultish following in Europe , particularly in France ’s Normandy region and in the U.K. , where pubs offer cider on draft along with ales and lagers .
It ’s also popular in apple - growing regions of the U.S. , such as New England , New York and the Pacific Northwest .
But in Los Angeles , cider tends to be the poor stepchild .
Since it ’s not wine or beer , few retailers pay it much attention .
I asked the manager of one wine shop how many ciders he carried .
“ We do n’t have any , ” he said with a shrug .
On my way out , I decided to check the beer section for nonexistent ciders .
There , right up front , was a nice little selection .
I recently sampled 22 hard ciders , apple and pear , available at local retailers .
Many were eminently forgettable or actually unpleasant , but I did find several terrific examples .
Here are four producers to seek out ( buying information in sidebar ) :
Inspired choices
Eric Bordelet was a sommelier at l ’Arpège , a Michelin three - star restaurant in Paris , in 1992 when he decided to return to his roots , quite literally , and manage his family ’s orchards in Normandy .
Bordelet brings a wine sensibility and a commitment to organic and biodynamic farming to the production of apple and pear ciders .
His Sidre Doux , with an alcohol content of 4 % , is styled like a lightly sweet , toffee - scented , apple -y dessert wine .
Bordelet ’s Poiré Authentique is a fresh - tasting , blossom - scented pear cider , while his top - of - the - line Poiré Granit , made from the fruit of 300 - year - old trees , is more vinous , with complex aromas of pear skin and spice .
Note that these ciders are vintage - dated and that the year is printed on top of the cork .
Manoir du Parc is another Norman product , this one from an estate called La Brique in St. Joseph , on the Cotentin peninsula .
Manoir du Parc produces a well - regarded apple cider , but locally , I have found only the Poiré , a superb example in a light - bodied style ( 3 % alcohol ) with aromas of ripe pears and clean , refreshing flavors .
Wandering Aengus Ciderworks is owned by Mimi Casteel and Nick Gunn , who got into the cider business about four years ago ( Casteel ’s parents own the neighboring Bethel Heights Winery ) .
Casteel and Gunn use artisanal methods and traditional varieties of cider apples to produce three ciders , the most appealing of which is Heirloom Blend , a sweet drink with a tart acidic backbone that ’s like biting into a dead - ripe , fragrant apple .
The semi-dry is more austere and wine - like , with fresh , juicy flavors .
The dry cider is too dry for my taste ; the naturally strong acidity of the cider tastes sour without a counterbalancing sweetness .
Rustic and robust
J.K. Scrumpy sounds like a cutesy name created during a 1960s ad agency brainstorming session , but it actually is an authentic , organic farmhouse cider produced by the Koan family of Almar Orchard in Flushing , Mich . , about an hour north of Detroit .
“ Scrumpy ” is a British term for a rustic style of cider , and “ J.K. ” stands for Jim and Karen Koan , the proprietors , who produce just one bottling , a robust , unfiltered , sweet drink with a 5.5 % alcohol content and the crisp taste of fresh apple cider .
This style of cider takes well to mulling ( heating with mulling spices ) , so keep some on hand for when those fiercely cold winter storms move into the Southland .

Microsoft is releasing the first public beta of Windows 7 at noon pacific time on January 9th on the Windows 7 page ( it turns out that Microsoft has delayed the release of the public beta , due to overwhelming demand ) , but before you jump right in be sure to back up those MP3s .
According to Microsoft ’s Technet site :
To protect your MP3 files
1 . Before you install this Beta release , back up all MP3 files that might be accessed by the computer , including those on removable media or network shares .
2. Install the Beta release of Windows 7 ; download and install the Update to Windows 7 Beta ( KB961367 ) located on this page .
Apparently , the first beta of Windows 7 will delete the first few seconds of any MP3 file that are added to Windows Media Player either manually or AUTOMATICALLY or if the metadata is edited in windows explorer , even on the network .
This is due the indexing software Microsoft runs on your machine .
There ’s currently a hotfix for this problem so I ’ll cross my fingers and hope that they have it included before the public beta goes live .
Here ’s a better description of the problem from Microsoft ’s Technet site :
When MP3 files are added ( either manually or automatically ) to either the Windows Media Player or the Windows Media Center library , or if the file metadata is edited with Windows Explorer , several seconds of audio data may be permanently removed from the start of the file .
This issue occurs when files contain thumbnails or other metadata of significant size before importing or editing them .
To avoid this , take the following steps :
To protect your MP3 files 1 .
Before you install this Beta release , back up all MP3 files that might be accessed by the computer , including those on removable media or network shares .
2 . Install the Beta release of Windows 7 ; then install this update ( KB961367 ) .
If you do not want to install the update , you can avoid this issue by setting all MP3 files that might be accessed by the computer to read - only before starting either Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center or before editing MP3 metadata with Windows Explorer .
To do this , in Windows Explorer , find the files , right - click them , click the General tab , and then select the Read - only check box .
Once you have installed the update , you can safely reset the read / write status of your MP3 files to your preference .

Zen meditation discourages mental withdrawal from the world and dreaminess , and instead asks one to keep fully aware with a vigilant attitude .
Typically one focuses on breathing and posture and aims to dismiss thoughts as they arise .
Brain scans now show that Zen training leads to different activity in a set of brain regions known as the " default network , " which is linked with spontaneous bursts of thought and wandering minds .
Image
The seemingly nonsensical Zen practice of " thinking about not thinking " could help free the mind of distractions , new brain scans reveal .
This suggests Zen meditation could help treat attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( so - called ADD or ADHD ) , obsessive - compulsive disorder , anxiety disorder , major depression and other disorders marked by distracting thoughts .
In the last decade , there has been a resurgence of scientific research into meditation , due in part to the wide availability and increasing sophistication of brain - scanning techniques .
For instance , scientists recently found that months of intense training in meditation can sharpen a person 's brain enough to help them notice details they might otherwise miss .
" It is important that this type of research be conducted with high scientific standards because it carries a long - standing stigma — perhaps well - deserved ? — of being wishy - washy , " said researcher Giuseppe Pagnoni , a neuroscientist at Emory University in Atlanta .
" Constructive skepticism should always be welcomed as a great sparring partner . "
Pagnoni and his colleagues investigated Zen meditation , which Pagnoni himself has practiced while studying for his doctorate in Italy .
The Zen of Zen
Zen meditation vigorously discourages mental withdrawal from the world and dreaminess , and instead asks one to keep fully aware with a vigilant attitude .
It typically asks one to silently focus on breathing and one 's posture with eyes open in a quiet place and to calmly dismiss any thoughts as they pop up , essentially " thinking nothing . "
One can over time learn how to keep one 's mind from wandering , become aware of otherwise unconscious behaviors and preconceived notions and hopefully gain insights into oneself , others and the world .
To see what effects Zen meditation might have on the brain , scientists compared 12 people from the Atlanta area with more than three years of daily practice in Zen meditation with 12 novices who had never practiced meditation .
The researchers " had to screen — and discard — a number of colorful characters who during the interview declared that they were meditating regularly by screaming in a towel while stomping their feet on the ground , or that they were communicating frequently with beings of other planets , " Pagnoni recalled .
" Such are the unexpected joys of this research ! "
As the volunteers had their brains scanned , they were asked to focus on their breathing .
Every once in a while , they had to distinguish a real word from a nonsense word displayed at random times on a computer screen and , having done that , promptly try and focus on their breathing again .
Their scans revealed that Zen training led to different activity in a set of brain regions known as the " default network , " which is linked with spontaneous bursts of thought and wandering minds .
After volunteers experienced in Zen were distracted by the computer , their brains returned faster to how they were before the interruption than novice brains did .
This effect was especially striking in the angular gyrus , a brain region important for processing language .
" The regular practice of meditation may enhance the capacity to limit the influence of distracting thoughts , " Pagnoni said .
Posturing the findings
" What I find really interesting in this approach is that it stands to regulate the mind by regulating the body — posture , breathing , " Pagnoni said .
The neural circuits for controlling posture are quite distinct from those responsible for higher brain functions , " and perhaps shifting one 's attention to posture or breathing facilitates a temporary quelling of mental chatter . "
By teaching people how to clear their minds of interruptions , Zen meditation could help disorders marked by distracting thoughts , Pagnoni said .
" There is already some evidence that a behavioral therapy incorporating elements of mindfulness training derived from meditation can be beneficial in reducing relapses in major depression , " Pagnoni noted .
Pagnoni added that the default mode network might be especially vulnerable to Alzheimer 's disease .
" Although we enter the field of wild speculations here , could the practice of meditation , by providing regular intervals of respite in the incessant working of the default network , have — if mildly — protective effects for Alzheimer disease ? " he conjectured .
Pagnoni noted one potential failing of the study was that the volunteers experienced in Zen meditation might have some innate capacity for controlling their thoughts , explaining the differences seen .
Ideally , scientists could track novices as they grow experienced in Zen meditation , to see if their brains change or not , he said .
The research , funded by a National Institutes of Health grant , is detailed online Sept. 3 in the journal PLoS ONE .
Doctors declare Australian hospital system on the brink of collapse
By Alex Messenger
11 December 2008
Australia 's public hospitals are so understaffed and bed shortages so serious that hospitals routinely operate for long periods at " code red " , a level of overcrowding at which patients will die , says a new public hospital ‘ report card ' released last month .
Fewer than two thirds of emergency patients are attended to within the recommended 30 minutes .
About a third of emergency patients wait eight hours to be admitted to a ward .
The federal Labor government this week responded to the crisis by increasing health funding by $ 1 billion annually under its new five - year Australian Health Agreement with the states .
But this is only a third of what is required to avoid unsafe bed occupancy levels , according to the Australian Medical Association ( AMA ) , the country 's leading medical lobby group .
The AMA 's report card says the $ 3 billion actually needed would add 3,750 hospital beds nationally .
The newly announced increase in federal funding will add only 625 .
The message that workers should take from the report and from the federal response , is that the Labor Party has effectively abandoned the task of providing basic services to the bulk of the population .
The AMA figures are stark .
The number of public hospital beds provided for each 100,000 people over 65 ( a useful proxy for the hospital - using population ) has decreased by 67 percent over the last 20 years .
In other words , the hospital - using public is two thirds worse off than it was in 1988 in terms of hospital bed provision .
The AMA also says that doctors are leaving the public hospital system and looking for work in private hospitals because they realise they cannot provide adequate care in the public system .
The core symptom of systemic distress , according to the AMA , is chronic overcrowding and vastly reduced levels of safety , especially for the elderly .
Studies by the Australian College of Emergency Medicine ( ACEM ) show that an occupancy rate of more than 85 percent " risks systematic breakdowns , extended periods of ‘ code red ' and puts patients at risk of mortality and disability . "
The major teaching hospitals are way over this mark and are " commonly operating on a bed occupancy rate of 95 percent [ with ] some jurisdictions set[ing ] a bed target rate of over 90 percent . "
Rates over 100 percent are not uncommon .
However , one needs to look closely at those figures to appreciate the true scale of the disaster .
The ACEM recommendation ( 85 percent ) is for what hospitals should achieve on average over a year .
But hospital practice ( 95 percent ) is routinely , not on average , above that level .
The myth of universal health care
The AMA report cracks open the claim of successive Australian governments that , in contrast to the United States , Australia has a system of universal health care .
( The current web site of the Commonwealth Department of Health repeats that claim . )
In fact , the Australian hospital system is being torn apart by the same profit - seeking , user pays ideology that dominates US health care and which has transformed Australian education , superannuation and government administration generally over the last 25 years .
Australia has a two - tier hospital system : a well - funded private one for those who can manage to pay ballooning private health insurance premiums , and for everyone else a residual system on the brink of collapse .
For proof , one need only compare the trends in bed numbers .
In the last decade , private hospital bed numbers have increased 16.5 percent .
Public bed numbers have undergone a 1.6 percent reduction .
The two - tier system reinforces existing inequalities , so that the wealthier get a better class of treatment .
Not only do private payers have their own hospitals , but because medical expertise is still centred in the major teaching hospitals , about 10 percent of patients in public hospitals , according to federal government figures , are actually private patients whose hospital costs are , in part , charged to their health insurer .
Poorer patients lie in crowded wards , often after having waited years for elective surgery .
Down the corridor , those who have paid insurance premiums receive what is , in comparison , a far better level of treatment — they are treated faster , get their own room and are allowed to choose their treating doctor .
Private elective surgery patients avoid the long public waiting lists that have for decades been a source of popular outrage .
But the central political issue that Australia 's semi-private hospital system raises is not simply inequality of treatment .
Of even more central importance is the relationship between the public system 's de-funding and the choices that individuals make in taking out private health care .
The legitimate fear of ending up in a dangerous , possibly deadly , public hospital system makes private insurance a rational choice within the parameters of the current system , even if that means struggling to afford insurance premium costs .
The public hospital system becomes less about providing adequate health care for all , or even for a majority , and more a mechanism for ensuring the growth of the private system and the profitability of the insurance sector .
This in turn justifies the further downgrading and de-funding of the public system .
The figures speak loudly on these matters .
In the last 11 years , rates of private insurance hospital cover per head of population have increased from 30 to nearly 50 percent .
The main source of that increase was a single 10 percent jump in 1999 - 2000 in response to the introduction of a 30 percent rebate for health insurance premiums ( the federal government will refund you 30 cents for every dollar you spend on private health insurance ) .
But the rebate cannot fully explain the current 50 percent private coverage rate .
In the past five years ( well after the introduction of the rebate ) average premium costs have risen 33 percent .
Usually , where price increases , demand drops .
The fact that demand for insurance has increased means that other factors are in play .
Growing apprehension about the public hospital system and its capacity to deliver adequate treatment , assisted by a federal government sales job on health insurance , is the clearest explanation .
The 30 percent health insurance rebate , now an almost unnoticed part of the health system 's furniture , illuminates better than anything else the political processes at work .
In 1999 , the then federal Liberal government spruiked the rebate 's introduction as a reward for those who had chosen not to be a burden on the public system .
The intention was to encourage people to take up private health insurance .
The 10 percent increase in members in 2000 indicates the policy worked .
But the rebate , which now costs $ 3.5 billion per year , effects , via the budgetary process , a massive annual transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich and to the insurance companies .
The explosion in the annual cost of the rebate is largely explained by the insurance industry 's annual ratcheting - up of premium costs .
( The government makes an annual public show of " moderating " the companies ' proposed increases , but these proposals are in any case ambit claims . )
Over the last five years , the average annual premium increase has been 6.5 percent .
Unsurprisingly , given massive public subsidies , health system parasitism is a profitable business .
In 2007 , MBF , which is one of 30 or so insurers and has about 20 percent of the market , announced a $ 223 million profit .
Other insurers have been doing similarly well .
Will Labor end the billions in annual subsidies to private health insurance companies ?
The answer should surprise no one .
At the introduction of the 30 percent rebate and in the years that followed , Labor , sensing broad popular opposition , promised to rein in the rebate .
But in February of this year , three months after Labor won government , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd assured the health insurance industry that the rebate was safe .
" The private health insurance rebate remains unchanged and will remain unchanged , " he told reporters .
Five more years of decay
The AMA report card is an attempt to warn the Commonwealth it must dramatically increase funding for public hospitals .
But the five - year agreement struck this week between the Commonwealth and states demonstrates that even careful exposure of the facts by a powerful and respected lobby group will make little or no difference to policy outcomes .
Between 1988 and 2000 , the Commonwealth provided about 45 percent of public hospital funding .
But that proportion has since been in steep decline , leaving state governments to meet the shortfall out of unstable state duties and fee increases for public services .
Each year the states scrounge for special - purpose supplementary funds from the Commonwealth .
That pattern will now continue .
The Labor state premiers , sensitive to the popular opposition federal Labor will face in the looming recession , have said they are happy with what they have received .
In fact , the $ 1 billion base funding increase is only half of what the premiers themselves were demanding before the global financial crisis began to hit .
This situation will only get worse .
The state governments , cash strapped , will not increase revenue - raising to fill the gap between Commonwealth provision and actual need .
Moreover , as Rudd's $ 10.4 billion federal government " stimulus package " has demonstrated , hospitals and other essential services will see no benefit from the federal government 's ad - hoc attempts to pump - prime an economy on the skids .
Above all , the Labor government will continue the user - pays politics that has brought the public hospital system to its knees .
Public hospitals will remain dangerous for patients and demoralising for employees .
Chronic overcrowding will worsen and private health insurance costs will consume more and more of the monthly budget of those already just managing to meet premium costs .
Misunderstanding Credit and Housing Crises : Blaming the CRA , GSEs
" It 's telling that , amid all the recent recriminations , even lenders have not fingered CRA .
That 's because CRA did n't bring about the reckless lending at the heart of the crisis .
Just as sub - prime lending was exploding , CRA was losing force and relevance .
And the worst offenders , the independent mortgage companies , were never subject to CRA -- or any federal regulator .
Law did n't make them lend .
The profit motive did . "
- Robert Gordon , American Prospect >
>
I have been meaning to get back to this issue , but events in the market have kept me a tad busy .
Making the rounds amongst a certain subset of wingnuts on CNBC , at IBD and other selfconfoozled folks has been the meme that the entire housing and credit crisis traces to the the Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) of 1977 .
An alternative zombie myth is the credit crisis is due to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
A 1999 article from the New York Times about the GSE 's role in subprime mortgages has been circulating as if its the rosetta stone of the credit crisis .
These memes have become a rallying cry -- cognitive dissonance writ large -- of those folks who have been pushing for greater and greater deregulation , and are now attempting to disown the results of their handiwork .
I feel compelled to set the record straight about this pseudo - intellectual detritus .
As we have painstakingly discussed over the past few years , there were many direct and indirect causes of the current financial mess .
Let 's clarify the causes of current circumstances .
Ask yourself the following questions about the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act and / or the role of Fannie & Freddie :
• Did the 1977 legislation , or any other legislation since , require banks to not verify income or payment history of mortgage applicants ?
• 50 % of subprime loans were made by mortgage service companies not subject comprehensive federal supervision ; another 30 % were made by banks or thrifts which are not subject to routine supervision or examinations .
How was this caused by either CRA or GSEs ? •
What about " No Money Down " Mortgages ( 0 % down payments ) ?
Were they required by the CRA ?
Fannie ?
Freddie ? • Explain the shift in Loan to value from 80 % to 120 % : What was it in the Act that changed this traditional lending requirement ?
• Did any Federal legislation require real estate agents and mortgage writers to use the same corrupt appraisers again and again ?
How did they manage to always come in at exactly the purchase price , no matter what ?
•
Did the CRA require banks to develop automated underwriting ( AU ) systems that emphasized speed rather than accuracy in order to process the greatest number of mortgage apps as quickly as possible ?
•
How exactly did legislation force Moody's , S&Ps and Fitch to rate junk paper as Triple AAA ? •
What about piggy back loans ?
Were banks required by Congress to lend the first mortgage and do a HELOC for the down payment -- at the same time ?
•
Internal bank memos showed employees how to cheat the system to get poor mortgages prospects approved that should n't have been : Titled How to Get an " Iffy " loan approved at JPM Chase .
( Was circulating that memo also a FNM / FRE / CRA requirement ? ) •
The four biggest problem areas for housing ( by price decreases ) are : Phoenix , Arizona ; Las Vegas , Nevada ; Miami , Florida , and San Diego , California .
Explain exactly how these affluent , non-minority regions were impacted by the Community Reinvesment Act ? •
Did the GSEs require banks to not check credit scores ?
Assets ?
Income ? •
What was it about the CRA or GSEs that mandated fund managers load up on an investment product that was hard to value , thinly traded , and poorly understood •
What was it in the Act that forced banks to make " interest only " loans ?
Were " Neg Am loans " also part of the legislative requirements also ?
• Consider this February 2003 speech by Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozlilo at the American Bankers National Real Estate Conference .
He advocated zero down payment mortgages -- was that a CRA requirement too , or just a grab for more market share , and bad banking ?
The answer to all of the above questions is no , none , and nothing at all .
The CRA is not remotely one of the proximate causes of the current credit crunch , Housing collapse , and mortgage debacle .
As I detailed in Barron 's , there is plenty of things to be angry at D.C. about -- but this ain't one of them .
If you were to ask me to reveal the prime causative factor for the Housing boom , I would point you to Fed Chairman Greenspan taking rates to 1 % , and then leaving them there for a year .
The prime factor in the bust was nonfeasance on the Fed 's part in supervising bank lending , allowing banks to give money to people who could n't possibly pay it back .
The root legislative cause of the credit crisis was excessive deregulation .
From exempting derivatives from regulation ( 2000 Commodities Futures Modernization Act ) to failing to adequately oversee ratings agencies that slapped a triple AAA on junk paper , the pendulum swung too far away from reasonable oversight .
By taking the refs off of the field and erroneously expecting market participants could self - regulate , the powers that be in DC gave the players on Wall Street enough rope to hang themselves with -- which they promptly did .
There are too many people who are trying to duck responsibility for the current mess , and seeking to place blame elsewhere .
I find this to be terribly important , as we seek to repair the damage amidst an economic crisis .
Rather than objectively evaluate the present crisis in an attempt to craft an appropriate response , the partisan hacks are trying to obscure the causes of the current situation .
Like burglars trying to destroy the surveillance tape , they are all too aware of their role in the present debacle .
Shame on them for their foolishness or cowardice .
Whenever I see a CRA proponent blathering , I have a " Star Trek moment . "
That 's when Captain Kirk proves to some random alien computer that its basic programming is logically inconsistent .
It 's the AI ( artificial intelligence ) version of cognitive dissonance .
The computer , recognizing the fraud its entire existence was based upon , seeing the futility of its belief system , at least has the dignity to blow itself up .
No such luck with the wingnuts , who merely move on to their next piece of spin . . .
" You can fool some of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time .
That 's usually enough . "

Comments
Dick Armey on CNBC spouting the same line of bullcrap --
Best quote : " Herbert Hoover was a must better president than he gets credit for . "
He also cites the BS Amity Shlaes book .
Posted by : Dick Armey | Oct 2 , 2008 7:10:18 AM
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. economy is likely to deteriorate further this year and unemployment will rise into 2010 , according to the latest forecasts from the staff of the Federal Reserve .
This bleak forecast was presented to Fed policymakers when they met last month and lowered interest rates to near zero .
Low interest rates are one key tool the central bank uses to try to spur economic activity .
According to the minutes from that meeting , the central bank is now predicting that gross domestic product , the broadest measure of economic activity , will fall in 2009 .
" I think that the Fed is really very scared right now -- like everybody else -- and they want to pull out all the stops , " said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
The Fed indicated that most members at its meeting expected a slow recovery to begin in the second half of the year , but that unemployment would still rise " significantly " into 2010 .
Employers cut 1.9 million jobs over the first 11 months of 2008 , which took the unemployment rate up to 6.7 % .
The December report will be released by the Labor Department Friday and economists surveyed by Briefing .com expect a loss of 475,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate will rise to 7 % , which would mark a 15 - year high .
The Fed cited a multitude of problems dragging down the economy besides rising unemployment , including stock market declines , low consumer confidence , weakened household balance sheets and tight credit conditions .
It said business spending is also likely to fall due to weak retail sales and the credit crunch .
In addition , some members of the Fed expressed concerns that the economy could worsen even more than currently expected .
" Meeting participants generally agreed that the uncertainty surrounding the outlook was considerable and that downside risks to even this weak trajectory for economic activity were a serious concern , " the Fed said in the minutes .
If the current recession , which began in December 2007 , lasts throughout 2009 , that would make it the longest U.S. economic downturn since the Great Depression .
Wyss said he thinks there is now little debate among policymakers about the problems in the economy and the need to take unprecedented action .
" They 're already jumping , they 're just asking how high , " said Wyss .
The minutes also showed that some Fed members are now more worried about the threat posed by deflation , or falling prices , than they are about inflation .
Deflation can slow economic activity dramatically since it could lead to businesses to cut their production plans in the wake of lower prices .
The Fed also revealed more details about other moves it plans to make to boost the economy now that it has lowered rates as far as it can .
According to the minutes , the Fed anticipates completing previously announced purchases of $ 600 billion in debt and mortgage backed securities from firms such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the end of June 2009 .
The plan to buy back these securities has already helped to lower mortgage rates in recent weeks .

Pretty rotten thing that happened in Mumbai , huh ?
Grand old hotel , in an increasingly progressive and prosperous India : Suddenly , hundreds of innocent , unsuspecting people are hostages , some of them being systematically murdered .
Bombs are exploding , people are screaming , military are descending into the chaos , TV crews are coming from everywhere to broadcast the carnage worldwide .
When the dust begins to settle after many horrifying hours , the body count has reached nearly 200 , and many more are injured and emotionally scarred for the rest of their lives .
The perpetrators ?
Though no demands were made , and no group immediately took credit for the insane attack , all evidence points to Islamic terrorists , likely from Pakistan .
And why ?
Well , if current theories and intel are correct , this slaughter was planned and executed by one of many Islamic groups that feel directed by their religion to subjugate – or exterminate – " infidels " like Hindus , Jews , Christians and even other Muslims who do n't hew to their extremist views .
To them , there is only one acceptable worldview – a theology they intend to enforce on all humankind – and anyone who might disagree or obstruct their goals should be removed , violently if need be .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Thank God , it could n't happen here .
Could it ?
Look around .
Watch your evening news .
Read your newspaper .
Are you unaware of the raging demonstrations in our streets , in front of our churches and synagogues , even spilling into these places of worship , and many of these riots turning defamatory and violent ?
Have you not seen the angry distorted faces of the rioters , seen their derogatory and threatening placards and signs , heard their vows to overturn the democratically expressed views of voters , no matter what it costs , no matter what was expressed at the polls ?
Twice ?
I refer to California 's Proposition 8 .
You have n't heard about the well - oiled campaign to find out the names of every voter and business that contributed as much as $ 1,000 , or even much less , in support of Prop 8 ?
You have n't heard about the announced plans to boycott , demonstrate , intimidate and threaten each one – because they dared to vote to retain marriage as between one man and one woman ?
You have n't seen , on the evening news , prominent entertainers and even California Gov.
Schwarzenegger , urging the demonstrators on , telling them they should " never give up " until they get their way ?
Assuming you have become aware of all this , let me ask you :
Have you not seen the awful similarity between what happened in Mumbai and what 's happening right now in our cities ?
Oh , I know the homosexual " rights " demonstrations have n't reached the same level of violence , but I 'm referring to the anger , the vehemence , the total disregard for law and order and the supposed rights of their fellow citizens .
I 'm referring to the intolerance , the hate seething in the words , faces and actions of those who did n't get their way in a democratic election , and who proclaim loudly that they will get their way , no matter what the electorate wants !
Hate is hate , no matter where it erupts .
And hate , unbridled , will eventually and inevitably boil into violence .
How crazily ironic that the homosexual activists and sympathizers cry for " tolerance " and " equal rights " and understanding –while they spew vitriol and threats and hate at those who disagree with them on moral and societal grounds .
I was saddened to hear that the estimable Brad Pitt , who has done a lot for the displaced people in New Orleans , pledged $ 100,000 to his friend Ellen DeGeneris for some campaign to overturn Prop 8 , saying something about constitutionally guaranteed " equal rights . "
I 'd like to know – on just what constitutional writ does Brad base this statement ?
Every homosexual citizen has the same , identical rights as any other American .
The Constitution says nothing about marriage , and should n't .
Marriage is not a governmental creation ; it is a time honored and biblically ordained institution that is subject not to the government but to the will of the people .
And the people , down through the centuries , have spoken .
Not just the Bible , but Webster 's Dictionary , defines this covenantal relationship called " marriage " as a commitment between one man and one woman .
Because this elemental building block of society has been so defined and respected throughout history , elected representatives in our self - government have granted certain supports and tax relief and privileges to marriages and families .
Again , these privileges did not originate with some benevolent higher authority – they originated with the people , through the democratic process .
That 's how a free republic works .
Our people consecrated our Constitution and determined to live within its provisions , voluntarily .
It was determined that the will of the voting majority would rule , though it was subject to change if the majority will changed .
There never were any " rights " granted or designated to those who dissented with the will of the majority , other than the same rights all citizens have to work through the democratic process to accomplish their purposes .
No " rights " were ever granted to citizens on the basis of their sexual habits or lifestyle .
There simply are no such " rights . "
Slavery was abolished , blacks and women obtained the rights to vote , and these true rights were not obtained by threats and violent demonstrations and civil disruption ( though these things did occur , of course ) , but by due process , congressional deliberations and appropriate ratification .
This was democracy in action , not mob rule .
As noted journalist Thomas Sowell has said , there never was " a right to win . "
In America , at least the America we 've known till now , rights are earned and won in a deliberative , legal way – at the polls .
What troubles me so deeply , and should trouble all thinking Americans , is that there is a real , unbroken line between the jihadist savagery in Mumbai and the hedonistic , irresponsible , blindly selfish goals and tactics of our homegrown sexual jihadists .
Hate is hate , no matter where it erupts .
And by its very nature , if it 's not held in check , it will escalate into acts vile , violent and destructive .
Animal Collective
Hey , Folks !
Happy new year !
The recently passed year of 2008 was a decent one , musically .
Decent because we saw quite a couple of fine albums come out , with some nice , surprising debuts ( see Fleet Foxes , Vampire Weekend , Bon Iver ) , but nothing really that stood out .
Frankly , ten years from now 2008 will only be remembered by people as the year Chinese Democracy came out .
Period .
For 2009 , though , I ’m hoping for a more memorable year and , judging from the list of albums coming up this year , it might just happen .
Bellow , you can check out just a few of 2009 ’s albums that we ’re dying to listen to .
1. Animal Collective – Merryweather Post Pavilion ( January 13th )
I always loved AC for their eccentric and innovative way of abording music , and that ’s not really hard to see , even for those who have n’t heard their music .
When you ’ve got band members going by the name of Panda and Geologist you know there ’s something special about these guys .
Strawberry Jam , the groups last studio effort , was really awesome , so I ’ve got really high hopes for AC ’s upcoming new album , Merryweather Post Pavillion , which gets out really close , in January .
Nice way to kick off the year , eh ?
2. John Frusciante – The Empyrian ( January 20th )
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are undoubtedly a killer band , with a catalog that would put most bands to shame .
However popular they may be though , fans do n’t seem to appreciate too much the solo work of the band members , and when I say RHCP solo work , I mean John Frusciante .
He ’s released nine really hectic albums ( ranging from lame to beautifully serene ) , with his tenth , titled “ The Empyrian , ” on the way .
I ’m feeling really sorry for all those people that think of John only as that dude who plays guitar for the Chillies and does some pretty backup vocals here and there , becasue they ’re simply missing out on some quality , raffined music .
It ’s not for everyone , I know , especially in the period when he was on drugs ( “ Your Pussy ’s Glued to a Building on Fire ” is the title of a song from that time ) , but still if you learn to appreciate his music , you ’ll surely be in for a treat .
Here ’s me rooting for a very special album from J .
3. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band ( January 27th )
Last time the ‘ Boss ’ teamed up with the jolly fellows from the E Street Band , they produced 2007 ’s Magic , one of the year ’s best and another solid addition to Bruce ’s intimidating discography .
Last year ’s election have seen Bruce committed to Obama ’s presidential campaign , playing gigs across the country in support for the now recently elected president of the USA .
This undoubtedly went on to influence how his latest album on the upcoming ( had a chance to listen to a few tracks ) , going by the name of “ Working On A Dream ” – a record packed with messaged of hope , new beginnings and change .
A new Bruce Springsteen album is always a chance to rejoice , so , again , fingers crossed .
4. Lily Allen – It ’s Not Me , It ’s You ( February 9th )
One of the best debut artist of the last few years , Lily Allen , is also prepping a new studio effort this , titled “ It ’s Not Me , It ’s You . ”
Lily ’s debut album “ Alright , Still ” took everybody completely by surprise and propelled her into instant fame .
The album did extremely well both financially ( it moved over 2.5 mil units ) and critically .
Well done , miss Allen , but can you put another Alright ?
We all hope so .
5. Morrissey – Years of Refusal ( February 16th )
The man around a cult following has been born around time ( you can always recognize a fan by the hair ) , Morrissey , has always dazzled people thanks to his extraordinary musicianship , as well as his songwriting , releasing a load of solo albums in the last year .
Undoubtedly , his latest upcoming new LP , dubbed “ Years of Refusal , ” will be among this year ’s best ( excellence seems to repeat itself through out his work ) , but we ’re a bit unsure what make out of the album art .
Wtf ?!
6. U2 – No Line on the Horizon ( March 3rd )
It ’s a bit incredible when you think about the fact that the arena monsters U2 have n’t released a new album in over four years , since they released the critically acclaimed “ How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb . ”
Guess Bono ’s constant benefits , stage appearances and all round persona made the band always feel close and in the spotlight .
Still , new music is missed from the Irish super group , and , like an answered prayer , the band is prepping to put out a new album , No Line on the Horizon , sometime in March .
7. Mastodon – Crack The Skye ( March ? )
“ The story starts with a seed and it grows .
It ´s a multidemensional story .
It starts on planet earth , it deals with astral travel , goes to outer space , you get lost and you go on into a wormhole and you start exploring all sorts of Stephen Hawking ’s theories , space continuum and all that , you go into the spirit realm , you get sucked into another wormhole that brings you into Tsarist Russia and you get put inside Rasputin´s body and Rasputin is assassinated and you fly off through the crack in the skye and back through outer space into the devil´s dominion , passed him , back into earth and into your body .
It ´s all real natural and it all kind of comes together .
We like it . ” – Brann Dailor , Mastodon drummer .
Ok .
Done reading that ?
If you also consider that a lot of the album ’s composition was made by the band ’s lead guitarist , whilst recovering from severe head trauma , you can easily come to a conclusion .
Yes , there ’s no doubt it – we ’re dealing with epic shit on our hands .
Their last album , “ Blood Mountain , ” was almost perfect , as far as progressive metal goes anyway , and we ’re rootin for nothing less from the upcoming Crack The Skye .
8. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – TBA
Once hailed as the saviors of rock ’n’roll , next to their fellow New Yorkers The Strokes , the garage rockers of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are definitely one of this year ’s favorite bands with a new album to get out .
There ’s a whole humongous fan base out there waiting and waiting for the new , still untitled album , but truth be it , there ’s really little to nothing we know about it .
Band promises it ’ll be a whole new experience , though .
Interesting …
9. Grizzly Bear – TBA ( May ? )
“ Yellow House , ” Grizzly Bear ‘s sophomore release , was a wonderful release , packed with tons of fun and the band ’s signature eerie harmonies .
Actually , it was GB ’s breakthrough moment , that gained them a lot of attention and well deserved appreciation .
After all , they did n’t tour with Radiohead for most of ’07 for nothing .
Now , all eyes are centered around their new effort , a yet untitled album , set for a release sometime in May .
Get ready a serious sonic orgasm .
10 . No Doubt – TBA ( first half ’ 09 )
We have n’t heard anything new from No Doubt in a very , very long time , and if you ask me ( and another million people ) it ’s about time they put something out , together .
Yup , the band ’s back together and will soon unleash a huge tour , starting spring ’ 09 , with a new album to go with it .
Feels like Christmas already .
Only 360 days left to go .
Bonus :
Franz Ferdinand – “ Tonight : Franz Ferdinand ”
Andrew Bird – “ Noble Beast ”
Chris Cornell – “ Scream ”
The Fray – “ The Fray ”
Kelly Clarkson – TBA
Depeche Mode – TBA
Dave Matthews Band – TBA
Dr. Dre – “ Detox ”
Goo Goo Dolls – TBA
Garbage – TBA
Lamb of God – TBA
Massive Attack – TBA
Matchbox Twenty – TBA
Joe Satriani – TBA
Muse – TBA !!!
– it ’s really more inclined towards ’ 10 , otherwise it would ’ve been in the top 10 .
Stars – TBA
Amy Winehouse – TBA
ZZ Top – TBA
Note :
There ’s no telling when a certain band might pull a Radiohead on us and release a album out of the blue .
Bands like The Raconteurs or Bloc Party did it last year , and I ’m betting we ’re see more of that this year as well .
So , be on the look out from anything from the likely suspects – White Stripes or …. Radiohead ( ? ) .
What are your most anticipated albums of ’09 ?
After months of dreary earnings reports , Midway Games got a brief reprieve in November with the release of the decently reviewed Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe .
However , the honeymoon did n't last .
This morning , the publically traded publisher issued a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that revealed it is carrying a whopping $ 240 million in debt .
That 's $ 72.5 million more than the $ 167.5 million in total assets -- including property -- that the company had as of September 30 .
Midway 's debt breaks down as follows : $ 150 million is from various note holders ( with Wells Fargo as trustee ) , and another $ 90 million is from the publisher 's former majority shareholder , National Amusements .
National Amusements is headed by Sumner Redstone , the multimedia mogul who controls MTV parent Viacom and GameSpot parent CBS .
Last week , gloomy stock - market conditions forced Redstone to sell his $ 30 million stake in the company for $ 100,000 -- and the assumption of $ 70 million of debt -- to a private financier buyer , Mark Thomas .
As a result of the ownership change , Midway 's debtors are able to call in the company 's debts if they so choose .
" Based on current market conditions , the registrant [ Midway ] expects that all holders of the [ debt ] notes will elect to require the registrant to repurchase their notes , " it read .
Indeed , Midway has apparently already received notices from investors eager to get their money back .
According to the terms of the $ 150 million loan , Midway has 20 days to send its debt holders notices of the controlling interest change .
Said debt holders then have the option to demand the Chicago - based company repay their loans at 100 percent value - -" plus accrued and unpaid interest " -- within 30 days .
In short , that means that in mid-January 2009 , Midway could default on debt worth nearly twice the $ 75.9 million quarterly loss that it reported in November .
In the company 's own words , " If this were to occur , the Registrant [ Midway ] does not believe , on the basis of its current liquidity , that it would have the ability to satisfy its obligation with respect to the repurchase of the [ debt ] Notes . "
Even worse , defaulting on the $ 150 million debt would trigger a provision that would let National Amusements call in the $ 90 million that it loaned Midway .
Again , in the filing 's own words , " If these amounts were declared immediately due and payable , the Registrant [ Midway ] does not believe , on the basis of its current liquidity , that it would have the ability to satisfy its obligations to repay these amounts [ to National Amusements ] . "
So what happens then ?
" I can't really comment other than to say we 're pushing forward , " a senior Midway corporate communications rep told GameSpot .
The rep did confirm that for several weeks prior to today 's announcement , Midway has been working with investment bank Lazard to come up with " liquidity solutions " that will be announced " as soon as possible . "
In the meantime , Midway is sticking to its 2009 release schedule , which has the long - delayed Vin Diesel - starring game the Wheelman launching in mid-February .
It also revealed that a sequel to its TNA Impact wrestling game is slated for release later in the year .
“ Hope ” is the thing with feathers … ( 254 )
Emily Dickinson
“ Hope ” is the thing with feathers –
That perches in the soul –
And sings the tune without the words –
And never stops – at all –
And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –
And sore must be the storm –
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm –
I ’ve heard it in the chillest land –
And on the strangest Sea –
Yet , never , in Extremity ,
It asked a crumb – of Me .
Commentary :
Those are indeed scare quotes around “ Hope ; ” the bluntness of “ thing with feathers ” tells our speaker ’s mood .
This “ thing ” plants itself – perhaps unwelcome – in the “ soul ” and hammers away at a tune .
It does n’t bother to be articulate even though it is unceasing .
The absence of logos and its double nature – speech and reason are both missing here – should mean that “ hope ” is doomed to fail .
It should reveal itself to be entirely false .
But something strange happens upon reflection : even though a tune is not fully articulate , even though it merely mirrors the temporal , it still is distinct from the “ Gale . ”
An empty , howling sound is no match for a sweet one .
A “ storm ” could even have regrets from attempting to “ abash the little Bird . ”
The “ thing ” has received a name because of its power : it stands distinct in aiding others , whereas the storm attempts to reduce .
We note that our speaker ’s mood is improving although she is articulating a serious problem with “ hope ” – it is , strictly speaking , inhuman .
Logos is well beyond it : animals can make music .
“ Hope ” is very real , though : its sweetness ( content ) and merely having form ( warmth distinguished from chaos / storm ) are easily seen .
We ’d be stupid to deny its existence , as the speaker almost did in the first stanza .
Finally , Dickinson ’s speaker moves away from the general to the particular with “ I . ” She ’s heard the bird when she personally was cold ; she heard it when gales and storms were trying her .
Her gratefulness seems to have improved her mood .
The implicit imagery is of a ship needing warmth and direction : a very good paper could probably be written on Dickinson ’s use of the word “ sweet ” in this poem and in “ This is my letter to the world . ”
Sweetness is n’t just a feeling : it is a path of sorts , it seems .
That path , here , is tied to “ extremity . ”
We note that the final couplet ( “ extremity , ” “ me ” ) are the only two lines besides the one introducing the “ bird ” to not end in a dash .
The bird is the speaker at an extreme , which is why no crumbs are necessary .
The inhuman composes the human , and again the question resounds : is this really “ hope ” we ’ve discussed ?
Encyclopaedia Britannica president Jorge Cauz announced today that new features will be rolled out on Britannica.com in what looks like an effort to get hip with the Web 2.0 crowd .
This includes the ability for users to correct articles , one of the more powerful and controversial features of Britannica ’s biggest online competitor for serving up encyclopedic information : Wikipedia .
But modifications from users will not appear immediately — unlike on Wikipedia , where you can have your moment of published glory instantly ( if only fleetingly , before a heavy - handed editor deletes it ) .
Britannica plans to check the facts on all user contributions before they are published — and they hope to do so within 20 minutes of the user pressing “ submit ” .
I ’ll believe that when I see it .
Before you can submit your own content to the site , you ’ll be required to register with your real name and address .
Not sure how they plan to verify that information .
But the point is , Britannica still wants to differentiate itself from Wikipedia in terms of the quality of the content , which will still have to go through the hands of paid experts .
Per Mr. Cauz :
The reason it took us a long time to create a more user interactive website is because of the amount of technology required to ensure the changes are implemented in an expeditious manner .
We still want people to have to go through the editorial workflow .
We are developing a curated knowledge database .
Britannica also hopes that more dynamic content may attract more attention from Google , which Mr. Cauz stopped just short of accusing of collusion with Wikipedia :
If I were to be the CEO of Google or the founders of Google I would be very [ displeased ] that the best search engine in the world continues to provide as a first link , Wikipedia .
Is this the best they can do ?
Is this the best that [ their ] algorithm can do ?
I decided to compare some articles between Wikipedia and Britannica.com .
It ’s well known that Wikipedia covers way more topics — a few years ago , a Britannica spokesman gave Wikipedia faint praise for covering the sport of extreme ironing , which oddly has no article in Britannica .
So I was n’t terribly surprised to find that searches for somewhat obscure programming languages like Rexx and OCaml came up empty on Britannica.com .
Searching for “ programming ” came up with a pretty decent list of topics .
When I navigated to one , though , I was forced to sign up for a “ free trial ” ( is that anything like a free lunch ? ) , which required entering credit card information .
They want to bill you the $ 69.95 annual fee at the end of the free trial if you do n’t remember to cancel .
Screw that .
So , lemme see if I ’ve got this straight .
When I want to look things up on the web , do I want to pay 70 smackers a year just to believe that the information that may or may not be on Britannica.com is maybe a little more accurate than what I could find for free and for sure on Wikipedia ?
I guess we should n’t be surprised that a 240 - year - old encyclopedia is still stuck in old media think .
Remote control toy helicopter 'used to fly drugs into prison '
A toy helicopter is believed to have been used in an attempt to smuggle drugs into a prison .
Guards at Elmley Prison in Sheerness , Kent , spotted the remote control miniature aircraft flying over the walls of the jail and heading for the accommodation blocks one night after it was picked up by CCTV cameras .
It had a small load beneath the fuselage , thought to contain drugs .
The toy or its cargo was not found .
Night flight :
A toy helicopter was spotted flying over the walls of a jail with its fuselage thought to contain drugs
However , staff could not find any trace of either the helicopter or the package which it appeared to be carrying underneath it when they searched the Category C jail .
' Using a mini- helicopter to get contraband into jails is unprecedented .
When officers spotted it they nearly fell off their chairs ' , a prison source told the Sun .
' It could have been drugs or a mobile phone in the package .
It is possible it was a dummy run . '
Target :
The remote control toy helicopter was spotted heading for the accommodation blocks at Elmley Prison
The Prison Service confirmed the incident took place .
A spokesman said : ' A remote control helicopter was flown into the grounds of HMP Elmley on December 23 .
' As a result of this , a search of the prison grounds and an accommodation block were carried out and nothing was found . '
Daring raid :

Mass layoffs predicted as Indonesian economy slows
By a correspondent
22 January 2009
Analysts and industry associations are warning that millions of workers will be laid - off this year in Indonesia because of the impact of the global economic breakdown .
With the country ’s exports severely hit , commentators are predicting slowing growth for 2009 , following expansion of around 6.2 percent in 2008 .
The World Bank has forecast growth of 4.4 percent , whilst the government has revised its target of 6.1 percent to between 4.5 and 5.5 percent .
Private institutions are less optimistic .
PT UBS Securities Indonesia president Sarah - Jane Wagg told the Jakarta Post in November : “ Given our global recession call , we are expecting Indonesian growth to moderate quite significantly , falling to 2.5 percent in 2009 ...
The prices of almost all primary commodities are falling and investments will be very weak . ”
The economy relies heavily on exports .
Indonesia was among the worst affected by the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 .
During 1998 , 3 million workers lost their jobs and GDP contracted by 13.7 percent .
Recovery from that crisis largely depended on exports , flowing from the growth of China and continuing US demand .
Exports grew by 17.29 percent in 2004 , 19.66 percent in 2005 and 17.67 percent in 2006 .
Now , Indonesia ’s three main export markets , Japan , the US and Singapore , have officially entered recession , China ’s growth has slowed considerably , and commodity prices have plunged .
As a result , the value of Indonesian exports for November declined 11.09 percent from October and 2.9 percent from the previous year , following an 11 percent decrease from September to October .
Exports of oil and gas , the largest sector in 2007 , decreased by 25.27 percent in October , with other key commodities — coal , chocolate , palm oil copra , rubber , copper , and tin — also declining .
The trend is expected to continue as the global slump deepens .
The World Bank predicts that non-oil commodity prices will decrease by an average of 23 percent in 2009 .
Indonesian share prices have already plunged .
Mining shares fell by 75.15 percent from January to November , agricultural stocks by 73.7 percent and trade , services and investment shares by 65.66 percent .
The Indonesian Stock Exchange ( IDX ) said market capitalisation declined from $ US211.1 billion in 2007 to $ 91.2 billion in December , with falls particularly dramatic in October .
Major losses prompted the IDX to halt all trading from October 8 to 13 .
Many foreign investors pulled out of the share market during the October collapse , IDX listing director Eddy Sugito told the Jakarta Post on December 12 .
The newspaper reported : “ Eddy blamed the recent departure of foreign investors on the tightening of liquidity worldwide , initially sparked by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States , forcing global investors to cash in their holdings in emerging markets ” .
In a sign of the seriousness of the crisis , the government announced a $ 6.5 billion fiscal stimulus package on January 5 .
Judging by the results of such packages in other countries , it will do little to ease the crisis , and is designed instead to ease public anger in the lead up to parliamentary and presidential elections this year .
By the government ’s own estimates , 6 percent economic growth is required to reduce current levels of unemployment .
According to the Manpower Ministry ’s estimate in early December , 10 million Indonesians are unemployed , and around 40 million underemployed .
Suwartoyo , a member of the Indonesian Institute of Science ’s humanities research centre , told the Jakarta Globe that decreasing exports would lead to mass lay - offs .
“ We recorded that many exporting industries have had to cut back on their workforce because demand for Indonesian goods from countries like the United States and European countries is declining , ” Suwartoyo said .
“ Seventy - five percent of palm oil is exported …
As prices have plummeted worldwide , 500,000 workers in West Kalimantan Province , for example , and 380,000 workers in South Sumatra Province could potentially be laid off some time in the near future . ”
The Indonesian Institute of Science said 600,000 workers were dismissed in 2008 , while a meeting of major industry associations on December 19 predicted that millions would be laid off in 2009 .
Speaking to the Jakarta Post , Indonesian Employers Association ( Apindo ) chairman Sofjan Wanandi predicted retrenchments of 1.5 million from the construction sector alone .
Indonesian Footwear Association ( Aprisindo ) chairman Eddy Widjanarko predicted 30,000 layoffs in the footwear industry in 2009 , on top of an estimated 10,000 in 2008 .
It is expected that 150,000 workers in the textiles and garments industry will be dismissed this year .
More than 250,000 migrant workers have returned home since the outbreak of the global turmoil , exacerbating the problem .
A mass return of Indonesia ’s 5.8 million migrant workers would also cut incoming financial flows , with their remittances home totalling approximately 60 trillion rupiah ( $ US5 billion ) in 2006 .
Broad layers of the Indonesian population are very vulnerable .
Of the country ’s 227 million people , an estimated 102 million , or almost 45 percent , live on less than $ US2 a day .
A Roy Morgan Research Survey conducted at the end of October found that 59 percent of Indonesian households do not regularly save any money , while 59 percent spend between 30 and 50 percent of their monthly budget on food .
The plight of the Indonesian masses will significantly worsen as the economic crisis deepens and sackings increase .
In the lead - up to this year ’s elections , social unrest could well produce political crises .
2008 has been a year of firsts for FIRE ’s .
Conceived as a network of liberty - minded students and faculty members , the CFN exists to facilitate a change in the campus culture from one of censorship to one of liberty .
Since the debut of its new website in February , the CFN has more than tripled its membership , exceeding 1,500 members across the nation .
The first annual CFN student conference took place on June 26 – 28 .
FIRE brought over forty students from around the country to Center City Philadelphia , to hear from speakers including FIRE Co-founder Harvey Silverglate , Alliance Defense Fund senior counsel Steve Aden , Stanford Law professor Derek Shaffer , and Indoctrinate U producer Evan Coyne Maloney .
Renowned journalist John Leo of the Manhattan Institute and Brooklyn College professor KC Johnson , co-author of Until Proven Innocent : Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case , delivered the keynote addresses .
Student feedback was overwhelmingly positive , and the CFN summer conference has earned a place as an annual FIRE event .
Organizing for 2009 ’s conference is already well underway .
The CFN has also instituted new recruitment efforts , the foremost of which is the CFN .
Created to encourage and facilitate students ’ activism for liberty , the program provides , FIRE , , and other rewards for students who on their campuses by hosting FIRE speakers , writing op - eds , and recruiting new members to the CFN .
The most active students are inducted into the CFN ’s Prometheus Society and receive guaranteed acceptance to the 2009 student conference .
Our top three winners — Sean Clerget of Wabash College , Amanda McCracken of the University of Alabama , and John Eubank of Towson University — received for their outstanding work .
For students interested in activism , the CFN established the FIRE this fall , facilitating students ’ ability to bring FIRE staff directly to their campuses .
In its first semester alone , the FIRE speakers ’ bureau arranged appearances at Towson University , Wabash College , Penn State University , Montclair State University , DePauw University , and the Lincoln School as well as at events for the Christian Union and Students for Liberty .
FIRE is also using the most up - to - date tools to get the word out about the CFN , including FIRE that can be placed on students ’ websites or Facebook profiles .
One widget links to the Spotlight page of a school of the students ’ choice , while the other links to the Speech Code of the Month school and is automatically updated every month .
To put one of these widgets on your blog or Facebook profile , follow the simple directions on the .
In order to reach the next generation of college students , the CFN hosted its first annual “ Freedom in Academia ” essay contest for college - bound high school seniors .
FIRE staff reviewed over 1,500 entries and found three that stood out among many good essays extolling the importance of free speech in the university .
Congratulations to our winners , and thanks to all the high school students who participated !
In the coming year we plan to continue and expand these programs , educating students and faculty members about their rights and empowering them to change their campuses .
Thanks also for all the hard work our members contributed and to our donors for believing in our work .
Students and faculty members interested in joining this enterprise and participating in the above programs should begin by and keeping their eyes on the Torch for more information on how to participate in the CFN ’s incentive program , summer conference , and other activities in 2009 .
Calling for a " new era of responsibility " in his inaugural address , President Barack Obama reminded us that there are no limits to " what free men and women can achieve . "
Indeed .
America achieved greatness as the can - do society .
This is , after all , the country of Thomas Paine and barn raisings , of Grange halls and Google .
Other countries shared , at least in part , our political freedoms , but America had something different -- a belief in the power of each individual .
President Obama 's clarion call of self - determination -- " Yes We Can " -- hearkens back to the core of our culture .
But ...
The tax haven plans to introduce an island - wide charge that allows residents unlimited legal downloads from P2P sites .
And if it goes ahead , we 'll be moving office ...
Visitors may soon travel to the Isle of Man not just for low tax rates , " spuds and herrin " , or to gape at the Bee Gees ' birthplace – they may go to download music .
The island 's government has announced plans to introduce a compulsory music licence , allowing unlimited legal music downloads .
Speaking at the MidemNet conference in Cannes , the Manx inward investment minister explained that the island has achieved 100 % broadband penetration and now seeks that its citizens be able to download music with impunity – under an island - wide blanket licence .
" At the end of the day , we 're not going to stop piracy , " Ron Berry said .
" Had the music industry embraced [ Napster ] , we 'd have a very different medium today . "
The Isle of Man 's proposed scheme follows a similar model to legislation that was rejected by French parliament in 2006 .
Internet subscribers would pay an extra monthly fee to their ISPs , who would in turn purchase a blanket music licence from rights holders .
Users would then be permitted to download whatever music they pleased , from whatever source – rogue P2P networks , shady BitTorrent trackers – without any legal repercussions .
" It effectively negates piracy , " Berry told BBC 6 Music .
" It legalises what 's already going on and what 's already going on in a big way ...
It 's something that 's been talked about on a number of occasions but we are offering an opportunity to really do it and do it quickly as a test bed . "
Though major labels have yet to sign up to the plan , they have backed similar propositions elsewhere .
It is the ISPs themselves who generally oppose these initiatives , resisting legislation that forces them to raise the price of internet access .
Under the Isle of Man 's plan , every internet user would have to pay the licence – whether or not they intend to download material .
" It may be as low as a euro a month , " Berry emphasised .
" That does n't sound like an awful lot of money ...
You have to look at the numbers involved .
If you work that up into , say , Telefonica terms with 120 million users , € 120 m euros a month from one ISP is worth considering . "
The failed French plan posited an € 8 to € 12 monthly fee .
" I think the timing is right , " Berry said .
" I think we just need to get that major rights - holder on board to say , OK , let 's see how we can make it work in the Isle of Man . "
The 1960s sculpture of Christ is made of coal dust and resin A large sculpture of Christ on the cross has been removed from outside a church in West Sussex after its vicar said it was " scaring young children " .
The Reverend Ewen Souter said the 10ft crucifix was " a horrifying depiction of pain and suffering " which was also " putting people off " .
The sculpture , located at the side of St John 's Church in Broadbridge Heath , has now been given to Horsham Museum .
It will be replaced with a new stainless steel cross .
In a survey carried out by the church , every comment about the sculpture was negative .
' Sense of hope '
Mr Souter said : " Children have commented on how scary they find it and how off - putting they find it as a symbol outside the church .
" As a key exterior symbol for us it was putting people off rather than having a sense of hope and life and the power of the resurrection . "
He said rather than undermining the work of the cross , the church wanted to portray " an accurate biblical picture of the crucifixion as a moment of hopefulness for the world , and not one of despair " .
The sculpture was designed in the 1960s by former Royal Society of British Sculptors president , Edward Bainbridge Copnall , and made out of coal dust and resin .
It was removed from the church just before Christmas and will be mounted on a large wall in the grounds of Horsham Museum .
Jeremy Knight , curator , said the powerful image portrayed by the figure was that of Christ in pain .
" That today is n't an image which a lot of churches want to follow .
They 'd much rather see an empty cross where Christ has risen , " he said .

I do n’t believe in the supernatural .
This includes God ( or gods ) .
In the literal sense of the word , that makes me an a - theist ( as well as an a - leprechaunist , a - goblinist , and so on ) .
Being an unbeliever in a predominantly Christian country can be a bit daunting at times , and I certainly understand the desire of my fellow unbelievers to speak out against hate , injustice , cruelty and prejudice , particularly when wrapped in a cocoon of religious rhetoric and passed off as love .
But the way some atheists go about it just makes me shake my head in wonder .
Take the recent flap in Olympia , Washington , where a seasonal message from the Freedom From Religion Foundation was erected next to the traditional Christian religious display in the Capitol building .
The message the FFRF chose to display was this : “ At this season of the winter solstice may reason prevail .
There are no gods , no devils , no angels , no heaven or hell .
There is only our natural world .
Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds . ”
The FFRF is run by Dan Barker , a former fundamentalist preacher who abandoned his Christian faith many years ago .
His story , as told in his book Losing Faith in Faith : From Preacher to Atheist , is a fascinating one , and Dan is obviously a smart guy , but I cannot imagine how in the world he let this message get past his laptop , let alone out the door and encased in a plastic slab in the rotunda of a state Capitol building .
No wonder many people think atheists are an intolerant and crotchety group .
Asking for reason to prevail is a nice sentiment , but it ’s laughable to espouse reason when you completely abandon it yourself .
There are no gods , no devils , no angels , no heaven or hell .
There is only our natural world .
Really , Dan ?
You ’re one - hundred percent sure about that ?
I must have missed the memo , the one that demonstrates with absolute certainty the non-existence of these supernatural entities .
I agree there is not one shred of scientific evidence in support of gods or devils or heaven or hell , but a lack of evidence only gives us ammunition to disbelieve , not flat - out deny .
Atoms , gravity , the strong nuclear force , and quantum mechanics existed for millennia before humans discovered them .
There are , undoubtedly , a host of other mysteries yet to be unraveled .
Perhaps the supernatural is one of them .
Granted , that possibility is remote , but reason dictates the door must remain slightly ajar .
The FFRF has fallen into a faith - based trap that is as worthy of ridicule as the beliefs they seek to condemn .
The FFRF concludes its message by making a blanket declaration that is neither fair nor accurate .
My wife ’s mind is not enslaved when she lights the Hanukkah candles and sings the blessings that have been handed down to her through the generations
She is simply taking part in a tradition that is important to her identity as a Jewish woman .
Religion certainly can harden hearts and enslave minds , but so can atheism .
The FFRF is taking the very worst that religion can muster and using it to paint everyone with the same bold brush strokes , a tactic perfected , ironically , by radical religious groups seeking to brand all nonbelievers as immoral devil - worshipping heathens .
How easily the FFRF stoops to the same level .
Pot , meet Kettle .
I have to give credit to the governor and state legislature of Washington for agreeing to post the message in the first place , though .
Giving atheists a place at the table of ideas in the public square is not exactly good for the reelection coffers .
At the same time , I wonder why someone did n’t rap his or her knuckles on Dan Barker ’s thick skull and explain to him that the best way to promote reason is probably not with an irrational and insulting sucker - punch aimed mostly at decent , hard - working people .
A simpler and gentler message would have sufficed : “ At this season , may reason triumph over fear and superstition , and may we renew our commitment to life , love , and the bonds of our shared humanity . ”
That ’s a message , I think , believers and nonbelievers alike can agree on .

The men said other desperate crew members also searched for pieces of the sunken craft during the Indonesian sinking .
The pair said during their sea journey , they spotted a Thai crew member but were unable to help him .
None of the other 18 crew members thought to be on board the sunken craft have been found to date , the Courier - Mail said .
An airplane belonging to the Australian Coastwatch spotted the two survivors , who drifted through shark - infested waters during their journey , Saturday near the Torres Strait .

Hamas vs. Likud Charter
In many of the Internet discussion I read throughout the recent war on Gaza , Zionist hasbara fighters claimed that it is impossible to talk with Hamas because its charter , written in 1988 , calls for the destruction of the state of Israel .
That charter is of course irrelevant and the use of the charter argument by pro-Zionists is nonsense .
Several times , last back in November , Hamas leader Haniyeh said publicly that Hamas is willing to accept a Palestinian state with 1967 borders and thereby will effectively recognize Israel .
So from Hamas ' site , a solution of the conflict is possible .
But there is another charter in play and I have not seen that mentioned in those Internet discussion .
The Likud charter from 1999 as available on www.knesset.gov.il says :
The Jewish communities in Judea , Samaria and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values .
Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel .
The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting .
...
The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river .
Judea and Samaria are the West Bank .
I am not aware of any refutation of that charter .
Likud is likely to win next month ' election in Israel .
Its leader Netanjahu promisses to extend the Zionist settlements in the West Bank .
This against international law , the roadmap and other peace plans .
So while using Hamas charter in an argument as being an obstacle to peace is clearly bogus , it is obviously justified to point to Likud 's charter as the real issue .
So why have I never seen this used as an argument in the discussion ?
Maybe people just do not know .
If that is the case , please spread the word .

Questioning Quackery
From reader Nathan Grange in New Zealand comes news that there is concern in New Zealand about more extensive government spending on what 's now called " Complementary and Alternative Medicine " [ CAM ] , a situation that is currently being reviewed , along with appropriate concerns about the efficacy of the treatments .
The Accident Compensation Corporation ( ACC ) reports that it spent NZ $ 37 million [ US $ 20 million ] on CAM in the 2007 - 2008 year up from NZ $ 18.4 million [ US$ 9.8 million ] in 2003 - 2004 .
It was decided that there were " legitimate questions " about the effectiveness of some alternative treatments , and the issue is being looked at as part of a broader ACC review .
In the past year , the ACC spent $ 14 million [ US $ 7.4 million ] on acupuncture alone , and NZ$ 12.7 million [ US $ 6.8 million ] on chiropractic treatment .
New Zealand doctors have wisely said that any treatment receiving government funding should be subject to the same rigorous standards as conventional medicine , though some alternative therapies for disability - allowance clients are approved by " registered medical practitioners , " which includes chiropractors .
One NZ MD , Dr. John Welch , said the idea of integrating conventional and complementary medicine was a
... fake proposition .
There can only be one sort of medicine that 's shown to be effective and works and should be publicly funded .
Even Ministry of Health chief adviser on integrative care Dr. David St. George said that the ministry was " exploring options " for integrating Cam into mainstream medicine but any suggestions of government funding were premature .
He said :
There needs to be sufficient evidence of efficacy and effectiveness before a therapy can be considered for public funding .
This all sounds perfectly sensible , but rather trite and unneeded , to me .
These requirements should be obvious , and an integral part of any decision about government funding .
But New Zealand Register of Acupuncturists president Paddy McBride says that Chinese medicine could not be tested
...using the same limited controlled trials Western medicine would like us to use .
May I ask , why not ?
Yes , the scientific method may be - to quacks - " limited , " because it requires direct evidence , and the word " controlled " is repellent to these folks , but those methods work !
Massachusetts voters supported marijuana decriminalization by a margin of nearly two - to - one in November , despite the horrified protestations of the Bay State 's law enforcement community .
Now , thanks to the inclusion of a sentence in the ballot initiative and guidance from state Attorney General Martha Coakley , decriminalization foes see an opening to keep fighting their lost battle by seeking to pass municipal ordinances that would fine , or in some cases , subject to criminal penalties , people who consume marijuana in public .
'' Gutterheads ' ' and '' Girls 4 Ganja ' ' pre-lobbying party , week of Quincy hearing
Under the initiative passed in November and in effect since early this month , the maximum penalty for marijuana possession ( up to one ounce ) is a $ 100 fine .
But as the state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security noted in law enforcement guidelines issued earlier this month : " Question 2 permits the cities and towns to pass ordinances or by - laws prohibiting public use of marijuana or THC and to provide for additional penalties for public use .
EOPSS recommends that municipalities enact such by - laws or ordinances and provide police with the option of treating public use as a misdemeanor offense . "
Attorney General Coakley was happy to help out .
Her office drafted and distributed a model ordinance for banning the public use of marijuana , which could include either criminal or civil sanctions , or both .
A number of Massachusetts towns and cities have expressed interest in passing such ordinances , which does not sit well with decriminalization advocates , and now battles over the ordinances are breaking out all across the state .
It has n't gone as well for the recriminalizers as they might have expected .
The first municipality to vote on an ordinance , Worchester , voted it down last week .
West Newbury Police Chief Lisa Holmes asked for a public pot smoking ordinance , but the council there unanimously said no .
In Methuen and Quincy , Bay State activists have managed to put local elected officials on alert that they can expect trouble if they pass such ordinances .
But those battles are n't over yet , and there are many more to be fought .
In Framingham , the town board of health passed a measure amending the smoking ban to include marijuana , but state law already prohibits the lighting of tobacco or other combustible products in public buildings .
In Braintree , an ordinance proposing a $ 500 fine for public consumption will be discussed in coming weeks .
In Auburn , where the police chief said the decriminalization law was unenforceable , he is expected to draft an ordinance fining public smokers .
Ordinance fights will also take place in Danvers , Everett , Haverhill , Melrose , Milford , Newburyport , North Andover , Plymouth , Revere , Wakefield , and Watertown , according to Massachusetts activists .
And there are probably more to come -- or perhaps not , if a string of defeats occurs .
And if activists can mobilize in those towns like they did Tuesday night in Quincy , they might just have the recriminalizers on the run .
In Quincy , more than 60 people showed up outside city hall with signs and banners to express opposition to any ordinance .
Mobilized by cell phone , Facebook , MySpace , and the BostonFreedomRally.com web site , about two - thirds of the ralliers were young people , said BostonFreedomRally.com 's Scott Gacek .
" Many of our people had just voted for the first time , for Obama and for decriminalization , and now they feel like their votes are being ignored , " said Gacek in explaining the youth turn - out .
Although the ordinance was on the agenda , the city council dithered for hours over a zoning issue , but the crowd lingered into the night , sending the council a strong message of opposition .
" The council introduced the measure and , with no discussion whatsoever , voted to send it to the public safety and ordinance committees , but it does n't exactly look like it's on a fast track , " said Gacek .
Citizen action is a good thing , affirmed Bill Downing , president of the MassCann , the Bay State NORML affiliate .
" If people want to participate in these protests in places like Quincy , that 's a significant thing .
If people are reading this in Maine or New Hampshire or Rhode Island , they can get on our e-mail list as well as read the news on the MassCann web site and join in .
Please . "
For Downing , the ordinance moves are a last gasp of the anti-decrim dinosaurs .
" I see this as sour grapes by the folks who lost the vote , " he said .
" Hopefully , people throughout the state who voted for this would see actions like that as an insult , as they well should .
It may end up helping us progress toward better marijuana laws because these people are only vilifying themselves . "
" Attorney General Coakley was hostile toward us from the beginning , and after the election she sent out a model ordinance , " said John Leonard , a former MassCann chair and currently a board member with the Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts ( DPFMA ) .
" Now , they 're jumping on this all over the place .
We are in the process of formulating an action plan here at DPFMA , " he said .
" We 're fighting these things left and right , and we need some help .
We 're happy that the Marijuana Policy Project came here and did the initiative , but now we 're left with the aftermath . "
MPP largely dictated November 's initiative language and funded the campaign .
Local activists had issues with some of the initiative 's language , but papered over them to unite behind the campaign .
In the sometimes rancorous debate in the run-up to the initiative , the language about ordinances was not an issue .
Perhaps it should have been , Leonard suggested in hindsight .
" It is a shame that Question 2 allowed for public consumption laws , " said Leonard .
" Those are traditionally used for legal substances , like alcohol and tobacco .
Marijuana is already illegal in public . "
Downing also blamed the wording of Question 2 for some of the current problems .
" The question itself said it did n't prevent towns from passing local ordinances .
If they had n't put that in there , this whole thing could have been avoided .
Do n't get me wrong , " Downing continued .
" We 're thankful for MPP for all they did , but now we have to deal with this . "
DPFMA is mobilizing to fend off the ordinances , Leonard said .
" We are going to buy advertising in Quincy , which is the largest city where this is an issue , and we 're going to be asking all the national organizations to chip in by adopting a town and lending their support .
We want to stop this now , " he said .
MPP is a bit more sanguine about the ordinances than Bay State activists .
" The bottom line is really whether specific proposals are an attempt to subvert the intent of Question 2 or whether it is just a reasonable public nuisance ordinance , " said MPP communications director Bruce Mirken .
" If they are going to use this as a pretext to give people criminal records , then that becomes a problem . "
But it 's Massachusetts voters who can stop the ordinances , or not , Mirken said .
" It is up to local folks to decide what they 're willing to tolerate and how organized they 're going to get to stop something they do n't like . "
It 's not that big a problem , said another national reform leader .
" We 're not worried that there will be serious damage from this , " said Keith Stroup of national NORML .
" It sounds like most of this is just chest - beating from the losers .
They did n't like the initiative , so they run out and say ' in my town we 're going to be tough , ' but they are going to find that not many elected officials will want to go up against the expressed will of the voters . "
" We want to make sure this law works well , and if it does n't , we are going to need to work with people to fix it , " said Stroup .
" But we 're not going back to arresting marijuana smokers .
I think the people of Massachusetts appreciate their new law and having police pay more attention to serious crimes . "
The ordinance battles will continue .
At best , they will result in a resounding defeat of the recriminalizers .
But even if decrim foes are able to get ordinances passed in some municipalities , it may be a pyrrhic victory :
In the process of trying to do so , they are waking up a whole new generation of Bay State marijuana activists .
Perhaps the local ordinance clause will turn out to be a Trojan Horse for building the drug policy reform movement .
Updated , 8:25 a.m. : Radiohead has been added to the performing line - up for the Feb .
8 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles , joining the likes of Katy Perry , Lil Wayne , Carrie Underwood and fellow Brits Coldplay .
Radiohead , nominated for album of the year for " In Rainbows , " has been quite the Grammy booster in 2009 , with singer Thom Yorke appearing in a television and print ad campaign to hype the Recording Academy - hosted gala .
Indie - focused website Pitchfork reported the news Sunday evening , and a Recording Academy statement confirmed it this morning .
Paul McCartney was also added as a performer , and the former Beatle will be joined by Dave Grohl , as nary a Grammy event shall happen without the presence of a Foo Fighter .
With Radiohead in , all but two of the album of the year candidates will be on board for the telecast .
It 's rare that an artist up for the top prize would not make some sort of live music appearance on the Grammy telecast .
However , that 's precisely what 's happened with Radiohead in the past .
The act has been nominated for album of the year twice -- for " OK Computer " and " Kid A " -- but did not perform in either year .

Newsbeat reporter
Men who take cannabis regularly have a one in 5,000 chance of developing a disease like schizophrenia , according to one of the top drug specialists in the UK .
But Professor David Nutt , who chairs the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , told Newsbeat the risk to mental health from smoking cannabis is no greater than getting drunk .
" We 've written three reports and read every paper published for the last 30 years .
We do not believe the risks are going up , " he said .
" When we look at the evidence , we have seen a huge increase in the use of cannabis but a fall in schizophrenia . "
" Alcohol is probably more likely to cause dependence than cannabis .
" It causes brain damage through vitamin deficiency and withdrawal can lead to psychosis .
Overall the mental health risks of alcohol and cannabis are not dissimilar . "
Mental health impact
The government has upgraded cannabis to a Class B substance this week against the advice of the ACMD , partly because it says there is growing evidence it does damage mental health .
The drug has been closely linked to schizophrenia , an illness which can cause hallucinations , paranoid or bizarre delusions and disorganised speech and thinking .
Alec Jacobs from Kent used to be a heavy cannabis smoker
Read : Cannabis law change comes into force Twenty - nine - year - old Alec Jacobs from Kent was a heavy cannabis user before developing the disease in his early 20s .
" I was hearing voices and getting anxious and depressed .
I think cannabis definitely played a part in doing something to me , " he told Newsbeat .
" I was smoking a lot of skunk which I think sent me into a psychosis .
" By the age of 21 , I found it hard being around people and I could n't smoke it anymore because it was n't doing me any good whatsoever .
" I think there is definitely a lasting effect .
I still get depressed and anxious and feel sort of trapped in a way . "
But Professor
Nutt from the ACMD reckons the link between cannabis use and that kind of severe mental health problem is " probable but weak " .
The latest research suggests the government would have to stop 5,000 men and 12,000 women from smoking cannabis to prevent a single case of schizophrenia in both groups .
" Using cannabis will tip a few people over the edge but in terms of most of the population , there is n't really a risk there , " he said .
Serious crimes link
The vast majority of people with the schizophrenia tend to suffer personal problems like depression but the most extreme cases can lead to dangerous behaviour .
Marc Middlebrook , 27 , was sentenced to life imprisonment last year for stabbing his girlfriend Stevie Barton to death because he believed she was part of a plot to kill him .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Newsbeat spoke to Stevie 's mother Jackie , a former psychiatric nurse .
She said she did n't blame the drug for her daughter 's death .
" I always say cannabis did n't kill my daughter , Marc did , " she said .
" I know lots of people - doctors , professionals , nurses - who have smoked cannabis for years and do not commit crimes . "
" It 's no good standing there wagging your finger and saying this is wrong .
People need to be able to know the facts and there is a lot of information and counter information around cannabis use at this time . "
" What message are you giving to people when you downgrade cannabis to a Class C and then take it back up to a Class B ?
It 's that you do n't know what you are doing . "
" Let 's not turn this into a witch hunt .
Let 's not damn all cannabis users , that would be wrong .
" We need an adult approach .
Let 's get some education . "

Hamas ' armed wing says it lost only 48 fighters during the conflict in Gaza
Three Palestinians across the Gaza Strip discuss the ceasefire and the role of Hamas in the war and its aftermath .
AHMED , in Nuseirat refugee camp
There is no mutual accord between Hamas and Israel in this ceasefire - each side has its own truce and conditions .
So people think the violence might start again , once Barack Obama has been inaugurated as US president .
Everything has stopped now , apart from the drones circling 200 m above our heads , round and round .
It 's a constant buzzing noise , very wearing .
It 's like an adventure for Hamas , but people 's lives are not a game
Yesterday was great though , people began to get back to normal .
The Hamas statements in the media , ' We did n't leave our homes , we will stay on in our broken houses , in a tent if we have to ' are nonsense .
There is so much suffering .
Why tease Israel , why play with fire ?
It 's like an adventure for Hamas , but people 's lives are not a game .
Why bring about this war ?
It 's not to open the crossings , because that can be achieved by the Palestinian Authority and Egypt .
What 's the point of making enemies with Israel ?
Israeli people can be good , we can live with them .
But the amount of hatred here in Gaza , both for Israel and for Hamas ... yes , hatred for both .
You can feel it .
My family is divided over who to blame for this .
My mother blames Israel for responding so harshly .
The other members of my family blame Hamas for all this .
But these views are for indoors only , no one must hear them outside .
When someone speaks out , Hamas are afraid , so they shut him up using force .
Former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin used the same techniques .
A couple of days ago they shot someone in the legs here in Nuseirat camp , after he made jokes about the Hamas interior minister , Said Siyam being killed in a strike .
Fatah people especially hated him .
Hamas has its spies who overheard him and they told the head of the intelligence services !
After they shot his legs , the man was shouting ' God bless Hamas ! ' , so they would n't kill him .
They left him bleeding in the street in the dark , and people only rescued him after the gunmen had gone .
We must stop playing these dirty games .
Palestinian and Israeli residents should visit each other to discuss and explain things , the situation can't be solved by the leaders .
If we do n't move forward , things will move backwards to violence , and very soon , I 'm sure .
MUHAMMAD ABUSHABAN , in central Gaza City
The streets are full of people ; the banks are open , the markets are open .
This is the first time in 23 days things have been like this .
We 've gone to the bakery and bought some bread .
We did n't have to make it at home .
My sister works in a bank and she 's gone to work , my father too .
All my friends are OK .
Everyone is being so friendly in the street , asking about each other 's families .
I am talking to you as I stand in front of the Palestinian Legislative Council , it 's totally destroyed , it can not be repaired .
Of course I do n't blame Hamas , because what was happening to all of us was also happening to them .
They were among us , they did not hide .
Hamas did their best to defend the Gaza Strip .
If I could thank them , I would .
They were fighting face - to - face with the Israeli army .
They put themselves in danger .
No , I do n't think Hamas put us in danger .
Israel was attacking us and killing us , even when all we were doing was throwing stones .
They do n't want us to defend ourselves .
Israeli tanks must now leave Gaza .
Enough is enough .
AMJAD SHAWA , relief worker , in southern Gaza City The conditions here are catastrophic .
People can go back to their homes , but so many of them are destroyed .
And we 're back to the old issue of shortages caused by the Israeli siege of Gaza .
I do n't need to believe Hamas , I can see facts with my own eyes in hospitals
I went to the Shifa hospital yesterday .
I saw so many bodies and injured people .
One doctor told me how he had had to amputate a child 's leg in a hospital corridor because all the operation rooms were full .
Hundreds of people : men , women and children have lost limbs .
There is no victory here .
The main losers are the Palestinian civilians .
A victory for me would be to get the Israeli criminals to court .
The issue is not Hamas .
This military operation was against the Palestinian people .
Today Hamas said that just 48 of them have been killed .
I do n't need to believe Hamas , I can see facts with my own eyes in the hospitals .
I 'm not afraid to talk about Hamas .
Last year we [ the non-governmental organisation ] took a position criticising Hamas for violating human rights .
We oppose any violation , whether it's from Hamas or anyone else , we do not keep silent .
We did meet Hamas officials about it back then , but other issues are more important now .
I am not a Hamas supporter , I did n't vote for them .
I am completely independent .
I support what gives us unity and what serves the people as a whole .
We need unity .
Hamas alone in Gaza and Fatah alone in the West Bank - is not going to work .
For me Hamas is not the issue , the main issue is the occupation .
Despite the unilateral withdrawal , Israel was still controlling everything in Gaza .

Kilo for kilo , space elevator payloads would cost much less than rockets
The prospects for the space elevator have been shaken up with a simple prototype using a broomstick .
Age - Raymond Riise of the European Space Agency demonstrated the device at a space elevator conference in December .
The project could see a 100,000 km long tether anchored to the Earth as a " lift into space " for cheaper space missions .
While the approach could solve one of the idea 's great technical hurdles , many issues remain , according to conference attendees .
First mooted by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895 , the space elevator idea has captured imaginations as what would be the greatest space mission ever conceived .
The idea rests on balancing a number of forces ; imagine fixing a short length of string to a football and spinning it - the string flies outward and remains taut .
Keeping an object moving in an orbit requires a centripetal force , directed Earthward .
The object is inclined to move in a straight line , however , resulting in the so - called centrifugal force that acts against the centripetal force , keeping the string - or the space elevator cable - taut .
By making use of a space elevator cable or tether whose centre of mass is at geostationary orbit - tracking a fixed point on the Earth 's surface - gravity provides the centripetal force that keeps the tether taut , providing a means to propel people and cargo into space .
Going up A long - standing critical issue is how to power the " climber " that would ascend the cable into space .
Prevailing ideas include delivering microwave or laser power to the climber beamed from the Earth 's surface , or even from orbiting solar power collectors .
In December the private firm Eurospaceward hosted the Second International Conference on Space Elevator and Tether Design in Luxembourg to discuss such schemes .
But European Space Agency ground station engineer Mr Riise provided a markedly more simple idea .
He proposed sending power mechanically - effectively by providing a carefully timed jerk of the cable at its base .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
To demonstrate , he employed a broomstick to represent the cable held in tension , and an electric sander to provide a rhythmic vibration to the bottom of the stick .
Around the broomstick 's circumference he tied three brushes representing the climber with their bristles pointing downwards - meaning it took slightly more force to lower the brush assembly than to raise it .
The vibration from the sander allowed the assembly to slide upward along the broomstick as it moved slightly downward , but grip it as it moved slightly upward .
The net effect : the assembly rose against gravity straight to the top of the stick .
The prototype 's approach would make for a bumpy ride in practice , but Mr Riise believes the rhythmic tugging on the cable could be smoothed out .
" It would be possible to make a suspension system that completely decouples the cabin where the passengers are , " he told BBC News .
" For them it would be a linear movement with very little disturbance . "
Sky - high stakes
While the novel idea could greatly simplify the provision of climbing power to the space elevator , a number of considerable technical challenges remain , namely in the makeup of the cable on which the climber ascends .
The idea might first see use in skyscrapers here on Earth Such a cable , at least 36,000 km long and strained in the middle with all its weight , is no easy thing to produce .
While next - generation materials , namely carbon nanotubes , could provide the enormous strength - to - weight ratio that would be required , debate rages on about how or even if cables of that scale and strength could be manufactured .
But the stakes are high ; payloads could be sent via space elevator much more cheaply than by rocket .
Besides cheaper space missions and space tourism , the space elevator would allow the development of space - based energy solutions that would be otherwise prohibitively expensive .
" From my point of view , the space elevator project is important because it enables a far more directly useful project - installation of large space solar power satellites around the Earth to provide continuous , cheap , CO2 - neutral , environmentally friendly energy , " said Benoit Michel of the Catholic University of Leuven , who attended the conference .
" I firmly believe that the next century will have a large space - based industry and that industry will be the main energy provider for the whole mankind , " he added .
Mr Riise said that he has been approached by commercial lift companies , who are researching new ideas for lifts in superscrapers .
The simplicity of the approach makes it attractive when compared to other nascent ideas for powering lifts , such as compressed air .

NEWTON , Massachusetts — January 3 , 2009 — Ars Technica today announced that 2008 was the last year the company would create a Macworld keynote bingo board .
Philip Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing , will deliver the opening keynote for this year 's Macworld Conference & Expo , and Ars Technica will not provide a bingo board .
The keynote address will be held at Moscone West on Tuesday , January 6 , 2009 at 9:00 a.m.
Macworld will be held at San Francisco 's Moscone Center January 5 - 9 , 2009 .
Ars Technica is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , trade show parody bingo boards have become a very minor part of how Ars Technica reaches its customers .
The increasing popularity of Ars Technica 's Actual Web Site , which more than 3.5 million people visit every week , enables Ars Technica to directly reach customers around the world in innovative new ways .
Ars Technica has been steadily scaling back on Apple - related novelty tie - in products in recent years , including NAB - bag Prize Pouches , Macworld New York Real Pizza and Bagels , Macworld Tokyo Variable Powered Armor , and Apple Expo Tarte Tatin in Paris .
Ars Technica ignited the " PC enthusiast " revolution in the 1990s with the Wankerdesk and reinvented the weblog in the 2000s with the Ars Technica journals .
Today , Ars Technica continues to lead the industry in innovation with its award - winning news coverage , Infinite Loop Apple journal , and the FatBits professional procrastinator repository and associated Twitter feed .
Oscar Grant was unarmed when he was shot by a BART police officer who was standing over him at the Fruitvale station early on New Year 's Day , said Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris , who has been hired by the victim 's family to investigate the death .
Grant , 22 , of San Leandro , was fatally shot on the BART platform shortly before 2 a.m.
Thursday , police said .
BART officers were called to the station in response to reports of fighting between two groups of men on board a train bound for the Dublin - Pleasanton station .
BART officials will only say the officer 's gun " discharged . "
BART officials have said Grant was unarmed and no weapons were recovered .
It remained unclear Saturday whether Grant was involved in the fight and whether he was one of the men put in plastic " flexi- cuffs , " which police often use as handcuffs when dealing with a large number of people .
BART officials say he was not restrained .
Witnesses dispute that claim .
Burris said Saturday that Grant did not move and was not trying to overpower the officer .
" It 's an outrageous set of facts , " he said .
BART officials have not released the name of the officer who shot Grant .
The officer has worked for the rapid transit agency for about two years , a BART spokesman said .
The train had come from San Francisco and was stopped at the Fruitvale station to allow officers to board the train and break up the suspected fight .
BART spokesman Jim Allison did not offer much new information about the shooting , except to confirm Grant was shot once .
Allison did not say where on his body Grant was shot .
The officer had been with BART two years .
He would not say if the officer had previously worked at another police department .
The officer is being represented by a Sacramento law firm .
A call to that office was not returned .
Allison also reconfirmed that surveillance cameras at the station do not record .
He said station cameras " historically " have not recorded what they view and are there primarily for " counterterrorism .
"
BART police did seize some cell phones from people on the platform who said they had used the phones ' cameras to record what happened .
None of those images have been released to the media , and Allison said he could not talk about evidence collected at the scene .
BART officials will only say the officer 's gun " discharged .
"
It is unclear whether Grant was involved in the fight and whether he was one of the men put in plastic " flexi cuffs .
" BART police and the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office are also investigating the shooting .
بعيداً عن الرَّط، و الطنطنة، و عدّ الجثث، و سكب الآهات و العبرات، أنا هنا اليوم لأنظر إلى واقع الأمر .
و واقع الأمر أيها السادة مثير .
مثير المحتوى، و مثيرٌ في كيفية توصلنا إليه، كما أنه مثيرً في كيفية تعاملنا معه .
فلسطين 1947 …
” أنا أؤيد الترحيل القسري، ولا أجد فيه شيئاً غير أخلاقي ” – دافيد بن – جوريون مخاطباً اللجنة التنفيذية للوكالة اليهودية ، يونيو 1938 .
أن تجهل لُبَّ المأساة، هو أمر محزن حقاً .
لكن أن تتعلمه على يد ( إيلان بابه ) هو شيء مهين .
في واحد من أكثر الكتب صرامةً و توثيقاً في تاريخ الصراع، يشرح إيلان بابه المؤرخ الإسرائيلي قريةً قريةً، بالدوافع و الآليات، واحدةً من أكبر جرائم التطهير العرقي في التاريخ الحديث — مولد إسرائيل .
و بينما أنا أقرأ “ التطهير العرقي في فلسطين ” و أشعر بضآلة مناهج التاريخ المعبأة بإنجازات الثورة لدينا، يتضح إليّ واقع الأمر أيها السادة .
أصل القضية و مفتاح الحل .
اللاجئ الفلسطيني .
و اللاجئ الفلسطيني أيها السادة نشأ بسبب الحاجة المرضية للآباء المؤسسين للصهيونية ألا يعيشوا في أقلية مرة أخرى .
و عليه، فإن الأرض المختارة وجب تفريغها من سكانها الأصليين ، لإنشاء الدولة اليهودية الخالصة .
لأنه، و لسخرية القدر الحارقة، حتى بعد تجمعهم من الشتات، فأن الصهاينة ما يزالون أقلية تعيش وسط الفلاحين العرب .
و هكذا و على مد ى عام كامل، بدأ مشروع الترحيل القسري، بالإرهاب و القتل على طول الخط .
لم يكن هناك خيارٌ أمام الفلسطينيين، و لم يكن هناك هذا الهراء الذي سمعناه عن بيعهم للتراب .
المجازر الجماعية تجري على قدم و ساق، و تلغيم بقايا القرى لكي لا يفكر أيهم في العودة يعمل بفاعلية عالية على أطراف من تسول له نفسه استعادة أي من حاجياته .
و النتيجة النهائية – أقدم معسكرات لاجئين في التاريخ الحديث .
بنهاية المشروع، قامت إسرائيل بخطوتين جادتين لإنهاء المسألة .
أولهما استيطان الأرض المفرغة أو تحويلها إلى غابات صناعية و منتجعات، كل ذلك يحمل أسماءً توراتية لمحو تاريخ الأرض نهائياً .
أما الخطوة الأخرى فكان إنشاء الأونروا، أو منظمة غوث و تشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين .
لأن تدخل المنظمة الدولية للاجئين في الأمر سوف يثير مقارنة مفزعة بين ما تفعله إسرائيل الآن و بين ما كان هتلر يفعله بيهود أوروبا، لأن المنظمة الدولية للاجئين كانت المعين الأول لليهود بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية .
مقارنة كتلك لا يجب أن تقوم .
تسعون ألفاً فروا إلى غزة .
يعيش الجيل الثالث منهم اليوم فيما يربو على السبعمائة و خمسين نسمة في معسكرات، معتمدين بالكلية على الإحسان الدولي، و آملين يوماً في العودة .
عودة لن تمنحها أبداً إسرائيل، حتى لا تتغير ديموغرافية البلاد لصالح العرب … طبعاً… منتهى الديموقراطية .
“ تقرر [ الجمعية العامة ] وجوب السماح بالعودة، في أقرب وقت ممكن، للاجئين الراغبين في العودة إلى ديارهم و العيش بسلام مع جيرانهم، و وجوب دفع تعويضات عن مملتكات الذين يقررون عدم العودة إلى ديارهم، و عن كل مفقود أو مصاب بضرر، عندما يكون من الواجب، وفقاً لمبادئ القانون الدولي و الإنصاف أن يعوض عن ذلك الفقدان أو الضرر من قبل الحكومات أو السلطات المسؤولة ” — قرار الجمعية العامة للأمم المتحدة رقم 194 ( الدورة الثالثة ) ديسمبر 1948 .
الشرعية …
بغض النظر عن اتفاقنا أو اختلافنا السياسي مع حماس أو غيرها من “ فصائ ل ” المقاومة، يبقى التزام إنساني مبدأي تجاه تلك الفرق .
التزام يوجبه نص القانون الدولي و اتفاقيات جينيف .
” المواقف المشار إليها في القطعة اللاحقة [ الواقعة تحت المواقف التي ينطبق عليها نص القانون الدولي ] تشمل النزاعات المسلحة التي يحارب فيها الشعب ضد السيطرة الاستعمارية، و الاحتلال الأجنبي، و الأنظمة العنصرية ممارسةً لحقهم في تقرير المصير ” — البروتكول الإضافي الأول لاتفاقيات جينيف المقال 1 ( 4 ) 1977 .
فيبدو من الأمر أن هناك احتلالاً أجنبياً، كما يبدو من الأمر أن هناك سيطرةً استعمارية .
يبدو أيضاً من الأمر أن هناك نظاماً عنصرياً يقوم بأعمال حصر و تطهير على أساس عنصري .
يبدو كذلك أن هناك شعب ما، و أن له حقٌ أصلي في تقرير المصير .
خلاصة المسألة هنا أنه لا يجوز اعتبار قوى المقاومة في حالة اعتداء بأي حالٍ من الأحوال .
كما لا يجوز الادعاء أنها استثارت حفيظة قوى الاحتلال .
كما أنه أيضاً لا يجوز –بصورة قانونية بحتة- المساواة بين المستعمر و اللاجئ في حالة “ المدنية ” .
أيضا ً نجد أن عدم اعتراف المستعمر بالقوانين الدولية و الاتفاقات المعترف بها من قبل الآخرين لا ينفي عمن اعترفوا بها و أقروها مسؤولية تنفيذها شاء أم أبى الطرف الجاني .
هذا هو واقع الأمر هنا أيها السادة، شئنا أم أبينا .
الدَّيـُّــوث…
حسناً .
يبدو أن هناك قوة احتلال تقوم بأعمال إبادة و استيطان و حصار و تجويع طويل الأمد .
يبدو أيضاً أن هناك قوات مقاومة تمارس حقها الشرعي .
يبدو كذلك أن هناك الآلاف من اللاجئين المحصورين في واحدة من أشد بقاع الأرض ازدحاماً .
هؤلاء اللاجئون مستهدفون منذ ما يربو على الستين عاماً لإنهاء الأزمة الديموغرافية للكيان العنصري المحتل .
هذا هو الواقع أيها السيد المحترم .
هذا الواقع أمامك الآن، و أنت رئيس جمهورية أكبر دول المواجهة، و أكثر الإخوة “ ثقلاً ” و تأثيراً .
هذا الواقع يملى عليك الآن من ( تسيبي ليفني ) بعد أعياد الميلاد بساعات .
ها أنت الآن تتخذ قرارك المصيري، ها أنت الآن تتصرف وفق الواقع و المسؤولية الملقاة على عاتقك .
إنك …
إنك تقول لهم لقد جلبتموه لأنفسكم و أنا لن أحرك ساكنا .
إنك تقول لهم ذلك يا سيدي بمنتهى الحكمة و الفطنة و الرصانة و الحصانة .
إنك تخبرهم بأنهم على وشك الإبادة .
تخبرهم ذلك و لا تفعل شيئاً .
هم بعد كل شيء ” الأخوة ” الفلسطينيون، و هذا شأنهم .
هم جلبوه على أنفسهم بشكل ما .
و أنت تجد نفسك في وسط كل هذا … غير مسؤول .
في وسط كل هذا، و بعد كل تلك الوقائع و الحقائق التي ترقد في حجرك منذ ستين عاماً .
تجد نفسك يا سيدي غير مسؤول .
تغلق عليهم الباب و تقف في الخار ج ت نفث دخان سيجارتك في هدوء، فأنت لا تريد أن تراه ينتهكها .
سوف تغلق الباب و سوف تنفث الدخان بعمق يا سيدي، حتى لا ترى عرضك كإنسان و قد علته الصراصير .
سيدي الديــوث …

Saudi court tells girl aged EIGHT she cannot divorce husband who is 50 years her senior
A Saudi court has rejected a plea to divorce an eight - year - old girl married off by her father to a man who is 58 , saying the case should wait until the girl reaches puberty .
The divorce plea was filed in August by the girl 's divorced mother with a court at Unayzah , 135 miles north of Riyadh just after the marriage contract was signed by the father and the groom .
Lawyer Abdullar Jtili said : " The judge has dismissed the plea , filed by the mother , because she does not have the right to file such a case , and ordered that the plea should be filed by the girl herself when she reaches puberty . "
Grooms take part in a mass wedding ceremony in Riyadh in June .
Governor of Riyadh Prince Salman and a local group organized a mass wedding for about 1600 couples to help people unable to afford expensive ceremonies
" She does n't know yet that she has been married , " Jtili said then of the girl who was about to begin her fourth year at primary school .
Relatives who did not wish to be named said that the marriage had not yet been consummated , and that the girl continued to live with her mother .
They said that the father had set a verbal condition by which the marriage is not consummated for another 10 years , when the girl turns 18 .
The father had agreed to marry off his daughter for an advance dowry of £ 5,000 , as he was apparently facing financial problems , they said .
The father was in court and he remained adamant in favour of the marriage , they added .
Mr Jtili said he was going to appeal the verdict at the court of cassation , the supreme court in the ultra - conservative kingdom which applies Islamic Sharia law in its courts .
Arranged marriages involving pre-adolescents are occasionally reported in the
Arabian Peninsula , including in Saudi Arabia where the strict conservative Wahabi version of Sunni Islam holds sway and polygamy is common .
In Yemen in April , another girl aged eight was granted a divorce after her unemployed father forced her to marry a man of 28 .
Before we get started tonight , a quick word of warning : Tonight ’s ISB has what your local cable provider would refer to as “ Adult Themes ” ( and not the good kind ) , and since I know there are at least a couple of you out there reading while you ought to be working , this might not be the time .
In fact , considering that it ’s a review of an issue of Tarot you might want to skip it altogether and save yourself some suffering .
Seriously , guys :
This one ’s gonna get bad .
Why not check out Dave Campbell ’s new site instead , and then head back here later .
In the meantime , please enjoy this picture of ROM : Spaceknight fighting a bear , and I ’ll meet the rest of you after the cut :
Still with me ?
Okay , but do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
Tarot : Witch of the Black Rose # 53 is the worst comic book I own .
It ’s tempting to say that it ’s the worst comic I ’ve ever read , but let ’s be honest here :
It might be in the running , but I read three issues of Rob Liefeld ’s Youngblood and that Jeph Loeb Buffy comic just last month , so it ’s up against some stern competition on that front .
Still , when you look at something like Youngblood , you get the idea that Rob Liefeld just could n’t do any better .
Maybe , if he was n’t hampered by his ( considerable ) lack of skill as an artist and ( even more considerable ) lack of skill as a writer , he could ’ve done a better job getting what was in his head onto the page , and maybe–however unlikely –it would ’ve been a tiny bit better .
With Tarot , though , there ’s a basic level of craftsmanshp that makes it hard to imagine that what you get is anything but exactly what Jim Balent wanted it to be .
It ’s his exact vision , laid out on the page .
He actually meant this to happen .
Point being :
This is a very bad comic book .
So bad , in fact , that I ’ve actually gotten requests from readers to review it , presumably because they enjoy seeing me suffer .
But trust me–and I know I ’ve said this before–it is the worst issue of Tarot so far .
Every time it comes out , I ’m convinced that it just ca n’t get any worse and I ’ve always been wrong , but man , there is no way he can top this one .
To start with , Tarot–whose latest exploits involve being out - dueled by her male counterpart , who is so good that he ’s able to cut her clothes off during the swordfight , which of course arouses her to no end–is n’t even in this issue .
Instead , the focus is on third - stringer Crypt Chick , whose major claim to fame is that she ’s the only recurring female character in the series–up to and including Tarot ’s mom–who has n’t appeared naked .
This may have something to do with the fact that she ’s a ghost , which would make her clothes ectoplasm or … something .
Do n’t ask me to understand the mind of Jim Balent , folks , I just read ’em .
I did n’t build the fucking thing .
In any case , she ’s Tarot ’s boyfriend ’s ex-girlfriend , their relationship having hit something of a snag when she dies in the car accident that gives Jon his alleged “ super - power ” of being able to talk to ghosts , which in turn led him to become The Skeleton Man : The Worst Super - Hero Ever .
And she ’s nominally the star of the issue , although this being Tarot–a book lauded by its fans as being “ female empowering ” that had a recent story arc where its main character was bound and literally milked so that a bad guy could steal her witchity power and eat it on toast–her contributions to the plot are mostly standing around , being duped by the bad guys , and acting as transportation .
Another victory for the Sisterhood !
The story–such as it is–gets started when Crypt Chick summons Jon to a suitably spooky crossroads so that he can have a sit - down discussion with a haint of ghosts that CC describes as “ evil . ”
See , she has this feeling , but hey , who among us has n’t had the urge to send our exes to a gang of poltergeists ?
Thus , we meet the bad guys :
It ’s the night staff of SuicideGirls™ Memorial Hospital !
And pay attention to the one just to the right of center .
I hate to say it but … she ’ll be important later .
Shockingly enough , these are n’t the discarnate spirits of a bunch of strippers .
They are , in fact , a group of nurses –which means that that ’s what Jim Balent thinks nurses look like –who died in an accident when they were carpooling to work , and subsequently had various body parts removed by unscrupulous doctors and used for plastic surgery .
In a better horror book , like Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service , this is an idea that might have some legs to it , but , well , this is Tarot , and the only legs you ’re going to find here are going to be covered up in tattered stockings and be as far from something resembling plot as possible .
But back to the nurses :
They are , of course , Back For Revenge , but in case you were one of Tarot ‘s slower readers , Balent goes so far as to spell it right out for you , down to giving the address of the intended targets :
Why do they give him the addresses ?
Because the story needs
Jon to know where to go to keep the plot lumbering along , and having Jon actually , you know , do some detective work or show any signs whatsoever of being competent would take precious time and pages away from the mind - numbingly awful horrorporn .
Thus , the Nurses trundle off into the night and Crypt Chick performs her primary plot function by flying Jon after them in what could best be described as tepid pursuit .
A few pages later , she drops him straight down out of the sky at one of the addresses , which makes him crashing through the window sideways in the next panel a pretty mean feat .
But let ’s be honest :
At this point , violations of the laws of physics are the least of our worries .
After all , when Jon gets to scene of the crime , he finds that the ghost has ripped poor Janice ’s lips off , and it ’s revealed that the ghost nurses bleed constantly from wherever their harvested parts are now .
Janice had a collagen injection in her lips , and Samantha underwent “ vaginal reconstructive surgery , ” and that ’s why the one I pointed out above is wandering through the afterlife constantly bleeding from her ghostly vagina ( PLEASE DO NOT CLICK ON THAT LINK ) .
So now it ’s a race to get to Samantha in time , and while I ’m pretty firm in my belief that this is one of the worst comic books I ’ve ever read , I honestly can’t decide if what happens next is the worst piece of dialogue in comics history … or the best :
You Have To Get Out Of Here .
YOUR VAGINA IS HAUNTED .
I gotta admit , folks :
For the first time , I am legitimately envious of Jim Balent as a writer .
I mean , I like to think of myself as a pretty creative guy and I ’ve come up with a couple of wacky premises in my time , but man .
A Haunted Vagina ?!
You could lock me in a room with nothing to do but come up with the weirdest plots I could imagine , and not in a year would I come up with a man fighting a haunted vagina .
And even more , it makes no sense :
If her vagina is haunted , where does she have to get out of ?!
Where is she going to go to escape her own ghost - riddled nether - bits ?
And yet , it is beautiful in its purity .
It is , in two sentences , everything that Tarot : Witch of the Black Rose is about .
It ’s why I read the book .
Because every now and then , it gets so bad , so unrelentingly stupid , that is somehow loops back around to become brilliant for eleven words .
You have to get out of here .
Your vagina is haunted .
Amazing .
Sadly , the brief transcendence to nirvana does n’t hold , and a couple of pages later , it all comes crashing down with a thunderous noise not unlike the death of all joy .
Shortly after Jon ’s warning , the ghost nurses show up , and after smacking him around for a few panels , including a kick to the face that even I could n’t enjoy , the ghost nurses turn their attention to the increasingly useless Crypt Chick , just in time for one of Tarot ‘s more ludicrous affectations to show up : Self - censorship .
This more than anything just blows my mind .
I mean , what , seriously ?!
You ca n’t say “ fuck ” in Tarot ?!
You can have a dead fetish nurse wandering around with a bloody cameltoe , but you ca n’t say “ fuck ? ! ” I mean , what the hell , man , are you worried that it might offend somebody ?!
I just .. I can ’t …
What the ..
arrrgghh
Sorry , it ’s just …
Man .
That shit does n’t make a bit of sense .
Anyway , Crypt Chick and the Nurses :
To keep her from interfering , since she can actually touch them while Jon just waves his arms like the ineffectual lump he is , they start to drain her …
Hell , I do n’t know .
It ’s not “ life force , ” I guess , because she ’s dead , but they somehow make her… more dead ?
Death Force , maybe ?
Whatever , I do n’t care anymore :
They do something that starts to turn her into a skeleton instead of a fetish model , and while Jon ’s distracted by their shennanigans , they stab him and then use a scalpel to … remove the woman ’s vagina .
And this , for the record , is the worst part of the book –which would put it in the running to be the worst part of any comic ever , held in check only by Jeph Loeb ’s dialogue –because of the sound effect .
And what ’s the sound effect of vagina removal ?
Of course it is .
So , having proven at this point to be completely unable to stop his enemies , Jon resolves to try to stop his enemies in their future efforts as well .
But unfortunately –for him , not us–it does n’t look like he ’s going to get the chance :
Because they wo n’t tell him where they ’re going .
Once again , folks , The Skeleton Man : the super - hero who ca n’t fight crime unless crime phones ahead to let him know where it ’s going to be .
Thus , nothing whatsoever is accomplished beyond the eye - searing pain of the alleged plot , and as always , we ’re left with more questions than answers .
Why focus the story on characters who never do anything useful ?
Why did they bother to give out the full street addresses of their victims in the first place ?
Why do some ghosts have the ability to make another ghost more dead ?
Why do they go after the women who got the surgeries , and not the crooked doctors who harvested their organs ?
Why “ f*ck ? ! ”
Why ?!
Because this is a terrible , terrible comic book on every conceivable level , that ’s why .
But if we can learn one thing from it , it is this :
You have to get out of here .
Your vagina is haunted .

ANDERSON COOPER 360 DEGREES
At Least 10 Killed in Midwest Tornadoes ; Mad Cow Disease in United States ; Police Announce DNA Match in New York City Murder Case
Aired March 13 , 2006 - 22:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening again , everyone .
This weekend , of course , police say they made a major break in the case of Imette St. Guillen .
We will be covering that in the hour ahead with some new details about the murder investigation , including how police say they used the suspect 's cell phone to place him near the scene of the crime .
It 's a type of tracking called pinging .
We will tell you more about it ahead .
We are also going to take a look at the case from a very different angle .
It 's about the media 's obsession with crime stories where the victims are a certain type of woman .
We begin , however , tonight with the start of tornado season , a deadly and punishing start , by the looks of it , at least 10 people dead , hundreds of homes destroyed -- new tornadoes reported tonight in Alabama , and as many as 113 twisters reported yesterday in Arkansas , Kansas , Missouri , and Oklahoma , as well as Illinois , where we find CNN's David Mattingly .
He 's coming to us tonight from Springfield , after getting a tornado 's - eye view of the destruction -- David .
DAVID MATTINGLY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , about the only way to really get a perspective on the path of this storm was to retrace the steps of one of Sunday 's most destructive tornadoes .
And , needless to say , it was quite an eye - opener .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
MATTINGLY ( voice - over ) : People on the ground describe the moment the tornado hit their homes as an explosion .
And , viewing the aftermath from the air , that 's exactly what it looks like .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I have never seen a -- just a line of trees completely uprooted and laid on their sides .
MATTINGLY : Veteran Missouri pilot Clark Thomas ( ph ) is our guide to an area outside of a small town of Renick , where a tornado blasted through homes , killing four people .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Yes , a very strong storm , very isolated .
MATTINGLY : The damage and the violence it represents is jarring .
Homes were torn in thousands of pieces .
An old school bus was rolled upside - down , and a row of old hardwood trees was pulled it by its roots .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
Well , this tornado just stayed on the ground , apparently , for miles .
MATTINGLY : The scattered debris seems endless .
Ponds filled up with pieces of lumber and siding , tree lines and fences wrapped with sheet metal .
But the tornado did n't stop here .
Turning to the northeast , we find much more .
( on camera ) :
As we follow this storm 's path , it is so easy to see where this tornado was heading .
It was almost in a straight line , going for miles .
At times , the path of destruction is more than several football fields across .
And , at its worst points , there 's not a single tree that was not left shredded , not a single building that was n't left in pieces .
( voice - over ) : Six miles into the vast farming country , insulation fills the treetops .
Ten miles out , another home is destroyed -- fifteen miles , to the town of Middle Grove , more of the same .
The winds from this tornado left little standing , and this is one early spring storm that will be remembered for some time .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
MATTINGLY : Ultimately , the path of destruction after that particular tornado ended after 20 long miles , Anderson .
And , all the time , we were thinking how much worse this could have been , if this had not been such a sparsely - populated area .
COOPER : And -- and , David , where -- in terms of the weather there now , how are things ?
MATTINGLY : Very windy , and the temperature 's dropping quite a bit , something you would expect after a big cold front like that coming through , but no severe weather to report tonight .
COOPER : All right , David Mattingly , thank you very much .
On to another kind of storm , and , sadly , another record -- wildfires covering more territory , nearly three - quarters - of - a- million acres in Oklahoma and Texas , than anyone has ever seen .
Reporting for us tonight from a very hot corner of Texas , CNN's Ed Lavandera .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ED LAVANDERA , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) :
The west Texas wildfires have scorched so much land , that it 's like watching more than half of Rhode Island burn .
The charred terrain stretches as far as the eye can see .
Even weathered firefighters are amazed .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Biggest one I have ever seen .
LAVANDERA : Battling the blaze in the remote , rugged terrain of the Texas Panhandle can be a lonely job .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
It 's coming up over the hill , coming right at me .
LAVANDERA : Wade Bruce ( ph ) and a small group of firefighters are working along a ridge on the northern edge of Miami , a speck of a town along Highway 60 .
These men are all that stand between the town and the fire .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
We come up here and tried to stop it right here , because if it hops over this canyon , and it goes down into the bottom , we can't fight it , until it gets to the bottom .
And , by that time , you 're pretty much in Miami .
LAVANDERA : Just in case , some residents have set sprinklers on rooftops .
The high winds can instantly ignite a flame .
( on camera ) :
We 're standing on top of a ridge here .
And , all of a sudden , we started hearing the crackling sound of a flame that just erupted from down there .
You can't even see the flames anymore through the smoke .
But this is something that firefighters are concerned about at this very moment , because these fires , with the wind blowing behind it and coming uphill , they say that this is exactly the kind of situation that can really make these fires move very quickly .
( voice - over ) :
The firefighters extinguish these outbreaks , but the threat is not over .
These fires have a mind of their own .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
It 's hard to fight , because it branches off so much that you do n't know which way to go .
LAVANDERA :
The wildfires fanned over a 1,000 - square - mile section of the Panhandle that stretches from close to the Oklahoma state line , down past Interstate 40 .
Seven people have died .
Almost 2,000 people in seven counties had to be evacuated .
Some local officials suspect a spark from a power line might have started one of the fires , but there is still no official cause .
Wade Bruce ( ph ) and these firefighters have beat back the flames , and the small town of Miami is still standing .
But he 's not convinced the battle is over .
So , he waits for the fire to try again .
Ed Lavandera , CNN , Miami , Texas .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Well , now to another developing story .
And it 's disturbing , especially when you first hear about it , the return of mad cow disease to the U.S. Today , it surfaced in America 's South .
Now , mad cow has already seriously hurt the meat industry .
Tonight , no hype , just facts -- what you need to know about this disease .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) COOPER ( voice - over ) :
It started with the telltale signs , a beef cow from a herd in Alabama struggling to stand and walk , like the cow seen here .
The cow was destroyed .
And , today , the USDA announced , a tissue sample tested positive for mad cow disease .
State officials acted quickly to calm fears .
RON SPARKS , COMMISSIONER , ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE :
There is no threat to human health .
This particular animal has been disposed of , and it did not enter the food chain in Alabama or this country in any way .
COOPER : Here 's what else we know about the animal .
The U.S. Agriculture Department says it was at least 10 years old and on the Alabama farm for roughly a year .
What they have to determine now is where the cow was born and raised .
This is the third animal in the United States to test positive for mad cow in the last 27 months .
In December 2003 , a dairy cow brought from Canada to Washington state was found to have mad cow .
And , in June 2005 , a cow in Texas also tested positive .
Mad cow is a fatal brain disease that spreads from tainted cattle feed to cattle .
And , in rare occasions , it can infect and kill humans .
Worldwide , as many as 150 people have died from eating mad cow - tainted meat products .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Only about 650,000 of the nation 's estimated 95 million cattle have actually been tested for mad cow .
But officials say , there is no reason to worry .
And , tonight , we wanted to separate fear from fact , so we talked earlier with 360 M.D. Sanjay Gupta .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : So , Sanjay , the third case of mad cow in the United States , how concerned should someone at home be ?
DR . SANJAY GUPTA , CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT :
Well , you know , the short answer is probably not concerned at all , really , Anderson .
It 's -- it 's kind of interesting .
On one hand , we used to say , here in the United States , mad cow disease was a disease of other countries , did n't worry about it .
But after December of 2003 , we had three cases in three years now .
So , I think people are -- their -- their guard is up , for sure .
But , as far as the basic idea of -- of worrying about what you eat , worrying about your meat , there really is no concern at all , because this animal could not and did not get into the food supply chain .
COOPER : How is mad cow disease transferred to humans , if at all ?
GUPTA : Well , you know , what 's interesting is that the -- this is a disease of prions .
The -- it 's not a virus ; it 's not a bacteria .
Mad cow disease is actually called by something known as a prion .
And that actually exists mainly in the nervous system , either in the brain or the spinal cord .
So , you know , here in the United States , we do n't typically eat that sort of food as part of the overall meat .
But , in many countries , they do , or it 's part of the feed that they feed to other animals .
Since ' 97 , we -- there has been a ban on that sort of feed , so that animals should n't eat that .
And we , as humans , do n't eat that either .
So , it 's really unlikely that we would get it at all .
COOPER : So , people eating meat should not be concerned ?
GUPTA : No .
You know , eating regular meat , you 're probably not going to come in contact with these prions , this -- this -- these disease - containing particles .
And , if you cook it using a meat thermometer , it should kill off whatever infectious agents there are anyway , so , really , really very little concern .
There has never been a case of the human form of mad cow disease , known as CJD -- there has never been a case of it in this country .
COOPER : How does someone know if they do have mad cow disease ?
GUPTA : You know , that 's the interesting thing , Anderson .
It can be about 10 to 15 years before you would actually develop any symptoms from -- from the human form of mad cow disease .
So , it 's really hard to go back and try and figure out where it came from .
And you probably can't remember what you had for dinner last night , let alone 10 to 15 years ago .
So , it would be very unusual .
But the same sort of symptoms occur in the humans .
You could have some confusion .
You could have some difficulties with walking , that sort of thing -- but a very , very rare disease , for sure .
COOPER : Well , this is a certainly blow to -- to the export of meat overseas .
I know a lot of people are concerned about that .
But , certainly , for people at home , good to hear that it really wo n't have much of an impact .
Sanjay , thanks .
GUPTA : Thank you .

COOPER : Tonight , a New York man is suspected of committing one of the most brutal murders in recent memory -- coming up , a look at the case against the bouncer - turned - murder - suspect Darryl Littlejohn .
And we will talk to his attorney .
Also , police on the case have their eyes on something just about all of us now carry around .
It has made it a lot easier for the police to find us .
That 's good , if they 're tracking a wanted criminal , but , otherwise , well , you can decide for yourself .
Also tonight , a war that began with smart bombs is being fought now with the dumbest bombs at all , homemade explosive pieces that have killed hundreds of American troops -- a report on the cheap , easy way to make reliable , fatal IEDs , and their damage in Iraq .
This is 360 .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
COOPER : One in a trillion , those are the odds , according to the New York police commission , that DNA and traces of blood on a set of plastic ties do not belong to Darryl Littlejohn .
The ties were used to bind the hands of Imette St. Guillen , who was raped and murdered and dumped along a local highway .
Mr. Littlejohn is the prime suspect in her murder .
A grand jury is hearing the evidence against him -- sources telling us it could hand up indictments by week 's end .
We 're going to hear from Darryl Littlejohn 's attorney and his neighbors in just a moment .
First , CNN's Rick Sanchez brings us up to speed in the case .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
RAYMOND KELLY , NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER : Littlejohn is the prime suspect in this case .
RICK SANCHEZ , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : Two weeks after the murder of Imette St. Guillen , New York City police now say they have their man , this man , 41 - year - old Darryl Littlejohn .
It all started here , at The Falls bar in SoHo , in the early - morning hours of February 25 .
It was closing time , 4:00 a.m. Littlejohn told police he saw Imette leave the bar on her own .
A week later , though , police say the bar 's manager admitted , he asked Littlejohn to escort Imette out .
( on camera ) :
And now , for the very first time , police are saying they know of people who were here in this general vicinity and saw Imette leaving with Littlejohn about 4:00 in the morning .
KELLY : Well , there are witnesses that put the victim in the company of Mr. Littlejohn when she left the bar that evening .
SANCHEZ ( voice - over ) : Police are investigating to see whether Littlejohn brought Imette here , to his home in Queens .
They have searched the house and carried out countless bags of possible evidence .
How much physical evidence is there ?
Experts close to the case say they may have only scratched the surface .
DR . LAWRENCE KOBILINSKY , FORENSIC SCIENTIST , JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE :
We have the sock that was forced down Imette 's throat .
We have the carpet fibers that are present on the tape that covers Imette 's mouth .
We have shoelaces that were , presumably , handled by the assailant .
There may be other trace evidence , perhaps in the form of saliva or semen , on or in the body that really has not been revealed as yet .
SANCHEZ : Police also confiscated this van , which was parked near Littlejohn 's house .
They say it may have been used to transport Imette 's body to the place where she was found just one day after she left The Falls .
( on camera ) :
That 's the Brooklyn Bridge , which leads you to the very place where Imette 's body was found .
Did Littlejohn end up in that same area where they found her body on the same night they found her body ?
Police are saying they suspect yes , and the reason they say so is , they have traced his cell phone .
KELLY : There is evidence , telephone evidence , telephone records that put the -- the telephone that Mr. Littlejohn had in his possession in the vicinity , the immediate vicinity , of where the -- the body was located , and also a route to that location .
SANCHEZ : But the most damaging evidence so far , according to police , involves Littlejohn 's own blood and one of these .
This is a plastic tie that 's often use by police as a makeshift handcuff .
Police are saying the murderer used one of these to tie Imette 's hands behind her back .
KELLY : Darryl Littlejohn 's blood was found on plastic ties that we use to bind Imette 's hands behind her back .
And a DNA match to Littlejohn was made .
KOBILINSKY :
When you get a match , it is not a maybe .
It is not a guess , perhaps one in 100 people would have such a -- a genetic profile .
No , it 's one in trillions .
This is an absolute identification .
There is no question that that blood on the plastic tie is from Mr. Littlejohn .
SANCHEZ ( voice - over ) : Long odds , and odds that may only get worse for Darryl Littlejohn , if more of the evidence now being tested in police labs ties him even more closely to Imette St. Guillen 's murder .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Rick , how did police know to go to The Falls right away ?
SANCHEZ : That 's an interesting question .
What police usually do in cases like this , as in the case with missing persons , is , they try and find out what record that person may have left behind .
In this case , we understand they did a track of her credit cards .
The last place that she made a purchase with a credit card was The Falls bar you see right there behind me .
They came to The Falls .
They started asking questions .
Unfortunately , some of the questions that they had asked did n't get answered , at least correctly , until four or five days , which is something , by the way , that has police here in New York extremely frustrated to this very moment -- Anderson .
COOPER : All right , Rick Sanchez , thanks very much , reporting for us from New York tonight .
More on the St. Guillen murder investigation coming up , including an interview with the suspect 's attorney .
First , Erica Hill from Headline News has some of the other top stories -- Erica .
ERICA HILL , HEADLINE NEWS CORRESPONDENT : Hey , Anderson .
Good to see you tonight .
We are starting off with a big shift in U.S. military operations in Afghanistan .
The mission to bring civil order there is now being shifted to a multinational force under NATO 's command .
And it 's going to mark the first time , actually , since World War II that U.S. troops are under foreign command in a combat situation .
Still , the U.S. here is expected to operate a separate counterinsurgency force in the country , hunting for Taliban and al Qaeda operatives .
Meantime , a stunner today in the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui , the suspected al Qaeda conspirator -- Moussaoui now facing the death penalty , after pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy .
But here is what happened today .
The judge , citing government misconduct , may actually now put the trial on hold and could rule out that death penalty entirely .
We are going to have more on this coming up for you tonight on 360 .
And wait until you hear the numbers on this one .
This is a wild story -- Sweetwater , Texas , holding the world 's largest rattlesnake roundup over the weekend .
Since 1958 , the roundup has brought in more than 130 tons of the reptiles .
And get this .
Researchers say the roundup only pulls in about 1 percent of the state 's western diamondback population .
The other 99 percent , oh , just out there looking for you , looking ...
COOPER : Well , you know ...
HILL : ... looking for ...
( CROSSTALK )
COOPER : ... actually , as a kid , I desperately wanted to go to the -- the rattlesnake roundup in Sweetwater , Texas .
HILL : Really ?
COOPER : Yes , I really did .
I used to collect snakes as a kid .
But I can see your rattlesnake roundup ...
HILL : Really ?
COOPER : ... and raise you a wrestling bear -- a man wrestling a bear .
Yes .
It ...
( CROSSTALK )
HILL : Why would any man in his right mind wrestle a bear , Anderson ?
COOPER : Well , it -- it -- it 's a 650 - pound black bear .
It 's -- it's an Ohio state wrestling champ wrestling the bear at the 69th annual Cleveland Sport , Travel and Outdoor Show .
It happened this weekend , apparently .
Do n't know who won , nor do I really care .
But there 's the video .
HILL : You just like the -- it is good video .
So ...
( LAUGHTER )
HILL : All right , you win that one .
But we 're not done yet .
COOPER : All right .
Remember , do n't try that at home , Erica Hill .
( LAUGHTER )
COOPER : We have got a lot rougher tough when we come back , unfortunately -- more on the bouncer - turned - murder - suspect Darryl Littlejohn , a career criminal .
The question is , does he really fit the profile of a killer ?
An expert weighs in .
And we will also talk with his attorney .
Plus , how they track their suspects ' movements and how they could track your movements -- they , of course , the government .
New technology makes it almost impossible for anyone with a cell phone to hide .
Chances are , you 're walking around with that cell phone that could track you -- when 360 returns .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
KELLY : Littlejohn is the prime suspect in this case .
And his indictment will be sought for the murder of Imette St. Guillen .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
COOPER : That was Police Commissioner Ray Kelly yesterday .
Now , thanks to the -- his very thick police record , a lot of things are known about the man suspected in the murder of Imette St. Guillen .
One thing is n't known , not yet , anyway .
If the accusations are true -- and it is a big if -- what would have turned the kind of criminal he was into the murderer he is now accused of being ?
CNN 's Randi Kaye looks into it .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
RANDI KAYE , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : Darryl Littlejohn is a career criminal , seven felony convictions , five prison stints for armed robbery , assault , drug dealing , weapons possession .
But missing from his record is sexual assault and murder .
So , if he killed Imette St. Guillen , what could have turned him into a killer ?
Why her and why now ?
Criminal profiler James Fox .
JAMES FOX , CRIMINAL PROFILER , NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY :
If a man is a -- is confronted with a woman who is inebriated , he may view her differently .
That devalues her , in his eyes .
He may feel , that is an excuse , a -- an invitation for him to do things that he would n't do .
KAYE : Still , how could this man , who says he 's innocent , and whose aunt describes him as gentle ...
ADDIE HARRIS , AUNT OF DARRYL LITTLEJOHN :
He has never displayed any violence , not in -- to me , not in my presence .
KAYE : ... make the leap from convicted felon out on parole to the front page of a police blotter ?
Neighbors describe Littlejohn as quiet , a loaner , often dressed in fatigues and black SWAT team uniforms .
NORMA SANDY , NEIGHBOR OF DARRYL LITTLEJOHN : Just normal , just normal -- look like somebody that work out , and that 's it , just normal .
KAYE : But violent criminals often have two personalities .
FOX : With friends and families , they 're loving , and kind , and generous .
But with people who are strangers , they 're very different .
Those people do n't matter .
People are very able to compartmentalize the world .
They -- they act one way to the -- to those who matter to them .
And , to everyone else , well , they 're expendable .
KAYE : Could it be that St. Guillen was expendable in Littlejohn 's eyes ?
Fox says , the most dangerous thing about career criminals is how well they blend in , how ordinary they appear .
Take the infamous BTK killer from Wichita , Kansas , a family man and church president who killed 10 people .
And what about John Wayne Gacy ?
He entertained children dressed as a clown , but killed at least 30 people , burying most of them beneath his house .
FOX : Part of their succession is their image , the facade of being someone who 's very safe and -- and -- and not violent .
You never suspect them .
Their victims certainly do n't .
KAYE : So , what happened the night St. Guillen died ?
If Littlejohn killed her , did he simply snap ?
FOX : Well , this is not a matter of someone who snaps .
These tend to be fairly well - planned .
KAYE : If it turns out he did do this , could it be , she was n't the first ?
FOX : First - timers tend to be rather tentative and not that comfortable with killing .
But , when you see this tremendous amount of -- of sadism and -- and barbarism , a victim who is raped in every way possible , someone who 's tied up , someone whose hair is caught off , and who perhaps is tortured , that suggests someone who is so comfortable with what they 're doing , that they have done it before .
KAYE : There is no doubt she died a brutal death , suffocating underneath the plastic , tortured at the hands of a violent attacker , raped and mutilated by someone
Fox calls a sexual sadist .
FOX : Someone who is very much obsessed with power and control .
And when he 's taking life , taking a human life , it 's not just a matter of -- of killing them , because that can be done easily with a gunshot .
It 's making them suffer , enjoying the whole experience of seeing their victims beg and plead and feel pain and suffering .
It 's not enough to kill .
It 's to feel like you hold life and death in your hands .
KAYE : Perhaps that need , that power , was the force that led to St. Guillen 's death .
Randi Kaye , CNN , New York .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Kevin O'Donnell joins us now .
He is Darryl Littlejohn 's attorney .
Thanks for being with us .
First of all , you talked to your client today .
How is he ?
KEVIN O'DONNELL , ATTORNEY FOR DARRYL LITTLEJOHN :
He is very concerned about the new allegations , Anderson .
His concern is that he 's not being treated fairly .
He has had the same concern since the beginning of the case , where he was implicated in the murder .
COOPER : He -- he thinks he 's being railroaded by the system and also by the media ?
O'DONNELL : He 's definitely being railroaded by the media , but the cause of that are the police leaks .
COOPER : And you 're saying the police are selectively leaking damning information , leaving out other things ?
O'DONNELL : Well , I -- I believe so .
We 're not hearing anything about when they strip - searched him .
From what I heard , there was blood found on these handcuffs .
The police did search him .
They strip - searched him .
And they strip -- strip - searched -- strip - searched everybody else in the bar , but they did n't find any cut whatsoever on Mr. Littlejohn .
COOPER : But the -- the police now have said -- I mean , you heard Ray Kelly say that , you know , there 's a trillion - to - one chance that the blood on these -- these cuffs is not Darryl Littlejohn's , that -- that -- that , by all statistical measurements , that is his blood on these cuffs .
How can you defend against that ?
O'DONNELL : Well , I heard that , too , Anderson , but the timing of that release concerns me .
First of all , why did it take two weeks to come to that conclusion ?
What were they doing for those two weeks ?
I would guess that one of the first items that they looked at to examine for DNA would have been those flex cuffs .
COOPER : So , you 're saying they could have had the DNA evidence faster ?
O'DONNELL : They should have had it .
The -- I -- it 's my understanding that that result could come back in 24 hours .
Now , what I want to know is where the evidence was taken , who took it , what was done with it once it was taken , who examined it .
What 's the chain of custody ?
Did it need to be retested ?
If it did , why did it need to be retested ?
COOPER : So , you 're going to be looking at things like chain of custody ?
You 're going to be basically putting the police department on trial ?
O'DONNELL : No .
I 'm going to enforce any client 's right .
This is about due process .
And because of all of these leaks by the media -- leaks into the media by the police department , my client 's right to a fair trial has been violated .
COOPER : It -- it 's not your client 's obligation , or your obligation , to prove your client 's innocence .
It is the prosecution 's obligation to -- to prove you 're client 's guilt .
Does your client have an -- an alibi for -- for the time frame that Imette St. Guillen was missing and then found ?
O'DONNELL : No , I 'm not going to get into any kind of a defense right now , Anderson .
There 's a 30,000 - member police force that are gathering evidence against my client .
And there 's only one person representing him .
And that 's me .
And my job is to defend him , and question the evidence , and put the people to their burden of proving his case beyond a reasonable doubt .
And I am going to treat this case like I treat every other case .
I 'm ...
COOPER : Why are you taking this case ?
I mean , you -- this is not -- this -- you were court - appointed for this police lineup last week .
You did n't have to take this case .
O'DONNELL : No .
It was my choice .
But I believe , as an officer of the court and as a -- as a defense attorney , that people who are charged , especially people who are in financial situations like my client , deserve proper representation .
And I believe I can give him that .
COOPER : What is he like ?
I mean , what kind of guy is he ?
O'DONNELL : Believe it or not , Anderson , our conversations have been incredibly cordial .
He 's been very cooperative with us .
He understands that right now I 'm the person that 's between him and the entire country that 's portrayed him to be a monster .
Now , I can understand why people are saying that he 's a career criminal .
His record speaks for itself .
However , to me , he 's my client .
COOPER : And to you it is significant that in his past criminal behavior , which there is plenty of , there is not a killing , there 's not a violence against women ?
To you that 's very significant ?
O'DONNELL : He 's never been accused of as much as pushing a woman .
And that is significant .
I think it 's unusual for somebody with this type of modus operandi to start at the age of 42 to go from robberies and drug -- drug - related convictions all of a sudden to violence against women .
COOPER : You 've taken on the case .
Your life is going to change , I 'm sure , a lot for the next couple months .
I appreciate you joining us .
Thanks very much , Kevin O'Donnell .
O'DONNELL : My pleasure .
COOPER : How might this case play out in court ?
Coming up , a panel of legal experts and a forensic scientist weigh in on the legal troubles that Darryl Littlejohn is facing and perhaps the police department is facing as well .
Later , the cat - and - mouse battle between bomb makers in Iraq and the troops who are trying to make it home in one piece .

( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
COOPER : Well , as it stands tonight , a grand jury is hearing evidence against Darryl Littlejohn in the abduction , rape and murder of Imette St. Guillen .
Now , we 've already heard about the DNA testing that police say links him to his crime , and we 've heard his attorneys answer to it .
With us now , forensic science Lawrence Kobilinsky of John Jay College of Criminal Justice , right here in New York where Ms. St. Guillen was studying , also Court TV's Lisa Bloom , and Jami Floyd , as well , from Court TV .
Good to see all of you .
Lisa , let me start with you .
Does a DNA match make this an ironclad case for the prosecution ?
LISA BLOOM , COURT TV ANCHOR :
It may , Anderson .
I think it 's certainly enough to charge him at this point .
It reminds me of the David Westerfield case .
He was the man who was convicted and sentenced to death for the abduction , rape and murder of little Danielle Van Dam several years ago .
And it was one drop of her blood on his jacket that really did him in .
He never had an explanation for it .
It 's powerful evidence , Anderson , because it 's not just Littlejohn 's blood on her .
It 's on the plastic ties that were around her .
There does n't seem to be an explanation , an innocent explanation for that .
COOPER : Well , that according to the police department .
You now heard -- Jami , you 've heard Mr. O'Donnell saying he 's going to be questioning the chain of evidence , why it took so long to get this evidence , where this evidence may have been laying for this last week or two .
How damaging is that blood on the ties for the defense ?
JAMI FLOYD , COURT TV ANCHOR : I think -- I think , of course , any defense attorney realizes that this is a bit of a setback , but I think the presumption of innocence is as strong today as it was on Friday .
We are talking a small amount of blood .
There is a possible innocent explanation , and that is that Mr. Littlejohn worked in the bar where the ties , police say , originated .
So he may have had access to those ties at some other point in time .
And that 's before you even get to the questions of chain of custody , why so long before we heard about this blood .
And then even if the police are to be thought honest , which I know Ray Kelly and I think he's an upstanding citizen and a wonderful commissioner , but there 's always the possibility that analysis was done improperly .
The DNA analysis is only as good as the person who is conducting that analysis .
And we know that there are hundreds of cases in this country , Anderson , that are now being called into question because of faulty DNA analysis .
COOPER : Professor Kobilinsky ?
LAWRENCE KOBILINSKY , JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE :
You know , if you see me squirming here , it 's listening to this .
This is nonsense .
The DNA is a critical piece of evidence .
It is the -- it is the gold standard of forensic science .
And , in fact , in rape cases and in homicide cases , this kind of evidence alone will not only get an indictment , it will get a conviction .
COOPER : But is it possible that -- you know , you have talked about the skin underneath the fingernails at this point being inconclusive .
If it is -- remains inconclusive , and there are more extensive tests that could be done , does that sort of put some reasonable doubt in there ?
KOBILINSKY : Not at all .
I think when they do further testing , they will determine whether there is male DNA present and whether it is Mr. Littlejohn's , or maybe it 's somebody else .
We still have n't ruled out whether or not there is another person involved here .
But let 's face it , there 's a lot of evidence that 's not just the DNA on the ties .
There 's the sock , there 's the shoe laces , there 's the seats that have been removed from the Windstar .
There 's a whole bunch of physical evidence that we have n't heard about yet because it 's just too early in the investigation .
COOPER : Lisa , what about this ?
I mean , we have heard an awful lot about this investigation .
I assume the leaks are coming from the police department or the -- you know , the prosecutor 's office .
How hard is it going to be to find an untainted jury pool ?
BLOOM : Well , that assumes that the only good juror is an ignorant juror , completely ignorant of the facts .
And I do n't believe that .
I think there 's nothing wrong with jurors knowing some of the facts of what 's going on .
And jurors take an oath , and generally I think they uphold it , and I do n't think it 's going to be a problem .
But I want to add to what Dr. Kobilinsky said .
By the way , we had fibers from his carpet that were under the tape on her face .
FLOYD : No , that 's not accurate .
BLOOM : We have his cell phone records ...
FLOYD : That 's not accurate , Lisa .
BLOOM : ... near the home .
I mean , we have a mountain of evidence at this point .
And now we have the DNA that 's really the clincher .
COOPER : Jami , you 're saying that 's not accurate ?
FLOYD : We do not have fibers .
This has been repeatedly misreported .
We do not have fibers from his carpet on the tape that was on her body .
We have fibers consistent with what was on her body .
And that is very different .
COOPER : And you 're saying -- you 're saying it 's a very common form of carpet ?
FLOYD : Indeed .
BLOOM : Well , it 's a red carpet .
He 's got red carpet .
And he confirmed that .
FLOYD : But to say that we have ...
BLOOM : Yes , there 's one in a couple thousand chance that it might be somebody else 's .
It 's not as good as ...
FLOYD : There are other ...
BLOOM : And again , you 've got to put it all together , Anderson .
It 's like a puzzle .
FLOYD : Lisa , there are other explanations .
There are consensual relations that may have happened .
I think everybody is rushing to judgment .
BLOOM : With a red carpet , the same color as his ?
I mean , what are the odds of that and the DNA and the cell phone , they 're just all false ?
( CROSSTALK )
COOPER : Jami , go ahead .
FLOYD : Perhaps with him , Lisa .
We do n't know precisely what went on that night .
The only person who knows is this horrible perpetrator .
And of course we want to find the right perpetrator .
We do n't want to rush to judgment on the wrong perpetrator , while , indeed , as Dr. Kobilinsky suggests , someone else who participated may be out there .
COOPER : Jami , do you think it 's fair that all these leaks are coming out ?
I mean , how easy is it to find an unbiased juror when you -- you know , you read the front page of any paper in New York and you see this man 's mug shot and , you know , it is very hard to -- to -- to resist forming an opinion about this case ?
I mean , on this show we do n't believe in -- you know , we believe in presenting facts , and I 'm not forming an opinion about this man 's guilt or innocence .
How hard do you think it is going to be to find a jury ?
FLOYD : I think it 's going to be incredibly difficult .
And I agree , this program and some others have gone out of the way to be unbiased , but when you see the man 's face every day on the front of the tabloids -- and it's not just in this -- in this city , of course .
It 's been across the state and across the country .
So even a change of venue to another part of New York may not correct the problem .
And this is a continued problem in this country when we prosecute people in the press .
COOPER : Dr. Kobilinsky , just very briefly , Mr. O'Donnell , the attorney for Littlejohn , said he was suspicious about why it took two weeks to get the blood evidence .
KOBILINSKY : Well , he should n't be .
The actual testing does n't take that long .
It 's a matter of a couple of days .
However , there 's a huge pile of paperwork that has to be done .
It 's part of quality control , quality assurance .
You 've got to dot the I 's and cross the Ts .
It 's a lot of work .
There 's a huge amount of effort , and believe me , two weeks is short .
We have n't seen even the beginning of it yet .
COOPER : Dr. Kobilinsky , always good to have you on .
Jami Floyd , as well .
And Lisa Bloom , as well .
Thanks very much .
BLOOM : Thank you .
COOPER : Looking at the story from many different angles tonight .
Still more on how police say they connected Darryl Littlejohn to the crime .
You probably did n't know about this , using his cell phone .
It 's called pinging .
We 're going to explain how it works .
The cell phone does n't actually have to be in use .
And later , a very strange affair .
A man who once had the president 's ear now accused of shoplifting on a major league scale .
You 're watching 360 .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
COOPER : So to indict Darryl Littlejohn for the murder of Imette St. Guillen , prosecutors must establish probable cause .
And to do that in this case they need the evidence that puts him at the crime scene .
And it 's not just the forensics they 'll be looking at .
They 'll also use his cell phone , even if he was n't using it .
It 's a process called pinging .
CNN 's Daniel Sieberg explains .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
DANIEL SIEBERG , CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT
( voice over ) : Consider your cell phone your own personal tracking device , like it or not .
BRUCE SCHNEIER , SECURITY EXPERT , COUNTERPANE :
The cell phone network is tracking you whenever your phone is on .
Whether there 's a human being receiving some data saying where your phone is you have no idea because the phone company has that data and it's what they 're doing with it afterwards .
SIEBERG : Authorities must have a court 's permission to track anyone through cell phone locations , but once that access is granted , it 's nearly foolproof .
( on camera ) :
So how exactly does it work ?
Well , here 's the easiest way to think of cell phone tracking .
In order to make or receive a call on your cell phone , your wireless provider has to know where you are .
You see this flashing little light up here ?
You can think of that as your personal locator beacon .
In a sense , it 's communicating with the cell towers that are all around you all the time as you move around .
And they can find you a few different ways .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
The cell phone always has to know what cell it 's in .
Otherwise , it can't send phone calls .
Your average phone when it 's walking around is in view of two or three different cells .
And what the phone company can do , and this is very easy , is to compare relative signal strengths and figure out where the phone is probably to a couple hundred feet .
They triangulate from the radio signal .
The third thing is satellite positioning system .
And phones that are equipped with that system can be pinpointed within a few feet .
SIEBERG ( voice over ) :
It 's that ability to be so exact that 's made it such an invaluable tool for law enforcement .
Following last year 's failed suicide bombings in London , British investigators used cell phone tracking to find a suspect who fled to Italy .
LARRY KING , HOST , " LARRY KING LIVE " : Simpson , the passenger in the car , has a gun at his head .
SIEBERG : It was used to track O.J. Simpson 's car phone while he was avoiding police along the L.A. freeways .
And it was even used as far back as 1993 , when police shot and killed drug lord Pablo Escobar in Colombia .
But as productive as cell phone tracking can be , privacy advocates are concerned about how all this data is accessed .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I think there 's a substantial worry that location information about cell phone users is being released without a court order .
This is actually an open legal controversy .
SIEBERG ( on camera ) :
If you do n't like the idea of being tracked with your cell phone , well , you really only have a few choices .
If you use Verizon or Sprint phones , in some cases you can set the GPS chip so it only works when you use 911 .
If you use Cingular or T- Mobile , you 're out of luck because they use the triangulation system .

COOPER : Well , in Iraq , a deadly type of technology is making headlines .
In one sense , the U.S. war there has become a war against IEDs , improvised explosive devices .
Tonight , a look at the new effort to beat the insurgents ' weapon of choice , the single biggest killer of the U.S. troops .

COOPER : Well , the war that began with smart bombs three years ago this week is now being fought with homemade dumb bombs , IEDs , improvised explosive devices .
Now , these things have done a lot of damage , and they 've hurt the presidential approval ratings as well .
Take a look at the new numbers .
In the latest CNN - " USA - Today " - Gallup poll , only 36 percent of those asked thought that President Bush was doing a good job .
His lowest number ever , 60 percent , disapprove of the way he 's handling things .
And where the war itself is concerned , it 's about the same .
Thirty - eight percent of those polled think it is going well .
Sixty percent think it 's going poorly .
The president addressed his Iraq problem head on today and the problem of IEDs .

BARBARA STARR , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT
( voice over ) :
Three years ago when the war in Iraq began , it was a phrase most Americans never heard of -- IED , improvised explosive device .
Now these roadside bombs are the largest single killer of U.S. troops in Iraq .
More than 930 troops have died , more than 9,600 wounded .
President Bush says there are signs of progress .
BUSH : Today , nearly half the IEDs in Iraq are found and disabled before they can be detonated .
In the past 18 months , we 've cut the casualty rate per IED attack in half .
STARR : But Iraqis are suffering as well .
In just 11 days at the end of February , there were 40 vehicle - borne IEDs causing 290 casualties .
IED attacks are on the rise , officials confirm , but they wo n't give exact numbers due to security concerns .
The Pentagon is spending more than $ 3 billion a year developing classified technologies to detect IEDs .
Some systems already are in Iraq .
The Buffalo armored vehicle uses a front claw to find roadside bombs .
Robots are used to detonate devices .
And electronic jammers keep IEDs from exploding .
But in this lethal game , insurgents constantly are changing tactics , improvising with everything from washing machine timers to garage door openers as detonators , and adjusting to U.S. efforts all the time .
( on camera ) : President Bush said just one news article about new IED detection technology was so quickly read by insurgents that just five days later they posted measures on the Internet on how to counter the U.S. effort .

The BBC came under fire today after celebrity lesbian couple Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson were the subject of " gratuitously sexist and homophobic remarks " in an end - of - year show .
The Most Annoying People Of 2008 , screened on BBC3 on December 29 , put the couple 43rd on the list of the year 's 100 most irritating public figures .
Interviewed for the programme , former porn star Ron Jeremy described in some detail the sex acts he wanted to perform with Lohan and Ronson , while BBC Radio 5 Live presenter DJ Spoony said " hot and fit " women should be saved for straight men .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called on the BBC to say sorry and said the DJ should be suspended from his show until he apologises for the remarks .
" The remarks by BBC Radio 5 presenter DJ Spoony and straight US porn actor Ron Jeremy were gratuitously sexist and homophobic , " Mr Tatchell said .
" The BBC should have never broadcast them .
A public apology is due from the BBC .
" DJ Spoony should be suspended by the BBC and be allowed to resume presenting his Radio 5 programme only after he has apologised on air and promised not to repeat his homophobic garbage . "
The show is due to be repeated on BBC3 tomorrow night , and is available to view on the iPlayer .
Mr Tatchell said Spoony and Jeremy 's remarks should be bleeped out for the repeat .
Actress Lohan , 22 , and 31 - year - old DJ Ronson - the sister of music producer Mark - announced they were an item earlier this year after months of press speculation about their relationship .
Of lesbians , Spoony said : " Let the munters and mingers get each other - that 's cool because no - one really wants them .
" But when they 're hot and fit and Hollywood superstars , they should be saved for guys - not me , but other guys . "
Jeremy , 55 , said he would like to have a threesome with the couple and even described ejaculating over them .

" Those two girls are both very good - looking , so I would love to be in the middle of that , " he said .
" They would do each other , do me , do each other , back and forth , then I do a pop and it 's over .
" The polite thing to do is to pop on both of them . "
Mr Tatchell said : " Ron Jeremy 's comments were needlessly offensive .
They added nothing to the programme and should have been edited out .
" He 's ugly , sexist and arrogant .
No self - respecting woman , lesbian or straight , would want to have sex with him or even spend a minute in his company . "
The BBC refused to apologise for the remarks , but issued a statement which read : " Most Annoying People 2008 is a light - hearted and comedic look at people and events that have annoyed , amused or appalled us over the last 12 months .
" The contributors to the programme are expressing their own views and opinions which are meant in a light - hearted way with no malicious intent . "
The BBC was fiercely criticised late last year after Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left a series of obscene messages on Andrew Sachs 's answering machine during a recording of Brand 's radio show .
The two presenters said Brand had slept with the 78 - year - old Fawlty Towers actor 's granddaughter , Georgina Baillie , 23 , and joked that Sachs might kill himself .
In the furore that followed the broadcast , Brand and two senior Radio 2 executives resigned and Ross was suspended without pay for 12 weeks .
The BBC Trust , the corporation 's governing body , said there had been major failures of editorial judgment by senior managers .
BBC management said in the wake of the scandal that extra care would be taken to stick to editorial guidelines in future .
Sir David Attenborough has revealed that he receives hate mail from viewers for failing to credit God in his documentaries .
In an interview with this week 's Radio Times about his latest documentary , on Charles Darwin and natural selection , the broadcaster said : " They tell me to burn in hell and good riddance . "
Telling the magazine that he was asked why he did not give " credit " to God , Attenborough added : " They always mean beautiful things like hummingbirds .
I always reply by saying that I think of a little child in east Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball .
The worm cannot live in any other way , except by burrowing through eyeballs .
I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator . "
Attenborough went further in his opposition to creationism , saying it was " terrible " when it was taught alongside evolution as an alternative perspective .
" It 's like saying that two and two equals four , but if you wish to believe it , it could also be five ...
Evolution is not a theory ; it is a fact , every bit as much as the historical fact that William the Conqueror landed in 1066 . "
Attenborough , who attended the Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester in the 1930s , said he was astonished at manifestations of Christian faith .
" It never really occurred to me to believe in God - and I had nothing to rebel against , my parents told me nothing whatsoever .
But I do remember looking at my headmaster delivering a sermon , a classicist , extremely clever ... and thinking , he can't really believe all that , can he ?
How incredible ! "
In 2002 , Attenborough joined an effort by clerics and scientists to oppose the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum of state - funded independent schools receiving private sponsorship , such as the Emmanuel Schools Foundation .
I saw a great presentation yesterday by Patrick Dubroy , who presented some preliminary results from his research on how people use tabs in the real world .
[ UPDATED : You can now read Patrick ’s whole presentation on his blog . ]
The sample size was small ( 22 people ) so we should be cautious about any conclusions we draw from this study , but it ’s pretty exciting to have any real scientific data at all on this question ( as opposed to anecdotes , personal observations , etc . )
The study also points in some exciting directions for further research .
The big thing I took away from Patrick ’s presentation was that among heavy web users , tabs are enabling new styles of browsing behavior that rely less on bookmarking and less on the back button .
According to Patrick , the back button is getting used less and less as the years go by , and for all but two of his test subjects , switching tabs was a more common action than hitting “ back ” .
This change seems to coincide with the rise of web applications , where a user might spend a long time interacting with data on a single page .
Web applications live comfortably in tabs ( I always keep gmail open in my leftmost tab , for instance ) but did tabbed browsers help popularize web applications , or did web applications help popularize tabbed browsing , or neither ?
One anecdote from the presentation really stuck with me : apparently some users love opening multiple links in separate tabs , but they use a laborious manual workaround to do so , because they do n’t know about command ( or control ) - clicking a link to open it in a new tab .
This tells me that the feature needs to be more discoverable somehow .
Ever since the original Wang attacks on MD5 in 2005 it's been clear that certificates were the most attractive target .
Today , Sotirov , Stevens , Appelbaum , Lenstra , Molnar , Osvik , and de Weger report ( slides writeup ) on an attack against a real CA , in this case RapidSSL .
Background
In order to understand what 's going on , we first need to recall some basic facts about how certificates work A certificate is a digitally signed assertion of the binding between a name and a public key .
The data to be signed is as follows ( I 'm simplifying a bit )
version
The version number ( 2 ) serialNumber
The unique certificate serial number issuer
The name of the CA issuing the certificate validity
The time period when the certificate is valid subject
The name of the entity to which the certificate was issued .
subjectPublicKeyInfo
The entity 's public key .
extensions Arbitrary extensions
In order to make a certificate , this data gets serialized using an annoying encoding and then the entire mess is hashed and then the resulting hash is digitally signed by the CA .
The problem we have here is that the hash , in this case MD5 , is weak .
More precisely , it 's possible to generate a collision : two inputs that hash to the same output .
( See here for more background on attacks on hash functions . )
We 've known for years how to exploit this kind of attack .
The basic idea is that the attacker prepares two documents , one " good " and one " bad " that hash to the same value .
He then gets the signer to sign the " good " variant and then cuts and pastes the signature onto the " bad " variant , thus producing a valid signature on the bad document .
So , the way you would use this to attack certificates is that you would generate a " good " certificate signing request that would result in a certificate that had the same hash as a " bad " certificate you had generated locally .
You get the CA to sign the request and then substitute the bad certificate .
Until now there were two major obstacles to using this technique to attack certificates :
It was n't clear that the serialNumber field was predictable .
field was predictable .
The techniques for generating collisions were n't very good : they were n't that controllable ( they generated a lot of random - appearing data ) and were slow ; or rather there were techniques for generating fast collisions but they were n't at all controllable .
The relevance of the serialNumber is this : unlike the name and the public key , the serialNumber and validity are generated by the CA .
So , you need to know in advance what they will be in order to generate the appropriate colliding " bad " certificate .
The validity is typically just generated as something like a year or two from the time of issue , so it 's relatively predictable .
The CA has a lot of freedom in how to generate the serial number .
If it 's truly a sequence number , it 's quite predictable .
However , if it 's randomly generated , then it can be made arbitrarily unpredictable , which effectively blocks this kind of collision attack .
When MD5 collisions were first discovered , the two standard recommendations were ( 1 ) stop using MD5 and ( 2 ) generate random serial numbers .
This Attack
Which brings us to this new work , which involves two main contributions .
First , the authors improved their collision finding techniques so they need a lot less random - appearing data .
The second is that they found a CA which still used MD5 and does n't randomize the sequence number .
Taken together , this allowed them to convince the CA to sign a certificate which was in itself valid but which collided with a certificate that the CA would never have signed , in this case a certificate for a new , subordinate CA .
( It could just as well have been a certificate for a specific target web site , but that 's less flashy than a CA certificate . )
Once in possession of this new CA certificate , it 's possible for the authors to sign arbitrary new certificates which will be trusted by anyone who trusted the original CA [ subject to some technical limitations which I wo n't go into here . ]
Effectively , the authors have made themselves a CA .
There are some interesting technical hacks needed to make this work : although the serial number is somewhat predictable , it 's not completely so , and in order to mount the attack they had to guess the serial number in advance .
This guess is n't totally accurate , but they were then able to issue their own CSRs to increment the serial number to where they needed it to be .
Impact
The impact of this is that the authors could in principle mount man - in - the - middle or other impersonation attacks on any Web server provided that the client trusted this particular CA ( most do ) .
The existence of this certificate does n't allow anybody else to mount impersonation attacks , since ordinary attackers wo n't have the corresponding private key ( unless they break into the authors machine and recover it , of course ) .
The authors have taken some steps to make the particular certificate they issued less useful for this purpose .
In particular , it has a time way in the past , so unless your clock is way off , you should notice this attack .
That 's not to say that there 's no risk here , since you might not notice the expiration date issue .
Of course , it 's possible that an attacker could independently use the same technique to acquire their own CA certificate .
In fact , we do n't know for a fact that nobody already has .
The only real obstacle is that the crypto needed here is fairly involved and the experts on it are mostly respected academics , many of whom are on this paper .
So , the sooner that CAs adopt the mitigations mentioned above , the better .
I should mention that this is n't the only way to get a bogus certificate : many CAs do n't do a particularly good job of user verification in any case ( I 'll be posting about one particular exceptional such case shortly ) .
In particular , it 's common to use " email confirmation " for identity verification , where the CA sends email to the administrator of the relevant machine to verify the certificate request .
There are probably a number of cases in which it 's easier to attack that than to build up a whole certificate collision infrastructure .
Containment
There are really two questions about how to contain this vulnerability :
What should we do about this specific certificate ?
What should be done about the class of vulnerability ?
The two basic options for this certificate are to ignore it ( assume we trust the researchers , especially since the certificate is expired ) or to blacklist it .
The way that the blacklist would work is that the browser manufacturers would just issue a security update with a patch to the certificate validation code telling it not to trust this specific certificate , just as they would patch any other security vulnerability .
For perspective , we can think of this as a vulnerability with an exploit that is known only to the researchers — even though we have the CA cert , we can't use it productively , and it 's not likely to be reproducible .
If I were in charge of a browser , which I 'm not , I would probably issue a patch with a blacklist for this certificate .
Others opinions may vary ; as far as I know , the browser manufacturers did n't issue mandatory security updates blacklisting all the Debian OpenSSL keys , so that may be a cue to their general attitude .
The second question is what to do about this class of vulnerability .
Because this attack only can be mounted against a live CA , not against an old certificate , it 's very important that the affected CAs either stop using MD5 , use randomized serial numbers , or both .
Presumably , the news coverage will act as an inducement for them to do so .
I 've also heard suggestions that the browser manufacturers should disable MD5 .
There are probably still enough MD5 - using servers out there that this would be problematic , though it 's something to consider for the future .
Bottom Line
As usual , do n't panic .
In its current state , this is more of a demonstration of a hole than a serious hole .
Countermeasures are readily available to the CAs and if the remaining CAs fix their practices fast enough , then it 's unlikely that there will be any more bad certificates issued ( it takes some time to spin up your infrastructure for this attack ) .
Even if one or two such certificates are issued — even to bad guys — it 's not the end of the world .
Once they 're detected they can be blacklisted .
This takes a long time with the current patching rate , but it 's not conceptually any worse than a remotely exploitable problem with your browser , or a bug in certificate validation logic , both of which have been known to happen .
That said , it is very important that the CAs do fix their practices , since this has the potential to become serious if the capability to mount the attack becomes widespread and convenient .

This is the P1 - E , a new British electric sports car created by former McLaren designer Jim Dowle .
The two - seat P1 - E is a development of a petrol - powered model first revealed at the beginning of last year .
It ’s inspired by the Lancia Stratos and Lotus Exige , but gets Mercedes SLR - style doors .
This new electric version of the P1 is powered by lithium - ion batteries , will reach 60 mph in a claimed 2.9sec and will have a limited top speed of 130 m ph .
The body will be made of lightweight composite panels over a carbonfibre and aluminium tub .
The whole car will weigh 1055kg and have a range of 230 miles .
Dowle wants to place the emphasis of his new car on its handling .
“ A big part is to produce something people want to drive , ” he said .
“ We hope it will raise the bar for electric vehicles . ”
The P1 - E will use a four - wheel - drive system to harness the 590lb ft of torque developed by the electric motors at either end of the chassis , with combined output for the twin motors expected to be 290 kW ( 389 bhp ) .
Dowle and his company JJAD already face considerable opposition from other electric sports car manufacturers such as Fisker and Tesla .
Production of the P1 - E is still more than two years away , during which time Dowle believes technology will develop to allow the company to take the upper hand over its rivals .
“ Tesla is a good benchmark , but the technology is moving fast .
Our car will be more advanced than the Tesla , ” said Dowle .
The company plans to develop three prototypes over the next few years , and believes close attention to detail will prevent them from running into the financial difficulties that many small - volume manufacturers face .
“ We ’ve budgeted for everything , ” said Dowle , “ right down to the cleaner ’s wages . ”
JJAD plans to build around 500 models of the £ 55 k P1 - E per year when it goes into production in 2012 .

Oh Nom Nom Nom !
After posting all the bacon recipes over the last week I decided to go out and make one of my very own to see if I could come up with a concoction nearly as disgusting as the bacon roll or the Ultra Bacon Whopper while simultaneously maintaining tastiness .
I would like to let you know that I succeeded on all fronts .
After hitting up our local Safeway , the total cost of the ingredients to build this legend was $ 65 .
Well worth every penny .
Ladies and gentlemen , I introduce to you what I like to call the Poutine 2.0 .
( Known as the Carny Casserole on this is why you 're fat ) This made three massive servingsI 'm not going to tell you how to cook all the ingredients as they are all simple things to make .
But cook them all individually and have 3 disposable large casserole dishes ready to go , and have your oven pre-heated to 450 F for the final baking .

Wait !
There is more !

I 'm trying to get Netflix to acquire some of their products .
The Institute screens their films in scheduled sessions around the country , and some have been distributed on a grand scale .
The movies are excellent .
Film is a fantastic medium for the transmittal of ideas , good or bad ; and Big - Government exponents are good at exploiting it .
We need to sharpen up our drama skills to take advantage of this medium ( and get a sense of humor while we 're at it ) .
Economics used to be called " political economy , " and for good reason .
You can't have economics without politics , and you can't have politics without economics .
They go hand in hand , sometimes to our detriment if we do n't watch out .

As the Democrats in Congress methodically plot against the Second Amendment , the Supreme Court works in unison against the Fourth Amendment .
On January 14 , the Court ruled that evidence obtained through illegal searches may be used to prosecute criminal defendants .
The Supremes rule against the Fourth Amendment .
According to Mark Sherman of the Associated Press , the justices split 5 - 4 along “ ideological lines . ”
In other words , the ideology of the majority of the Supreme Court is apparently arrayed against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Chief Justice John Roberts , Justices Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas rule against the exclusionary rule , which requires evidence to be suppressed if it results from a violation of a suspect ’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches or seizure .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , David Souter and John Paul Stevens dissented .
Bader Ginsburg said the ruling leaves the suspect in the case , Bennie Dean Herring of Alabama who was illegally convicted on drug and weapon charges , “ and others like him , with no remedy for violations of their constitutional rights . ”
“ The most serious impact of the court ’s holding will be on innocent persons wrongfully arrested based on erroneous information carelessly maintained in a computer database , ” wrote Ginsberg .
The “ ideological ” majority focused on the “ societal costs of excluding drugs and other evidence seized , ” according to USA Today .
In other words , the social bias of Supreme Court “ conservatives ” against drugs trumps protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment .
By ruling against the exclusionary rule , the Supremes have rolled American law back to a time before 1789 when English law did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the Fourth Amendment , in part a reaction against English law including the general warrant and the writs of assistance .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In a related development , the so - called federal intelligence court , in a “ rare public opinion , ” according to Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times , “ is expected to issue a major ruling validating the power of the president and Congress to wiretap international phone calls and intercept e-mail messages without a court order , even when Americans ’ private communications may be involved ” ( emphasis added ) .
Put another way , the illegal secret court , established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act of 1978 , may soon have carte blanche and unsupervised power to monitor the communications of all Americans , an effort underway for some time now .
“ The appeals court is expected to uphold a secret ruling issued last year by the intelligence court that it oversees , known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance , or FISA , court .
In that initial opinion , the secret court found that Congress had acted within its authority in August of 2007 when it passed a hotly debated law known as the Protect America Act , which gave the executive branch broad power to eavesdrop on international communications , according to the person familiar with the ruling , ” Lichtblau writes .
The so - called “ Protect America Act ” allows for massive , untargeted collection of communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts .
“ The misnamed Protect America Act allows the US government to monitor telephone calls and other electronic communications of American citizens without a warrant .
This clearly violates the Fourth Amendment , ” Ron Paul said on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30 , 2008 .

GALVESTON , Tex . ( AP )  Galveston police and firefighters ’ unions have agreed to take a 3 percent pay cut to help the city avoid layoffs and save $ 600,000 , according to a report in The Houston Chronicle .
The move comes as a result of Hurricane Ike , which hit shore near Galveston on Sept. 13 , killing at least 37 people in Texas .
Flooding from the hurricane devastated homes and businesses in the city .
The city manager , Steve LeBlanc , predicted that the losses would cause a 30 percent decrease in property tax values and a 10 percent drop in sales tax revenue .
To combat that budget shortage , city leaders proposed an across - the - board 3 percent pay reduction to generate the $ 600,000 savings .
About 40 percent of the 880 - member municipal work force  police and firefighters  belong to unions that had to vote on whether to give up raises they were given in October .

Do you sometimes find yourself wishing that there was a place you could go to just watch music videos ?
Back in the 80s , MTV served that purpose .
These days , MTV and its sibling MTV2 are hardly channels anyone would watch in order to get a music video fix .
MTV is looking to redeem itself in the music video department , however , by launching a new site Tuesday called MTV Music that opens up the company 's massive video archive and puts it on the web for free .
MTV Music expands upon the music video offerings already posted to MTV.com by offering an entire back catalogue of videos that go all the way to when music videos were born .
The library includes more than 16,000 videos , sprinkled with " exclusive " MTV concert footage and MTV " Unplugged " performances that used to be all the rage .
And that 's just the beginning .
According to a blog post on MTV's Splash Page , more videos are being added by the day , so even if your favorite Paula Abdul selections have n't been posted yet , they probably will make it up eventually .
In addition to the consumer - facing side of MTV Music , the company has also launched an API that allows developers to build applications that make use of MTV Networks Content .
The examples provided include creating a video gallery , a MySpace or Facebook app to send music video dedications to friends , the " music application of your dreams " made up of your favorite videos , or a blog plug - in to pull in various videos .
MTV Music may not seem like a big deal to some , but it 's pretty major when you consider what 's going on behind the scenes .
YouTube originally stated in 2006 that its goal was to host " every single music video ever created " — an ambitious goal that the company hoped to accomplish within 6 to 18 months .
That obviously has n't happened , quite yet , and now MTV Music is way ahead of YouTube in the music video department .
Ice burn .
Why has n't YouTube caught up , even with a two - plus year head start ?
MTV is owned by Viacom , the company that filed a $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube for " brazen " copyright infringement in 2007 ( the suit is still pending ) .
Among other things , Viacom wanted to have full control over any of its content that gets posted — something that YouTube could not provide .
MTV Music is also differentiating itself from YouTube by being light on the ads .
All 16,000 + videos lack any form of advertising except for banner ads at the top of the page , while Google is currently testing video ads on some of its videos in order to monetize the massive ( and otherwise un- monetizable ) amount of content on the site .
Like YouTube , MTV Music allows users to not only watch videos on the site , but to also leave comment , give ratings , and embed the videos on their blogs or personal websites .

Advertisement A senior Hamas leader has been killed by an Israeli air strike on his home in the Gaza Strip , Hamas officials say .
Nizar Rayyan , the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since 2004 , had urged suicide attacks against Israel .
News of the strike came on the sixth day of Israeli strikes on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip .
Palestinian medical sources say 402 people have been killed .
Israel says it is trying to prevent militants from firing rockets into southern Israel .
Mr Rayyan is the most senior Hamas leader to be killed since the death of Abdel Aziz al - Rantissi in April 2004 .
Long reach of Israel Since its bombing campaign began last Saturday , Israel has attacked Hamas fighters and commanders .
Sites linked to Hamas have also been hit , including smuggling tunnels under the border to Egypt , government buildings and security compounds .
Map : Gaza and Israel violence
In pictures : Gaza conflict
Aid worker diary : Part five Obituary : Nizar Rayyan Hamas considered Mr Rayyan to be a political leader , but he often wore a military uniform and was close to the group 's armed wing .
Until now , political leaders have not been killed .
The BBC's Mike Sergeant , in Jerusalem , says this may further strengthen the determination of Hamas to resist the Israeli air assault .
But it will also be seen as an indication that the Israeli military can target key members of the Hamas leadership - the people Israel says are responsible for the rockets being fired towards Israeli towns , our correspondent adds .
Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rockets fired into Israel since Saturday .
Humanitarian warning On Wednesday , Mr Rayyan had promised that Hamas would hit Israel " even deeper " than it has so far .
On the Hamas - run al - Aqsa television channel , he said Hamas militants were preparing for any Israeli ground incursion , saying " we will kill the enemy and take hostages " .
Israeli planes and helicopters have bombed Gaza for six days
At least nine other people , some said to be members of Mr Rayyan 's family , were also killed in the air raid on his home in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip .
The deaths come as the main UN agency operating in Gaza , Unwra , has resumed food deliveries , but warned of a dire humanitarian situation in the territory .
The UN says at least 25 % of the 402 Palestinians killed were civilians ; Palestinian medical officials say more than 2,000 people have been injured .
Israel is refusing entry to Gaza for international journalists and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone " , leading to speculation a ground offensive into the tiny coastal strip could be imminent .
' Truce violated ' Both Israel and Hamas have ignored international calls for a ceasefire .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said there was no need for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds as more lorries containing aid were entering Gaza than before the conflict began last Saturday .
Speaking in Paris after talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , she said Hamas had used the previous six - month truce , which ended mid-December , to re-arm .

" Another thing which is important to understand is that Israel accepted a truce a few months ago that was initiated by Egypt , but during the few months of the truce Hamas violated the truce , and they used it in order to get missiles with a longer range . "
Hamas has said Israel must stop bombarding Gaza and lift its blockade of the territory before it will consider a ceasefire .
Mr Sarkozy is travelling to the Middle East next week in an attempt to find a way to end the crisis .
A draft UN resolution put forward by Egypt and Libya failed after the US and UK complained that it called on Israel to ends its air assaults but made no mention of Hamas rocket attacks against Israel , which they say started the latest hostilities .
For the current violence to end , Israel needs to show that it has stopped the rocket fire , says the BBC's Middle East Editor , Jeremy Bowen .
But if Hamas can still resist , its leaders will feel they can claim victory .
Hamas believes that its fighters who are launching rockets into Israel are taking part in legitimate resistance against an occupier , he adds .

Race as a Military Propaganda Theme
By SGM Herbert A. Friedman ( Ret . )
Note : The Willa Cather Foundation has requested and received permission to use images from this article in an exhibition entitled “ Telling War Stories : the Rhetoric of the Great War . ”
During wartime psychological operations , propagandists often search for powerfully emotional themes and vulnerable groups within the enemy military and civilian populations .
In other words , they search for a weakness in the enemy society that allows them to exploit and divide their forces .
American society has always carried with it the weakness of an early slave culture .
Although in theory slavery has not existed since Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 ( and that did not free all the slaves regardless of what is widely believed ) , a form of racism has continued to exist in the United States just as it does in many other countries around the globe .
The most visible and extreme example of American racism is the lynching of a black individual .
Although I would question the accuracy of any numbers in regard to lynching , one that has been posted is 3,345 blacks killed between 1882 and 1968 .
Whites were sometimes lynched too .
It is believed that there were 4,732 recorded lynchings between 1882 and 1951 , although there were certainly many undocumented lynchings before and during that period .
Most of the recorded lynchings occurred before 1930 .
The vast majority of lynchings took place in the South and the Border States , although lynchings were not unknown in the North and Midwest .
About three - fourths of the victims were black .
During WWI , Germany did not produce many propaganda leaflets and those that were produced were disseminated very late in the war .
This rare WWI leaflet is addressed to American " Coloured " soldiers and promises them a nice heated room and plenty of food in the warm south of Germany if they surrender or are captured .
During WWII , The United States Army gradually integrated black soldiers into its forces .
A word on terminology .
I have lived long enough to have seen the use of " negro , " " colored , " " black , " and " Afro - American " to identify people of African descent .
In this article I will use the term " black " for simplicity .
With the introduction of black American soldiers onto the battlefield , the Axis powers saw the opportunity for a propaganda campaign .
Earlier they had attacked the French because of their treatment of their Colonial Arab forces and the British for their treatment of their colonial Indian troops .
This German image from the newspaper Illustrated Observer depicts a French Army officer sending a black colonial troop to the front while a Jew who might be Maxim Maximovitch Litvinov , Russian ambassador to the United States from November 1941 to August 1943 slyly hides behind him .
The Germans bitterly attacked the French use of black troops in the Rhine and other occupied territories after World War I .
In fact , they complained so often and so loudly that an American Senator Hitchcock from Nebraska is quoted in the N.Y .
Times of 31 August 1922 charging atrocities by French Negro troops against German women and others in the occupied portion of Germany .
He said in part : I hold in my hand a printed circular called " The Horror of the Rhine . "
It purports to be a complaint of the German people living in the German territory occupied by French troops ...
It is charged that the black African troops of France , whether Negro or Senegalese , were committing unspeakable crimes against German women and children .
So , just as the Germans had successfully attacked French black troops , they would now attack the American treatment of its own black population in an attempt to turn the minority soldiers against their officers and nation was an easy choice .
In general , most of the Axis leaflets told the black soldiers that their own people were being attacked in the United States and pointed out that their white officers did not trust them and they were treated far differently from white troops .
Curiously , the Germans had their own history of murdering minorities such as Jews and Gypsies , so this anti-American propaganda was doomed to failure from the start .
In fact , Adolf Hitler had made some prejudicial remarks himself , complaining during the 1936 Olympic Games according to Albert Speer , his armaments minister : ... He was highly annoyed by the series of triumphs by the marvelous colored American runner , Jesse Owens .
People whose antecedents came from the jungle were primitive , Hitler said with a shrug ; their physiques were stronger than those of civilized whites and hence should be excluded from future games .
What is odd is that at the same time the Germans were asking blacks to surrender because of their poor treatment in the American Army , they were pointing out to American soldiers that their black troops were thieves and murderers .
One very well - known leaflet shows a black man raping a white woman .
Hitler 's Italian Allies depicted American blacks as savages and in one very famous image pictured a black soldier selling the Venus de Milo with a $ 2 price tag .
So , as we will now show , the Axis played both sides of the divide and conquer argument , telling both blacks and whites that the other was exploiting them .
Rick Atkinson discusses American blacks in WWII in The Day of Battle : The War in Sicily and Italy , 1943 - 1944 , Macmillon , 2007 : When War II began in September 1939 fewer than 4000 blacks served in the U.S. Army ; more than two years later the U.S. Navy had only six black sailors - excluding mess stewards .
At the time of the Anzio landings ( May 1944 ) , the U.S. Army had 633,000 officers , of whom only 4,500 were black .
The U.S. Navy was worse , with 82,000 black enlisted sailors and no black officers ; the Marine Corps which had rejected all black enlistments until President Roosevelt intervened , would not commission its first black officer until several months after the war ended ... ... blacks were shunted into quartermaster companies for duties such as truck drivers , bakers , launderers , laborers and the like .
By January 1944 , 775,000 blacks wore Army uniforms - they made up 8.5 percent of the force , but only two in ten served in combat units compared to four in ten whites ....
The 92nd Infantry would arrive in Italy in late summer 1944 as the only African - American division to see combat in Europe .
U.S. Fifth Army combat artist Edward Reep briefly mentions the German use of race in their propaganda in A Combat Artist in World War II , University Press of Kentucky ; 1987 : The German propagandists turned out predictably consistent pornography and outright lies in an attempt to terrorize Allied soldiers to turn one against another ... The German leaflets were suffused with sex , bigotry and deceit ; all Allied leaders were corrupt Jews , notably politicians and bankers ;
Negroes at home were sleeping with our sweethearts and wives while we were engaged in a useless , futile war where we would die in battle ...
A reader might wonder why there are so few leaflets using race as a theme .
I would tender a guess that the most reasonable answer is that the Axis powers simply did not run into that many blacks on the battlefield .
It was not until February 1948 that President Harry Truman told Congress that he had : ... instructed the Secretary of Defense to take steps to have the remaining instances of discrimination in the armed services eliminated as rapidly as possible .
In July 1948 , President Truman signed Executive Order 9981 , which stated :
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race , color , religion , or national origin .
The movement toward full integration was slow but steady .
It was July 1951 before the Army announced that the integration of all its units in Korea , Japan and Okinawa would be completed within six months .
In October 1953 the U.S. Army announced that 95 % of African - American soldiers were serving in integrated units .
Today the armed forces of the United States are fully integrated .
GERMANY ANTI - BLACK German Leaflet AW 36 is in the form of a see - through card .
When you first look at it you just see some strange shapes and a dead body at the bottom .
When held to the light , you suddenly see a black man raping a white woman .
The cards were produced by the German Propaganda Company in Paris in July 1944 .
There were over a half - dozen of these AW leaflets , but only the above item depicted a black man .
This October 1944 uncoded German leaflet depicts black soldiers dying at the front while civilian blacks drink and dance .
The text is :
The Draft - dodgers on the home front expect every Joe to do his duty
We should point out that an almost identical anti-Semitic leaflet was also produced by the Germans in January 1945 that was entitled :
The Kikes expect every Joe to do his duty .
GERMANY ANTI - WHITE
One of the most interesting German leaflets depicts a fleeing black man being chased by a pipe - wielding hooligan .
The code " AI " indicates that the leaflet was prepared by the SS - Standarte " Kurt Eggers " for Allied troops fighting in Italy .
Text on the front is : Race War Fleeing Negro , who is already hurt , is chased by Detroit mobsters .
Lead pipe ( center ) was later used in finishing him off .
Text on the back points out that the blacks are being used as cannon fodder and they get the lousiest jobs and the lousiest pay and the contempt of all the whites in the U.S.A.
ALL MEN are created free and equal Yes , that is what the declaration of Independence says .
Well , it 's just Ballyhoo , always was .
The white bosses want your peace - loving , hard - working colored boys just as CANNON FODDER In World War I they promised your father 's racial equality as a reward for fighting the war .
What did they get ?
What did you get ?
The lousiest jobs .
The lousiest flats .
The lousiest pay .
The lousiest chances .
Poverty , Unemployment , Race , Riots , Lynching , Hanging and Burning ! and The general contempt of all Whites in the U.S.A. RICH ( WHITE ) MAN'S WAR POOR ( COLORED ) MAN'S FIGHT
RICH ( WHITE ) MAN'S WAR
POOR ( COLORED ) MAN'S FIGHT Leaflet AI - 128-10 - 44 was produced by the Sudstern section of the SS - Standare Kurt Eggers organization and aimed at American black soldiers in Italy .
The all - text leaflet tells the story of colored workers in Philadelphia who were hired to work on the subways and trolley cars , but were unable to work because white workers went on strike and refused to instruct them .
Some of the text is :
Think of your loved ones at home who are praying to the Lord every day that he may send you home uninjured .
What good is it to you when a shell tears you to pieces or leaves you bleeding to death ?
There is only one way of returning home safe and sound .
COME OVER TO US !
The above leaflet has the same title and is in the same all - text format .
It tells the story of a black dentist and friend who buy a home in a nice white area to get away from the crime and violence .
The neighborhood whites are so enraged that they forced the blacks to sell their house and leave the town .
Some of the text on the back is : COLORED SOLDIERS OF THE U.S. FORCES !
The white people in the U.S.A. do n't want you to live near them .
But all of a sudden they now remember that you are also American citizens because they want you to fight their wars , to get killed and maimed for them .
THEY NEED YOU AS CANNON FODDER !
Another leaflet from this series is AI - 129 - 10 - 44 .
Once again the leaflet is all text on the front and the back .
Some of the propaganda message is : COLORED SOLDIERS OF THE U.S. FORCES !
This is the truth about how you will be treated in a German prisoner - of - war camp .
You will not be shot , You will not starve , You will not be beaten up As your white officers tell you .
The Germans seem to have believed the cliché that the black Americans are simple folk that want to play athletic games .
In what is almost insulting by today 's standards , they promise :
If you go in for sports , just join the football or baseball teams or play basketball .
All camps have athletic fields and modern sporting equipment .
It is surprising that they do n't offer musical instruments for a jazz band .
The leaflet ends : COME OVER TO US
It is better to be a prisoner of war and return home safe and sound after the war , than to die for your white bosses .
Leaflet AI - 128-10 - 44 is in the same format and has the same title as the leaflet above .
This all - text leaflet tells the story of colored workers in Philadelphia who were hired to work on the subways and trolley cars , but were unable to work because white workers went on strike and refused to instruct them .
Some of the text is :
Think of your loved ones at home who are praying to the Lord every day that he may send you home uninjured .
What good is it to you when a shell tears you to pieces or leaves you bleeding to death ?
There is only one way of returning home safe and sound .
COME OVER TO US !
This leaflet depicts a smiling black soldier .
The text on the front is :
Why is he smiling ?
The back explains that he has surrendered to the Germans and he is out of the fight .
It says : He is out of it !
That 's why he is smiling .
He and his pals have found out that the Germans give the colored man a square deal .
I have been treated very nice by the Germans since I have been captured .
Paul King , Co. F , 370 Infantry .
Thomas E. Carpenter , HQ Co. , 2nd Bn. , 370th Infantry .
Sept. 23 , 1944 .
If you should be captured you 'll see for yourself .
In a POW camp you enjoy PEACE and SAFETY under the supervision of the International Red Cross .
Remember , the most important thing in the war is to get home alive .
This same propaganda message was used on a number of different German leaflets ; the only difference being a different black soldier was depicted on the front of the leaflet .
This leaflet depicts a black prisoner of war happily eating a big plate of food .
Text on the front is :
No starving here !
The back explains that there is no need to go on a diet .
The Germans have plenty of good food and are more than happy to share it with their colored prisoners .
Like the " AI " coded leaflets , the " AF " leaflets were also produced by the Sudstern section of the SS - Standarte " Kurt Eggers " organization for Allied troops in Italy .
There are a number of these vary gaudy and " arty " leaflets showing black soldiers in strange positions with caricatured looks on their faces .
It is clear from the codes that the Germans decided to work on getting American and British black troops to surrender in late in 1944 .
The leaflet shows two happy black POWs smoking a pipe and playing an accordion in the background , while their buddy is killed at the front in the foreground .
Checking my WWII Order of Battle I find that this unit named on the leaflet is identified as the " 92nd Infantry Division ( Colored ) . "
It arrived in Naples in August 1944 .
In regard to the battle mentioned above I find the quote : The German counterattack against the division along the Serchio drove in its outposts on 26 December 1944 .
The following day part of the infantry abandoned its positions and the division made further withdrawals .
It would appear that having given the division a sound beating the Germans believed that they would be ready to surrender and prepared this tactical leaflet .
The leaflet says in part on the back : BOYS OF THE 92nd DIVISION Did you get out of the bloody Hell of the Serchio Valley unhurt : then you were mighty lucky .
But how can you know that a worse
Hell is not in store for you ...
SLIP OVER TO JERRY Remember : JERRY NEVER SHOOTS COLORED P.O.W.s Leaflet AF - 32-4/45 was certainly prepared by the same artist and shows a black family behind a black soldier .
Once again the characters are caricatured and the black soldier has bright red lips and large piercing eyes .
The text on the front is : STAY ALIVE FOR YOUR FOLKS AND DON'T DIE FOR EMPTY PROMISES
This leaflet is a surrender pass and a radio leaflet allowing a prisoner of war to communicate with American forces .
It depicts a black man playing " Swanee River " on a saxophone at the left .
It reminds the black soldiers of what a pleasure it would be to safely return home to the American South .
It says that the only way to avoid injury and death is to come over to the German side .
On the back there is a place for name , rank , serial number , address and a message to be broadcast on Jerry 's Front Radio .
The leaflet ends with a safe conduct passierschein .
Another German leaflet to black troops depicts two babies on the front and the text : Tiny Tots want daddy back
The back is all text .
Some of the divisive propaganda text is :
Have you got a wife and cute children or a girl you want to marry ?
THEY WANT YOU TO COME BACK ALIVE !
Well , what chance have you to survive ?
Hardly any at all !
Remember , back home the colored man always had to do the dirty work .
On the front it is the same .
Uncle Sam 's colored soldiers are just CANNON FODDER .
The leaflet ends with a German passierschein ( safe conduct pass ) at the bottom .
Some German leaflets were in the form of a safe conduct pass just for the black soldiers .
For instance , leaflet AI - 165 - 11 - 44 depicts an all - text safe conduct pass in both English and German .
Some of the text is : TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COLORED DIVISION
After they got you into the war they shipped you to a foreign country as CANNON FODDER to fight in the RICH MAN'S WAR ...
Slip over to Jerry some night as many other colored boys have done before you .
They are now SAFE in a P.O.W. camp waiting for the end of the war .
This German leaflet depicts two black civilians trying to enter a church to pray .
They are blocked by a group of white parishioners .
The long text explains that the two men were visiting on a Sunday and just wanted to enter the church but were attacked instead .
Text on the back says in part :
In Germany anything like this would be impossible .
Colored people living in Germany can always go to any church they like .
They have never been a problem to the Germans .
There have never been lynchings of colored men in Germany ...
The Parole der Woche was the title of a weekly poster issued by the propaganda ministry of the German Reich from 1936 to February 1943 .
A small gummed version of these posters , 100 mm x 73 mm in size , was printed each week from August 1939 until the end of 1942 .
The stickers were printed by the Zentralverlag der NSDAP in Munich and are numbered at the bottom left .
Private Citizens used them for many purposes and they are often found stuck on envelopes like patriotic stamps .
The themes of the Parolen are always from the Nazi party and include attacks on Chamberlain , Roosevelt , Churchill , the Jews , the Russians , the French and rarely , blacks .
The Parolen above was issued for the week of 11 - 17 June 1940 .
It attacks the French use of their northern African troops and says : " In the Name of Civilization " France , infiltrated by Jews and Negroes , pushed its black Beasts on us for the third time .
It must be that last time .
It will be that last time !!
The German Sudstern Organization produced an interesting multi-page Travelers - Handbook for American Soldiers coded * 149-10 - 44 in October 1944 .
It is an illustrated satirical booklet for troops fighting in Italy telling a number of short stories in rhyme about the perils of joining the army to see the world .
One of the panels is racially insensitive and depicts a GI sitting by a signpost that reads : Join the Army - See the Nigger !
The soldier stares at an African and the text is :
On a cactus you may sit ,
Water do n't you find a bit ,
Where is sunny Africa
Fred the nigger - baby saw
Rome and Berlin - Ladies curled .
Join the army see the world .
JAPAN
This full color Japanese leaflet depicts a black foreman with a whip striking a white woman at a factory while a second black worker kisses a white woman and fondles her breast .
Since American wives were working in factories for the first time during World War Two in the " Rosie the Riveter " phase of armaments and war material , this leaflet was aimed at the soldiers on the front lines who left working wives at home .
Strangely , the Japanese were telling the colored peoples of the colonial powers that they should take power from their white masters , and here they attack the workers and seem to take the side of the white power structure .
A mixed message at best .
Text at the bottom of the leaflet is :
Is it getting as bad as all this ?
Yap , Negroes are the boss of the town now .
The above Japanese leaflet depicts a black sprinter next to a black soldier .
The text says that although the black man is a great racer , a great fighter and a good man , to the white man they are nothing but cannon fodder .
They are sent to the front while " Whitey " stays behind where he wo n't get hurt .
John W. Dower mentions the Japanese race propaganda in War without Mercy - Race and Power in the Pacific War , Pantheon Books , NYC , 1986 : Japanese propaganda directed at the United States during the war did indeed attempt to appeal to nonwhites by emphasizing racial discrimination ...
In the mid-1930s they established a connection with the radical anti-white Black Muslim movement led by Elijah Muhammad ...
Before the war , the Japanese also established a relationship with Robert O. Jordan , a charismatic black sometimes called Harlem 's Hitler .
They also took over several American magazines , " Living Age " and " North American review " and founded a press service called " Negro News Syndicate . "
Barak Kushner says in The Thought War - Japanese Imperial Propaganda , University of Hawaii Press , Honolulu , 2006 : The Japanese government maneuvered to have favorable articles concerning its movements in Asia and explaining why boycotts against Japan hurt everyone printed in prominent American newspapers .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted Black American newspapers for specific attention in the hope that disenfranchised minorities would seek solace in Japan 's championship of the " colored races . "
This Japanese leaflet appears to have been drawn by the same artist as the one above .
A black soldier looks down at an image of Africans being sold into slavery .
It points out that although slavery may no longer exist , his people are still being treated like slave .
This Japanese leaflet attempts to persuade the Australian " Diggers " to abandon New Guinea and go home because their real threat were the American soldiers , to include black soldiers , staged in Australia who were seducing the Australian women while they were dying in the jungle .
The leaflet depicts an American soldier kissing an Australian wife while dead bodies are shown in the foreground and background .
The text is : Hey ! you Diggers !
He came , he saw , he conquered !
Thinking you diggers will never come back alive
The BLACKS and the YANKS are raping your wives , your daughters and your sweethearts -- they are helpless without your protection .
Your future happiness is at stake !
One last Aussie simply means one more Yank safely in the house .
Surely you 'll not give up your lives to make this possible .
This Japanese leaflet in Pidgin - English to the natives of Papua - New Guinea may not belong in this article that describes targeting blacks .
However , the Japanese dropped these leaflets on the local black natives asking them to act as their eyes and ears in case of an American attack .
One individual who knows the Papuans well said in regard to this leaflet :
The Japanese occupiers of northern Papua New Guinea were , for the most part , liked by the Papuans .
In general , the Japanese hired the Papuans to work for them ; teaching them to drive trucks , perform rudimentary maintenance on vehicles and equipment , etc. and paying wages in the occupation currency .
Better treatment than they received from their pre-war Australian administrators .
From the Papuans ' point of view , they just changed one occupier for another .
At the left of the leaflet an American amphibious force lands on their island .
Two natives in the bush watch the landing and one says that he sees the American soldiers and the second says that they need to tell the Japanese so they can come and kill them .
The text is : GO QUICKLY AND TELL THE JAPANESE SOLDIERS Oh !
The American soldiers are very dumb .
They do not know that the strong Japanese soldiers are going to kill them .
Halou !
[ Name of native at left ]
Run quickly and alert the Japanese soldiers .
The [ Japanese ] soldiers are over there !
Another leaflet meant to drive a wedge between American black and white fighting men is in the form of a written leaflet without image .
Some of the text is : A Negro youth was lynched in Detroit , Mich .
On March 12th for the reason of having raped a white girl ... but as his innocence was made clear , the neighboring Negroes raised and attacked the girl 's house for revenge ... the nearby army unit had to rush to the scene ...
There were 172 dead among the Negroes after having been machinegunned ...
Whites always seem to be right ... When it comes to war Negroes are quite useful ... but after it 's over , all colored heroes will have to go back where they belong ---- Slaves again ....
Curiously , like the Germans , at the same time the Japanese were using race as a theme to attack their enemies , they used this same theme to win friendship and admiration from their allies and collaborators .
In the leaflet above , the Japanese brag about beating the Russians in 1905 and state that this shows that not only are Asians equal to Europeans , but in fact , better than Europeans .
So , at the same time they attack Americans for thinking they are better than blacks , the Japanese brag about the fact that they are clearly superior to whites .
The Japanese claim to be fighting the Anglo - Americans for all Asians and ask for Philippine loyalty .
A penciled note on this leaflet indicates that the Japanese dropped in on 10 March 1944 .
ITALY
The Italians never really went on the offensive against the Americans so there are no leaflets that seek to divide and conquer American forces using minority troops as a major theme .
However , the fascist Italian government and its German allies produced several leaflets , posters and propaganda postcards that attacked the American blacks and depicted them as uncultured animals , thieves and rapists .
This propaganda targeted the Italian people in an attempt to encourage them to fight on to protect their nation and heritage from the black barbarians who would destroy the culture .
I first discussed some of these postcards in an article entitled " German Propaganda Post Cards in Italy during World War II , " The American Philatelist , July 1990 .
Certainly the most famous of all the anti-black propaganda cards is this 1944 Gino Boccasile vignette showing a black American corporal offering the Venus de Milo for two dollars .
A supporter of Benito Mussolini , Boccasile produced propaganda material for the government including several racist and anti-Semitic posters .
After the war he was imprisoned and tried for collaborating with the Fascists and although acquitted , he remained an outcast .
He did a second vignette called " Negro in Church " where Christ on the Cross was being taken down , possibly for resale .
One of the black and white propaganda postcards produced by the Germans for their Italian allies depicts a caricatured American and black soldier .
Text beneath the card is : Anglo - American police on the streets of Rome ( Sketched by Alberto Cossola and smuggled out of invaded territory )
In order to avoid a similar shame to the cities of Northern Italy , each man must perform his duty at work .
That is the only way we can help our soldiers who are fighting against the multicolored army .
Other such cards mention the difference between the peaceful Fascist north of Italy and the occupied south of Italy .
One full - color double - card depicts two Allied soldiers ( one a black soldier holding a whip ) laughing at a weeping Italian couple amid burning and crumbling ruins .
The text is :
In Southern Italy , the occupation troops kill and burn , threaten the population and pillage .
Many black troops rape women .
The districts completely soiled by the black troops have to be cleaned up by Italians .
The second connected card depicts a female farmer in the north waving to a passing soldier in a tank .
The text is : In Northern Italy there reigns tranquility and order .
The new Republican Italy is in full reconstruction .
Above all , there dominates a steady faith in the future .
This German multi-page leaflet to Italians depicts a number of faces on one page , a black man raping a white girl with the word " Nigger ! " on another , and several pages depicting blacks and their victims .
The propaganda claims that they are all the same , murderers and rapists .
Another German leaflet to Italians that uses race as a theme is coded 0I /151 .
It bears four photographs of black faces on one side and four scenes on the back , including a black being mugged , a black hanging from a rope and a vandalized church .
The first side has five blocks of text , four of which claim to be reports on black behavior from a private letters , news correspondents , etc .
The back has five more , but each of them is just a simple propaganda statement .
The title of the leaflet is in larger typeface on the front .
It is : Blacks in our House ?
Never !
We Struggle until Victory !
The text under the lynched person tells the Italians :
The vast majority of Chicago gangster leaders are niggers and the bloodbaths in Chicago can be attributed to them .
The American population knows this well and they lynch the niggers because of this .
Another message by a " Franco B " claims that three drunk niggers came to the garden and two of them attacked and killed an uncle while the third one held him .
One then ran after Lisetta .
She ran away screaming .
Franco got out of his hiding place and I followed her .
He would not leave her to her fate .
Other texts mention black music and morality , the same sort of thing we hear today about " rappers . "
The Germans say that President Roosevelt has spoken about the black artists and their nightclubs .
The " art " of these clubs consists of obscene actions , wild nude dancing and dancing to the sounds of jungle music .
Another block of text warns of gangs of noisy blacks that loiter along the roads leading into cities , and how they get women pregnant and infect them with venereal diseases .
In all , your usual German propaganda trying to motivate the Italians to continue the fight to protect their homeland and women from the black murderers and rapists .
Curiously , some American officers worried about the black VD rate too .
John Costello mentions this in Love , Sex and War : Changing Values , 1939 - 45 , William Collins , London , 1985 : The all - Negro regiments , which made up sixteen per cent of the theatre strength , proved to be the most sexually active with ninety - six per cent of black troops admitting to intercourse , compared to eighty - two per cent of white soldiers .
Consequently VD rates amongst black soldiers averaged five times the rate for white ones , and in some units infections were being contracted by every second man .
" Just why the Negro has more sexual intercourse is a matter of speculation , " noted the survey , but other statistics collected by the army during the war showed that black GIs admitted to earlier and more frequent sexual activity as adolescents .
When overseas , most of these troops were in supply and quartermaster regiments behind the front lines - so they had more opportunity for sexual activity .
Although black troops were more likely to use a condom and take prophylactic measures than whites ( sixty - two per cent compared to forty - three per cent ) , their far higher VD rates , the report pointed out , was because " women to whom they have access are much more likely to be diseased on the average than the white enlisted male contact . "
This German leaflet to Italians coded øI - 179 depicts a black American soldier on the front .
The text reads :
If the opposition protests against the employment of black soldiers in combat , I can answer to the Congress that I have particular and good reasons to employ them .
Roosevelt to Congress 16 June 1944
The back is all text and a long propaganda message discusses the barbarity of black soldiers in Italy and their violations of the Italian people during the Christmas season .
In this Fascist Italian image a British " Tommy " and an American black soldier laugh at the sight of an Italian soldier apparently fighting against his brother who stayed loyal to Mussolini .
This final image shows a black American airman holding his fist over a destroyed Italian city .
In regard to the German use of race as a propaganda theme in Italy , Pradeep Kanthan told me : My Dad was in the 8th Army and was in Italy from 1943 to 1945 .
As a sapper he had to stay behind to remove the mines he had laid .
He spoke of being in Bari , and spoke Italian fluently by the time he came back to India .
He told me that the Germans had spread leaflets to the Italian population that Indians were barbarians and would pillage and rape at will .
It was very hard for Indians to get close to locals or get any support from them for this reason .
My Dad learnt of this when he had to employ locals in clearing minefields .
KOREAN WAR
This North Korean leaflet depicts a black lynching victim being removed from the scene of the crime by police .
The text is : American Negro soldiers !
Look at this heart - breaking picture !
It shows what happened to John Craft , Negro veteran of World War II , when he stood up for his rights in Magee , Mississippi .
The back is all text .
Some of the message is : LOOK AT THIS PICTURE AND THINK !
Why are you in Korea ?
The Chinese and Koreans are for equality and mutual respect among all races .
They do not regard Negroes as inferior .
In fact , they are fighting against the attempt to impose Jim Crow on them ...
The Communist Chinese produced a brown monotone leaflet that depicts a group of black prisoners of war .
One plays an accordion , a second plays a guitar .
The leaflet is signed by the " Central Political Bureau of the Korean People 's Army . "
Surprisingly , very few Korean War Communist leaflets targeted African - American troops .
The Chinese and North Vietnamese would later produce dozens of racially divisive leaflets in the 1960s , but the North Koreans showed little interest in attacking that " soft underbelly " of America .
There is one known case of six American prisoners released on 7 January 1951 and sent back to their own lines carrying three North Korean leaflets .
The very odd text is : COLORED MEN OF U.S. FORCES .
FIND THE ONLY WAY TO LIVE !
YOU MUST LIVE .
YOU MUST GO HOME AGAIN .
Your family is awaiting your return .
How sad were it when your death be informed to them .
Who will support your family 's lives after your death ?
You are now defeated on every front and are surrounded in many areas by brave Korea People 's Army and voluntary Army of China .
You continuous fight brings nothing else but worthless death in a strange land .
YOU MUST HAVE YOUR JUST RIGHT TO ENJOY FREEDOM AND EQUALITY .
You certainly remember that you have been mistreated with racist discrimination and in slave life .
American capitalists are plotting to colonize Korea by military intervention .
We should cut this chain .
HATE WAR AND COME OVER TO KOREAN'S PEOPLE'S ARMY .
IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE ONLY WAY TO LIVE .
Korean People 's
Army will treat you very well and send you home soon .
Another leaflet that uses race as a theme is folds out into six pages and is signed by the Korean People 's Army and the Chinese People 's Volunteers .
A picture on the cover depicts Private First Class James Wilson shaking hands with his Communist captors .
Some of the text is :
Did you ever stop to think why you should be in Korea , fighting other colored people , while lynchings , murders and insults pile up against the Negro people at home ?
We say : No U.S. soldiers have any business in Korea .
Korea for the Koreans .
China for the Chinese .
America for the Americans , Negro and white .
... We did n't come 5,000 miles across the sea to fight .
We did n't come to America with guns and bombs and we never will .
Do n't risk your lives here .
Ask to go home where you can fight for your own rights as a human being .
Leave us in peace in our homes here .
The leaflet goes on to report lynchings and crimes against black men both in the United States and in the U.S. Army in Korea .
It discusses politics in the United States and points out how few black Congressmen and Senators hold office .
It reminds the black soldiers of how few black officers have been commissioned in the military .
VIETNAM WAR
The Communists produced a great number of divide and conquer leaflets during the Vietnam War .
Some showed the American people marching in anti-war protests ; others mentioned the treatment of black civilians and troops .
Most were very well done , printed in Hanoi and shipped to both the battle front and the United States where they would be distributed by fellow - travelers and anti-war activists .
A very few were printed in the South by the Viet Cong and they are crude on poor quality paper .
One must always beware the crude leaflets though , since they could have purposely been printed in the North in a crude manner to make them appear to be battle - front leaflets .
Whereas most American leaflets were dropped from the air over selected targets , the Communists never had that ability .
Therefore , Communist leaflets were usually left where it was thought that Americans would pass by ; along trails , near base camps , and of course in bars or other places that American troops might congregate .
The previously classified Confidential MACV Combined Intelligence Center VC PROPAGANDA FACTBOOK dated 29 March 1969 says about the Viet Cong 's use of race in part :
The purpose of enemy propaganda directed against US soldiers is to lower their morale and to lessen their desire to fight .
The most common method of dissemination of this propaganda is the leaflet .
Radio Hanoi and Liberation Radio also direct propaganda broadcasts at the US soldier .
The VC has often chosen particular target groups within the US forces ; for example , the Negro servicemen or the men of a particular division are likely targets .
Most of the propaganda , however , is directed at the US soldier in general …
A parallel is often drawn between the American Revolution , which is lauded as a just war of which the world approved , and the present struggle in Vietnam …
There are three slogans which appear most frequently in large type at the bottom of the various leaflets directed at the US soldier : " Oppose the US aggressive war in South Vietnam " , " Peace for Vietnam , " and " Repatriate the US Expeditionary Corps . "
Propaganda aimed at the Negro soldier portrays the US " aggressors " as the common enemy of both the Negro and the Vietnamese .
These leaflets stress racial injustices in the US in an effort to get the Negro soldier to empathize with the VC cause and to question his support of the American effort .
Jerry Berry says in Psychological Warfare Leaflets of the Vietnam War : Another popular theme of Communist leaflets was the existing racial prejudice against African Americans in the United States .
The Communist propagandist used this advantage to specifically target the Black GIs fighting in South Vietnam .
Messages on leaflets attempted to convince them that they were being used unfairly by their superiors and forced to suffer the brunt of the fighting and casualties on the battlefield .
Black GIs were often described in Communist leaflets as " cannon fodder for the American aggressors in South Vietnam " .
Photos of African Americans depicting racial injustice against them were favorite choices of Communist propaganda writers .
If the reader wants to see more examples of Communist leaflets from the Vietnam War I recommend he read my article on this subject .
Some of the text on the back of the leaflet is : EVER HEARD THIS LITTLE DITTY ?
I wish I were an Alabama trooper , that is what I would truly like to be .
I wish I was an Alabama trooper , cause then I could kill the niggers legally .
A similar leaflet depicts another anti-War crowd carrying signs such as " Weapons cannot win the people " and " Bring the troops home now . "
Some of the text on the back is : AFRO - AMERICANS !
The Vietnamese are not exploiting you nor discriminating against you .
No Vietnamese shoots and kills Black freedom - fighters in the streets of America .
The Vietnamese are fighting for their own independence and freedom .
Your true enemy is not the Vietnamese people .
Your true enemies are those who are calling you niggers .
Unite with your Vietnamese brothers to fight our common enemy : the ruling clique in the United States who are carrying out an extremely cruel war of aggression in Vietnam and an extremely barbarous policy of exploitation and racial discrimination in the United States !

Have you ever wondered what all those extra SUVs are in the Presidential or VIP motorcades ?
You know , the ones with severely tinted windows .
The SUV's that no one gets in or out .
Maybe they are Unmarked ' black helicopters ' on four wheels ...
Well , wonder no more .
They have a 6 barreled 7.62 mm mini gun .
They Fire over 4,000 rounds per minute
The wipers need to be run to remove Spent casings when the weapon is firing .
This video is from the company that makes this happen .
The vehicle is also armor plated .
While our experience says otherwise , we really hope that the practice of launching buggy smartphones has n't been institutionalized .
The Wall Street Journal just published a report about the " bumpy launch " of the BlackBerry Storm -- a handset that WSJ sources say sold some 500,000 units in the first month following its global release .
Not bad , but well off the 2.4 million launch pace seen by the iPhone 3G -- the phone the Storm had hoped to unseat as sales champ .
The WSJ speculates that the relatively timid response stems from buggy or otherwise " clunky software " that crippled the user experience and performance at launch only to be ( partially ) corrected later via software updates .
An abysmal scenario which echos the buggy 2.0 software that accompanied the iPhone 3G at launch .
Now , instead of pleading for mercy at the feet of disgruntled consumers , RIM co-CEO , Jim Balsillie , calls the post - launch scramble part of the " new reality " of making complex cellphones in large volumes .
A Verizon spokesman noted that return percentages are measurable in single digits ( standard for a smartphone ) adding , " The sales and performance of the device have lived up to our expectations . "
Fine , but when expectations are high that the consumer experience will be poor , somehow that does n't sound like a victory to us .

Medics have found traces of depleted uranium in victims of Israel ’s brutal attack on Gaza , according to a Press TV report , meaning the ultimate death toll could be far higher as future generations are plagued by cancers and birth defects .
“ Norwegian medics told Press TV correspondent Akram al - Sattari that some of the victims who have been wounded since Israel began its attacks on the Gaza Strip on December 27 have traces of depleted uranium in their bodies , ” states the article .
Following the conclusion of the first Gulf War in 1991 , in which depleted uranium was used by U.S. forces , cancers and birth defects in Iraq soared and many veterans organizations agree that the weapon was responsible for the emergence of Gulf War Syndrome that has plagued hundreds of thousands of Gulf War veterans .
Depleted uranium shell holes at the infamous Highway of Death in Iraq showed measurements 1,000 times more radioactive than background radiation .
The residue of a DU weapon can be spread by the wind and infect humans not in the immediate area as well as the entire food chain .
The image below shows some of the shocking effects of depleted uranium and how its use leads to horrific birth defects .
In 1999 , the UN called for the use of depleted uranium to be banned worldwide but efforts to downplay its effects led by the Pentagon have blocked such a ban .
Former head of the Pentagon ’s 1994 U.S. Army Depleted Uranium Project Maj .
Doug Rokke has faced constant harassment , including murder attempts , after going public in 1997 to expose the health effects from depleted uranium that the U.S. government and the World Health Organization have consistently dismissed .
Israel ’s use of depleted uranium against victims of the Gaza bombing campaign provides further evidence that war crimes are being committed with the tacit approval of both the current administration as well as president elect Barack Obama .

" Your men of energy are the very fellows TO fail , " he said ; " however , they shall find if I have had extraordinary energy in running into debt , that I have extraordinary energy , too , in getting out of it .

The proof is that the poets who have dramatised the whole story of the Fall of Troy , instead of selecting portions , like Euripides ; or who have taken the whole tale of Niobe , and not a part of her story , like Aeschylus , either fail utterly or meet with poor success on the stage .
This course , when others fail , may be good , but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that , since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you .

There ’s a solid reason we celebrate Martin Luther King Day every year , and it does n’t just have to do with getting the day off if you work for the government .
These 25 MLK quotes will remind you why we hold the day in observance :
1 . True peace is not merely the absence of tension : it is the presence of justice .
2 . I submit to you that if a man has not discovered something that he will die for , he is n’t fit to live .
3 . A riot is the language of the unheard .
4. Darkness cannot drive out darkness : only light can do that .
Hate cannot drive out hate : only love can do that .
5 . Many of the ugly pages of American history have been obscured and forgotten .
A society is always eager to cover misdeeds with a cloak of forgetfulness , but no society can fully repress an ugly past when the ravages persist into the present .
America owes a debt of justice which it has only begun to pay .
If it loses the will to finish or slackens in its determination , history will recall its crimes and the country that would be great will lack the most element of greatness — justice .
6. Cowardice asks the question , “ Is it safe ? ” Expediency asks the question , “ Is it politic ? ” And Vanity comes along and asks the question , “ Is it popular ? ” But Conscience asks the question “ Is it right ? ”
And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe , nor politic , nor popular , but he must do it because Conscience tells him it is right .
7 . I say to you that our goal is freedom , and I believe we are going to get there because however much she strays away from it , the goal of America is freedom .
8 . I am not interested in power for power ’s sake , but I ’m interested in power that is moral , that is right and that is good .
9 . If a city has a 30 % Negro population , then it is logical to assume that Negroes should have at least 30 % of the jobs in any particular company , and jobs in all categories rather than only in menial areas .
10 . … Life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony .
11 . Science investigates ; religion interprets .
Science gives man knowledge which is power ; religion gives man wisdom which is control .
Science deals mainly with facts ; religion deals mainly with values .
The two are not rivals .
They are complementary .
12 . A nation or civilization that continues to produce softminded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan .
13 . Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity .
14 .
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience , but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy .
15 . Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere .
16 .
We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor ; it must be demanded by the oppressed .
17 .
One has not only a legal , but a moral responsibility to obey just laws .
Conversely , one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws .
18 . I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek .
I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends .
But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong , or perhaps even more so , to use moral means to preserve immoral ends .
19 .
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism .
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy .
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice .
Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God ’s children .
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood .
20 .
Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force .
21 . Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time — the need for mankind to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression .
22 . I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction .
I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality .
This is why right , temporarily defeated , is stronger than evil triumphant .
23 .
The time is always right to do what ’s right .
24 .
In every age and every generation , men have envisioned a promised land .
Some may have envisioned it with the wrong ideology , with the wrong philosophical presupposition .
But men in every generation thought in terms of some promised land .
25 . I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed : “ We hold these truths to be self - evident : that all men are created equal . ”
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood .
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi , a state , sweltering with the heat of injustice , sweltering with the heat of oppression , will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice .
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character .
I have a dream today .
Americans believe in God , angels , heaven , miracles - such traditional religious thinking is still much a part of the nation ’s mind - set , according to research that also plumbs a few less traditional beliefs .
“ Overall , more people believe in the devil , hell and angels than believe in Darwin´s theory of evolution , ” said a Harris Poll released Thursday .
The numbers clearly favor the proverbial Big Man Upstairs : 80 percent say they believe in God ; among those who attend church weekly , the number is 98 percent .
Three - quarters believe in miracles , 73 percent believe in heaven , 71 percent say Jesus is the Son of God and 71 percent believe in angels , the survey found .
Seven out of 10 say Jesus Christ rose from the dead and that the Bible is , all or in part , the “ Word of God . ”
More than two - thirds - 68 percent - believe in the “ survival of the soul after death ” and would describe themselves as religious .
About 62 percent think that hell exists , 61 percent believe in the Virgin Birth and 59 percent say the devil exists .
In contrast , fewer than half - 47 percent - said they believe in Darwin ’s theory of evolution ; a third said they did not believe in it while 22 percent were not sure what they thought .
A full 40 percent said they believe in creationism , though the question did not elaborate on exactly what that term meant .
Supernatural phenomena of other kinds attract Americans ’ attention .
Overall , 44 percent of the respondents said they believe in ghosts , 36 percent say UFOs are real while 31 percent believe in both witches and astrology .
About a quarter believe in reincarnation , or “ that you were once another person , ” the survey found .
“ I think these numbers show that Americans are both devout and rebellious at the same time , ” said Steve Waldman , co-founder and editor in chief of Beliefnet , an online spiritual source that also polls the public .
“ Americans embrace key parts of tradition and faith , but they add other sorts of stuff , the supplementary beliefs that might not be on the approved list , ” he added .
Although Protestants have a slight edge on Catholics in terms of church attendance , the survey revealed marked similarities between the denominations .
“ There are no significant differences between the large percentages of Catholics and Protestants who believe in God , miracles , heaven and hell , that Jesus is the Son of God , angels , the Resurrection of Jesus , the survival of the soul after death , the Virgin Birth and the devil , ” the survey said .
“ However , Catholics are more likely than Protestants to believe in Darwin´s theory of evolution ( by 52 percent to 32 percent ) , ghosts ( by 57 percent to 41 percent ) , UFOs ( 43 percent to 31 percent ) , and astrology ( by 40 percent to 28 percent ) .
Protestants are slightly more likely than Catholics to believe in creationism ( by 54 percent to 46 percent ) . ”
The survey of 2,126 adults was conducted Nov. 10 - 17 .

Google has finally added offline support to Gmail , allowing US and Blighty - based users to read and write email while unconnected to the interwebs .
The firm said it was rolling out an “ experimental feature in Gmail Labs ” that will probably be a bit cranky and frustrating due to the fact that there are still “ some kinks that have n't been completely ironed out yet ” .
Gmail engineer Andy Palay said in a post on the company ’s offical blog yesterday that Google has been testing the offline version of Gmail for some time .
Indeed many have been patiently waiting for the manacles to come off of Gmail , because up to now it was limited by the fact that messages could only be accessed online .
Of course , Gmailers wanting offline access could simply opt for a separate POP client such as Thunderbird , Apple Mail , or even Microsoft 's very own Outlook .
Google entered the offline web app market in May 2007 with the release of its browser add - on project Gears .
At the time the firm marked out clear intentions to enter territory dominated by Microsoft by offering free , open source apps such as docs and spreadsheets that work without an internet connection .
However , it ’s taken Google over 18 months to include email in its Gears project .
In that time the company has suffered several major outages in Gmail that have perhaps best illustrated the limitations of storing users data up in the cloud .
The offline version of Gmail now uses Google Gears , which downloads a local cache of an individual ’s mail and synchs with Mountain View servers when connected to its network .
A fact that could prove a storage headache for some .
The feature has to be switched on via Google ’s email testbed environment Gmail Labs .
It will be made gradually available to individual Gmail account holders as well as Google Apps biz customers in the US and UK over the next few days .
Oh , and an offline option for Google Calendar will be winging its way into Gears soon too . ®
I Went to Necromancy School With Zonomaw the Facerender , and Liberals Have Nothing to Fear About Her Joining the Supreme Court
“ I do n’t see why my fellow liberals are so concerned over a decrepit being , who has traded her humanity for more power , becoming the decisive vote on the legal determination of reproductive freedom , civil rights , and labor protections for the next 40 years . ”
Prime Minister Geir Haarde had called early elections for May Iceland 's coalition government has collapsed under the strain of an escalating economic crisis .
Conservative Prime Minister Geir Haarde announced the resignation of his cabinet , after talks with his Social Democratic coalition partners failed .
He said he could not accept the Social Democrats ' demand to lead the country .
Iceland 's financial system collapsed in October under the weight of debt , leading to a currency crisis , rising unemployment and daily protests .
The economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10 % this year .
The coalition between Mr Haarde 's Independence Party and Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir 's Social Democratic Alliance had been under strain in recent months .
Mr Haarde told reporters on Monday : " We could n't accept the Social Democratic demand that they would lead the government . "
The Independence Party currently controls 25 of the country 's 63 parliamentary seats , to the Social Democrats ' 18 .
Meltdown
The announcement comes three days after the prime minister called an early general election for 9 May , adding that he would not stand for health reasons .
The coalition government , in place since 2007 , had been due to remain in place until 2011 .

Her party is now expected to look for new partners to form a government until the election .
President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson said he would not give any party a mandate to form a new government until Tuesday at the earliest .
In recent months the Social Democrats had urged Mr Haarde to fire the central bank governor and move towards closer ties with Europe .
Iceland , a country of about 300,000 people , has traditionally sought to stay outside the EU .
But last month European Union Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the island might apply for membership as soon as this year .
The extent of Iceland 's trouble became evident as conditions tightened in global credit markets last year .
It emerged that the country 's banks , which had amassed debt during years of rapid expansion , owed about six times the country 's economic output .
Money from around the world had also poured into Iceland because interest rates there exceeded 10 % .

bdb : Improved Ruby Bindings for Berkeley DB
By Peter Cooper
Berkeley DB is a high performance database system initially developed in the early 1990s .
It 's not an SQL driven database engine - it just stores data in key / value pairs - but BDB is very fast , available to use on most operating systems , and is dual licensed for open source and commercial use .
It has several benefits to just using a flat file or a PStore : transactions , fine - grained locking , replication , and hot backups , for starters .
While Ruby bindings already exist for BDB , Matt Bauer has just released some all new shiny ones that are fast and easy to use .
You 'll need to have Berkeley DB installed as a library on your system before you get started , of course .
On OS X , the MacPort for Berkeley DB 4.6 is called db46 .
On Ubuntu try libdb - dev .
Alternatively , go to the official Berkeley DB site and download the source .
Follow Matt 's README for instructions on installing the Ruby bindings .
Sample usage :
env = Bdb :: Env . new ( 0 ) env_flags = Bdb :: DB_CREATE | Bdb :: DB_INIT_TXN | Bdb :: DB_INIT_LOCK | Bdb :: DB_INIT_LOG | Bdb :: DB_INIT_MPOOL env . open ( File . join ( File . dirname ( __FILE__ ) , ' tmp ' ) , env_flags , 0 ) ; db = env .
db db . open ( nil , ' db1.db ' , nil , Bdb :: Db :: BTREE , Bdb :: DB_CREATE | Bdb :: DB_AUTO_COMMIT , 0 ) txn = env .
txn_begin ( nil , 0 ) db . put ( txn , ' key ' , ' value ' , 0 ) txn .
commit ( 0 ) p db .
get ( nil , ' key ' , nil , 0 ) db .
close ( 0 ) env .
close
Okay , it 's not the easiest to read code in the world , but Berkeley DB 's power outweighs the modest complexity of its API .
If Berkeley DB and its ways are still fresh to you , check out this guide ( slightly but not significantly out of date ) to get up to speed on the main concepts .
This article was originally posted in Canadian Developer Connection .
From looking at Microsoft ’s surveys of Canadian developers and plain old talking to people ( something I love to do ) , it seems that many people who call themselves “ developers ” wear many hats , one of which is “ manager ” .
If this is the case , I ’ll bet that the title of this article has piqued your curiosity .
I wo n’t keep you in suspense any longer .
According to the Harvard Business blog , the interview question you should always ask is :
“ What do you do in your spare time ? ”
The example they cite is Captain Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger , the celebrated and heroic captain who successfully landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after both engines were knocked out by what pilots call “ bird strikes ” .
What does he do in his spare time , when he ’s not flying passengers around ?
As a boy , he built model aircraft and aircraft carriers .
As a teen , he got a pilot ’s license and flew gliders .
Without its engines , the Airbus effectively became a big glider .
He was an accident investigator for the Air Line Pilots Association .
He ’s worked with aviation officials to improve training and methods for evacuating aircraft in emergencies .
He runs a consultancy called Safety Reliability Methods , which helps companies improve their safety , performance and reliability .
In short , “ Sully ” is all about flying – and doing so safely .
You might even say it ’s an obsession of his .
Here ’s what the Harvard Business blog article has to say about one ’s obsessions :
Obsessions are one of the greatest telltale signs of success .
Understand a person ’s obsessions and you will understand her natural motivation .
The thing for which she would walk to the end of the earth .
The article goes into more detail , but its general gist is that what a candidate does in his or her spare time might be a good indicator of his or her fit for the position .
Looking for a star developer ?
It ’s probably one who ’s got a hobby programming project on the side .
Seeking an ace IT pro ?
Someone who ’s converted an old computer into a home entertainment unit might be a good pick .
You might want to go beyond the article ’s focus on hiring others and turn it around : what do you do in your spare time ?
Do any of you extracurricular activities suggest that you ’d be good at your job ?

Despite the news yesterday that the wolf population in Yellowstone has decreased 27 % , the Bush administration said today that they will remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list in the Midwest and in the area surrounding Yellowstone National Park .
[ social_buttons ]
The Bush administration has tried to remove the wolves ’ federal protections twice before , once in the Great Lakes and once in the northern Rockies , which includes Montana , Colorado and Wyoming .
Federal judges revoked both rule changes in February and September of last year .
Defenders of Wildlife sent an emergency news blast this afternoon that said they are already prepared to file new lawsuits to ensure the wolves ’ are protected .
The organization estimates that more than 1,000 wolves could be killed this year as a result .
Deputy Interior Secretary Lynn Scarlett said “ We believe this is a major success story for conservation , [ and ] we can all be proud of our various roles in saving this icon of the American wilderness . ”
However , the move comes after intense pressure from anti-wolf lobbies funded by farmers and ranchers who claim the wolves are pests , or “ predators , ” a designation which allows even protected species to be killed in defense of livestock .
While it is unlikely that this move will hold up in court , only months after successful lawsuits against similar decisions , it will be effective as a last - minute gift to the political establishment in these states , where the wolf protections are a contentious , hot - button issue .

Sharding is a database technique where you break up a big database into many smaller ones .
Instead of having 1 million customers on a single , big iron machine , you perhaps have 100,000 customers on 10 different , smaller machines .
The general advise on sharding is that you do n’t until you have to .
It ’s similar to Martin Fowler ’s First Law of Distributed Object Design :
Do n’t distribute your objects !
Sharding is still relatively hard , has relatively poor tool support , and will definitely complicate your setup .
Now I always knew that the inevitable day would come where we would have no choice .
We would simply have to shard because there was no more vertical scaling to be done .
But that day seems to get pushed further and further into the future .
Bigger caches , more reads
Our read performance is in some aspect being taken care of by the fact that you can get machines with 256GB RAM now .
We upgraded the Basecamp database server from 32 GB to 128GB RAM a while back and we thought that would be the end of it .
The box was maxed out and going beyond 128 GB at the time was stupid expensive .
But now there ’s 256GB to be had at a reasonable price and I ’m starting to think that by the time we reach that , there ’ll be reasonably priced 512GB machines .
So as long as Moore ’s law can give us capacity jumps like that , we can keep the entire working set in memory and all will be good .
And even if we should hit a ceiling there , we can still go to active read slaves before worrying about sharding .
The bigger problem is writes
Traditionally it has n’t been read performance that caused people to shard anyway .
It has been write performance .
Our applications are still very heavy on the reads vs writes , so it ’s less of a problem than it is for many others .
But with the rise of SSD , like Fusion - IO ’s ioDrive that can do 120K IOPS , it seems that we ’re going to be saved by the progress of technology once again by the time we ’ll need it .
Punt on sharding
So where does that leave sharding ?
For us , we ’re in the same position we ’ve been in for the past few years .
We just do n’t need to pay the complexity tax yet , so we do n’t .
That ’s not to say that sharding does n’t have other benefits than simply allowing that which otherwise could n’t be , but the trade is not yet good enough .
One point of real pain we ’ve suffered , though , is that migrating a database schema in MySQL on a huge table takes forever and a day .
That ’s a very real problem if you want to avoid an enterprisey schema full of kludges put in place to avoid adding , renaming , or dropping columns on big tables .
Or avoid long scheduled maintenance windows .
I really hope that the clever chaps at MySQL comes up with something more reasonable for that problem , though .
I ’m told that PostgreSQL is a lot more accommodating in this regard , so hopefully competition will rise all boats for that .
Do n’t try to preempt tomorrow
I guess the conclusion is that there ’s no use in preempting the technological progress of tomorrow .
Machines will get faster and cheaper all the time , but you ’ll still only have the same limited programming resources that you had yesterday .
If you can spend them on adding stuff that users care about instead of prematurely optimizing for the future , you stand a better chance of being in business when that tomorrow finally rolls around .

Apple Demonstrates Energy - Efficient MacBook Battery at MacWorld
January 7th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Steve Jobs ’ absence has n’t prevented exciting things from happening at this week ’s MacWorld Expo in San Francisco .
This morning , Apple unveiled the new 17 inch MacBook Pro , complete with a new energy efficient lithium - polymer battery .
According to the company , the MacBook ’s battery can run for eight hours on a single charge and retains 80 percent of its capacity for up to 3,000 charge cycles .
That ’s a big upgrade from the 13 and 15 inch models , which only have 300 recharges .
Apple ’s battery retains its long life with the use of an embedded chip that keeps track of charge level , temperature , and manages the charging current .
Speculation abounds as to who will be the battery supplier , but Apple has n’t provided any leads .
Possibilities include Toshiba , Sanyo , Panasonic , Mobius Power , Actacell , and Boston Power .

From the " Guido must be happy " files :
Python 3.0 is now officially out - breaking compatability ( in many respects ) with currently deployed Python 2.x series .
Do n't worry it 's not all lost for existing Python users , though the official Python release does sound dire .
Python 3.0 ( a.k.a. " Python 3000 " or " Py3k " ) is a new
version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x line of
releases .
The language is mostly the same , but many details ,
especially how built - in objects like dictionaries and strings work ,
have changed considerably , and a lot of deprecated features have
finally been removed .
Also , the standard library has been reorganized
in a few prominent places .
You see in October Python 2.6 was released , and it is an effort to bridge the gap between the 2.x and 3.x versions of Python .
When I spoke with Python developers back in October the expectation was that many developers would stick with the 2.x line for awhile and not immediately jump to 3.x when available .
" We are not expecting or encouraging developers to migrate to Python 3
immediately , and the Python 2.x line will continue to be supported and
improved for years to come , " David Goodger , an officer of the Python Software Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
" Python 2.6 is an upgrade intended for most
developers of production systems .
Python 3.0 is for those who like to
live on the bleeding edge . "
The iPhone has been hacked in the past to use modified external keyboards , but new mods promise much more general interaction .
Now , iPhone expert Ralf Ackermann has succeeded in supporting a standard Bluetooth keyboard using an external Bluetooth approach and is working on supporting an internal one .
For the external approach , Ackermann modified a Robotech Bluetooth module , which he placed in an iPhone battery sleeve and connected to the iPhone ( serial ) connector port at the bottom of the unit .
This allowed the the phone to communicate directly with the the module using the Bluetooth serial port profile .
The external Bluetooth module on the left has been placed into an iPhone battery sleeve .
The whole thing works courtesy of Jay " saurik " Freeman 's Veency application .
Ackermann used a tiny libvncclient to generate keyboard events , which were then passed to Veency .
Veency then provided the keyboard event injection using the iPhone 's private Graphics Services framework .
You can find out more about this external module project over at Ackermann 's blog .
He 'll be posting schematics and code as he gets his site set up .
Ars readers may be more excited , though , by his work on a completely internal solution .
Here , Ackermann discovered BlueSn0w , part of the iBluetooth project .
BlueSn0w ( yes , its name is apparently inspired by the iPhone dev team 's yellowsn0w ) will scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices .
According to this Flickr page , the module seems to enable the Bluetooth UART interface to communicate
The internal solution depends on gaining access to the Bluetooth module stack .
" User space BT stacks are not common — nevertheless , of course they can be done , " Ackermann told Ars .
" In the past , I had a look at an adaptation of the Linux Bluez stack for ATMEL uCs for instance — and this seems similar . "
Once the stack becomes available , Ackermann believes a fully internal solution will be quickly usable .
There is no time estimate on this due to the complete volunteer nature of the BlueSn0w project but it looks like hobbyists are drawing close to the goal .
Allowing the iPhone to accept keyboard input from an external Bluetooth keyboard will move the iPhone forward in opening new opportunities for general computing and on - the - go note taking .
Taking into account the iPhone 's newly realized video out support , the entire platform looks like it's at the brink of a transformative revolution .
DETROIT 
The rapidly deteriorating finances of General Motors are forcing the federal government to decide whether to bail out the largest American automaker or face the prospect that it might go bankrupt .
G.M. said Friday that its cash cushion had been dwindling by more than $ 2 billion a month recently and that it could run short of money by mid-2009 unless it got emergency federal assistance .
It also said it had suspended merger talks with Chrysler to focus on its own increasingly urgent problems , brought on by higher gas prices , a weakening economy and tight credit  a combination afflicting the entire auto industry , but hurting G.M. the most .
The government faces a difficult choice .
If it provides G.M. with a bailout , there is no guarantee the company will not need more money later to stay out of bankruptcy , particularly with the economy weakening .
No time to freeze the minimum wage : four reasons why
07 Jan 2009 , by Adam Lent Guest in Economics , Labour market
I mentioned before how pressure for a freezing of the minimum wage has grown in recent days .
Here ’s four reasons why this is a bad idea .
1 . The argument from business associations is that 2009 is going to a terrible year economically and to place extra costs on business at this time will create greater job loss and insolvency .
But the Low Pay Commission ( the body that recommends the minimum wage rate to the Government ) has actually already set a minimum wage rate for 2009 – it is £ 5.73 per hour and it came into force in October 2008 and will run to October 2009 .
The current LPC deliberations will lead to a recommendation designed to run from October 2009 to October 2010 .
So the real issue is how bad things will or wo n’t be throughout 2010 not 2009 .
This is , of course , very difficult to know but even the gloomiest predictions expect some pick - up in growth by 2010 .
In effect , those who are arguing for a freeze are saying that just as the economy starts to grow and wage settlements are likely to ease , the lowest paid should still suffer .
2 . Freezing the minimum wage is a horribly blunt approach .
The Low Pay Commission takes vast amounts of evidence , conducts a great deal of research and deliberates in detail before deciding its rate recommendation .
It has a complex trade off to make between social justice , what businesses can actually afford ( not what they say they can afford ) , the likely impact of various changes to the rate on unemployment for a variety of groups in the labour market , the impact on different types and size of business , and the impact on the wider economy .
Into this mix they have to throw issues around enforcement of minimum wage rights and the fact that there are different rates and arrangements for different age ranges , apprentices and certain types of atypical work .
To simply say “ things are bad , let ’s freeze the rate ” is absurdly simplistic against the background of such complex trade - offs .
3 . In this vein , just as raising the rate too high can lead to unemployment and insolvencies , so setting it too low will have the same effect .
Minimum wage earners ( of which there are about one million ) are also consumers as well as employees .
Importantly , given the recessionary problems , they also spend rather than save and they also spend a lot of money in the very sectors where there tends to be concentrations of minimum wage earners .
If their wages are set too low , then their spending power will be constrained which will lead to declining demand which will in turn lead to greater insolvency and unemployment .
On the other hand , set the rate at the right level and the rise in October 2009 will act as an economic stimulus .
4 . I ’ve heard it said that because inflation will drop next year , then a freeze would in effect not be that bad for minimum wage earners .
This is nonsense .
As pointed out above , the minimum wage is being set now for October 2009 to October 2010 – the rate of inflation over this period is unclear but it is very unlikely the figure over this twelve months will be below 0 % .
In effect , a freeze therefore means a real terms pay cut for one million people already struggling on a very low wage .

Alpine Conjunction

Explanation : Did you see it ?
The last conjunction of Moon and bright planets in 2008 featured a young crescent Moon and brilliant Venus in the west after sunset on December 31st .
Seen here in dark , clear , mountain air from Mönichkirchen , Austria , are the two celestial beacons that dominate planet Earth 's night sky .
That pair was hard to miss , but skygazers watching lower along the western horizon in early twilight might also have glimpsed a pairing of Jupiter and Mercury as they both wandered closer to the Sun in the sky at year 's end .
Still , while this single , 5 second long exposure seriously overexposes the Moon 's sunlit crescent , it does capture another planet not visible to the unaided eye .
The tiny pinprick of light just above the photographer 's head in the picture is the distant planet Neptune .

< @blackbart > just got a call from him and answered with " hello son , i dont love you and your adopted "
< @blackbart > cant stop laughing
Lets be clear about something .
We did not just live through a 30 year period of laissez faire that has come to an end .
Government got neither smaller in scale or scope .
At best the growth of government slowed , but it was never reversed .
Fiscal policy has been irresponsible for at least two generations , monetary policy has been loose in an effort to minimize the short term pain of adjustment .
WE ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE VERY SAME POLICIES WE ARE NOW ADVOCATING TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS .
We did n't have an era of complete deregulation and free trade , we had partial deregulations ( and attenuated property rights ) and managed trade agreements .
We have international agencies that promote administrative command / managed capitalism overseas and call it " free market " , we have politicians at home that engage in discretionary spending unheard of before who claim to be " fiscal conservatives " .
It is also the case that this is not a new argument by me or anyone else .
Lawrence Kontlikoff has been sounding a warning bell on the fiscal side for my entire professional life .
And thinkers such as Axel Leijonhufvud have been discussing the dire costs of inflation in terms of coordination failures since the 1960s .
And it is not like the names Buchanan and Hayek are unknown to those in the economics profession since both won the Nobel Prize , and Buchanan explained in detail the consequences of the breakdown in the old time fiscal religion and the Legacy of Lord Keynes , and Hayek explained clearly the consequences of engaging in the Keynesian dance of holding the " tiger by its tail " with respect to inflationary monetary policy .
So how can it be that we get articles such as these --- Jeffrey Sachs making the case for Big Government in Time , and Yves Smith arguing that current crisis undermines the idea of economics as a science .
The " analysis " of Sachs and Smith needs to be read , but also understood to be full of conceptual confusion and historical inaccuracy .
The sad reality is that since the 1940s , economic policy world - wide has been dominated by Keynesian ideas .
Research in economics has been dominated by Keynesianism even when it supposedly had thrown off those intellectual ideas .
Keynesian ideas led to Keynesian models , which in turn led to the development of Keynesian data that was then used to test Keynesian models with the purpose of exploring the efficacy of Keynesian policies .
All that oscilated was whether we should be " liberal " or " conservative " , but everyone in power was fundamentally Keynesian .
After the 1987 crash , for example , Reagan was asked whether this meant the rehabilitation of Keynesian economics , he responded by telling the audience that Mr. Keynes did n't even have a degree in economics .
That was his rhetoric , but the diagnosis of why the 1987 crash was one of aggregate demand failure , and the policy response was attempts to stimulate consumption .
" Buy , Buy , Buy " Reagan told his audience within in 2 minutes after telling us that Keynes did n't have a degree in economics .
The very same economic framework that was unable to see the looming problems of fiscal irresponsibility and loose monetary policy , also could n't see the difficulties of state socialism in the former Soviet Bloc and the problems of 3rd world poverty .
But each of these economic policy failures are at root problems with statism , not problems with the market economy .
Keynesianism is the prefered economic policy of statism ( as Keynes himself pointed out when he argued that the policy experiments in Germany and Russia might be the more natural home for his ideas ) .
The " Washington Consensus " and the so - called era of laissez faire following the Reagan revolution are in fact , lets face it , much closer in reality to the policy prescription of John Kenneth Galbraith than Milton Friedman .
Friedman 's rhetoric was employed to pursue Galbraithian policies .
Galbraith argued for Keynesian activism via a weird mix of Marx , Veblen and Keynes --- but the basic prespection was on of government involvement both as referee and active player in the economic game .
This is what we have had since the 1940s .
Friedman argued against these positions via the logic of economic theory and the empirical examination of the consequences of government activism .
Friedman won the intellectual debate among his peers , but lost the war of policy implementation in Washington and throughout the world .
He pointed this out himself --- classical liberal he said have won the battle of rhetoric , but lost the battle of implementation .
But Friedman 's argument has n't impacted the conceptual confusion and historical inaccuracy that blames our current crisis on the era of small government and laissez faire policy .
So now we read about how Friedmanesque ideas ( let alone Hayekian ) are refuted by the current situation .
Even President - elec Obama referred the other day to the " failed ideology " of the past , and the need for a new era of regulation of the economy fit for the 21st century .
Ironcially , one of the major sources for the confusion is found in Friedman 's framework himself .
When it came to macroeconomics , Friedman was fundamentally a Keynesian .
What was needed was a complete rejection of the entire methodological and analytical framework of Keynesianism .
Friedman was the first " conservative " Keyensian arguing against the " liberal " Keynesianism of the time .
So his intellectual victory did not translate into a fundamental change in the structure of public policy either in the US or abroad .
Free market public policy had absolutely NOTHING to do with our current financial crisis , just as the current policy response has absoultely NOTHING to do with free market public policy .
In fact , we are responding with public policies that are exactly what caused the problems in the first place .
Give me Hayek and Buchanan , and perhaps if we followed their methodological , analytical , and policy prescription the perhaps economics could be revitalized as a scientific discipline and our economy could recover from the current malaise which statism has entrapped us .
The first identity cards are being issued today to foreign nationals in Sheffield .
Foreign nationals who registered to have an ID card will be able to have one if their application has been processed , home secretary Jacqui Smith announced today .
Opening the Border Agency building in Sheffield , Ms Smith said : " What I have seen today demonstrates that we are successfully delivering two of our most important changes to the immigration system . "
The home secretary also met staff working on the UK's tough new immigration measure involving an Australian - style points system for migrant workers .
The first cards are being issued to those applying to stay in the UK as a student or spouse and all foreign nationals coming to the UK for longer than six months .
By 2014/15 it is estimated that 90 per cent of all foreign nationals will have been issued with an ID card .
The ID card will contain a facial image and fingerprints , thus locking the foreign national into a single identity .
It is hoped the ID cards will help businesses and enable a crack down on illegal working .
" ID cards will give employers a secure way of checking a migrant 's right to work and study in the UK and help people prove they are who they say are , " Ms Smith said .
The process of ID enrolment has already caught people seeking to remain in the country under false pretences .
In one case a person trying to stay in the country by applying for a marriage visa was detected and sentenced to eight months in prison .
But Michael Parker of No2ID said this was just an attempt to make it look as if the ID card plans are still on track when they have in fact halted .
Speaking to politics.co.uk , Mr Parker said : " The Boarder Agency has nothing to do with ID cards and this is an attempt by the government to brand immigration as part of the plans for national identity cards .
" They are trying to make it look as if ID cards are still on track .
It is coming up to 2009 and no contracts have been set up and public support for ID cards has dropped below 50 per cent . "
Foreign nationals have been able to enroll for identification cards since 25 November and will be issued with one as soon as their application is processed .
Paying taxes getting you down ?
Want to get away from it all ?
The great thing about tax havens is that they also double as great holiday destinations .
Whether it 's snorkelling in the Cayman Islands , yachting in Bermuda or shopping in the epic Dubai Mall , at first sight tax advisers do n't seem to have a hard job on their hands luring disgruntled non-doms from British shores .
Tax havens tend to be in exotic destinations , such as the Caribbean , that offer the kind of lifestyle perks that make the super - wealthy tick , from secretive private bankers to beachside properties and tight security .
Britain 's creaking transport system and grim winters just do n't get a look in .
An estimated 200,000 non-doms in the UK , though Treasury figures count 115,000 , have just over a month to decide whether to jump ship or pay £ 30,000 to retain special tax privileges when the new tax year begins .
The levy applies to individuals who have been in the country for at least seven years , a net that catches in excess of 20,000 people .
Of that number , the Treasury expects about 4,000 to pay up and 14,000 to opt for being taxed on a normal basis while 3,000 or so will up and fly away on their private jets .
The countries said to be top of the departures list are Switzerland , Monaco , Spain and Dubai .
However , closer to home , Ireland is also cropping up with increasing frequency due to its low corporation tax rate .
A survey of wealth advisers by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners ( Step ) found that 77 per cent of their super - rich clients were leaning towards Switzerland .
' A lot of people are looking to go back home if they have strong links there , ' says Step spokesman Jacob Rigg .
' But others are looking at Switzerland if they do n't have cultural ties anywhere , and Dubai is also pushing very hard .
Without wanting to sound cliched , these people are international citizens . '
Zurich or Geneva are seen as among the most attractive destinations because the retired can negotiate paying tax as a lump sum worked out from the rental value of their main residence .
Also , the Swiss do not count managing your fortune as work for tax purposes .
But according to Judith Ingham of law firm Withers Worldwide : ' Switzerland is not great if you want to work full - time for a third party .
A tax regime may be better or worse , but is no use if your business does n't have a branch there . '
However , tax advisers say it is not the £ 30,000 levy that is causing the most concern ; rather , it is the move to close loopholes surrounding offshore trusts .
You used to be able to keep money offshore until you needed it , then enjoy it tax - free when you did , says KPMG partner David Kilshaw .
' There is a lot of unease that a system that has been stable for 90 years is being altered .
The changes have come out of left field and that has shaken people 's confidence . '
But some argue that the threat of a non -dom exodus has been overstated .
Linda Foster , a tax partner at Deloitte , says : ' A lot of people are talking about it between themselves ; but realistically , not that many are going to want to uproot their families .
' The other thing people are saying is " I 'll go home , I 'll go back to where I came from " , and some countries are a bit more generous once you 've earned your money elsewhere .
Scandinavian countries , for example , are very benign as far as estate taxes are concerned . '
However , while Britons revel in moaning about the weather , public transport and immigration , in reality few would wish to live in exile .
Indeed , other than for tax reasons , some observers question why you would choose to live in Monaco , which according to UN figures is the world 's most densely populated country .
Tycoon Sir Philip Green , who is based there for tax purposes , spends as much time as he is allowed to at his suite at the Dorchester in London .
' Countries such as Luxembourg might have a different tax system - but is it cosmopolitan , has it got the schools or variety of entertainment ?
London is unique in that sense , ' says Guy Salter , deputy chairman of the luxury - industries trade association Walpole .
' Also , we are talking about a group of people at the apex in terms of wealth .
They are not going to live full - time in a place like the Caymans .
For people from the Middle East , for example , their whole life revolves around connections and meeting people , and it is easy to do that in London . '
Indeed , evidence that London is still seen as the place to have a base comes from the property market , with agents reporting strong demand for apartments in One Hyde Park , the world 's most expensive residential scheme .
According to agents Knight Frank , half the 80 apartments in the Richard Rogers - designed development , which cost an average of £ 20 m , have been sold .
' The market for " super- urban " properties that tick all the boxes on security and black onyx marble is in London and New York , ' says Salter .
Advisers suggest it is American non-doms who have the biggest problem and are most likely to simply return home .
Their own government is no fan of tax exiles and even if they were to quit Britain for the Bahamas , Uncle Sam would be peering over their shoulder ; in reality , US citizens are taxable anywhere in the world .
Indeed , even if an American gives up their passport , it can be 10 years before the government gives up jurisdiction over their taxable income .
' One of the big concerns is that Americans could end up paying tax under two systems , ' continues Ingham .
' If that is the case , people seconded by JP Morgan and other US banks will ask for their next posting to be back home . '
Indeed , Ingham warns that some US firms may be deterred from sending staff if they will be ensnared in the legislation : ' The UK will become less financially attractive to them and their seconding business .
It is very difficult because they will have to ensure staff are no worse off in terms of cash in their pockets . '
But whatever their position on the proposed tax changes , the thing both tax advisers and payers appear to be most irked about is the confusion .
They complain about how the government has handled the process , changing its mind and releasing information into the public domain in a piecemeal fashion .
One adviser says it is still unclear how offshore mortgages are affected , which could have serious implications , at least for the London property market : ' The new rules come into effect on 6 April , but at the moment it is like playing a game of football where you do n't know what the rules are until the referee tells you two minutes from time . '
' London has its drawbacks : public transport , weather and council services etc , ' says Ingham .
' For some this is the last straw .
Why continue here rather than Marseille , which is a nicer place to live ? '
But , she concludes : ' Monaco and all these alternate tax havens are great , but the question is whether your business is able to operate from a small island or jurisdiction .
Tax is not the only factor .'
The world 's best havens : where non-doms could go
Monaco
The tiny principality of Monaco , just 2 km square , enclosed on three sides by France and on the other by the Mediterranean , is one of just three jurisdictions condemned by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development as ' uncooperative tax havens ' .
It levies no income or property taxes , has a notoriously secretive banking industry - and has long been a destination of choice for entrepreneurs and their yachts .
Retailer Sir Philip Green and EasyJet founder Stelios Haji - Ioannou are among those who call it home , at least for some of the year .
Of the population of 35,000 , just 20 percent are locals , and the rest are ex-pats taking advantage of the sun , sea and minuscule tax bills .
Moving in is not cheap , however : a studio flat with a balcony in a luxurious high - rise development can go for as much as $ 2 m , while a family town house can fetch close to $ 40 m .
Deloitte tax partner Linda Foster says these days Monaco is a bit passé , and few non-doms have recently headed for the Riviera .
' It 's long - established , but it is n't particularly one that people are gravitating towards now , ' she says .
Cayman Islands
Deciding to make your new home in the Cayman Islands allows you to hold on to a little bit of British life , as the Union Jack appears in the corner of its flag .
Corporate raiders will find themselves welcome , as some of the earliest settlers were pirates .
According to legend , the benign tax regime can be traced to 1788 when islanders were rewarded by King George III for rescuing the crew of a stranded merchant ship , with the promise not to levy taxes again .
But however beautiful the beaches , a life there would not suit the adventurous , with just three islands and 100 square miles of ground to explore .
The capital , George Town , [ population 20,000 ] is also likely to disappoint those used to the bright lights of London .
International finance and tourism are the ' twin pillars ' of the economy , with more than 70,000 companies registered in the Cayman Islands , including 446 banks and trust companies .
Despite its size , 40 of the world 's largest banks have offices there .
Switzerland
Switzerland has been welcoming tax exiles from the UK for many years .
Musician David Bowie and Genesis frontman Phil Collins keep homes there - though both have claimed it is the peace and quiet , not the tax regime , that attracts them .
F1 hero Lewis Hamilton has threatened to follow suit .
What attracts wealthy taxpayers is that they can negotiate an agreement , for several years at a time , to pay a lump sum in tax up front , instead of providing detailed information about their finances .
Zurich , the Swiss financial capital , is an expensive place to live - but still , on average , cheaper than London , according to the Economist Intelligence Unit 's ( EIU ) worldwide cost of living survey .
And 2008 is the ideal year to take off for Switzerland : as well as peaceful lakeside living and plenty of skiing , this summer it will jointly host the Euro 2008 football tournament .
Dubai
The fast - growing desert city - state , with its glitzy skyscrapers , is one option for non-doms seeking a change of scene and a zero tax rate .
Described by Lonely Planet travel guides as ' flashy , fun and slightly surreal ' , Dubai has expanded at breakneck speed , as it strives to reinvent itself as a swanky tourist destination and financial services hub .
Linda Foster , tax partner at Deloitte and Touche , says a number of clients have mentioned Dubai as a possible destination .
Its location between London and Asia , she says , makes it an ideal hub for entrepreneurs .
It is also much cheaper than London .
Renting a mid-range , two - bed flat costs $ 2,952 ( £ 1,521 ) a month , against $ 7,347 in a smart part of London ; while the monthly wages for a maid are $ 435 compared to almost $ 3,000 in London .
Non -dom women may feel less at home , however : Dubai is a relatively conservative Muslim state .
The EIU warns : ' Short or tight clothing can be worn by women , but it will attract unwelcome attention . '
Examples :
[ Hepburn , 2005 ] Stray dogs are being skewered on hooks and dragged behind boats as live shark bait .
The cruel practice takes place on French - controlled Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean , where Prince William spent two holidays .
A six - month - old labrador pup was recently found ALIVE with a huge double hook through its snout — like the dog above — and another through a leg .
The pup was found in a coastal creek and is thought to have somehow freed itself from a fishing line .
But other dogs and kittens have been chomped up and swallowed by sharks .
The RSPCA plans to petition the French government , demanding an end to the hideous torture .
[ Collected on the Internet , September 2012 ] PETITION : Please help stop French Islander and Mexican fishermen using live dogs and kittens as shark bait To : The French and Mexican Governments
We have to stop this PLEASE help !
French Islanders using live puppies and kittens as shark bait ??
Please stop this senseless abuse to innocent puppies and kittens .
French Islander and Mexican fishermen are using LIVE puppies and kittens as shark bait !!
No living being should have to undergo this torture and insurmountable fear !
This is inhumane and must stop NOW .
Together we can make a difference and let our voice be heard as ONE .
Please sign this petition and please pass this along .
Thank you for caring .
Blessed be Currently the penalty is only 2 years and $ 36,000 that is far too little for such a heinous crime .
We urge that you raise the penalty to 10 years in prison with NO parole and a fine of $ 100,000 .
This will hopefully act as a deterrent and will stop these horrendous acts against innocent animals .
Please do the right thing and help us stop these people .
Islanders on the French controlled Reunion Island have been using live dogs as shark bait .
The Sun claims that “ a six - month - old labrador pup was recently found alive with a huge double hook through its snout – like the dog above – and another through a leg . ”
It is also claimed that local fisherman have also been using kittens !
Reunion Island is an overseas départements of France and an official region of France , giving it the same status as a province or state in other countries .
The claim that live dogs ( and cats ) were being used as bait by shark fisherman on Réunion Island ( a French - controlled territory just off the coast of Southern Africa in the Indian Ocean , east of Madagascar ) started hitting the world press in August 2005 and picked up steam in early October 2005 , when it was reported by publications such as the UK ’s Sun ( an excerpt from which is quoted at the head of this page ) and Sweden ’s Aftonbladet , complete with a heart - rending picture of a purported “ bait dog ” with a large hook through its muzzle .
Animal rights groups such as the RSPCA have taken up the cause of putting a stop to the horrible practice .
Many observers remain skeptical of such claims , however , positing theories that range from media and animal rights groups having been taken in by a hoax to a deliberate disinformation campaign being waged by activists who seek to end the slaughter of sharks for their fins and cartilage by Indian Ocean fisherman .
Arguments have flown back and forth over the practicality and plausibility ( or lack thereof ) of Réunion Islanders fishing for sharks in the manner described .
A 2006 Réunion newspaper article acknowledged the practice and reported the recent prosecution of a deliveryman ( and amateur fisherman ) on that island over animal cruelty charges associated with the described activity , suggesting that although there may be some truth to the shark - fishing claim , the practice does not appear to be as widespread or horrific ( or tolerated ) as implied by news reports in the foreign press .
Rather than describing hordes of shark fisherman impaling live dogs on hooks and dragging them behind boats as shark bait , the article noted that employing dogs in shark - fishing was largely the province of a small group of amateur fisherman rather than large numbers of professionals , that the dogs used were generally dead animals picked up from roadsides or culled from the island ’s large population of unwanted strays ( estimated at 150,000 ) , and that the no-longer - alive animals were attached to unattended buoyed “ shark trap ” platforms rather than dragged alive behind boats .
The French embassy in Washington , D.C. , also maintained that although the practice was not unknown , its occurrence and acceptance was not nearly as prevalent as recent news reports had made it seem :
Dear Sir / Madam , Thank you for writing to us with your concerns .
We too denounce the barbaric practices you refer to .
Such acts are obviously illegal and will not be tolerated on French territory .
But while we share your revulsion , we would like to emphasize that the practice of using live dogs or cats as shark bait is in fact exceptional and isolated .
It was never widespread nor traditional , but introduced by ruthless individuals , and has been strictly banned for decades now .
TV reports that raised initial indignation when they were aired in France and abroad in 2005 were filmed locally in 2003 following the discovery of a mutilated dog .
The last few months have seen two identical events which received heavy media coverage ( one of these events was soon determined to be a false alarm ) .
But can these vile occurrences lead us to conclude that there is an ongoing tradition of barbarism on Reunion Island ?
Reunion Island , a French territory and a European region , obeys the laws and regulations of the French Republic and the European Union .
It respects the rule of law and does not practice inhumane ancestral practices .
The facts that elicited your complaint are the act of a few isolated , irresponsible parties who are being sought by the police and will be brought to justice .
The authorities on the island are closely monitoring the situation ; one person is in custody and appeared in court on Friday September 30 , 2005 .
All suspicions of such acts will be investigated , and animal protection organizations that have any specific information on these matters are strongly encouraged to inform French police authorities .
The French minister for agriculture and fisheries , Dominique Bussereau , is fully aware of the media and public outcry regarding this issue , and has written to the French National Assembly to emphasize that several measures have been taken to strengthen already existing laws .
Veterinarians have been directed to immediately report any suspicious wounds to authorities , and the police will increase their inspections of fishing and pleasure vessels .
Meanwhile , a sterilization campaign , launched in 2001 to reduce the number of stray dogs and cats on the island , continues .
Animal rights are an important issue in France : over half of French households have at least one pet , and France has some of the world ’s most stringent animal rights legislation .
French law provides for the prosecution of those who are cruel to animals .
Voluntary cruelty to animals is punishable by a sentence of two years in prison and a 30,000 euro fine ( equivalent to about $ 36,000 ) .

The photo displayed at the top of this page , which has adorned several news articles and humane society - related web pages on this topic , is a frame from a 2005 video produced by the 30 Million Friends Foundation .
The video purportedly documents the case of a dog that had escaped from fishermen who planned to use it as shark bait ; skeptics have questioned the authenticity of the video , maintaining that it merely shows the aftermath of an accidental entanglement that has been mistakenly or deceptively misused for publicity ’s sake .
A similar video purporting to document the practice using kittens as shark bait appears to be a hoax , intercutting shots of kittens ’ being dunked in water and dangled from wires with unrelated footage of ocean fishing activity :
What happened
The Senate Armed Services Committee released a bipartisan report blaming former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Bush administration officials for the U.S. military ’s inhumane treatment and abuse of detainees at Guantánamo Bay and in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The report rejects Bush administration assertions that Abu Ghraib and other abuse cases were “ simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own . ” ( Los Angeles Times )
What the commentators said
So “ it is official , ” said Juan Cole in Informed Comment .
Rumsfeld and Bush “ bear responsibility for the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib , Bagram , and Guantánamo , and the tossing aside of the Geneva Conventions . ”
But why report that they and other “ high U.S. officials committed war crimes ” now , at a time of year “ when it will not get much play ” ?
“ Numerous courts - martial ” have found that the Abu Ghraib abusers violated “ lawful orders , ” said Dan Spencer in Red State , so this report seems like “ an attempt to rewrite the history of the war . ”
Either way , I ’m glad we had “ serious people ” willing to delve into the “ unsavory issues ” of how to deal with the “ Islamic extremists waging war against us . ”
It ’s worth noting that their policies have “ kept us safe for more than seven years . ”
“ These abuses did not keep Americans safe , ” said Jack Balkin in Balkinazation .
In fact , the report rightly states that they ’ve “ actually undermined our national security ” by weakening our “ moral authority ” and harming our intelligence gathering .
It ’s unlikely that Rumsfeld or other top officials will ever face criminal prosecution , but Americans “ need to know the truth about what happened , ” in part so we do n’t do it again .
“ I ’m more inclined to blame al Qaeda ” than Rumsfeld , said Boston Herald editor Jules Crittenden in his blog , “ for the uncomfortable circumstances in which detainees find themselves . ”
And while “ there were some excesses , ” the question of terrorist interrogation and incarceration is “ Obama ’s problem now . ”
He ’ll find the answers are n’t so easy .
' Footsie to fall 90 % from all - time high '
The severity of the ongoing economic and market torment has now led one analyst to forecast that the FTSE 100 index could plummet to below the 1000 level in the coming years .
Looking bearish :
The merchants of doom are out , with one analyst predicting more big falls
Bill Adlard , a professional trader and market analyst , at Chart - Guide.com gave
This is Money , the most gloomy - but notably the most accurate - forecast for how the index would fare in 2008 .
Now Adlard says : ' I believe over the coming five years the FTSE 100 could fall by around 90 % - from its all time high in 1999 of 6930 .
It could easily be below 1000 in five years time .
' The UK market will reflect what happened in the US between 1929 and 1932 when the Dow Jones dropped by 90 % from 397 to 40 points .
I expect something of the same from the Footsie . '
Speaking to This is Money 12 months ago , Adlard said that given the coupling of poor economic data and the ongoing global credit crunch , he believed that the index could pull back to its lows of 2003 – a fall of more than 40 % .
In early trading on 10 October , 2008 , the Footsie , had collapsed to 3873 - a fall of 40 % since the start of the year - and Adlard 's prediction had come to fruition .
By the year 's end , the index had clawed back some of its fall and finished 31 % down over the 12 months .
At mid morning trading on 28 January , 2009 , the Footsie was at 4266.31 .
On 31 December 2007 , the index was riding far higher at 6457 – giving a fall of 34 % in the past 13 months .
It hit its all time high of 6930 , back on 31 December 1999 , and today 's level exemplifies a drop of 38 % since then .
For the rest of 2009 , Adlard expects the index of the UK's top 100 firms to ' thrash about between 4,500 and 3,500 ' before ultimately crashing through the lower barrier .
Justin Urquhart Stewart , at Seven Investment Management , says : ' It is possible that the index could fall that far but I do believe it is unlikely . '
For his part , Mark Dampier , head of investment research , at financial adviser , Hargreaves Lansdown , believes that the mountain of problems and debt to be worked through is immense and as such does not lend itself to much good news right now .
The situation has not got much better given that the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) declared that the British economy will contract by 2.8 % this year - the worst of any Western country .
Dampier says : ' The world economy is in a mess .
Take Spain as an example , which is looking at having some 20 % unemployment .
Could the market fall further ?
Of course it could , the Footsie reaching 2000 would not be unreasonable .
But I am always sceptical of making such large predictions .
' The stock market is not pricing in a great depression scenario , so if the environment greatly deteriorates , the market will fall further .
And the landscape certainly does not look great for 2009 . '
Dampier believes that the in the UK , we need to see the housing market bottom out and the sector ' could easily fall another 20 % ' .
He adds : ' Balance sheets need to be squared up , people need to start paying back their debt and banks need to re-capitalise . '
About the artist :
Mel Ramos was born on July 24 , 1935 in Sacramento , CA
The popularity of his works is evident in the fact that since 1959 he has participated in more than 120 group shows .
He has enjoyed great success and critical acclaim as an adventuresome artist with the creativity and sense of humor it takes to remain on top .
Mel Ramos received his first important recognition in the early 1960s .
Ramos , along with other artists such as Andy Warhol , Roy Lichtenstein , Claes Oldenburg and James Rosenquist , produced art works that celebrated aspects of popular culture as represented in mass media .
His paintings were shown along with theirs in major exhibitions of Pop Art both in this country and in Europe and were reproduced , often with irony , in books , catalogs , and periodicals throughout the world .
Ramos was born in 1935 at Sacramento , California .
Between 1954 and 1958 he studied at the Sacramento City College , the San José State College and the Sacramento State College , finishing with an M.A. From 1958 he taught at various institutions including Elk Grove High School , Mira Lama High School and California State College .
In 1962 - 63 he began a series of garishly colored super - heroes taken from comic strips using a thick oleaginous pigment .
In 1963 he was first included in a collective exhibition in Pop Goes the East at the Contemporary Art Museum , Houston .
In 1964 he had his first one - man exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery , New York .
In 1965 he developed a specific kind of Pop Art iconography by combining nude pin-up girls from American magazines and advertisements with branded products .
In 1966 he exhibited at the Galerie Ricke , Kassel .
In 1967 he had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art ;
In 1969 he was represented in the exhibition Human Concerns at the Whitney Museum , New York , and had a one - man exhibition at the Gegenverkehr , Aachen .
He exhibited at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts , Salt Lake City , in 1972 , and was represented at the Pop Art exhibition at the Whitney Museum , New York , in 1974 .
In 1975 he had a retrospective at the Museum Haus Lange , Krefeld , and in 1977 at the Oakland Museum , California .
In 1978 he was included in the exhibition Art About Art , Whitney Museum , New York and at the Church Fine Arts Gallery , University of Nevada , Reno , and the Galeria Plura , Milan , Italy .
In 1980 The Rose Art Museum , Brandeis University presented Mel Ramos : A Twenty Year Survey .
1981 saw a solo show at the Louis K. Meisel Gallery in New York City ; in 1985 the Meisel Gallery mounted another , The Four Seasons , and he has been showing regularly with them since then : Beauty And The Beast in 1989 , The Artist 's Studio in 1991 , Mel Ramos - The Heroines of 1962 - 64 , and in 1993 Mel Ramos : The Unfinished Painting Series .
Ramos has also been featured at the Hokin / Kaufman Gallery , Chicago ( 1986 ) ; Mel Ramos - Early Paintings was presented by Galerie Tanja Grunert , Cologne , West Germany in 1986 , and Studio Trisorio , Naples , Italy featured his works in 1987 .
In 1994 - 95 Mel Ramos - Retrospective , a traveling exhibition in Germany and Austria , was shown at the Kunstverein Lingen , Lingen ; the Mannheimer Kunstverein , Mannheim ; the Kunsthalle zu Kiel , Kiel ; and then went to Vienna under title Mel Ramos : Pop Art Images , " showing at the Hochscule fur Angewandte Kunst .
Some critical observers of the " art scene " persist in classifying Mel Ramos as a Pop Artist .
His identification with the Pop movement of the 1960's was much too narrow to account for the braoder context of his paintings .
His humor is not satire of ridicule .
His " parodies " are respectful , affectionate tributes , a celebration of images with personal meanining .
A retrospective of over 50 years of his work opened at the Crocker Art Museum in his hometown of Sacramento on June 2 , 2012 .
This show is " the first major exhibition of his work in his hometown " , and his first American retrospective in 35 years .
Help Test jQuery 1.3 Beta 1
Posted on by
The jQuery team has been working hard on the new release of the jQuery library and it ’s ready for some in - depth testing !
j Query 1.3 is not ready for production use yet but we need help to weed out any bugs that might ’ve snuck through .
Download
A copy of jQuery 1.3b1 can be found here :
Please do n’t use minified or packed versions of jQuery when testing – it makes locating bugs difficult .
Major Areas of Change
Here are some of the areas that have seen major changes and are most likely to cause problems in your code :
Selector Engine –
The selector code has undergone a complete rewrite – it ’s likely that some edge cases still exist here .
DOM Manipulation ( append / prepend / before / after ) –
This code has also undergone a large rewrite along with some of the logic for executing inline script elements .
.offset ( ) – Another method that has been completely rewritten .
Event Namespaces –
The logic for handling namespaced events has been completely rewritten .
Event Triggering –
When triggering an event the event now bubbles up the DOM – this is likely to cause some problems .
While we wo n’t get into the particulars of all the new features that are in j Query 1.3 ( we ’ll do that later , when it ’s ready for final release – scheduled for January 14th ) we do appreciate any / all feedback that you can provide .
How to provide feedback :
Submit a bug to the jQuery bug tracker ( you will need to create an account , first ) .
Be sure to include a simple test case for any problem that you ’re experiencing ( either attach the test case or provide a link ) .
Mention that you ’re testing “ jQuery 1.3 Beta 1 ” ( otherwise your ticket will get confused with another release ) .
Email a link to your test case and bug report to the jQuery Dev list so that the dev team will be notified about your issue .
Thanks to everyone , in advance , for all your help in testing this release .
We ’re really excited about this release and ca n’t wait to get it into your hands .
Ezra Klein at American Prospect has already commented on some footage that I just saw on CNN .
Paul Krugman marshalled his critique of Obamaâ€™s stimulus plan from his blog onto the op - ed page of todayâ€™s New York Times .
A front - page story in the same newspaper suggests that Democratic legislators have been reading Krugman .
Obama responded by throwing down the gauntletÂ for people in general , and Krugman specifically , to put forward better stimulus ideas .
As Klein notes , Krugman has already been pretty clear about his constructive proposal : a larger stimulus package with proportionally more new spending and fewer tax cuts .
In another post , Klein outlines a more specific proposal from theÂ man who gave the PEFâ€™s inaugural Galbraith lecture : hiking Social Security benefits and cutting Social Security premiums .
Klein ( correctly ) argues that Social Security premiums are regressive because they apply only to the first $ 102,000 of income .
By comparison , Canada Pension Plan premiums applyÂ only toÂ the first $ 46,000 of income , which makes them much more regressive .
I would put far more emphasis on improving benefits than on cutting premiums .
But if we are going to have tax cuts , we should indeed aim to cut regressive taxes .
UPDATE ( Jan. 11 ) : Another specific suggestion for Obama
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Just weeks before the 2004 presidential election , Donald Rumsfeld , then secretary of defense , appeared at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City .
After the secretary finished , with customary panache , assessing the state of the war on terrorism ( “ Have there been setbacks in Afghanistan and Iraq ?
You bet ” ) , a young man in a business suit asked politely , “ Mr. Secretary , you have a very impressive career both within… and outside the government sector .
As such a credible leader , could you please explain to us what your definition of the word ‘ accountability ’ is ? ”
Rumsfeld seemed nonplussed .
“ Capability ? ” he asked .
“ Accountability , ” the young man repeated politely , yet firmly .
“ Oh no , I do n’t know that I can , ” the secretary said .
He cast out a few platitudes — ” checks and balances , ” “ gray areas , ” “ individuals who have responsibilities ” — only to find his stride by turning to Pentagon personnel metrics .
He concluded that “ You need to put in place a series of things that hold people reasonably accountable for their actions , and people , I think , expect that . ”
Today , with Rumsfeld and his former boss on their way to the judgment of history , the question of accountability looms large .
From liberals fantasizing about Dick Cheney in handcuffs , to cia officials taking out insurance against prosecution , many are wondering :
Will there be redress for the crimes of the Bush administration — and if so , what form should it take ?
The list of potential legal breaches is , of course , enormous ; by one count , the administration has broken 269 laws , both domestic and international .
It begins with illegal wiretapping and surveillance ( which in the view of many experts violated the Fourth Amendment , the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 , and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , for starters ) , the politicization of the Justice Department and the firing of nine US attorneys , and numerous instances of obstruction of justice — from the destruction of cia interrogation tapes to the willful misleading of Congress and the public .
Perhaps the paramount charge that legal experts have zeroed in on is the state - approved torture that violated not just the Geneva Conventions and the UN Convention Against Torture but also the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the 1996 War Crimes Act , which prohibits humiliating and degrading treatment and other “ outrages upon personal dignity . ”
With these abuses in mind , lawyers , policymakers , and others have identified three models from which to fashion a response to the Bush era .
In decreasing order of opprobrium , the choices are impeachment , prosecution , and investigative commission .
Impeachment , according tothe consensus emerging in Washington and among a wide spectrum of lawyers and human rights advocates , seems both unlikely and undesirable .
Though it has reared its head periodically over the past eight years — most notably with Rep.
Dennis Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment against Bush and Cheney — Democratic leaders have declared the option “ off the table . ”
And at this point , it ’s a bit moot .
The idea of prosecution has fared only slightly better .
In Italy , 26 Americans — including cia agents , a military attaché , and several diplomats — face charges in conjunction with the rendition of radical cleric Abu Omar to Egypt .
Human rights organizations , notably the Center for Constitutional Rights , have teamed up with partners in Germany and France to pursue charges against Rumsfeld for violating the Convention Against Torture , though so far to little effect .
The possibility of other cases has been raised , most recently in British barrister Philippe Sands ’ warning that Congress should investigate the torture question , for “ if the United States does n’t address this , other countries will . ”
( See opposite page . )
More significantly , there have also been rumblings about prosecution here at home .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has already appointed a special prosecutor to look into the Justice Department firings ; potential targets include four top doj officials as well as Karl Rove and Harriet Miers .
In June , 56 congressional Democrats signed a letter to Mukasey seeking an investigation into detainee abuses with an eye toward violations of “ federal criminal laws . ”
Then , after a September conference on the crimes of the Bush administration sponsored by the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , attendees launched a committee to seek the prosecution of the president , chaired by the school ’s dean , Lawrence Velvel .
Also in September , Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - Wis. ) introduced the Executive Branch Accountability
Act of 2008 , which calls for the new president to “ investigate Bush / Cheney administration officials ’ alleged crimes and hold them accountable for any illegal acts . ”
Baldwin ’s plan would require Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to consider the possibility of criminal charges — a model whose historical precedents Americans are only too familiar with .
Still , when I asked a range of legal and political experts about the prosecution option , few seemed to consider it worthwhile — at least at this point .
“ We need some sort of accountability , ” Georgetown law professor Marty Lederman told me , “ but it wo n’t necessarily be by prosecutions . ”
The reasons are practical as well as philosophical .
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz explained that “ the real question is whether investigating one ’s political opponents poses too great a risk of criminalizing policy differences — especially when these differences are highly emotional and contentious . ”
Others , including nyu law professor and former aclu president Norman Dorsen , who chaired two investigative commissions for the Ford and Clinton administrations , warn of the dangers of appearing vengeful , or even creating sympathy for those under scrutiny .
After all , some argue , John Yoo , Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , and the lot are already persona non grata ; though they ’ll likely do fine in the private sector or academia , their reputations are indelibly tarnished and their political careers effectively over .
Perhaps the biggest question , though , is one of political will given that Americans , it seems , really are n’t that upset about what has happened .
A recent University of Maryland poll found that tolerance for torture of suspected terrorists has actually risen in recent years , from 36 percent in 2006 to 44 percent last June .
Barack Obama ’s campaign message reinforced this reluctance to prosecute .
In essence , he has promised to create a national unity government , a notion that does n’t square with criminally charging one ’s predecessors .
As Obama put it last April , “ I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we ’ve got too many problems we ’ve got to solve . ”
Obama ’s advisers , too , have let it be known that prosecutions are not on the agenda except for “ egregious crimes , ” a term that seems purposely vague .
Only Joe Biden , perhaps straying from his talking points ( again ) , has seemed open to the possibility .
“ If there has been a basis upon which you can pursue someone for a criminal violation , they will be pursued , ” he said last fall , “ not out of vengeance , not out of retribution — out of the need to preserve the notion that no one , no attorney general , no president , no one is above the law . ”
But it is not just political caution that stands in the way of prosecution .
It is also the fact that torture and other alleged crimes were sanctioned by legal advice within the administration and , in some cases , by Congress .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel has the authority to interpret the law for the executive ; these interpretations — including the “ torture memos ” — are considered binding until they are reversed or disavowed .
In addition , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 limited the abuses that can be prosecuted under the War Crimes
Act to only the most extreme violations of the Geneva Conventions ( thus codifying the distinction between “ torture ” and “ degrading treatment ” ) ; the changes were made retroactive to 1997 , creating what Garth Meintjes , a noted authority on transitional justice and amnesties , has called “ quasi amnesties . ”
These changes are one reason why the Senate armed services and judiciary committees , in their hearings on torture last summer , seemed to focus on proving perjury as much as substantive violations of law .
With impeachment out of the picture and prosecution receding as a possibility , attention has turned to an investigative commission along the lines of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that followed the end of apartheid in South Africa , the 1967 Kerner Commission on race , or the 9/11 Commission ; the best model may be the Church Committee , Congress ’ response to the 1970s revelations on Watergate , cia destabilization programs abroad , and surveillance of Americans .
( The Church hearings led to creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court . )
Perhaps recognizing that his impeachment bill is past its sell - by date , Kucinich has cottoned to the commission idea , announcing in September that he was looking to introduce legislation to launch just such a body .
As Walter Lippmann once wrote , congressional commissions can turn into a free - for - all as politicians , “ starved of their legitimate food for thought , go on a wild and feverish manhunt , and do not stop at cannibalism . ”
Accordingly , some favor the idea of an independent commission , run by someone of the stature of Plamegate prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald or former New York US Attorney Mary Jo White , in the hope that this format would be less politically charged .
The goal would be to prove Lippmann wrong and establish the facts in a reliable , nonpartisan fashion — to create an authoritative narrative that the nation could share .
But what kind of commission makes all the difference .
Truth and reconciliation commissions , which the United States has never had at the federal level , are for healing .
Watergate - style commissions bear the prospect of condemnation , exposure , and punishment .
Then there is the question of just what is to be found :
Much of what happened in the run-up to the war , the torture scandal , or the National Security Agency wiretaps has already been documented in news articles , books , and congressional probes ; what is missing , though , is the full story about who knew what and when .
Perhaps a commission could get members of the Bush administration to reveal these details .
Perhaps there are other skeletons to be unearthed .
The best hope , Meintjes ruefully acknowledges , is for a “ negotiated truth ” along the lines of the 9/11 Commission .
As attorney Scott Horton has pointed out in Harper ’s , “ Investigative commissions can provide truth … but they cannot provide justice . ”
Yet it ’s also true that once a commission begins , it is hard to control just where it will go .
Although many who embrace the idea of a commission have disavowed prosecution , once the facts are out , criminal charges may yet follow .
If prosecution looms as a possibility , testimony may be difficult to obtain .
But if immunity is offered — a common element in truth and reconciliation commissions — prosecutions may prove problematic .
To be sure , any commission would be time - consuming and could distract the new administration from the urgent work of addressing the war in Iraq and the financial crisis .
And there ’s the problem of potential complicity among those charged with the investigation .
Members of Congress who voted for war , for example , would rather not revisit that moment ; ditto those who were briefed on the wiretaps and the cia interrogation techniques .
Yet the downside of not addressing crimes of power is immense .
It creates a space for lingering suspicion that the new president might want to keep some of the excessive authority Bush carved out for himself .
What ’s more , signaling a new way forward in the matter of torture could go a long way toward reestablishing the government ’s credibility at home and abroad .
One possibility , suggests Dorsen , is for Congress or a blue - ribbon citizens ’ commission to hold investigative hearings ; only if crimes are revealed would the attorney general consider ( very carefully ) what the consequences of prosecution would be .
Whatever form it takes , the accounting will not be easy .
As one close observer has put it , “ Who would want the job of cleaning the Augean stables anyway ? ”
Congress may not be able to redirect the rivers as Hercules did to wash out the accumulated filth , but it can go a long way in that direction .
Accountability is a worthy goal even if incomplete .
To borrow a phrase from Chile ’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission , the best we can hope for is “ all the truth and as much justice as possible . ”

January 23 , 2009 --
On January 18 , voters in El Salvador went to the polls to elect 262 mayors , one for every municipality in the country , and 84 deputies to the national Legislative Assembly .
At the end of a tense day of voting , filled with legal disputes and allegations of irregularities and fraud , the leftist FMLN ( Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front ) celebrated victory , despite losing the capital city to the right - wing ARENA ( Nationalist Republican Alliance ) party .
The stage is now set for March 15 , when Salvadorans will elect a new president , with the choice between Mauricio Funes of the FMLN , a former independent journalist , and ARENA ’s Rodrigo Ávila , a former private security mogul and director of the national police force ( PNC ) .
As preliminary results of municipal and legislative races came in on January 18 , the FMLN declared itself the strongest political force in the country , having won the largest bloc of deputies in the Legislative Assembly with 100,000 more votes nationally than ARENA .
With official results yet to be announced , the FMLN appears to have won 43 % of the national vote for deputies , making it the most popular party in El Salvador by 5 - 6 percentage points over ARENA .
Such an achievement puts the party on the path to winning the presidency and continues the it ’s steady increase in legislative seats since 1994 , when the FMLN first entered electoral politics having converted itself from guerrilla force via the 1992 Peace Accords .
When the Supreme Electoral Tribunal ( TSE ) announces its final tally , the FMLN will likely increase its number of legislative deputies by three , while ARENA has lost two seats .
These results would give the FMLN 35 seats in the Assembly to ARENA ’s 32 .
On the other hand , ARENA claimed victory for its mayoral candidate , Norman Quijano , in the capital city of San Salvador , which had been governed as a strategically symbolic stronghold of the FMLN for the last twelve years .
Even in defeat , FMLN incumbent Violeta Menjívar , received more votes than she had in 2006 .
FMLN leaders believe that Quijano ’s victory was due in part to the migration of thousands of voters into San Salvador , a claim backed up by the fact that Menjívar had a significant lead in opinion polls in the days leading up to the January 18 vote .
Despite losing the race in San Salvador , the FMLN won mayors ’ offices in most of the other large cities in the metropolitan area , including Mejicanos , Apopa , and San Marcos .
Overall , the FMLN increased the number of municipalities it will govern by more than 50 % percent , to around 90 municipalities ( some have yet to be decided ) , indicating broad support for the leftist party across the country , in both rural and urban areas .
The FMLN also claimed victory in three of the next four largest cities in the country : Soyapango , Santa Tecla , and Santa Ana .
The latter is an especially significant victory , given that the incumbent mayor , Orlando Mena of the Christian Democrat Party ( PDC ) , had governed the city for nine years .
The FMLN also won several smaller municipalities that it had not governed in recent years , including La Union , Izalco , Perquin and Zacatecaluca .
The wins in La Union and Perquin signify an important growth in rural votes for the FMLN , an ongoing goal of the party since its inception .
Perquin and Izalco are also symbolically important for the party .
Perquin , which the FMLN reclaimed after losing there to ARENA in 2006 , has historically been an FMLN stronghold , and was a focal point of resistance during El Salvador ’s 1980 - 1992 civil war .
Izalco , on the other hand , is the site of an uprising that led to the infamous 1932 massacre of some 30,000 indigenous peasants who were aligned with FMLN namesake Farabundo Martí .
The FMLN will govern Izalco for the first time beginning May 1 , when newly elected mayors take office .
In the Legislative Assembly , El Salvador ’s complicated residual voting system will likely give disproportionate representation to the right - wing National Conciliation Party ( PCN ) party .
Following ARENA and the FMLN , the PCN has retained its position as the third largest bloc in the Assembly with 11 seats , while the center - right PDC will have 5 seats .
The PCN will have 13 % of the seats in the Assembly despite receiving only 8.5 % of the legislative vote .
The center - left CD ( Democratic Change ) will have just one seat , while the FDR ( Democratic Revolutionary Front ) , a center - left split - off from the FMLN , failed to win a single seat , which should , according to Salvadoran law , result in the dissolution of the party .
Inaccuracies in voter rolls lead open door for fraud
While national and international observers ’
Election Day reports indicate consistent irregularities across voting centers , the pre-election context in El Salvador points to large scale fraud that was set in motion long before that day ever came .
The most glaring examples of a skewed electoral system result from the actions of the Legislative Assembly and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal surrounding census data and the voter registry .
In September of 2008 , the Assembly issued the official convocation of the 2009 election period ahead of schedule , days before data from the 2007 census was officially released by the government .
As a result , the number of legislative seats apportioned to each of El Salvador ’s 14 departments through the 2009 election is based on 1998 census data , which grossly underestimates the current population of San Salvador and other major cities , thus granting disproportional representation to the more conservative rural areas , which have largely lost population through emigration .
In addition to the faulty configuration of deputies , the voter registry is another outstanding deficiency in the electoral process .
Numerous reports of out - of - date voter rolls reveal that , across the country , deceased , incarcerated and relocated persons remain registered to vote .
In spite of constitutional and electoral regulations to the contrary , not all of the political parties have had equal access to the current registry of naturalized citizens , upon which voter rolls are based .
By controlling access to the citizen registry , the ARENA party prevents comparison of this registry to the voter rolls , and the resolution of inconsistencies between the two .
The right - wing dominated TSE failed to attend to this problem in advance of the 2009 elections , despite a prominent 2008 recommendation by the Organization of American States that this obstruction to electoral integrity be resolved .
Issues surrounding the voter registry left the January elections extremely vulnerable to fraud committed by parties bringing in people from Guatemala , Honduras and Nicaragua to vote , as well as transporting voters from other municipalities to areas with more hotly contested races .
Incidences of deceased and relocated persons on the voter registry allowed for others to vote using those identities and counterfeit identification cards ( DUIs - Unique Identification Documents ) .
Reports of this nature were rampant leading up to and during Election Day .
FMLN representatives reported that six buses of foreigners were detained in the department of La Unión , and another 3 buses in the department of Usulután .
Meanwhile , the National Civilian Police reported a bus of Nicaraguans in the municipality of San Miguel .
Observers also heard reports of large groups of people being housed in government buildings in San Salvador , the most sought - after municipality for ARENA , the night before the election .
Despite these alarming incidents , there is hope that localized efforts by party activists will be effective in defending the legitimacy of the vote across El Salvador in March .
In San Isidro Cabañas , during the week before the municipal election , members of the FMLN , PCN , PDC , and CD parties filed a complaint with the TSE stating that the incumbent ARENA mayoral candidate was distributing voter cards to Honduran citizens that were found in the voter registry .
On the day of the election , party representatives on the Municipal Electoral Committee ( JEM ) , overriding the opposition of ARENA ’s representative , agreed to shut down the vote at midday due to the influx of foreign voters .
Thanks to the active local response , the people of San Isidro Cabañas will have another opportunity for a fair election in a special revote on January 25 .
Although the FMLN has pushed for solutions to voter registry - related fraud – including public access to the citizen registry , the use of ultraviolet lights at voting tables to verify DUIs , and “ residential voting , ” in which citizens would vote at smaller polling places in their own neighborhoods , thus decreasing the likelihood of non-residents voting – these recommendations have either gone unaddressed or been dismissed by the TSE .
Faced with a March presidential election that will again be based on inaccurate voter rolls , the FMLN is counting on grassroots organizing and the appeal of its candidate Funes to transcend the defamatory , fear - based campaign that ARENA , with the complicity of the mainstream press , has been running for months .
With Rodrigo Ávila trailing Mauricio Funes by 17 points in some recent polling , ARENA seems resigned to the fact that it cannot win in the ‘ first round ’ presidential election on March 15 .
Its strategy , instead , is to force a run-off election by preventing the FMLN from winning the absolute majority ( 50 % plus one vote ) that it will need to gain the presidency .
In a second round run-off , only the two parties with the most votes would compete , giving ARENA the advantage of attracting votes from supporters of the smaller right - wing parties .
Although the movement of voters from one municipality to another do n’t affect the results of a nation - wide presidential election , the right - wing is expected to again bring foreigners to the polls in order to prevent a majority FMLN vote in the first round .
In order to prevent voter fraud and maintain confidence in its campaign , the FMLN will rely on the power of its activists to get out the vote and defend a fair election .
In the months leading up to the January elections , the FMLN ’s limited resources , which consist primarily of the energy of its activist base , were split between campaigning on a local and departmental level , while also maintaining the momentum of the presidential contest .
Meanwhile , ARENA ’s virtually unlimited monetary resources and media exposure contributed to Quijano ’s victory in San Salvador .
With less than two months remaining before the presidential elections , FMLN activists are now able to focus all of their attention on one concerted effort towards a presidential victory .
Although ARENA and the right - wing of El Salvador have a symbolic victory in San Salvador and more material resources in their pocket , the widespread and numerous FMLN wins in the January 18 elections prove that , on the national level , a plurality of voters continue to see the FMLN as a hopeful alternative to 20 years of ARENA - led government .
Party leadership is counting on grassroots participation to curtail voter fraud and deliver a presidential victory in March , while the party has promised not only to address El Salvador ’s economic and social disparities , but also to resolve concerns about the electoral system , thus ensuring fairness and transparency in future elections .

Police already use hackers ' tools for ' remote searching '
The Home Office has signed up to an EU strategy against cybercrime that " encourages " police across Europe to remotely access personal computers .
The plan has sparked fears that the government is looking to increase police powers to hack into people 's computers without a court warrant .
UK police already do a " small number " of such operations under existing law .
However , the Home Office said the EU agreement would not affect police behaviour and was not legally binding .
The plan , drawn up by the Council of the European Union , makes broad statements on how to improve European cyber crime - fighting , including inviting countries to introduce remote searches if they are already provided for under national law .
In a statement regarding the agreement , the Council stated that " the new strategy encourages [ the police and the private sector ] to resort to remote searches . "
British law already allows police to remotely access computers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , which allows surveillance to " prevent or detect serious crime " .
A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) told The Times newspaper that police were already carrying out a small number of these operations among the 194 clandestine searches last year of people 's homes , offices , and hotel rooms .
" The UK has agreed to a strategic approach to tackling cybercrime with other EU member states , but this is separate from existing UK laws , " the Home Office said in a statement , adding that the plan is not legally binding and there is no timescale for implementing the strategy .
' Sophisticated products ' Jacques Barrot , Vice - President of the European Commission , said in a statement that the goal is to ensure EU countries are committed to the fight against computer crime .
Professor Peter Sommer , a cybercrime expert at the London School of Economics , doubts that the strategy will increase the amount of police hacking .
" The products are out there , they 've been available for quite a long time and they are pretty sophisticated , however they probably are n't going to get used very much , " he told BBC News .
Most anti-virus programs and firewalls will detect surveillance attempts because they are designed to stop the remote access software or Trojan - type viruses that hackers - even police hackers - usually use , he explained .
Prof Sommer also pointed out that evidence gathered from hacking is difficult to defend in court , because prosecutors must prove that it has not been tampered with .
" Normally , when computers are examined forensically , a great deal of care is taken to ensure that nothing is written to the computer when the examination is taking place , " said Prof Sommer .
" Once you start looking at a computer remotely , all of those controls vanish . "

After a resounding electoral defeat , in which voters in this once - red state rejected Republicans McCain , Schaffer , and Musgrave , the Colorado Republican Party will undoubtedly be asking themselves , “ Why did we lose ? ”
I want to let them know that they lost the vote of many former supporters ( including myself ) because they have chosen to embrace the Religious Right .
I voted Republican in 1996 , 2000 , and 2004 .
I believe in limited government , individual rights , free market capitalism , a strong national defense , and the right to keep and bear arms – positions that one normally associates with Republicans .
But I did n’t vote for a single Republican in 2008 .
I ’ve become increasingly alienated by the Republicans ” embrace of the religious “ social conservative ” agenda , including attempts to ban abortion , embryonic stem cell research , and gay marriage .
The Founding Fathers correctly recognized that the proper function of government is to protect individual rights , such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion .
But freedom of religion also implies freedom * from * religion .
As Thomas Jefferson famously put it , there should be a “ wall of separation ” between church and state .
Public policy should not be based on religious doctrines .
Instead , the government ’s role is to protect each person ’s right to practice his or her religion as a private matter and to forbid them from forcibly imposing their particular views on others .
And this is precisely why I find the Republican Party ’s embrace of the Religious Right so dangerous .
If a woman chooses not to have an abortion for reasons of personal faith , then I completely respect her right to do so .
But she cannot impose her particular religious views on others .
Other women must have the same right to decide that deeply personal issue for themselves .
The Religious Right ’s goal of outlawing abortions would violate that important right , and sacrifice the lives of actual women for clumps of cells that are only potential ( but not yet actual ) human beings , based on religious dogma .
As a physician , I find that position abhorrent and deeply anti-life .
In his October 24 , 2008 radio broadcast , Rush Limbaugh told pro-choice secular supporters of limited government such as myself that we should leave the Republican Party .
Many of us have already taken his advice and changed our affiliation to “ independent . ”
The Republican Party stands at an important crossroads .
The Republican Party could choose to follow the principles of the American Founding Fathers and promote a limited government that protected individual rights but otherwise left people alone to live their lives .
This includes affirming the principle of the separation of church and state .
If they did so , I would happily support it .
Or the Republican Party could instead choose to become the party of the Religious Right and seek to forcibly impose the religious values of one particular constituency over others ( thus violating everyone else ’s rights ) .
In that case , it will continue to alienate many voters and lose elections — and deservedly so .
Even though I no longer regard myself as a Republican , I definitely regard myself as a loyal American .
My parents immigrated legally from Taiwan to America over 40 years ago .
They had very little money , but they worked hard , sent two children to college and medical school , and are now enjoying a well - earned and comfortable retirement .
Their life has been a real - life embodiment of the American dream .
America is a beacon of hope to millions of people around the world precisely because our system of government allows honest , hard - working people to prosper and thrive .
Our system is a testament to the genius of the Founding Fathers , who recognized that the proper function of government is to protect individual rights , such as our rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Hence , I believe the Republican Party should choose the first path – the path of limited government , separation of church and state , and protection of individual rights .
This is the America that brought my parents from a ocean away in hopes of a better life for themselves and their children .
This is the America I want to live in .
And this is the America I want the Republican Party to stand for .

Things are getting worse by the day .
The streets here in Gaza City have been empty .
It 's dangerous to go on the balcony but if you risk looking out you can see columns of black smoke rising from the north .
The sound of automatic machine gun fire from the Apache helicopters I find most terrifying .
Overnight , it seems the Israeli tanks progressed further into Gaza , and now we 've heard about the tank shelling at a UN school in Jabalya camp killing more than 30 people .
I found out about that when the electricity resumed for a short time in the evening and I was able to get online .
I 'm appalled but not surprised : if you have tanks on high ground to the east of Jabalya firing down on such a densely populated area , this kind of bloodshed can be expected .
Personally I 've had a big decision to make .
I 've had to evacuate Alaa from our family home .
It 's just too risky for a woman who is due to give birth shortly , to stay here in our apartment which is quite a distance from the nearest hospital .
I managed to find a taxi driver willing to make the journey , and moved her to stay at her parents ' house in Al Masser near the Beach refugee camp which at least is closer to a small clinic .
Alaa packed up all the things for the baby – the first aid kit , some diapers , her own clothes .
She did n't want to go .
I can't describe how sad it is to be apart from your wife in these circumstances .
I want to be with her , but I also have the responsibility of my younger brothers , my sisters and their kids and my mother , especially after what happened to our father , who was killed by an Israeli air strike on our farm in northern Gaza on Saturday .
Emotionally my mother has been very strong .
But I saw tears in her eyes when Alaa was leaving .
Do n't worry , I told Alaa , I 'll be with you soon .
Now I 'm very much afraid I wo n't be able to meet my promise .
Even phone contact is n't assured .
The Palestinian telecoms company say all our networks will be down soon if Israel does n't allow fuel into Gaza within 48 hours .

Meanwhile we have no water , not even cold water .
There is n't a drop in the taps .
My sister 's children and our young cousins have been clustering around a very old kerosene stove we decided to try to use after the cooking gas ran out .
We rush to do some cooking in the night if electricity suddenly comes on .
We got power back last night for half an hour and made a loaf of bread .
There are seven children under the age of 10 here and they 're all pretty scared .
They do n't stop asking what 's going on .
Will the Jews come to our house , they ask .
Today I 've eaten nothing but dates and some of the bottled water we had brought in before this began .
There 's no chance of a shower , or getting any sleep .
And the nights are so long after dark when you can't read or go online .
At least when the electricity is on you feel slightly reassured and relaxed .
The dark contributes to your feeling of being completely isolated and afraid .
California ’s nickname of the Golden State could n’t be more apropos than with its leadership on energy .
PBS recently devoted an entire episode of “ Nova ” to the subject of “ The Big Energy Gamble ” about California .
“ It is leading the United States , and quite frankly , even though the bulk of the United States is behind the developed world , I think California in many respects is partially leading the world , ” newly - confirmed U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said in an interview for the special .
“ It ’s wonderful to be director of a major research lab that wants to work on this energy problem in a state that is so receptive to this work . ”
One thing that stood out from the “ Nova ” episode was the ongoing debate of nuclear power , which faces many tough obstacles in the Golden State .
For example , California ’s Energy Commission has been directed via Assembly Bill 1632 to evaluate the state ’s current nuclear plants , even though California law still prohibits the creation of new nuclear plants “ until the Energy Commission finds that the federal government has approved and there exists a demonstrated technology for the permanent disposal of spent fuel from these facilities . ”
Quite the dilemma , huh ?
“ I want people to look at nuclear power .
Nuclear power was ‘ villainized ’ for a reason .
We had waste that we did n’t know what to do with , and other problems .
But the technology in the last several decades has improved .
In France , they ’re now using the waste to power the plant , ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in an interview for the special .
“ So I think we can revisit it .
I ’m not saying build it , because I ’m not running the state by myself .
I ’m saying , ‘ Let us all look at it again with an open mind . ’
We may then say , ‘ It ’s not worth it .
There ’s new technology .
Let ’s just move on , beyond nuclear . ’
Great .
Let ’s look at everything , because we always need energy .
We also need to explain to people that conservation is where a lot of the action is . ”
And it ’s a debate that rages stronger every day .
On Jan. 21 , one day after the PBS special aired , the Associated Press ran a story about a group called San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace that details “ the latest chapter in a long - running battle that pits the all - volunteer group of aging hippies , activists and teachers against the federal government , Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , and PG&E ’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant . ”
According to the story , Diablo Canyon ( pictured above ) , one of the state ’s nuclear plants , is struggling to find a place for its “ highly radioactive spent fuel . ”
Therefore , the debate about nuclear power — especially the waste generated from it — consumes the Golden State and continues a worldwide energy crisis that becomes more dramatic every day .

A lot has been said and written , for instance , about the corrupting effects on Wall Street of gigantic bonuses .
What happened inside the major Wall Street firms , though , was more deeply unsettling than greedy people lusting for big checks : leaders of public corporations , especially financial corporations , are as good as required to lead for the short term .
Richard Fuld , the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers , E. Stanley O’Neal , the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch , and Charles O. Prince III , Citigroup ’s chief executive , may have paid themselves humongous sums of money at the end of each year , as a result of the bond market bonanza .
But if any one of them had set himself up as a whistleblower  had stood up and said “ this business is irresponsible and we are not going to participate in it ”  he would probably have been fired .
Not immediately , perhaps .
But a few quarters of earnings that lagged behind those of every other Wall Street firm would invite outrage from subordinates , who would flee for other , less responsible firms , and from shareholders , who would call for his resignation .
Eventually he’d be replaced by someone willing to make money from the credit bubble .
OUR financial catastrophe , like Bernard Madoff ’s pyramid scheme , required all sorts of important , plugged - in people to sacrifice our collective long - term interests for short - term gain .
The pressure to do this in today ’s financial markets is immense .
Obviously the greater the market pressure to excel in the short term , the greater the need for pressure from outside the market to consider the longer term .
But that ’s the problem : there is no longer any serious pressure from outside the market .
The tyranny of the short term has extended itself with frightening ease into the entities that were meant to , one way or another , discipline Wall Street , and force it to consider its enlightened self - interest .
The credit - rating agencies , for instance .
Everyone now knows that Moody ’s and Standard & Poor ’s botched their analyses of bonds backed by home mortgages .
But their most costly mistake  one that deserves a lot more attention than it has received  lies in their area of putative expertise : measuring corporate risk .
Over the last 20 years American financial institutions have taken on more and more risk , with the blessing of regulators , with hardly a word from the rating agencies , which , incidentally , are paid by the issuers of the bonds they rate .
Seldom if ever did Moody ’s or Standard & Poor ’s say , “ If you put one more risky asset on your balance sheet , you will face a serious downgrade . ”
The American International Group , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , General Electric and the municipal bond guarantors Ambac Financial and MBIA all had triple - A ratings .
( G.E. still does ! )
Large investment banks like Lehman and Merrill Lynch all had solid investment grade ratings .
It ’s almost as if the higher the rating of a financial institution , the more likely it was to contribute to financial catastrophe .
But of course all these big financial companies fueled the creation of the credit products that in turn fueled the revenues of Moody ’s and Standard & Poor’s .
These oligopolies , which are actually sanctioned by the S.E.C. , did n’t merely do their jobs badly .
They did n’t simply miss a few calls here and there .
In pursuit of their own short - term earnings , they did exactly the opposite of what they were meant to do : rather than expose financial risk they systematically disguised it .
One of the world ’s finest repositories of junk sits just off Route 55 in Minneapolis , about two miles south of the city ’s new baseball stadium , Target Field .
Here , in a cavernous warehouse , used toilets jostle for space with worn aluminum siding , and doors and cabinets reach in teetering stacks toward the ceiling .
On a rainy morning recently , Jamie Heipel weaves expertly between sheets of particleboard , pointing out , as he walks , the prices on each item .
“ This one is $ 50 , ” he says , resting his hand on a mint - condition dresser .
“ Much less than half of what you ’d pay at Home Depot .
In most cases , the stuff goes for about 50 cents on the dollar .
Sometimes 40 .
Sometimes less .
And we ca n’t keep it in stock . ”
Mr. Heipel , a stocky former corporate businessman , is the executive director of a local environmental nonprofit called the Green Institute , and the de-facto head of its Re -Use Center initiative .
Since 1995 , the Center has been salvaging discarded building supplies and selling them at a deep discount from this warehouse .
( In March , the Green Institute launched a second storefront in nearby Maplewood . )
Now Heipel is watching foot traffic soar – a direct result , he speculates , of the dismal global economy and a heightened eco-awareness on the part of consumers .
“ It ’s helped our business tremendously , ” Heipel says .
“ People are less likely to invest in a new house .
They want to stay put , and they want their home to look good .
And the people who are donating , they want to feel like they ’re contributing to the community . ”
It ’s a familiar scenario for salvage and supply outfits across the country .
In interviews this week with the Monitor , directors of organizations from Berkeley , Calif. , to Astoria , Queens , reported a surge in sales volume and revenue .
“ We ’ve been around for about nine years now , and the number of purchases in [ October ] were the highest we ’ve ever had in a single month , ” says Mike Gable , the executive director of
Construction Junction , a nonprofit “ building material reuse retailer ” based in Pittsburgh .
“ Our revenue is 20 percent ahead of where it was last year , ” Mr. Gable adds .
“ And we ’ve had an incredible increase in people coming into our store . ”
According to in - house figures provided by Gable , Construction Junction revenues are up nearly one - third from last year .
November is shaping up to be another banner month , he says .
“ We get a lot more calls these days , from the media and from contractors , ” says Brad Guy , president of Building Materials Reuse Association , a national nonprofit that helps educate groups on deconstruction and recycling .
“ Every major publication has had a green edition recently .
We ’ve got the buzz about the whole green - jobs thing .
It ’s a buzzword , but it does translate – people are more interested in avoiding waste .
We ’re riding that wave . ”
Most construction - supply re­­cycling organizations work on a relatively simple model , pioneered in part by the Re - Use Center .
Supplies ranging from one - foot squares of glass to entire kitchen interiors are donated by private contractors or local residents .
( Tax - deductibility varies by state . )
Some programs , such as the Queens - based Build It Green !
NYC , also employ a team of deconstruction experts who can strip and haul away reusable material from homes under renovation and demolition sites .
The material is then displayed in a warehouse or storefront setting for contractors , consumers , or landlords to haul away .
“ Think about it from a resource conservation perspective :
You do n’t need to be manufacturing that glass or mining that ore to make the doorknob , ” explains Stephen Hammer , director of the Urban Energy Project at Columbia University ’s Center for Energy , Marine Transportation , and Public Policy .
“ Less energy is used over the lifetime of that object . ”
It ’s called “ embodied energy , ” Dr. Hammer adds , referring to the amount of energy expended on the creation of a product .
“ And it ’s absolutely critical to the business sector . ”
In 10 years , Heipel , of the Re- Use Center , estimates his program has kept close to 41,000 tons of waste out of local landfills .
Justin Green , the program director of Build It Green ! , says that reuse organizations also help cut down on the byproducts of traditional landfill use .
“ Let ’s say you have some debris that ’s getting hauled out of a demolition site in New York , ” Mr. Green says .
“ That material is going to get ground up in New Jersey , and then shipped out to Pennsylvania or Ohio , where the dumping fees are cheaper .
Think about the amount of energy that ’s expended there . ”
Oscar Michel , the office manager at Urban Ore in Berkeley , Calif. , says Americans have become “ pretty hip ” to the idea of large - scale construction recycling .
“ They ’ll come in and say , ‘ I do n’t care about these windows either way , so I think I ’ll give them to you first , ’ ” says Mr. Michel .
“ And there ’s some great stuff here .
The bad economy has sort of helped us – in some cases , our numbers are better than they ever were before . ”
But Urban Ore , unlike the Re- Use Center and Build It Green ! , is a for - profit enterprise .
They pay low - income Berkeley residents for scrap metal and plumbing and other building innards .
“ A lot of people survive on us , ” Michel says , and since scrap metal prices are holding , it ’s unlikely that the supply stream will dry up anytime soon .
For Gable of Construction Junction , it remains a pressing concern .
“ We ’ve been kind of watching to see if people are going to not only stop buying homes but stop renovating , ” he says .
“ Put off replacing their old kitchen with a new kitchen .
Could the supply side of our organization slow down ?
Well , we have n’t seen it yet . ”

Today is AMD 's Financial Analyst Day at AMD 's campus in Sunnyvale , CA .
I 'm not a financial analyst but there are some useful tidbits that are coming out of the presentations today .
Obviously the focus at AMD these days is returning to profitability and with the planned spinoff of its manufacturing business , this should be possible .
AMD was quick to point out that it only has one competitor in the CPU space and one competitor in the GPU space .
There are very few markets where there are only two competitors , which led to the following statement : " We ought to be able to make money , and we can make money " .
Manufacturing is going to be an important topic today and AMD plainly laid out its manufacturing transitions for next year : AMD is going to move chipsets to 45nm in 2009 , graphics will be pushed down to 40nm , and we 'll see 32nm designs completed for production in 2010 .
I 'm not sure if I 'm reading this correctly but it appears to say that AMD 's marketing strategy for North America is graphics - exclusive , with no real Phenom focus .
The important disclosures thus far have been in the roadmaps however .
The Server Roadmap
Today AMD launched its Shanghai processor , the 45nm follow - on to last year 's Barcelona .
We also got a brief update on its server roadmap :
In the 2nd half of 2009 we 'll see Istanbul , a 6 - core 45nm product that will work in current sockets for Barcelona / Shanghai .
In 2010 we 'll see 8 - core and 12 - core solutions with up to four DDR3 memory channels and four Hyper Transport links .
Economic Snapshot for January 21 , 2009
In recessions , federal grants are key to recovery for states
by Kathryn Edwards
Virtually all states are required by law to have a balanced budget , meaning that each year a state can only spend as much as it receives in taxes .
Because of the current recession , revenue from taxes is very low and most states now face troubling budget shortfalls .
The chart shows how badly state budgets were affected by the 2001 recession , clearly illustrating how , after the nation slides into recession , it can take years to climb out of the deep fiscal hole .
Such recessionary shortfalls force states to either raise taxes ( to increase revenue ) or cut expenditures , usually by eliminating or gutting valuable public services in areas like health care or education .
But cutting expenses and raising taxes only exacerbate the recession ’s effect because both further reduce demand in the state ’s already weakened economy .
That is why federal grants to the states are so crucial : they help states maintain needed public service levels , combat the recession , and provide a fighting chance at eventually building up reserves to weather the next downturn .
Gordon Brown is battling to give Alastair Campbell a peerage to complete a line - up of New Labour big - hitters in time for an election campaign .
But the former spin doctor to Tony Blair is understood not to be interested in a seat in the House of Lords , despite " intensive courtship " by the Prime Minister since October , The Independent on Sunday has learnt .
The revelation came as Alan Milburn , a one - time sworn enemy of Mr Brown , was welcomed into the premier 's big tent with a central role on social mobility and access to the Downing Street nerve centre .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Milburn 's shock return to Mr Brown 's side after years of bitterness between the two men follows the recall of Peter Mandelson , another Blairite critic of the Prime Minister , three months ago .
Mr Campbell , for some a controversial figure from the Blair years , has been under pressure to accept a peerage and a ministerial job since Lord Mandelson 's return .
He has been helping in an advisory capacity but the Prime Minister wants his role formalised , possibly with a job at the Cabinet Office .
Giving him a Lords seat and a job would bind him into an official role .
In what will be seen as a snub to Mr Brown , Mr Campbell has so far refused , although strenuous efforts are continuing to get him to change his mind .
It is also a rebuff to House of Lords reform initiated under Tony Blair .
The behind - the - scenes manoeuvres will reignite speculation that a general election could be called as early as this spring , despite claims by Mr Brown last week that it was the " last thing " on his mind .
While the date is still likely to be 2010 , insiders said the Prime Minister was ensuring " all the pieces are falling into place " to have the strongest team possible to fight for a fourth Labour term .
Other names tipped for return include David Blunkett and Charles Clarke , who recently declared his support for Mr Brown after years of animosity .
At the same time , David Cameron readied his party for an early election with a letter to all candidates putting them on a war footing .
The Tories are also planning direct mailshots to target seats and a nationwide advertising campaign , while the leader will carry out a major shadow cabinet reshuffle – likely to be the final line - up for polling day – within a fortnight .

He has appointed the businessman Stanley Fink as party co-treasurer in charge of raising the general election fighting fund .
Mr Fink donated £ 1 m , and Tory sources said there would be more to come before the election .
Mr Milburn will chair a panel overseeing the White Paper on social mobility – aimed at getting more people from deprived backgrounds into employment in the professions and widening the middle class – which will be published on Tuesday .
As Health Secretary in 2002 , Mr Milburn had a spectacular falling - out with the then Chancellor over foundation hospitals .
He left the Cabinet in 2003 to spend more time with his family , but returned to help run Labour 's 2005 election campaign , when he again clashed with Mr Brown .
Mr Milburn saw the Prime Minister around the time of the Crewe by - election in May and suggested he should produce a White Paper on social mobility .
Mr Milburn then helped to write the Prime Minister 's speech on the issue in June .
The two men began " playing footsie " over the summer , despite speculation that Mr Milburn was urging David Miliband to challenge for the leadership .
The MP has told friends he now believes Mr Brown is " back on the pitch " and that he himself is prepared to " forget the battles of last year " .
Mr Milburn will have a secretariat based in the Cabinet Office , but he is expected to have access to Mr Brown 's " war room " , the horseshoe - shaped desk arrangement inside No 12 Downing Street .
A No 10 source said : " Social mobility is something that Alan Milburn has always taken a very close interest in .
This is an issue that Gordon has been talking about for some time .
They were quite keen to find a way of working together . "
Despite being Mr Blair 's long - term spin doctor , Mr Campbell , unlike Lord Mandelson and Mr Milburn , has never been an enemy of Mr Brown , instead seeing himself as " tribally " Labour .
He is not known for his support of the Upper House , however , and has said in the past he cannot see himself in the Lords .
Mr Campbell declined to comment last night .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " You would n't expect us to comment on appointments or peerages . "
( Reuters ) - Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC was examined at least eight times in 16 years by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and other regulators , who often came armed with suspicions , the Wall Street Journal said .
SEC officials followed up on emails from a New York hedge fund that described Bernard Madoff ’s business practices as “ highly unusual , ” the paper said .
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , the industry - run watchdog for brokerage firms , reported in 2007 that parts of the firm appeared to have no customers , according to the paper .
Madoff was interviewed at least twice by the SEC , the paper said , adding that regulators never came close to uncovering the alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme that investigators now believe began in the 1970s .
The SEC could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
The serial regulatory failures will be on display on Monday when Congress holds a hearing to probe why the alleged fraud went undetected , according to the Journal .
Among the key witnesses is SEC Inspector General David Kotz , who was asked last month by the agency ’s chairman , Christopher Cox , to investigate the mess , the paper said .

I just arrived in South Korea , and my colleague says that I can die if I sleep in a closed room with a fan on .
He insists that " fan death " is an actual danger .
What the hell ?
" I 'm told that every Korean believes that fan death is real , " Jeffery Hodges , a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul , tells AF .
" I 've heard as explanation that the belief originated at a time when Koreans were first able to purchase electric fans and used them to such an extent that electrical systems were burdened , so the government spread a rumor that running them overnight was potentially fatal . "
Hodges also shared the following passage from the government - issued Cultural Guide for Migrant Workers in Korea : " In some cases , a fan turned on too long can cause death from oxygen deficiency , hypothermia , or fire from overheating . "
" Some Koreans , " he adds , " give outlandish explanations about how the whirling blades of a fan can sever oxygen molecules . "
So far as AF is able to determine , no scientific literature exists to support the existence of fan death , nor does it seem to be a perceived threat in any other country but Korea .

When like - minded hackers come together to unleash the true power of seemingly simple gear , it 's truly a beautiful thing .
We 've featured a good number of how - tos and hacks over the years that make expensive upgrades unnecessary and unleash seriously cool features in your gear , and 2008 was no exception .
In the last year , our iPhones and iPod touches got jailbroken all over again , our wireless routers were graced with a new super - charged firmware , our Canon digi-cams gained pro-level powers , and we learned that our Nintendo Wiis were even neater than we'd thought .
Today , however , we wanted to take a long view on the best hacks that unlock the best features in our standard hardware , and ask our readers :

Jailbreak tools for iPhones / iPod touch
Advertisement
When the iPhone 3G and its 2.0 software was released , some of us thought that might be the end of jailbreaking , or opening up your device to third - party , non-approved applications ( and , in some cases , mobile carriers ) .
We thought wrong , as there were many apps worth jailbreaking for , and the process got much simpler with the Mac - based Pwnagetool and Winpwn for Windows .
The greater issue is that Apple 's been roundly criticized for rejecting any software that " replicates " its own apps , and is somewhat secretive about just why it kills and delays other apps , so jailbreaking will likely always have a home on Apple 's multi - touch devices .

If you 've ever been intrigued by time - lapse photography , motion - sensing shutters that can capture lightning , or being able to shoot videos of any serious length , you might not need to shell out for a semi-serious DSLR model — if you 've got a Canon , that is .
The CHDK lets you do all that and more , including record your photos in the very work - able RAW format , get way more on - screen information about your shots and their settings , and , as Adam put it , generally turn your point - and - shoot into a super - camera .
The possibilities are vast , given the number of user - created scripts the CHDK can run .
And , in true hacker fashion , you can even play a game or two on your LCD screen ( while you pretend to be setting up that staged photo mom and dad want , perhaps ) .

Homemade Wi-Fi extenders

Sure , you could give Linksys ( or Buffalo , or D - Link , or Apple , et al. ) the extra cash for an extended , wider - range router than the standard box you 've tucked away in the living room or office .
But if you do n't mind doing just a few minutes of DIY work , you can also create your own higher - powered antennas .
We 've covered a few ways of doing so , including tinfoil and paper parabolas , internal wiring replacements , and , for that steampunk feel , cooking strainer extenders .
If you want to actually boost the power your router gives up , well , we 're covering that farther down , but these are all relatively safe and damage - free ways to ensure a solid connection throughout your house .

Ever since our boss bought a " classic , " first - generation XBOX off eBay and turned it into a media center with the open - source XBOX Media Center , she 's been using to organize all the media that makes it to her television , stereo , and other screens .
In the meantime , XBMC has spawned a number of intriguing remixes and spin-offs , including Boxee , and now works on pretty much any platform that 's got video cards and a hard drive — Windows , Mac , Linux , XBOX models , and even Apple TVs .
If buying another whole system just to watch your downloaded videos and stream MP3s across the house sounds like overkill , use what you 've got with XBMC .

As mentioned above , some home network routers just can't reach around all the walls in your house .
And if you want to set up specific bandwidth rules — giving you , say , lots of room for World of Warcraft at night , but throttling your BitTorrents while you 're actually working — you 're usually out of luck .
Unless , that is , you 've loaded DD - WRT or Tomato on your router .
We 've walked through installations of both systems and toured a bit of what they can do .
Plus , as many have attested , they can make a router more stable , freeing you from frequent oh - crap - hope - that - page - saves runs to re-plug your misbehaved little guy .

Homebrew Wii

It 's hard to say , exactly , why Nintendo did n't include DVD playback capabilities on its
Wii game system , given that its games are , well , DVDs .
So it was only a matter of time before a few clever folks came up with a way of getting homebrew apps and DVD playback on the Wii , without anyone having to bust out a screwdriver or soldering iron .
You can add a lot more to that Homebrew Wii channel , and , if you 're cool with Nintendo absolutely disliking your doing so , play backed - up Wii games on it .
While you 're feeling geeky , you can put your Wiimotes to use in reverse by controlling your computer with them .

In the U.S. , the kids are snorting Ritalin to get high .
But in South Africa , the newest abused prescription drugs of choice are HIV drugs .
Teenage schoolchildren in South Africa have been seen grinding up anti-retroviral pills and smoking them , sometimes mixed with painkillers or marijuana .
The children say they are buying or stealing the drugs from HIV patients and healthcare workers .
Tooli Nhlapo , a documentary filmmaker for the South African Broadcasting Corporation , was shocked when she first observed the children smoking the pills .
Meant to boost the immune system and help the body fight off HIV , the drugs apparently produce a hallucinogenic effect when smoked .
" When I asked them why they like doing it , they said it helps them relax and forget about their problems , " she said .
What Nhlapo first thought was an isolated incident may turn out to be a nationwide problem :
Many people in the areas she visited were aware of the new way to get high .
Doctors say the abuse of HIV drugs is particularly worrisome if the drugs are coming from HIV patients , because these pills need to be taken as part of a cocktail of several drugs to have optimal effect .
To make matters even worse , South Africa has one of the worst HIV / AIDS epidemics in the world , with an estimated one - fifth of the population infected .
The government - supported treatment program , which distributes anti-retroviral drugs , has only been in effect since 2004 .

Five Somali pirates drown as they squabble over their $ 3 million ransom
Five Somali pirates drowned when a wave washed off their getaway boat as they squabbled over over how to split their $ 3 million ransom .
The ransom had been paid to the pirates to end the world 's biggest ship hijacking .
The canister full of cash was parachuted onto the Sirius Star - observed by the U.S. Navy who provided these images - and the two - month ordeal of the 25 crew , including two Britons , was finally over .
Dramatic :
The apparent ransom payment is delivered via a parachuted container to pirates holding the Sirius Star
The pirates originally wanted more than £ 16 million to release the boat and its £ 65 million load of oil .
Eventually they accepted the offer of $ 3 million ( around £ 2 million ) .
A close up of the parachuted ransom falling towards the Sirius Star
But as they made off they continued to row about the payout .
' Two of them swam and survived .
One is still missing .
The weather was so terrible that it blew the boat over , then sank it .
We got five dead bodies and we are still searching for the missing one .
The waves were disastrous , ' said Farah Osman , an associate of the gang .
It is not known what happened to the money or those who survived .
After the squabbling gang left the Saudi supertanker its crew were free to move to a safe port .
Both British crewmen - chief engineer Peter French and second officer James Grad - said they were well treated by the pirates .
Andrew Mwanguru , of the East African Seafarers Assistance programme , based in the Kenyan port of Mombasa , said : ' The last batch of gunmen have disembarked from the Sirius Star .
She is now steaming out to safe waters . '
Mr Mwanguru said it was heading south and possible destinations included Mombasa for resupplying or going on to South Africa .
Flying drop :
The small aircraft flies towards the MV Sirius Star during the apparent parachuted payment
Delivered :
The aircraft appears to fly off after dropping the ransom on the ship
Mr Osman , speaking from Haradheere , said the pirates finally agreed the ransom of $ 3 million with the ship 's owners , Vela International .
The company has declined to comment .
The Sirius Star was captured in November with 25 crew members , 450 nautical miles southeast of Kenya in the boldest seizure to date by Somali pirates .
The rampant piracy off Somalia worsened dramatically in 2008 as an Islamist insurgency fuelled chaos onshore .
Released : Sirius Star was seized in November by Somali pirates .
Reports suggest the supertanker has now been freed
The piracy in the busy Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean shipping lanes has sent shipping insurance prices soaring , made some owners choose to go round South Africa instead of through the Suez Canal , and brought an unprecedented deployment of international warships to the region .
The crew of the Sirius are from Britain , Poland , Croatia , Saudi Arabia and the Philippines .
The U.S. Navy , which has had a warship close to the Sirius monitoring the saga , could not immediately confirm its release .
The U.S. Navy said on Thursday it was planning to launch a force to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden , an offshoot of an earlier mission .
Chinese warships also began anti-piracy patrols off Somalia this week .
Spain will send up to 395 military personnel and a patrol plane to the waters off Somalia to defend merchant ships from pirates , the government said on Friday .
Underlining the danger , Kenya Ports Authority said on Friday that Somali pirates had attacked a Kenyan fishing vessel north of Mombasa , kidnapping three Indian nationals on board .
Neither the ship nor Kenyan crew , however , were taken , officials said , adding full details of the incident on Thursday in waters near the Somali border were still not available .
Is This Where the $ 700 Billion Is Going ?
There was a lot of noise last week about how the banks who ’ve been drawing down the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program fund ca n’t account for how the money is being spent .
It ’s not like $ 700 billion can just disappear , right ?
Well , a reader named Gannon Hubbard wrote in with a hunch as to where the money is being spent .
No , not on commercial loans or mortgage relief or even a new highway fund .
Try … a rabbit hutch .
Yes , a third - party seller on Amazon.com was offering a “ Marshall Peters Hinged Mat Woven Grass for Rabbits and Small Animal ” for the low , low price of $ 766.5 billion :
As Gannon writes : “ It looks like third - party selling on Amazon is n’t exactly foolproof . ”
The good news is that a serious discount was invoked since this screen shot was taken , with the hutch now selling for just $ 13.59 .
The seller is called Sleepy Pets , and as of this writing , its most recent customer feedback was a five - star review that said : “ Arrived well ahead of schedule . ”
For $ 766 billion , I should certainly hope so .
Former Illinois attorney general Roland Burris , embattled Gov. Rod Blagojevich ’s pick to replace Barack Obama in the Senate , is no stranger to controversy .
Public fury over the governor ’s alleged misconduct has masked the once lively debate over Burris ' decision to continue to prosecute the wrong man – despite the objections of one of his top prosecutors – for a high - profile murder case .
While state attorney general in 1992 , Burris aggressively sought the death penalty for Rolando Cruz , who twice was convicted of raping and murdering a 10 - year - old girl in the Chicago suburb of Naperville .
The crime took place in 1983 .
But by 1992 , another man had confessed to the crime , and Burris ’ own assistant attorney general was pleading with Burris to drop the case , then on appeal before the Illinois Supreme Court .
Burris refused .
He was running for governor .
" Anybody who understood this case would n’t have voted for Burris , " Rob Warden , executive director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions , told ProPublica .
Indeed , Burris lost that race , and two other attempts to become governor .
Burris ’ role in the Cruz case was " indefensible and in defiance of common sense and common decency , " Warden said .
" There was obvious evidence that [ Cruz ] was innocent . "
Assistant attorney general Mary Brigid Kenney agreed , and eventually resigned rather than continue to prosecute Cruz .
Once Burris assigned Kenney to the case in 1991 , she became convinced that Cruz was innocent , a victim of what she believed wasprosecutorial misconduct .
She sent Burris a memo reporting that the jury convicted Cruz without knowing that Brian Dugan , a repeat sex offender and murderer , had confessed to the crime .
Burris never met with Kenney to discuss a new trial for Cruz , Kenney told ProPublica .
" This is something the attorney general should have been concerned about , " Kenney , now an assistant public guardian in Cook County , said in an interview .
" I knew the prosecutor ’s job was not merely to secure conviction but to ensure justice was done . "
Kenney was not alone in her beliefs .
Prior to Cruz ’ 1985 trial , the lead detective in the case resigned in protest over prosecutors ' handling of the case , according to news reports at the time .
And rather than argue Burris ’ case before the state supreme court , Kenney also stepped down .
" What I took away was that [ Burris ] was n’t going to do anything to seem soft on crime , " Kenney said .
" He did n’t have the guts . "
In her resignation letter , Kenney claimed Burris had " seen fit to ignore the evidence in this case . "
" I can not sit idly by as this office continues to pursue the unjust prosecution of Rolando Cruz , " she wrote .
" I realized that I was being asked to help execute an innocent man . "
Burris ' response at the time : " It is not for me to place my judgment over a jury , regardless of what I think . "
( We have also left a message for Burris at his office and will post an update if we hear back . )
Local prosecutors carried on with the prosecution , even after DNA evidence in 1995 excluded Cruz as the victim 's rapist and linked somebody else — sex offender Brian Dugan–to the crime .
Eventually , prosecutors ’ case hit a wall .
The Illinois Supreme Court reversed Cruz 's conviction and granted him a third trial .
( The court declared that the trial judge in the case had improperly excluded Dugan ’s confession , and thus compromised Cruz 's defense . )
In the new trial , Cruz was acquitted .
The judge in that case concluded , " I 'd hope and pray the person or persons - whoever is culpable - is brought to justice . "
In late 1995 , Cruz finally walked free after serving nearly 11 years on death row for a crime he did not commit .
A grand jury later indicted four sheriff 's deputies and three former county prosecutors for their roles in the Cruz case .
They were eventually acquitted .
Burris was never accused of any wrongdoing or misconduct .
Dugan is scheduled to stand trial for the crime next year , 26 years after it was committed .
Europe is prosecuting Britain for consistently breaking air pollution laws and endangering people 's health in urban areas .
Legal proceedings against the government were started today by the EU environment commissioner , Stavros Dimas , and could result in unlimited daily fines .
Britain had been given nearly 10 years by Europe to reduce its levels of the minute , sooty " particulate matter " known as PM10s , which are mainly emitted by industry and traffic .
But EU documents seen by the Guardian earlier this month showed that Britain had been breaking the regulations , now part of UK law , for three years .
More than 20 cities and conurbations were found to have dangerous levels of particulate matter between 2005 - 7 .
In a statement , the commission said we have " started infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom for failing to comply with the EU's air quality standard for dangerous airborne particles known as PM10 .
These particles can cause asthma , cardiovascular problems , lung cancer and premature death . "
The decision to take Britain to the court of justice will embarrass the government because it has had since 1999 to come up with a plan to reduce PM10 levels , but has failed to do so .
All other major EU countries have submitted plans and successfully negotiated a time extension .
This week the government launched a consultation on the issue , but this was widely seen in Europe as a delaying tactic .
The UK has two months to respond to the EU 's letter before further action may be taken .
Dimas showed his exasperation with Britain .
" Air pollution has serious impacts on health and compliance with the standards must be our utmost priority .
It is essential that where time extensions are not applicable the standards are fully respected . "
Air pollution near many roads in British cities averages well over twice the UN's World Health Organisation maximum recommended level .
If Britain is to reduce PM10 levels it will have to substantially reduce traffic congestion , which could mean unpopular congestion charging and low emission zones .
A spokesman at the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said : " The UK , along with other member states , intends to apply for a time extension to meet PM10 air quality limits .
Twenty - four out of 27 member states also reported breaches of the limits in 2007 .
We expect to apply for this extension following a public consultation that began on Tuesday 27 January . "
But Caroline Lucas , leader of the Green party and MEP for the South East , said the move by the commission was a " damning indictment of Labour 's aspirations to position itself as having any credibility on the environment at all " .
And she said it sent a clear signal to ministers who were going ahead with plans to expand Heathrow airport despite concerns that more planes will push pollution levels up even further .
" Legal action is long overdue , " added Simon Birkett , director of Clean Air for London .
" This should be a real wake up call to Britain to take air pollution seriously . "
In a coincidence , the government also released data on air quality for 2008 , showing that particulate pollution varied from year to year , and while there was a long - term decline , the fall was not fast enough to meet the new limits .
A Defra report said that " in urban areas , air pollution in 2008 was recorded as moderate or higher on 27 days on average per site , compared with 24 days in 2007 , and 59 days in 1993 " .
Iranian banks illegally shifted billions of dollars through American financial institutions in recent years , and authorities suspect some of the money may have been used to finance Iran ’s nuclear and missile programs .
Details of the illicit transfers came to light on Friday when New York State and federal authorities announced that a large British bank had agreed to pay $ 350 million to settle accusations that it had helped the Iranian banks hide the transactions .
The British bank , the Lloyds TSB Group , “ stripped ” information that would have identified the transfers in order to deceive American financial institutions , which are barred from doing business with Iranian banks , Robert M. Morgenthau , the Manhattan district attorney , said .
Lloyds acknowledged its conduct and agreed to turn over detailed records of the transactions .
“ They went to great lengths to obliterate any identification , ” Mr. Morgenthau said .
The district attorney ’s office was still investigating nine major banks that might be engaging in similar conduct , but prosecutors declined to name them .
Mr. Morgenthau said , however , that money in one transaction was used to buy a large amount of tungsten , an ingredient for making long - range missiles .
He said he suspected that other funds might have been used to finance Iran ’s nuclear program .
We ’ve officially entered the hard months , the “ dark ages ” as the midshipmen at the Naval Academy say : the time of the year when the sun disappears and the pale complexions of your friends remind you that you had better take your vitamins or else you ’ll have a cold to go with your pasty look .
I dread winter each year because many of my depression busters require sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s .
What does a girl who kayaks and bikes for sanity do in the winter ?
Lots of things .
Here are a few of them :
1 . Watch the sugar .
I think our body gets the cue just before Thanksgiving that it will be hibernating for a few months , so it needs to ingest everything edible in sight .
And I ’m convinced the snow somehow communicates to the human brain the need to consume every kind of chocolate available in the house .
Depressives and addicts need to be especially careful with sweets because the addiction to sugar and white - flour products is very real and physiological , affecting the same biochemical systems in your body as other drugs like heroin .
According to Kathleen DesMaisons , author of “ Potatoes Not Prozac ” :
Your relationship to sweet things is operating on a cellular level .
It is more powerful than you have realized ….
What you eat can have a huge effect on how you feel . ”
2. Stock up on Omega - 3’s .
During the winter I ’m religious about stocking in my medicine cabinet a Noah ’s Ark supply of Omega - 3 capsules because leading physicians at Harvard Medical School confirmed the positive effects of this natural , anti-inflammatory molecule on emotional health .
I treat my brain like royalty –hoping that it will be kind to me in return–so I fork over about $ 30 a month for the Mac Daddy of the Omega - 3s , capsules that contain 70 percent EPA ( Eicosapentaenoic acid ) .
One 500 mg softgel capsule meets the doctor - formulated 7:1 EPA to DHA ratio , needed to elevate and stabilize mood .
3 . Give back .
Gandhi once wrote that “ the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others . ”
Positive psychologists like University of Pennsylvania ’s Martin Seligman and Dan Baker , Ph.D. , director of the Life Enhancement Program at Canyon Ranch , believe that a sense of purpose –committing oneself to a noble mission–and acts of altruism are strong antidotes to depression .
4. Join the gym .
Do n’t let the cold weather be an excuse not to sweat .
We have centers today called “ gyms ” where people exercise inside !
Granted , it ’s not the same –watching the news or listening to the soundtrack from “ Rocky ” as you run in place as opposed to jogging along wooded paths with a view of the bay .
But you accomplish the goal : a heart rate over 140 beats a minute .
5 . Use a light lamp .
Bright - light therapy –involving sitting in front of a fluorescent light box that delivers an intensity of 10,000 lux–can be as effect as antidepressant medication for mild and moderate depression and can yield substantial relief for Seasonal Affective Disorder .
I usually turn on my mammoth HappyLite in November , just after my least favorite day of the year : when Daylight Saving Time ends and we “ fall back ” an hour , which means that I have about an hour of sunlight to enjoy after I pick up the kids from school .
6 . Wear bright colors .
I have no research supporting this theory , but I ’m quite convinced there is a link between feeling optimistic and sporting bright colors .
It ’s in line with “ faking it ’ til you make it , ” desperate attempts to trick your brain into thinking that it ’s sunny and beautiful outside–time to celebrate Spring !
–even though it ’s a blizzard with sleet causing some major traffic jams .
Personally , I tend to wear black everyday in the winter .
It ’s supposed to make you look thinner .
But the result is that I appear as if and feel like I ’m going to a funeral every afternoon between the months of November and March .
This is n’t good .
Not for a person hardwired to stress and worry and get depressed when it ’s cold .
So I make a conscious effort to wear bright green , purple , blue , and pink , and sometimes –if I ’m in a rush–all of them together !
7. Force yourself outside .
I realize that the last thing you want to do when it ’s 20 degrees outside and the roads are slushy is to head outside for a leisurely stroll around the neighborhood .
It ’s much more fun to cuddle up with a good novel or make chocolate chip cookies and enjoy them with a hot cup of joe .
On many winter days–especially in late January and early February when my brain is done with the darkness –I have to literally force myself outside , however brief .
Because even on cloudy and overcast days , your mood can benefit from exposure to sunlight .
Midday light , especially , provides Vitamin D to help boost your limbic system , the emotional center of the brain .
And there is something so healing about connecting with nature , even if it ’s covered in snow .
8 . Hang out with friends .
This seems like an obvious depression buster .
Of course you get together with your buddies when your mood starts to go south .
But that ’s exactly when many of us tend to isolate .
I believe that it takes a village to keep a person sane and happy .
That ’s why we need so many support groups today .
People need to be validated and encouraged and inspired by persons on the same journey .
And with all the technology today , folks do n’t even have to throw on their slippers to get to a support group .
Online communities provide a village of friendship right at your computer .
9 . Head south .
Granted , this solution is n’t free , especially if you live in Maine .
But you need not travel like the Kennedys to transplant your body and mind to a sunny spot for a few days .
I try to schedule our yearly vacation the last week of January or the first week of February so that it breaks up the winter and so that I have something to look forward to in those depressing weeks following the holidays .
10 .
Take up a project .
There ’s no time like winter to start a home project , like decluttering the house or purging all the old clothes in your kids ’ closets .
When a friend of mine was going through a tough time , she painted her entire house–every room downstairs with two different colors .
And it looked professional !
Not only did it help distract her from her problems , but it provided her with a sense of accomplishment that she desperately needed those months , something to feel good about as she saw other things crumble around her .
Projects like organizing bookshelves , shredding old tax returns , and cleaning out the garage are perfect activities for the dreary months of the year .
11 . Challenge yourself .
My mood can often be lifted by meeting a new challenge–an activity that is formidable enough to keep my attention , but easy enough to do when my brain is muddied .
Learning how to record and edit video blogs , for this girl who hates technology , turned out to be great fun .
Friends of mine get the same boost by joining Jenny Craig and losing the 25 pounds of baby fat , or exploring a new hobby –like scrapbooking .
I try to stretch myself in a small way every winter –whether it be taking a writing class , researching the genetics of mood disorders , or trying to build myself a website .
It keeps my brain from freezing , like the rest of my body .
12 . Light a candle .
If I counted up all the minutes I ’ve spent staring into a flame , I wonder how many years of my life that would be .
Certainly more than the hours I ’ve spent brushing my teeth or combing my hair .
It would probably even surpass the combination of bath and shower time .
But I just feel better if I stick my face in a hot glowing body of flame .

“ America ’s most famous television surgeon , Sanjay Gupta , is poised to take his black bag and microphone to the White House as President - elect Barack Obama ’s choice for U.S. surgeon general , ” reports the Washington Post .
“ A neurosurgeon who is also a correspondent for CNN and CBS , Gupta was chosen as much for his broadcasting skills as for his medical résumé , suggesting that the incoming administration values visible advisers who can drive a public message . ”
In 2007 , CFR member Gupta ignored research indicating that thermersol and its mercury - based preservative did indeed cause autism .
Gupta was not only chosen for his “ broadcasting skills , ” but also because he is a trusted insider .
Not surprisingly , Gupta is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Part of Gupta ’s “ public message ” is that thermersol and its mercury - based preservative has nothing to do with autism .
In 2007 , Gupta went on CNN to state there appears to be no relationship between thimerosal and autism ( see video ) .
Gupta does not mention a study published in the March 10 , 2006 , issue of American Physicians and Surgeons that reveals that since mercury was removed from childhood vaccines , the alarming increase in reported rates of autism and other neurological disorders in children dropped sharply .
Independent researchers used the government ’s own databases on childhood neurological disorders , including autism , before and after removal of mercury - based preservatives .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Mr. Gupta appears to be part of an effort to deny there is an epidemic and try to hide the data from public scrutiny , while at the same time secretly putting in an addendum in to the Homeland Security
Act specifically to prevent parents from suing vaccines companies for vaccine damage ( see the Autism Mercury Link page on the Autism Couch web page ) .
Sanjay Gupta , as a member of the CFR and the Mockingbird corporate media , is part of the ongoing eugenics vaccination effort , thus his appointment as surgeon general makes perfect sense .
In addition , he was a White House Fellow in 1997 and served as special advisor to then - first lady Hillary Clinton .
“ We are told that the pitch to him has been that health care reform will be a top priority , that wellness , fitness , obesity , the issues he has focused on often here at CNN , will be a top priority , ” reports John King .
In other words , Gupta will be Obama ’s point man on the “ continuum of care , basically from birth to death , ” as fellow CFR member John Edwards put it , that is to say government micromanagement of “ wellness , fitness , obesity ” and other health issues .

How was this created ?
The typesetting company hand - translated my HTML to LaTeX , which they formatted and processed with LaTeX style files provided by the publisher .
The interior layout and design , including creation of the style files , was done by an unsung genius named Julio Esperas , an employee of Morgan Kaufmann .
If you think the interior of the book looks good , as I do , Julio Esperas is the person who deserves the credit .
The interior illustrations were created by a company called Dartmouth publishing , from my hand - drawn originals .
There were several exchanges back and forth in which I told them to make the lines in the tree diagrams curved instead of straight , to make the clouds fluffier and the parabolas more elegant .
The cover was designed by a freelancer named Yvo Riezebos .
These are the original sources that I used to generate the manuscript draft that I first sent to the publisher .
They are written in MOD , a variation on the " pod " markup in which Perl 's documentation is written .
It should be self - explanatory .
If not , drop me a note .
The big drawback of this version is that it not only omits the corrections that were added between the first and second printings , but also the much more significant corrections that were added before the first printing .
The big advantage is structural markup and tests for the code .

Mod package
Mod is a simple markup language , based on the POD system used to generate Perl 's documentation .
The main desideratum for Mod was that I should be able to use the same sources to generate TeX to send to the compositors , HTML for the web version , and a plain text version output .
( In the end I sent the HTML version to the compositors instead . )
Also I wanted inline tests , so that when the book said “ function foo returns 7 ” I could have an inline test that would check automatically that that the code , as written , did in fact return 7 .
I added some features I needed that POD did n't have , like a sequence to generate an index entry .
And I fixed some things I did n't like about POD .
( Bad spacing rules , too much implicit behavior , and instead of C<< $ foo -> method >> you write C < $ foo -\> method > . )
Markdown had n't been invented yet or I probably would have modified that instead of POD .
Pandoc had n't been invented yet or I probably would have used it .
But Mod did n't take long to make , and it worked well enough that it did n't get in the way while I wrote a book in it .

Cow gives birth to a dude

Cow on Irish farm gives birth to a 6 ’ 2 ″ surprise .
( Thanks , kele ! )
A proposal by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to shorten the school year by five days is creating panic among educators across California , who say they barely have enough time to fit the state ’s academic standards into the existing 180 - day calendar .
The idea to cut funding equivalent to five school days would save $ 1.1 billion at a time when California faces a massive budget deficit .
But state Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell called the proposal “ devastating . ”
“ It would particularly hurt our low - income students and students of color , ” he said , because affluent districts are more likely to be able to pay for the five days themselves while poorer districts will be forced to eliminate those teaching days .
“ The result would be a further widening of the achievement gap , ” he said .
If the Legislature approves the proposal , California would join Kentucky , North Dakota and a few other states that require the least number of school days .

Parents are worried that the quality of their children ’s education would suffer and some said that it was an economic issue for them as well -- with an additional week of child - care costs .
“ I ’m a single parent .
It ’s hard to make ends meet , ” said Tina Herrera , 41 , a Long Beach resident whose 9 - year - old son attends Holmes Elementary School .
“ One extra week of child care is hard on my wallet .
And there are thousands more just like me . ”
Republican Ken Maddox , a former assemblyman who is a school board trustee in South Orange County , said that although he is sympathetic to the governor ’s predicament , the state ’s schools already are underfunded .
“ The standards are getting higher and higher , which is great .
It would be nice if the dollars going to schools would get higher and higher , ” he said .
“ Our children deserve the best education possible , not the shortest education possible . ”
A Schwarzenegger spokesman said the suggestion came last fall from district superintendents as a less painful cut than some others that they could be forced to make .
Some districts , for example , are considering closing schools , laying off teachers , and eliminating sports and arts programs .
The governor ’s office did not provide the names of any superintendents who support the five - day funding cut .

“ We put this forward knowing we were heading into what is clearly the most challenging fiscal environment California has ever faced , ” said H.D. Palmer , spokesman for Schwarzenegger ’s finance department .
“ When you have to put forward a budget that closes a gap of more than $ 41 billion , criticism is going to be implicit in any proposal , whether in the education area or in health and human services or on the revenue side .
“ That ’s why , before we came out with this proposal , we wanted to engage the education community at the front end of the process to get their views on how we can try to . . . do the least amount of damage possible , ” he said .
Lobbyist Sandy Silberstein , who represents Riverside County ’s 23 school districts , noted that districts would not be required to eliminate days .
She said the proposal -- along with another that allows restricted funds , such as those in textbook accounts , to be used more freely -- gives school districts greater leeway in deciding how to weather the economic storm .

“ What we have said . . . is give us the longest menu of flexible options , ” she said .
“ That is the only way we will survive this . ”
The 2009 - 10 budget is far from finalized , and it is unknown whether the school - year proposal will survive negotiations in Sacramento .
But education probably will face major cuts because it makes up about 40 % of the state budget .
Currently , the state requires 175 days of school , although an annual fiscal incentive created in 1983 prompted most districts to provide 180 days of instruction .
Many other countries require far more .
Indian and Chinese students spend more weeks in the classroom every year than their American counterparts .

Education advocates have been calling for more days in the American school calendar for decades , notably in “ A Nation at Risk , ” a 1983 report that called on states to create a 200 - to 220 - day school year , as well as more instructional time in the day .
Research has consistently shown students , if engaged academically , benefit from more classroom time .
“ You do n’t need a PhD to understand that the more days students work with teachers , the more they learn , ” said Bruce Fuller , a professor of education and public policy at UC Berkeley .
O’Connell ’s fear that districts serving more low - income students or minorities would bear the brunt of the cuts is true in Pasadena , where the district could not afford to pay for the five days , said Pasadena Unified School District Supt .
Edwin Diaz .

“ It ’s a huge step backward and is going in the opposite direction of what we need in this state to close the achievement gap and improve performance for all kids , ” he said .
“ We need more time with the kids . ”
In addition to ensuring that today ’s generation is prepared to compete in a global economy , educators and others said there is another , more immediate , benefit from requiring students to spend more time in school .
“ When you cut days out of school , I guess the question is what are students going to be doing with that time ? ” asked Chad Heeter , the Indianapolis - based director and editor of “ Two Million Minutes , ” a 2008 documentary that examined lives and study habits of high school seniors in the United States , India and China .
“ What [ time in school ] does community - wide is keep kids busy and occupied and out of trouble . ”
Educators also had a more practical concern :
Though Sacramento can decide to cut funding for five days of school , each of the state ’s 1,054 school districts would be required to renegotiate contracts with unions representing teachers and other employees , including potential pay cuts .

Joe Farley , superintendent of the Anaheim Union High School District , said he renegotiated salaries when he headed a San Diego County district .
“ It was extremely hard , ” he said .
“ It ’s something I would avoid doing again . ”
In the Los Angeles Unified School District , the state ’s largest , Supt. Ramon C. Cortines said that officials expect to cut $ 400 million in next year ’s budget but that they are hamstrung until legislators approve a budget plan .
This week , the district sent layoff notices to 2,300 instructors because of an anticipated shortfall this school year .
Cortines implored state leaders to act quickly .
“ We can not do anything until we know what the parameters are that we have to work within , ” he said .
“ That has to come from Sacramento . ”

Schwarzenegger ’s budget bust
The governor is looking for funds in all the wrong places , Michael Hiltzik writes .

There 's one saving grace about Paul Krugman 's column at the New York Times : when an Austrian economist wants to explain how mainstream economics leads to ruin , he can always trust Krugman to set up the target in a clear , concise manner .
This saves us a lot of work , because we do n't have to first build up the position before knocking it down .
Even the casual reader of the financial press knows that it is dominated by Keynesian " demand - side " thinking .
For example , during the debate over the stimulus checks earlier in the year , the main objection was that taxpayers might use some of their rebate to pay down credit card bills , rather than blowing the whole thing at the mall .
But the reader will never see a careful , step - by - step exposition of the worldview that generates such crazy notions .
Enter Paul Krugman .
In a recent piece , " When Consumers Capitulate , " the newest Nobel laureate spells out the method behind the madness .
Let 's take the opportunity then to show just why this focus on consumer spending is not only mistaken but downright dangerous .
" The Paradox of Thrift "
Krugman first tells us the ( allegedly ) bad news : " The long - feared capitulation of American consumers has arrived … [ R]eal consumer spending fell at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter ; real spending on durable goods ( stuff like cars and TVs ) fell at an annual rate of 14 percent . "
Now let 's stop for a moment .
Many left - leaning writers — including Krugman — have been warning for years that the US trade deficit was too high , and that the national savings rate was too low .
So one would think that a drop in consumer spending would be a good thing .
Ah , not so fast : Krugman tells us that " the timing of the new sobriety is deeply unfortunate … .
For consumers are cutting back just as the U.S. economy has fallen into a liquidity trap . "
And now to the actual theory behind all these musings .
Krugman writes ,
[ O ]ne of the high points of the semester , if you 're a teacher of introductory macroeconomics , comes when you explain how individual virtue can be public vice , how attempts by consumers to do the right thing by saving more can leave everyone worse off .
The point is that if consumers cut their spending , and nothing else takes the place of that spending , the economy will slide into a recession , reducing everyone 's income .
In fact , consumers ' income may actually fall more than their spending , so that their attempt to save more backfires — a possibility known as the paradox of thrift .
My friend Bill Anderson actually derives sustenance from his hatred of Paul Krugman ; at lunch one time , Bill skipped a sandwich and instead just bought a New York Times .
Now one of Bill 's frequent remarks is , " Paul Krugman is not an economist . "
When I first heard that , I thought Bill was being unfair in order to score a funny point .
But the above excerpt from Krugman changes all that .
The most central lesson of economic science — going back further than Adam Smith 's " invisible hand " metaphor at least to Mandeville 's 1732 Fable of the Bees — is that in a system based on private property , private vices can actually be harnessed for the benefit of the public at large .
Specifically , a market economy steers greedy businesspeople into staying up all night , thinking about how best to satisfy their customers .
Besides this truth ( discovered relatively recently in human history ) , people have always known that a wise person refrains from possible consumption in order to accumulate savings .
The reason humans in the 21st century are so fantastically wealthy compared to those in the 11th century is not merely a matter of technological innovation .
It is also the result of the growing inventories of machines , tools , and equipment ( i.e. , " capital goods " ) that have been bequeathed from generation to generation .
" Everybody knows " that thrift leads to prosperity , while prodigal spending leads to ruin .
There 's even a famous story in the Bible on this topic .
It is truly shocking to learn that Krugman not only tells his students the exact opposite — namely that private virtue leads to public vice , and that saving makes the community poorer — but that he actually relishes the demonstration .
Fortunately for one 's sanity , we can uncover the fallacies pretty easily .
The Misleading " Circular Flow " Model
In a nutshell , the problem with Krugman 's Keynesian analysis is that it is static , meaning that it does n't involve the passage of time , and consequently it can't begin to grapple with the capital structure in a modern economy .
The " circular flow diagram " illustrates the way Krugman views the economy :
So during a recession , Krugman thinks that ( for some reason ) consumers freak out and start spending less .
This reduces the revenues earned by firms from the sale of goods and services .
But then this means firms have less money with which to hire factors of production ( natural resources , labor hours , and capital equipment ) .
That means the income earned by the owners of these items — i.e. , everyone in the economy — goes down .
But with less income , people in their role as consumers can't spend as much on goods and services , so business receipts fall even further , and so on until the decentralized market economy crashes into a major depression .
To repeat , Krugman thinks the free market can't solve this problem , because individuals rationally respond to the onset of the crisis by increasing their cash balances , which only makes the crisis worse .
According to Krugman , in order to escape from this vicious cycle , the government must coax consumers to start spending again , perhaps by cutting interest rates or giving tax refunds .
But sometimes ( as in the present situation ) those remedies are inadequate , and then it is the duty of the politicians to be the adults and spend tens of billions in borrowed money to do a Control - Alt - Delete on the economy .
There are so many problems with Krugman 's thinking that it 's hard to know where to begin .
For starters , if government pump - priming can boost firm revenues , which raises national income , which allows further business expansion , etc. etc. , then why employ this technique only during recessions ?
Why not recommend that the government always engage in deficit spending , in order to create jobs and boost GDP ?
" Well , " the Keynesian would say , " in a state of full employment , further additions to aggregate demand would n't allow firms to hire more workers .
The new demand for products and services at that point would serve merely to push up prices , not increase real output . "
Ah , now we 're getting somewhere .
With all the talk of consumer spending and national income , we often forget that actual production must occur before people can consume anything .
It does n't matter how many green pieces of paper are in your wallet ; you can't " demand " a TV set unless the store has an actual unit on the shelf .
Pushing it back one step , no matter how many customers are lining up outside his store , the manager of Best Buy can't stockpile his shelves with TVs unless the manufacturer has previously assembled them .
And of course , the manufacturer can't do so — regardless of how much money he is offered by the Best Buy manager — unless he can find enough workers , and enough of the relevant parts , to actually make the TVs .
We now see why the circular - flow diagram above is a very misleading model of the economy .
It leads us to think that output of finished consumer goods can immediately rise and fall with " spending . "
This framework would hold if there were no capital goods , meaning that all consumer goods and services were produced immediately , as workers took gifts of nature and produced the finished item on the spot .
For example , in an economy composed of masseuses and jugglers , the circular - flow diagram might be useful .
If someone wanted a massage and had the cash , the masseuse could go right to work .
The only physical constraint on output in the " massage sector " would be the number of masseuses , and the fact that they needed to sleep at some point .
Besides the input of the masseuse 's labor , the only other item involved is a table , and the same table can be used in the production of thousands of massages before needing to be replaced .
Things are different with most of the goods and services produced in a modern economy .
In almost every sector , the workers show up and rely on tools and equipment that greatly magnify their productivity .
Moreover , the overwhelming majority of workers do n't apply their tools directly to raw natural resources .
Instead , they use their tools to transform materials that are shipped to them from other firms .
It 's useful to take a step back and just consider what happens every day in the worldwide market .
There are billions of humans scattered over the planet .
Some of us work on oil rigs , pulling up barrels of crude .
Some of us work on farms , gathering wheat .
Some of us work on oil tankers or drive tractor trailers , bringing the ( somewhat ) raw materials to others .
As consumers , we only see the tail end of a " pipeline " that could be traced back many years .
The finished goods you buy at the store are made of components that passed through probably thousands of different hands , in dozens of countries , before all coming together into the item you throw in your grocery cart .
Once we grasp the stunning complexity of the true " economic problem " — how all of this interlocking human activity is coordinated so that production flows smoothly and predictably — we see the absurdity of Keynesian pump - priming remedies .
During a recession , it 's not as if all output in all sectors falls by the exact same percentage .
On the contrary , some sectors shrink more than others .
This is because some sectors suffered huge losses , and they need to release some ( or all ) of their workers and other resources to more profitable sectors .
This reshuffling takes time , especially because critical intermediate goods need to be produced so that operations further down the " pipeline " can resume .
( In this article , I tell a quick story describing this process for a hypothetical island of 100 people . )
The Keynesians are right that in a condition of " full employment , " their proposals wo n't cause more physical TVs and pickup trucks to roll off the assembly lines .
But even in a state of widespread unemployment , the Keynesian solutions do n't help .
To repeat , this is because we can't simply increase activity in all sectors by , say , 1 % to raise output back up to pre-recession levels .
Generally speaking , this is physically impossible .
No matter how much money consumers or the government throw at it , Ford can produce 1,000 more Rangers only if it can purchase 4,000 more of the appropriate tires .
And the tire producer in turn can only meet Ford 's request if it can buy the appropriate amount of extra rubber .
And the rubber producer can only do this if …and so on .
When the recession is the result of a central - bank - induced artificial boom ( such as the recent housing boom ) , the downturn is a period of readjustment , when misallocated resources are channeled back into more appropriate lines , consistent with consumer preferences and technological realities .
When the government steps in and tries to prevent this readjustment , it simply maintains an unsustainable deployment of scarce resources .
Bottlenecks occur in the millions of different " pipelines " tracing the flow of natural resources through millions of different workers ' hands and onto the store shelves .
There Is Nothing Paradoxical About Thrift
In closing , it will be useful to spell out exactly what happens in a market economy when consumers decide to save more of their income .
The first thing to realize is that people do not decide to " spend " or not ; rather , they decide whether to spend in the present versus in the future .
For example , imagine that thousands of couples in a large city one day decide to skip their weekly restaurant outings in order to save up for a summer cruise .
At first , it seems that this would hurt the economy .
After all , local restaurants see their sales drop , and so they buy fewer items from their suppliers and lay off some workers .
The suppliers and workers in turn have less income to spend , and so sales are hurt elsewhere too .
However , so long as the entrepreneurs involved in the cruise industry anticipate the eventual increase in demand for their services , they will exactly offset the above effects when they hire more workers and other items in preparation for the busy summer months .
The new savings ( which were previously spent on restaurants ) drives down interest rates , perhaps allowing the cruise operators to borrow money and pay for an additional liner .
Thus the decision to save more does n't reduce total income or employment , once everyone adjusts to the new spending patterns .
It is really no different from a scenario where thousands of people become health conscious and decide to spend their money on vegetables rather than fast food .
Now it 's true , in the present circumstances of our financial panic , consumer spending has fallen because of fear , not because of a fundamental shift in the desired timing of consumption .
But still , the point remains that people cut back on present consumption in order to be able to " spend money " in the future .
The difference between our present situation and the cruise - liner story above is just that people right now are n't sure exactly when , and on what , they will be spending this extra savings .
Even so , the best solution is still for the government to mind its own business and let people work things out voluntarily .
The uncertainty is n't phony ; people really do n't know what 's going to happen next month .
In this situation , it is entirely appropriate for humans to stop cranking out so many iPods and designer clothes , allowing a temporary build - up of the resources that go into the production of these nonessential items .
What is especially ironic in all of this is that even on his own terms , Krugman 's recommendations make no sense .
That is to say , even if we put aside all of the real , physical readjustments that must occur to revamp the economy in light of the unsustainable housing boom , it would still be the case that the government ought to do nothing .
If the present crisis really were largely the result of irrational panic and hoarding then government activism would only make people more uncertain about the future .
In particular , no one has any idea what Paulson & Bernanke will announce next regarding financial companies and mortgages .
If we 're trying to reassure consumers that everything is normal , why would we resurrect tools from the New Deal playbook ?
There is one more contradiction we should mention .
The essence of the paradox of thrift and the liquidity trap is the insight that businesses wo n't expand operations if there is no demand for their product .
But if Krugman and other pump - primers can see that the interruption in spending is only temporary , then so can the business owners involved .
And to the extent that it is not temporary — for example , homebuilders are seeing much lower sales , and this is n't simply due to irrational hoarding — then government spending to " fill the gap " only screws things up even more .
For long - run sustainable output , businesses want to have finished products emerging from the pipeline just when consumers want to buy them .
Market prices and the profit - and - loss system provide the best means of allowing entrepreneurs to make these forecasts .
If the government starts buying , say , office copiers even though it does n't really need them , that might provide jobs temporarily in a few firms , but the owners know that they can't trust this demand because it is subject to political whim .
Thus the government 's efforts will simply confuse entrepreneurs who are trying to configure their capacity to meet future demand .
Conclusion
In his discussion of the " paradox of thrift , " Paul Krugman proves that he is not an economist — or at least , not a very good one .
His policy recommendations are based on a Keynesian model bereft of time and the capital structure of production .
Recessions are rooted in misalignments in this unbelievably complex structure , and there needs to be a period of below - normal output as these pipelines are fixed .
Most important , consumers are doing the right thing when they increase their saving during a downturn .
If solving a recession really were as simple as getting people to spend , then we would n't keep experiencing them .
Boozy Britain 's bloody New Year : A 999 call every seven seconds in alcohol - induced mayhem
Violence scarred celebrations and led to a bloody New Year across the country as emergency services endured a chaotic end to 2008 .
Ambulance control centres reported receiving 999 calls as often as once every seven seconds - the second highest volume of calls since the Millennium - as binge drinkers turned nasty in the freezing temperatures .
Many of the calls related either to alcohol - fuelled assaults or excessive drunkenness .
Bloodbath : A victim of a bottle attack at a club in North London
Booze contributed to time - wasting calls to 999 operators too , with one man calling to ask if New York was in America , and what time it was there .
Elsewhere , while large numbers were ferried to hospitals , in some areas injuries were treated by paramedics in ' booze buses ' to leave ambulances free for more serious emergencies .
In Essex , so many drunk people were arrested that all 200 of the constabulary 's cells were filled , and overflow revellers had to be shipped to neighbouring Kent to be held for the night .
A huge brawl at a social club in Loughton , Essex , meant 600 rowdy revellers had to be dispersed , with two arrested for attempted murder after a 47 - year - old man was stabbed in the eye and back .

In Wales , a 999 call led to tragedy when an ambulance speeding its way to an emergency ran over and killed reveller Jason Hawkes , 23 , as he stood in the road outside a pub in Beddau - near Cardiff .
In one of the most disturbing incidents an ambulance was wrecked by callous thugs while parked outside the home of a sick baby boy in Tilehurst , Reading .
He eventually had to be sped to hospital in his family 's own car .
Mother - of - two Jemma Dromgoole , 22 , had found her son Ryan , 19 months , screaming in pain with a limp arm at teatime on New Year 's Eve .
Miss Dromgoole said : ' We thought that he had dislocated his shoulder or something even worse .
He was so distressed I had to call 999 .

' When we got outside one of the paramedics made a dash for the ambulance .
He said he saw a kid on a bike and then told us the ambulance had been put out of action by vandals .
' He asked if we could go in my partner 's car to the hospital .
What kind of person does that to an ambulance ?
It 's sickening .'

Last year the problem was even worse but then it was nowhere near as cold , with far more revellers out on the streets .
Spokesman Alistair Drummond said : ' The high volume of calls on New Year 's Eve put the service under increased pressure .
' It made it harder for us to ensure we respond quickly to other patients with potentially life - threatening emergencies .
' People should not be drinking so much that they wake up in hospital .
' We would urge them to think more carefully about the consequences of drinking so that they can enjoy the start of 2009 safely and responsibly . '
Violent incidents in the capital included a bloody fight at the Gilgamesh Party in Chalk Farm , where a man was left drenched in blood after allegedly being hit with a bottle .
His injuries were not life threatening . .

British Transport Police spokesman Superintendent Brian Pearce - whose colleagues helped control the huge crowds gathered for fireworks by the Thames , said : ' The nature of New Year 's Eve in central London has changed .
What used to be a relatively low - key , spontaneous night is now a world - class event that attracts thousands and thousands of people .
' Such large crowds create a challenging policing environment .
In the main the crowds were good humoured . '
There were 13 ' booze buses ' or field hospitals specially set up around the capital to deal with minor injuries on the spot .
The West Midlands Ambulance Service received a call once every 12 seconds in the first five hours of 2009 - most alcohol related , and dozens of them inappropriate , including the man asking whether New York was in America .

According to the Federation of Small Businesses , it will be ' No Show Friday ' because many employees will seek to extend their festive break into the weekend rather than bother turning up for work .
Spokesman Stephen Alambritis said : ' It 's bleak and freezing , and after the celebrations for New Year 's Eve run into New Year 's Day , we believe there will be record absences from work .

Last night ’s 60 Minutes had a story on Oil Speculation .
Its not that they said anything that was factually wrong per se , its more that they told 10 % of the story of the rise and fall of energy prices .
The entire report was surprisingly thin , and avoided discussing all of the many other factors that had been impacting energy prices during the 7 year rise and subsequent collapse ( 60 Minutes video here ) .
Very often , major bull market moves begin on fundamentals , but shift towards the end of its life into a speculative frenzy .
These always end in a price surge ( i.e. , a blowoff top ) , which is followed by a collapse .
But note that it is in the end game where speculation dominates , not the first 7 or 8 innings .
That was true as much for Housing in 2005 - 06 as it was for dot com stocks in 1999 - 2000 .
Hot markets always attract hot money .
But merely claiming that the run up in Oil prices was due to unprecedented speculation misses the big picture of what actually occurred .
And , it reflects a lack of understanding of how markets work , and the psychology of booms , bubbles and busts .
Here are a few factors that I believe the folks at 60 Minutes either misunderstood or overlooked completely during the run up from $ 20 to $ 100 :
1. Oil is priced in US Dollars .
Since 2001 , the Dollar fell 40 % ( from 120 to 72 ) ; Oil rise nearly 5 fold over the same period .
And Oil ’s collapse occurred over a period when the dollar formed a short term bottom ; it has certainly had its most significant rally in years ( 72 to 88 ) .
2 . Over the same period that Oil prices were rising , the US was fighting two major wars in the Middle East , Iraq and Afghanistan .
These impact prices via psychology and risk of supply disruption — especially at a time when producers were running flat out .
3 . Energy prices rose during a global economic expansion ( fueled by low rates and cheap money ) ;
Oil fell during a period that marked the beginning of the US recession and the start of a global slowdown .
4 . Since 2001 , Commodities of all sorts rose significantly : Steel , aluminum , cement , cotton , soy , livestocks , foodstuffs , precious metals , etc .
Were they all driven by speculation , or was something else going on ?
5 . Since the 1 % Fed funds rate of 2002 - 03 , inflation has had a dramatic impact on ALL prices — from medical costs to insurance to education to health care to transportation to housing to food and energy .
That 60 Minutes failed to even mention inflation in a piece on Oil prices is a terrible oversight on their part .
6 . Throughout the 1990s and 2000s , cars were increasingly replaced with SUVs and trucks in the United States .
Not only did these get appreciably worse gas mileage , that fleet transition took place as the total US miles driven rose .
Over the past 20 years , people have lived increasingly further away from their jobs .
Hence , increased US demand for energy accompanied ( and increased prices ) .
7 . Since gas prices hit $ 4 a gallon and the recession began , total US miles driven fell significantly , by several billion miles .
As expected , t he drop in driving was followed by a fall in prices .
8 . 60 Minutes interviewed Mike Masters , a hedge fund manager who had testified before Congress that speculation was driving prices .
They omitted to mention he was talking his book .
His holdings in energy sensitive stocks — with large positions , the vast majority in call options , in AMR Corp ( AMR ) , the parent of American Airlines , Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) , General Motors ( GM ) , UAL Corp ( UAUA ) and US Airways ( LCC ) — were responsible for his fund losing 35 % of its value before the Fall 2008 market collapse ..
9 . China boomed ~!
More and more global manufacturing outsourcing saw factories being built throughout China .
They also went through a wild process building out the nation in preparation for the 2008 Olympics held there .
Oh , and China , like the US , also began filling its Strategic Petroleum Reserves .
Another small country , India , was booming over this period also .
10 .
The rise of extremist terrorist groups like al - Quada , the hostility of Iran towards the West , supply and political disruptions in places like Nigeria , and overt hostility to the US by oil producers like Venezuela President Hugo Chavez also contributed to drive prices up .
The political factors were also omitted .
There ’s a lot more , but the bottom line is this :
Higher energy prices were caused many many factors over the past 8 years .
Certainly , speculation played a part at the end of the run — but it always does .
Oil fell more precipitously than it rose , but do n’t all markets do that ?
Did n’t the S&P just plummet nearly 50 % in a year , after a 5 year run ?
Speculation is merely one aspect of what happened .
60 Minutes missed the other 59 elements . . .

Four current and former executives from LG Display in South Korea and from Chunghwa Picture Tubes in Taiwan have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail terms in the U.S. for participating in a conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of TFT - LCD ( Thin Film Transistor - Liquid Crystal Display ) panels , according to the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) .
They are the first to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in the active investigations into anti-trust violations in the TFT - LCD industry , the DOJ said Thursday .
The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act , which carries a maximum fine of US $ 1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual .
Under plea agreements which have to be approved by the courts , the executives have agreed to serve prison terms ranging from six to nine months and pay criminal fines of between US $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 , besides assisting the U.S. government in ongoing investigations into the TFT - LCD price - fixing , DOJ said .
The individual plea agreements follow moves by LG Display , Chunghwa and Sharp to plead guilty and pay criminal fines for fixing LCD panel prices .
LG Display agreed to pay a $ 400 million criminal fine , while Chunghwa settled for a $ 65 million criminal fine .
Sharp also pleaded guilty in December to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT - LCD panels sold to Dell , Apple Computer , and Motorola Inc , and was sentenced to pay a $ 120 million criminal fine , DOJ said .
Among the executives charged is Chang Suk " C.S. "
Chung , an LG executive who is alleged in a one - count felony charge to have conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT - LCD panels from late 2001 to mid 2006 , the DOJ said .
During the conspiracy , Chang Suk Chung , a Korean citizen , worked as LG's Vice President of Monitor Sales .
Among the three Taiwanese executives from Chunghwa is Chieng - Hon " Frank " Lin , a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen , who was Chunghwa 's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer .
All three executives are charged with participating in the TFT - LCD price fixing conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14 , 2001 , to December 2006 , the DOJ said .
These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the U.S. for an antitrust offense , it added .
Big brother is NOT watching you : Cash - strapped towns leave CCTV cameras unmonitored
Once , Britain was the most watched nation in the world , with more than 4 million CCTV cameras monitoring our every move .
But now in these difficult economic times , it seems that Big Brother is n't actually watching , in fact no one is .
As cash - strapped police forces and councils around the UK are forced to tighten their belts in the recession , CCTV cameras around town centres are being left unmanned as they can't afford to pay anyone to watch out for crime as it happens .
Unmanned : Many CCTV cameras , like the one above , are not being watched
Instead , entire networks of surveillance cameras are being effectively put on auto - pilot , with police reviewing tapes only after a reported incident .
While in some areas , members of the public and police community support officers are being drafted in fill the breach .
Now critics have called for a review of the future of CCTV surveillance which has cost taxpayers £ 500 million over the last decade , saying there is little point in having the cameras if no one is watching .
Worcester City Council is the latest to announce plans to cut CCTV operatives monitoring the town 's 63 cameras in a bid to plug a £ 4.3 million hole in its budget .
Council leaders claim that paying staff to carry out surveillance which costs the council £ 140,000 a year , is a burden it can no longer afford .
Simon Geraghty , leader of Worcester City Council , said : ' There has been an agreement between the city council and West Mercia Police that we fund the operatives and we have to give them at least 12 months notice .
' They ( West Mercia Police ) have said they do not want to fund this but it is a burden we can no longer support . '
But the move has angered police who say that it will be more difficult to detect and convict criminals without the support of the CCTV operators .
Chief Supt Reynolds , south Worcestershire 's head of policing , said : ' It 's like having an automatic car without a driver .
' The dynamic element of the system is crucial .
If a club reports trouble , the camera operators can point their camera at the venue .
' This could be a very important part of the evidence - gathering process .
' You could have the cameras on a roaming setting , but it becomes haphazard on what it records .
' If an incident occurs and the camera happens not to be trained on that place at that time , it becomes useless in terms of that incident . '
Last month it emerged that Cotswold District Council had failed to allocate a new contract to monitor its CCTV system in Cirencester , Gloucestershire .
Police Community Support Officers have now been drafted in to fill the breach on Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays .
But at all other times the cameras have been on automatic , with police reviewing tapes only after a reported incident .
While in Dorset , police resorted to advertising for unpaid civilian volunteers to monitor CCTV footage after claiming that it was not cost effective to pay trained professionals .
In June Dorset Police appealed for members of the public to watch live images from street security cameras in Wimborne , Blandford , Shaftesbury and Gillingham to help spot crimes and anti-social behaviour .
Surveillance expert , Professor Nigel Gilbert , who last year produced a report for the Royal Academy of Engineers calling for a halt to CCTV cameras until their need was proven , said today that the situation had become farcical .
He said : ' The evidence suggests surveillance cameras are completely useless as a way of reducing crime , their only use is as a way of collecting evidence a crime has been committed - it does n't stop it happening in the first place .
' The public has been misled into believing that it 's a silver bullet for crime reduction and actually it is not .
' I suspect that councils are realising this and therefore it is not a very high priority to look out for crime on CCTV systems .
' It is not an efficient or cost - effective use of resources .
' With no one to watch , I would question the value of having them turned on at all . '
Dr David Murakami-Wood , from The Surveillance Studies Network has also questioned the future of CCTV , saying : ' Councils are now having cameras on with no one watching or they are having to cut back staffing levels in the recession .
' CCTV is expensive - local councils did not really think about these costs when they joined the rush to install cameras funded by central government .
' Now many are realising that they have been saddled with a massive extra cost that in hard times like these can eat into their limited budgets for providing other forms of public safety .
' Questions should now be asked about the future of CCTV and why we have so many cameras if no one is watching them .
' If the only justification is that people are watching if you are in trouble and that is not happening , then there seems little point in having them on at all . '

Usually , search engines can look through data outdated by a few days .
But Twitter search seems to be returning real time search results .
That ’s why it ’s interesting how it works .
In this post I ’ll present a short introduction to full - text search engines and my private thoughts about a possible implementation of a better one .
Let ’s start from the beginning .
How does normal full - text search work ?
It ’s really simple .
When you search for a single keyword , like britney , the search engine finds a list of documents that contain this keyword .
This list is called an inverted index .
I call this list a ‘ hitlist ’ .
For example :
britney -> [ document_1 , document_3 , document_44 , document_555 ]
When you enter two keywords , like britney spears , you really want to get a list of documents that contains both keywords “ britney ” and “ spears ” .
Under the hood , search engine retrieves inverted indexes for both keywords .
Than it looks for documents that appear in both retrieved indexes .
" britney " -> [ document_1 , document_3 , document_44 , document_555 ] " spears " -> [ document_2 , document_3 , document_5 , document_44 ]
Computed result :
" britney " AND " spears " -> [ document_3 , document_44 ]
The AND operation must be very fast ( usually O( n ) , where n is the number of documents for a single keyword ) .
To achieve such linear speed , inverted indexes must be presorted .
So what ’s the problem ?
Imagine that inverted indexes ( I call them `hitlists` ) are big .
In a pessimistic case a hitlist will contain references to all of your documents .
For example the word ‘ the’ would probably appear in every document , so the hitlist for this word would be huge .
To reduce RAM and CPU usage while comparing hitlists , they should be stored in a linear chunk of memory .
That makes adding and removing items from hitlists very expensive .
That ’s the reason why creating indexes is usually very different process from querying them .
Normally creating an index is a separate stage .
Once this stage is finished you can use computed , usually immutable , index .
The problem is that it becomes very hard to create indexes when you have more data then RAM .
That ’s why huge data sets are usually split between many reasonably sized indexes .
On the other hand splitting indexes not very good .
Remember , that reading a hitlist from many indexes requires reading data from many index files .
Remember that disk operations – disk seeks , are really expensive .
Consider :
reading one hitlist from one index : 1 - 2 disk seeks – 8 - 20ms
reading one hitlist from ten indexes : 10 - 20 disk seeks – 80- 200ms
As you can see , it ’s better to have a hitlist in one chunk and in one index .
As mentioned before , once this chunk is stored on the disk , it should be immutable – updating it can be very expensive .
That ’s why usually full - text search engine serve data outdated by a few days .
Every now and then the indexes are recreated from scratch .
However , Twitter search serves realtime data .
It ’s very different from what normal search engines can do .
On the other hand Twitter search serves realtime data
That ’s why I was wondering how Twitter search works .
Serving realtime data is not a thing that normal full - text search engines can do .
But let ’s take a closer look at page loading times for a simple query ‘ text search ’ :
2nd page : 0.44 seconds
20th page : 6.72 seconds
30th page : timeout ( proxy error )
Hmm .
Timeout on a search is not a very good result .
For me it means that they just use some kind of sql - based full text search .
It works fine when data is cached in memory .
But once you try to read old data – it becomes impossible to read data from disks in reasonable time .
So it looks like Twitter is not really using a full text search , if we understand the term ‘ full text search ’ as defined at the beginning of this post .
Rather Twitter is using some kind of a hack around a SQL database .
This seems to be working fine for the first few result pages .
Is it possible to create true realtime full - text search indexing ?
I do n’t know in general .
I was thinking about a particular Twitter - like use case .
I ’d also like add some other assumptions :
There should n’t be an explicit indexing stage .
Once you add the data to the search engine , they ’re ready to be served .
The search engine is always ready to serve queries .
We ’re talking about pretty big scale .
For a small scale ( index fits to RAM ) Lucene or Zope could do realtime search indexing pretty well .
There are n’t any particularly strong latency requirements for queries .
It would be good to serve most of the requests in a short time , like 100 ms , but it ’s nothing bad if someone has to wait a few seconds now and then .
Document_ids are monotonic and based on timestamp .
That would mean that the newer the document , the bigger the document_id .
This simplifies the process of sorting hitlists a lot .
We ’re talking about a Twitter - like scenario : A lot of tiny documents .
Changes to the data should be visible in query results instantly .
Let ’s say that in the pessimistic case we should n’t get longer delays than 5 minutes .
Even with these assumptions , I ’m not sure if the problem is solvable .
I ’m not sure if anyone has ever done a working and scalable implementation for that problem ( correct me if I ’m wrong ! ) .
Based on these requirements , let ’s try to design the API for such a realtime full - text search engine :
add_to_index( document_id , keywords )
del_from_index(document_id )
search ( query ) -> returns list of document_ids
Initial feed of data
As mentioned before , we do n’t have the initial phase of creating and optimizing indices by design .
That ’s not a particularly bad thing , but it means that in the beginning you need to feed this search engine with current offline data and then update and add new records on - the - fly .
It means that we actually do n’t really care about the speed of adding a document to index when we ’re in operation .
On the web quite a small amount of data is created or changed .
So unless adding document is particularly slow ( more than a second ) , we really do n’t care about the speed .
On the other hand , when we feed initial data to the index we want that operation to complete in reasonable time .
Rebuilding indexes from offline data should take at most a few days .
Let ’s count how fast adding documents needs to be , in a situation when we ’d like to index a dozen gigabytes of text .
This experiment requires some assumptions :
Let ’s index 12 gigabytes of text : an average social network could have about that much data .
Let ’s consider Twitter ’s data model – a document is at most 140 characters long .
On average , an English word is about 5.1 letters long .
Okay .
The counting begins .
12 gigabytes / 5.1 letters_per_word = 2.45 * 10^9 words
The main metric of indexing speed is not the number of unique documents , it ’s not even the number of unique keywords .
What we ’re interested in , is the number of unique tuples ( document_id , keyword ) .
Let ’s assume that adding one tuple document - keyword takes 1ms :
( 2.45*10^9 words * 0.001 seconds ) /60.0 sec /60.0 min/24.0 hours = 30.5 days
Ouch .
Reindexing of 12 gigabytes of data would take 31 days .
That ’s not good .
But we can do it faster !
Let ’s assume that adding one tuple costs 0.1 ms : we do our job in 3.5 days .
That ’s more reasonable .
We can spend 4 days of work to reindex all of the data .
The problem is that 0.1 ms per tuple means that we need to create a really fast system .
Disk seeks
Adding one tuple ( document_id , keword ) costs us a disk seek – we need to save data .
That ’s around 8 ms .
But we need to have 0.1 ms per added tuple to make everything run in reasonable time .
The result is easy to predict – we need to have 80 disks and add 80 tuples in parallel , leading to 0.1 ms average cost .
To sum up : indexing 12.5 gigabytes of data would require 3.5 days of work and 80 disks , possibly on multiple machines .
That sounds rather expensive .
It also means that we need to be able to scale horizontally .
Optimizing
But , maybe we do n’t need to synchronize the hitlists to disk every time we add a tuple .
Let ’s change our API a bit :
add_to_index(document_id , keywords , synchronization_latency=60seconds )
Now we can choose to cache hitlists for a period of time .
During this time the hitlists would grow bigger before being written to disk .
That ’s not really realtime indexing , but it ’s a reasonable compromise .
On the other hand – how many disk seeks could we save using this trick ?
It ’s not so easy to answer this question , but fortunately , we can simplify our model and get an answer .
Let ’s forget about the latency of cacheing the hitlist and think about caching a particular number of hitlists .
How much we can win by delaying synchronization ?
I prepared an experiment :
Take a few gigabytes of text - only English wikipedia dump .
Count the number of unique words – this is the number of hitlists produced .
In the optimistic case of unlimited memory we would have exactly this number of disk seeks .
Count the total number of words .
This is a pessimistic number of disk seeks , if we synchronize to disk for every tuple .
On the other hand for this model we do n’t have to use any memory .
Let ’s assume that we keep the X most often updated hitlists in memory and are counting the number of disk seeks in this scenario .
For every X hitlists cached count the win against the pessimistic case and the loss against the optimistic case .
Here are the results for few a chunks of data from wikipedia :
DATA 500MB - chunk # 1 500MB - chunk #2 1GB optimum – unique words 1036547 971534 1634688 worst – total words 85016295 84660053 171409013 16 hitlists cached 66941279 67396522 134685743 256 hitlists cached 34076915 33975288 68475626 4096 hitlists cached 15648343 14814646 31308282 16384 hitlists cached 8190192 7800053 16150592 65536 hitlists cached 3764562 3565387 7415305 0.5 M hitlists cached 1425247 1329566 2639209 1 M hitlists cached 1211102 1130571 2107068 16 M hitlists cached 1040521 975186 1650374 BOOST

Results :
For caching 16 million hitlists in memory we are very close to optimum ( ANTIBOOST = 1 ) .
That ’s not surprising , since there are not many more unique words in English than 16mln .
With 1 million hitlists in memory we are only 30 - 60 % worse than optimum .
For 1 million hitlists we are 70x - 81 x better than the pessimistic scenario .
It means that the optimum size of the cache is around 0.5 to 1 mln hitlists .
This scenario should not use more than 0.5 GB of RAM .
This cache size could give us around 70 times fewer updates to disk .
Sounds reasonable .
That means that we could possibly index 12.5 gigabytes of data in 4 days – using one disk .
But to achieve that we ’d need very fast software , that would be only I /O bound .
Architecture
Of course , the point is to create a real time search engine that is fully scalable .
Actually such an approach could simplify the software .
By scalable I mean being able to scale horizontally – you could add a new disk or a new server and the software would just work without any special configuration changes .
Scaling down is more complicated , because it requires moving data .
It ’s not a requirement for us .
I believe that the architecture of this project should look like this :
It ’s clear that the actual indexing , querying or other operations on hitlists are very different than actually storing data on disks .
That ’s why I think that the biggest challenge is not really the search engine logic but rather a scalable and ultra fast persistence layer .
Scalable , persistent key - value storage
Scalable and persistent key - value databases are a very long topic .
We would need such a system as a persistence layer for our search engine .
The most important features are :
Simple key - value storage is enough for our needs .
There must be an â€œappendâ€ operation .
We do n’t want to retrieve few megabyte hitlist just to add one item to it .
As fast as possible .
Latency must be kept very low .
We do n’t need redundancy – speed is more important .
In case of a disk failure we can afford to recreate the index from scratch .
No eventual - consistency .
We need the proper value right when we ask for it .
No transactions , we do n’t need them .
Optimistic - locking is enough .
It should cost at most one disk seek to retrieve a record .
At most two disk seeks to add data ( one to retrieve the record , another to save it )
I like memcached binary protocol , so it could be nice to have it as an interface .
Scalable – adding a new server does n’t require stopping the service and needs minimal configuration changes .
The client API for this storage needs to be able to retrieve data from many servers in parallel .
Remember that every interaction with storage could take a few milliseconds if it requires a disk seek .
There are various open - source projects that can be used as a scalable persistent key - value storage , but no project fully satisfies my needs .
Here ’s the list of what I found at this point ( I ’d be happy to update this list if I missed something yesterday Richard Jones wrote better comparison ) :
Making it even faster
There are some very interesting ideas about how hitlists could be represented and stored .
The basic solution is to store each hitlist as a list of sorted integers .
Like :
' britney ' -> [ 1,3,4,44,122,123 ]
To reduce disk usage , this list could just be compressed using , for example , gzip .
Unfortunately gzip does n’t give us a good compression ratio .
My tests show a ratio of only around 1.16 x .
However , we could modify the hitlist to only store the differences between elements .
Our ‘ britney ’ hit list would then look like :
' britney ' -> [ 1,2,1,40,78,1 ]
The gzip compression ratio is now much better .
It ’s around 1.63 x .
That ’s not astonishing , but it could be worth the CPU power wasted on compression .
A totally different approach is to store hitlists as bitmaps .
It can be memory inefficient , but it makes binary operations AND , OR , NAND very very fast .
To reduce memory penalty we could use compressed bitmaps .
It could be a perfect way of storing data for very long hitlists .
On the other hand it could be worse for small and sparse hitlists .
I ’m still not sure which representation is the best ; maybe some kind of a hybrid solution .
There ’s for sure a place for optimization in this area .
Conclusion
There are a lot of open questions for this problem .
One of them is what the persistence layer should look like .
The next thing is the internal representation of hitlists , how to make them always sorted and whether sorting should be done on retrieval or on update .
How to be able to retrieve only part of them if they are compressed .
Yet another idea is to use solid state drives as storage to reduce disk seek problem .
There ’s a lot of work to be done in this area .
I think that such a full text search engine could fit perfectly as piece of infrastructure in many websites .

Advertisement Israel has sent ground forces into the Gaza Strip after a week of air strikes to try to halt rocket attacks by Palestinian militants .
Its troops were reported to be engaged in heavy clashes with Hamas fighters in northern Gaza .
Both sides have reported casualties in the fighting .
The UN secretary general called for an immediate halt to operations .
But an emergency Security Council meeting failed to agree a united approach to the Gaza conflict .
As dawn broke in Gaza a large plume of black smoke could be seen rising from part of the northern strip while the sound of exploding artillery shells - could also be heard .
The shelling had continued through the night .
Hamas has held the people of Gaza hostage ever since their illegal coup against the forces of ( Palestinian ) President Mahmoud Abbas
White House statement
In pictures : New phase begins Aid worker diary : Part seven Formidable force fights Hamas Witnesses say Israeli military convoys supported by attack helicopters crossed into northern Gaza at four separate points after nightfall on Saturday .
Advancing Israeli tanks were reported to be in battles around Gaza City and the northern towns of Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya , the Afp news agency reported .
Hamas fighters replied with mortars and rockets , witnesses said .
The Israeli army said 30 of its soldiers had been wounded in the ground offensive , two of them seriously .
Palestinian medical officials said eight Gazans had been killed by Israeli troops , five of them gunmen .
' Not war - hungry '
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the objective of the ground operation was " to destroy the Hamas terror infrastructure in the area of operations " .
In pictures : Protests worldwide UK protests over Gaza air strikes Gaza voices : Family fears " We are going to take some of the launch areas used by Hamas , " Maj Avital Leibovitch told reporters .
Israeli officials have described the offensive as a " limited " operation .
The move into Gaza had been preceded by some of the heaviest Israeli air and artillery attacks on the territory in more than a week of bombardment .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak said the ground campaign against Hamas " will not be easy or short , but we are determined " .
" Our aim is to force Hamas to stop its hostile activities against Israel and Israelis from Gaza , and to bring about a significant change in the situation in the southern part of Israel , " he told a news conference .
" We have carefully weighed all our operations .
We are not war - hungry , but we shall not allow a situation in which our towns , villages and civilians are constantly targeted by Hamas . "
Mr Barak also said Israel would " keep a sensitive eye " on its northern border with Lebanon , where it fought a short but bloody war with the Shia Hezbollah movement in 2006 .
" We hope the situation will remain calm .
Nevertheless , we are ready and alert to face any unwanted development in that area , " he added .
Timeline :
Week of attacks
The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says this is probably just the first wave of the assault , since there are said to be some 10,000 Israeli troops and hundreds of tanks massed on the border with Gaza .
The government has also announced the urgent call - up of " tens of thousands " of extra military reservists .
Just before the ground offensive began , Hamas issued a statement promising that Palestinian children would be picking over the ruins of Israeli tanks and the body parts of Israeli soldiers .
The militant group 's exiled political leader , Khaled Meshaal , earlier warned Israel against a ground offensive , saying that a " black destiny " awaited Israeli forces if the entered Gaza .
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the offensive as " a vicious aggression " .
Our correspondent says this promises to be a very bloody encounter .
' Alarm and dismay '
The UN session was convened a few hours after Israeli forces entered Gaza .
Talks lasted more than three hours and afterwards the Security Council 's current president - France 's Jean - Maurice Ripert - said there was a " general convergence " among some members , but he would not elaborate .

The UK ambassador to the UN , Sir John Sawers , said members had got close to an agreement .
He added it was disappointing there could not be a firm statement from the UN as the situation on the ground escalates .
France has strongly criticised the Israeli land campaign .
The British Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , said the escalation of the conflict would cause alarm and dismay .
The US said it had told Israel 's government that military action must be " mindful of the potential consequences to civilians . "
The State Department also said Washington is " deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation " in Gaza , but said in a statement that Hamas holds the people of Gaza hostage .
Israeli warplanes and naval vessels have carried out more than 800 strikes on the Gaza Strip since the offensive started eight days ago , including 40 on Saturday .
The UN has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis , and believes 25 % of more than 400 Palestinians killed by Israel so far were civilians .
Israel says about 80 % of those killed were Hamas militants .
Four Israelis have been killed by rocket fire from Gaza .
Mosque hit Earlier on Saturday , at least 13 people were killed in one Israeli raid when a missile struck a crowded mosque in Beit Lahiya , Palestinian medics said .
HAVE YOUR SAY Violence brings only more violence .
If the killing does n't stop there would be no truce .
Nour Hafez , Kuwait Witnesses said more than 200 people had been inside the Ibrahim al - Maqadna mosque for evening prayers when it was struck .
Correspondents say Israel has accused Hamas of using mosques to hide weapons and ammunition , but this is the first time a mosque has been hit at prayer time .
Militants in Gaza fired more rockets into southern Israel on Saturday , one of which hit the port of Ashdod , injuring two people .
Around the world , demonstrations were held against Israel 's military operations .
The biggest was in Paris , drawing more than 20,000 people .
About 10,000 people protested in London .
In Israel itself , tens of thousands of Israeli Arabs gathered in the town of Sakhnin to protest against their government 's actions .
