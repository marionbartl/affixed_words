NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bush administration officials have had talks with the nation 's automakers about providing possible federal help for the cash - starved companies , a White House spokeswoman said Monday .
Spokeswoman Dana Perino , responding to questions at her daily press briefing , said a decision had not yet been made about whether federal help will be offered to General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC .
A number of experts have expressed concern that the automakers , which have suffered a sharp plunge in sales , could run through their cash reserves by next year .
The automakers could get help through the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout passed by Congress earlier this month .
The bailout was designed to prompt banks and securities firms to loan money to businesses and consumers , but automakers might qualify for help through their finance arms , Perino said .
" It 's possible that some of those financing arms could be a part of the rescue package , the TARP , as they call it , at the Treasury Department , " Perino said .
" That 's one of the reasons Treasury has been in contact with them . "
Earlier this year , Congress approved a separate $ 25 billion loan program to help the automakers finance a switch in production from larger vehicles , such as pickups and full - size SUVs , to more fuel efficient vehicles .
The government has not started dispersing money under that program .
The Department of Energy is working on regulations to govern the loans .
" I think that it 's clear that the automakers are dealing with a very serious situation , " Perino said .
" They have been for some time . "
GM spokesman Greg Martin acknowledged Monday that automakers are interested in getting help from the federal government .
" We have been in contact with a variety of federal officials for some time during this extraordinary and difficult economic period , " said Martin , who is the automaker 's Washington - based spokesman .
Martin declined to elaborate on the discussions .
" We have said publicly that we believe the federal government should consider all of the tools available to it - some recently enacted - to support industries that are in distress and that are essential to the U.S. economy . "
A Chrysler spokesperson said the company " worked hard " after the bailout was proposed last month " to be sure it was broad enough to offer the tools to address the automotive credit liquidity problem . "
Ford declined to comment .
Industry officials suggested that Ford was the least likely to be pushing for bailout funds because it had the strongest cash position of the three U.S. automakers .
Last week , Michigan 's 17 - member congressional delegation signed a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke asking that the federal government help the U.S. automakers .
The delegation is made up of nine Republican members of the House and seven Democrats , along with the two Democratic senators .
" There is no single segment of America 's economy that is more critical to the financial well - being of millions of Americans than the automotive industry , " the letter stated .
" One in ten American jobs is related to auto manufacturing .
" In this current economic environment it is imperative that the government ensures that liquidity is restored so that the U.S. auto industry is able to function until normalcy is restored to credit markets , " the letter continued .
What the candidates say
Officials with the presidential campaigns of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have said they want the original $ 25 billion loan money made available to automakers more quickly .
The loan money was originally authorized last year and finally enacted this year as part of an energy bill .
" It should not take 18 months to issue loans that were authorized in 2007 , " said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's senior economic policy adviser .
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday evening that the Department of Energy may release to GM $ 5 billion from the $ 25 billion loan program .
Both presidential campaigns said they are open to using the Wall Street bailout program to help automakers , but they did n't make firm commitments .
Jason Furman , Obama 's top economic policy adviser , said his candidate wants Treasury and the Federal Reserve to explore the subject .
" At the end of the day , Senator Obama has pledged that all options will be on the table to help our nation 's auto industry succeed , " Furman said .
Holtz - Eakin said that McCain supports using the Wall Street bailout to help any industry that qualifies .
" It seems pretty clear that GMAC does , although Treasury will have to decide for others , " he said .
General Motors owns 49 % of GMAC , a finance company that has an extensive home loan portfolio in addition to auto loans .
Tough time for Detroit
All of the automakers have announced plant closings and payroll reductions in recent years to stem losses from their core North American auto operations .
Their combined U.S. sales in the first nine months of this year are down nearly 20 % from year - ago levels .
Just last week , privately - held Chrysler LLC announced it would eliminate one in four salaried jobs at the company .
It also said it would cut a shift at an Ohio plant and accelerate the planned closure of a Delaware assembly line .
Also last week , GM said that it is on track to meet its goal of a 20 % reduction in salaried staff costs , and added that further cuts could be needed because of the weak sales environment .
GM and Chrysler are reported to be in talks about a possible merger that could eliminate tens of thousands of additional jobs in an effort to save billions of dollars .
But finding financing for such a deal in the current environment has proved difficult .
Investors have also been scared away from the sector .
Last week financier Kirk Kerkorian , the largest individual investor at Ford outside of the Ford family , announced that he had sold 7.3 million shares of Ford and was looking to sell his remaining 133 million shares .
The sale means he 'll take a big loss on the Ford stake he purchased earlier this year .

I thought this was a powerful moment in the debate for Obama .
When a candidate can get personal about an issue it always rings true and in this case Obama draws on the the horrible experience his own mom had to endure during her final days fighting cancer and the insurance company .
I 'm still trying to figure out what Lisa Schiffren of the NRO was complaining about .
CNN :
Brokaw : Privilege , right or responsibility .
Let 's start with that .
Obama :
Well , I think it should be a right for every American .
In a country as wealthy as ours , for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they 're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they do n't have to pay her treatment , there 's something fundamentally wrong about that .
So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference .
And , Tom , I know that we 're under time constraints , but Sen.
McCain through a lot of stuff out there .
Number one , let me just repeat , if you 've got a health care plan that you like , you can keep it .
All I 'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it .
You 'll still have choice of doctor .
There 's no mandate involved .
Small businesses are not going to have a mandate .
What we 're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need .
Now , it 's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care , because children are relatively cheap to insure and we do n't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma .
And when Sen. McCain says that he wants to provide children health care , what he does n't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children 's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who did n't have previously health insurance have it now .
Now , the final point I 'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers , that do n't give you the fine print , so you end up thinking that you 're paying for something and , when you finally get sick and you need it , you 're not getting it .
And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state , you know what insurance companies will do ?
They will find a state -- maybe Arizona , maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings , where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions , and they will all set up shop there .
That 's how in banking it works .
Everybody goes to Delaware , because they 've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards .
And in that situation , what happens is , is that the protections you have , the consumer protections that you need , you 're not going to have available to you .
That is a fundamental difference that I have with Sen. McCain .
He believes in deregulation in every circumstance .
That 's what we 've been going through for the last eight years .
It has n't worked , and we need fundamental change .

The murder of Gayle Williams in Kabul on Monday follows a string of attacks on humanitarian aid workers in Afghanistan this year .
The first seven months have seen more than 120 attacks and the murder of 30 aid workers .
A further 92 aid workers have been kidnapped .
In August the Taliban murdered three foreign women and their Afghan driver in an ambush just outside Kabul , which was the bloodiest single attack on an international organisation in Afghanistan in recent years .
The four were working for the US - based International Rescue Committee , which I worked for when I lived in the country .
The Taliban justify their attacks by claiming that the aid organisations are attempting to proselytise for Christianity , which is illegal in Afghanistan .
A relatively high proportion of those killed have been women , and it is quite likely that the targeting of women is a deliberate policy .
When I was working in Jalalabad in 2004 , the Taliban blew up a bus of women election workers as part of their campaign to try to prevent women voting in that year 's presidential election .
Girls ' schools are also regularly burnt to the ground because the Taliban object to the education of women .
The Taliban view aid workers as soft targets .
We are unarmed and we tend not to accept military escorts , as that would affect our humanitarian status .
However , it is impossible to do the job without going into the field and , although security precautions are taken , we are probably the simplest high - profile victim .
Targeting aid workers is also a good way to achieve a wider political objective of halting the reconstruction of the country and undermining the authority of its central government .
Afghanistan is hugely dependent on international assistance and - unlike Iraq - there is still considerable support for the international presence .
That support has shrunk in recent years , as many Afghans believe that most of the aid is not getting through to its intended recipients .
The more the insurgents can isolate the international community from ordinary people , the easier it is to portray our presence as a straightforward occupation of their country .
In fact , when they were in government , the Taliban relied heavily on the international humanitarian community to make up for their total neglect of social programmes .
" God will provide " was Mullah Omar 's standard answer when asked about his government 's plans for healthcare and education .
What he really meant was that he was leaving the task to international aid workers .
This has led to a more complex relationship between aid organisations and insurgents than is often supposed .
Many agencies have been in Afghanistan for decades .
Most were based across the border in Peshawar during the jihad against the Russians , and their aid helped to sustain the families of the mujahideen , some of whom went on to form the Taliban .
There are a network of personal connections , mediated through tribal elders , by which aid organisations continue to communicate with the Taliban , often seeking their informal permission to operate in certain areas .
Last year the Taliban released four Red Cross workers , which they said had been kidnapped by " mistake " .
A spokesperson said : " We have nothing against the Red Cross and we are going to release them soon . "
The US government has also tried to integrate the delivery of humanitarian assistance into its counter - insurgency campaigns in both Iraq and Afghanistan , which many aid organisations complain has reduced the " humanitarian space " within which we can operate .
For most aid workers , political neutrality remains the best form of self - defence and the best way to gain access to crisis zones .

Went to War , has just been published conorfoley30@hotmail.com
Scientists from Oregon State University and the Natural History Museum in London have announced the discovery of the oldest known fossil of a gecko , with body parts that are forever preserved in life - like form after 100 million years of being entombed in amber .
Due to the remarkable preservative power of being embalmed in amber , the tiny foot of this ancient lizard still shows the tiny “ lamellae , ” or sticky toe hairs , that to this day give modern geckos their unusual ability to cling to surfaces or run across a ceiling .
Research programs around the world have tried to mimic this bizarre adhesive capability , with limited success .
This gecko’s running days are over , however , as only the foot , toes and part of a tail are left in the stone .
The rest might have become lunch for a small dinosaur or other predator during an ancient fight in the tropical forests of Myanmar during the Lower Cretaceous Period , from 97 million to 110 million years ago .
The find is at least 40 million years older than the oldest known gecko fossil , shedding additional light on the evolution and history of these ancient lizards that scampered among the feet of giant dinosaurs then and still are common in tropical or sub-tropical regions all over the world .
The findings were just published in Zootaxa , a professional journal .
“ It ’s the unusual toe pads and clinging ability of some geckos that make them such a fascinating group of animals , so we were very fortunate to find such a well - preserved foot in this fossil specimen , ” said George Poinar , Jr. , a courtesy professor at OSU and one of the world ’s leading experts on insects , plants and other life forms trapped in amber , a semi-precious stone that begins as tree sap .
advertisement
“ There ’s a gecko society , gecko clubs , just a lot of interest in these animals because of their unusual characteristics , ” Poinar said .
“ So there are a lot of people pretty excited about this . ”
Based on the number of lamellae found on its toe pads , this gecko was probably a very small juvenile of what would have become a comparatively large adult , possibly up to a foot long , the researchers say .
Modern geckos get no more than about 16 inches long , although it ’s possible there were larger species millions of years ago .
The juvenile gecko found in the fossiljuvenile gecko found in the fossil was less than an inch in length when it died – possibly by being eaten or attacked , since only partial remains were found .
The discovery has been announced as a new genus and species of gecko , now extinct , and has been named Cretaceogekko .
It had a striped pattern that probably served as camouflage .
There are more than 1,200 species of geckos in the world today , common in warm or tropical regions , including parts of the southern United States .
They are frequently kept as pets , and often are welcome in the homes of some tropical residents because they help control insects .
Some are very colorful .
They use long tongues to lick , clean and moisturize their eyes .
“ Geckos are territorial , and when I lived in Africa in the early 1980s we used to have them in our house , ” Poinar said .
“ They are pretty friendly and do n’t bother humans .
Certain individuals would move into the house , we ’d give them names , and they would run around the house , catch mosquitoes , help control bugs .
They would crawl across the ceiling and look down at you . ”
The new study provides evidence that geckos were definitely in Asia by 100 million years ago , and had already evolved their bizarre foot structure at that time .
The amber fossil was mined in the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar , and during its life the gecko probably lived in a moist , tropical forest with ample opportunities for climbing .
advertisement
The ability of geckos to walk on vertical walls or even upside down is due to the presence of thousands of “ setae ” on their toes , very tiny , hairlike structures that have tips which attach to surfaces by van der Walls forces .
It ’s a type of incredibly strong , dry adhesion shared by virtually no other group of animals .
It ’s not known exactly how old this group of animals is , and when they evolved their adhesive toe pads .
However , the new study makes it clear that this ability was in place at least 100 million years ago , in nature .
Modern research programs still have not been able to completely duplicate it .
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley reported earlier this year that they have developed a new “ anti- sliding ” adhesive that they said was the closest man-made material yet to mimic the ability of geckos – they think it might help a robot climb up the side of walls .
A research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this year created a waterproof adhesive bandage inspired by geckos , that may some day be used in surgery .
And of course , geckos have become an advertising icon for the insurance company Geico .
This study is just one of many in which Poinar and colleagues have used the unusual characteristics of amber to study ancient life forms and develop information on the ecology of ancient ecosystems .
As a stone that first begins to form as sap oozing from a tree , amber can trap small insects or other life forms and preserve them in near - perfect detail for observation millions of years later .
Als am Sonnabend den 11 .
Oktober mehrere zehntausend Bürger in Berlin gegen die Überwachung auf die Straße gingen , ließ der Staat die Kameras laufen .
Während ein Sicherheitsbeamter ganz offen mit seiner Kamera am Werk war , haben auch mehrere Polizisten die Demonstranten mit versteckter Kamera aufgenommen .
Die filmenden Beamten wurden dabei ihrerseits von einem aufmerksamen Demonstranten gefilmt .
Anders als die Bänder der Ordnungshüter wurden diese Aufnahmen veröffentlicht .
Unter dem Titel " Surveilling anti-surveillance crowd aka is surveillance for terrorists only ? " hat ein gewisser " friendofchange " ein fünf Minuten langes Video bei Youtube veröffentlicht .
Polizist mit Arbeitsgerät .
Nachdem 2007 nach unterschiedlichen Schätzungen bereits zwischen 8.000 und 15.000 Bürger unter dem Banner " Freiheit statt Angst " demonstriert hatten , gingen in diesem Jahr sogar mehrere zehntausend Bürger gegen Überwachungsmaßnahmen wie Speicherung aller Telekommunikationsdaten , Flugreisendenüberwachung und biometrische Bürgererfassung auf die Straße .
Veranstalter war der Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung , er begründete seinen Aufruf damit , dass eine freie und offene Gesellschaft " ohne bedingungslos private Räume und Kommunikation nicht existieren " könne .
Das Video von friendofchange zeigt zahlreiche Szenen , in denen Polizisten Kameras in offenen Jacken oder hinter Schutzhelmen verbergen .
Offensichtlich wollten sie nicht , dass jemand bemerkt , dass sie filmen .
Zwischendurch erscheinen Bilder von Kondensstreifen am Himmel – möglicherweise eine Hommage an die Teilnehmer des G8 - Camps , die ja mit Hilfe von Tornados beobachtet und aufgenommen worden waren .
Gegen Ende erscheint auch eine Textzeile : " Can somebody tell me , what is this all about in the sky ? "
Beispiele für die staatlichen Dreharbeiten finden sich im Youtube - Video bei 0:59 , 1:30 und 1:39 ; die Stellen zeigen Polizisten , deren Kameras aus der Jacke herausschauen .
Und so geht es weiter .
Fazit : Die Demonstration war dringend notwendig .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A purple tomato genetically engineered to contain nutrients more commonly seen in dark berries helped prevent cancer in mice , British researchers said on Sunday .
Tomatoes of different colors are seen in a bowl in Medford , Massachusetts July 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
The finding , published in the journal Nature Biotechnology , bolsters the idea that plants can be genetically modified to make people healthier .
Cancer - prone mice fed the modified fruit lived significantly longer than animals fed a standard diet with and without regular tomatoes , Cathie Martin and colleagues at the government - funded John Innes Center in Britain reported .
“ The effect was much bigger than we had expected , ” said Martin , a plant biologist .
The study focused on anthocyanins , a type of antioxidant found in berries such as blackberries and blackcurrants that have been shown to lower risk of cancer , heart disease and some neurological diseases .
While an easy health boost , many people do not eat enough of these fruits , the researchers said .
Using genes that help color the snapdragon flower , the researchers discovered they could get the tomatoes to make anthocyanins -- turning the tomato purple in the process .
Mice genetically engineered to develop cancer lived an average of 182 days when they were fed the purple tomatoes , compared to 142 days for animals on the standard diet .
“ It is enormously encouraging to believe that by changing diet , or specific components in the diet , you can improve health in animals and possibly humans , ” Martin said in a telephone interview .
The researchers cautioned that trials in humans are a long way off and the next step is to investigate how the antioxidants actually affect the tumors to promote better health .
But the findings do bolster research suggesting that people can significantly improve their health by making simple changes to the daily diet , other researchers said .
“ It ’s exciting to see new techniques that could potentially make healthy foods even better for us , ” said Dr. Lara Bennett , science information officer at Cancer Research UK .
“ But it ’s too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer . ”

Since its release , the steady stream of updates have made Windows Vista noticeably less annoying to use .
The biggest stride forward was the release of the operating system ’s first service pack , back in March of this year .
Neowin.net now claims that the second service pack is on its way , with the first beta being dropped on testers in the coming four weeks .
The final release of Vista ’s second service pack will be delivered before Windows 7 , so we can expect it to arrive somewhere next year .
A beta will appear in the coming four weeks ; invites have been sent out to beta testers , Neowin claims .
SP2 for Server 2008 follows the same time table .
In fact , a placeholder webpage is already available at Microsoft ’s website .
The second service pack will include Windows Desktop Search 4.0 , support for Bluetooth wireless ( including BT 2.1 fixes ) , and additional application compatibility updates .
Server 20008 , “ Microsoft will include backwards compatibility with Terminal Services licensing keys , improved manageability features with DFS / FRS console , and Storage Resource Manager , print server and spooler performance improvements for printers in Windows Vista and Server 2008 and improved error reporting in DFSR to help identify incorrectly configured deployments which lead to failed replication . ”

" A re-elected Conservative government led by Stephen Harper will reintroduce federal copyright legislation that strikes the appropriate balance among the rights of musicians , artists , programmers and other creators and brings Canada 's intellectual property protection in line with that of other industrialized countries , but also protects consumers who want to access copyright works for their personal use , " the platform document says .
" We will also introduce tougher laws on counterfeiting and piracy and give our customs and law enforcement services the resources to enforce them .
This will protect consumers from phoney and sometimes dangerous products that are passed off as reliable brand - name goods . "
The Conservatives ' previous copyright - reform legislation , Bill C - 61 , which died on the order paper when the election was called , was released in June to a wave of criticism .
While a number of organizations that represent copyright holders , such as the Canadian Recording Industry Association and the Entertainment Software Association of Canada , praised the plan , it was roundly criticized as unfair by consumer advocates , artists , privacy watchdogs , education groups and other businesses .
The legislation proposed hefty fines for people caught downloading copyrighted materials but also made it illegal for consumers to work around locks — known as digital rights management — placed on media .
Minister of Industry Jim Prentice said the reforms struck a balance between the needs of copyright holders and consumers , but critics said a number of loopholes , particularly the digital locks provision , skewed the rules heavily against average Canadians .
" There 's a fine line between protecting creators and a police state , " Liberal industry critic Scott Brison told CBCNews.ca at the time .
Prentice was also criticized for not consulting consumer groups in drafting the legislation and was accused of caving to lobbying by the U.S. entertainment industry .
Facebook protest delayed legislation
The Conservatives had planned to introduce the proposed legislation last December but backed off after its purported details were leaked .
A protest group on social - networking website Facebook , started by University of Ottawa internet law professor Michael Geist , drew tens of thousands of members within days of launching , forcing Prentice to retreat .
On his website two weeks ago , Geist challenged election candidates to sign on to a pledge dedicated to consulting Canadians in drafting new legislation and in supporting balanced copyright reform .
As of Tuesday , the entire Green Party , one - third of the NDP and about 15 Liberal candidates had signed on .
Geist reiterated on his blog on Tuesday that the Conservatives ' approach to copyright reform is not balanced , a view shared by the more than 92,000 members of his Facebook group .
" Bill C - 61 did not strike the appropriate balance and tens of thousands of Canadians told Harper just that over the summer , " he wrote .
The Conservatives also touched on a few other technology , telecommunications and science issues in their platform .
The party plans to prevent cellphone companies from charging for unsolicited text messages , and it intends to introduce anti-spam legislation .
The platform also pledges to strengthen the newly created Commissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services and the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
" We will amend the Telecommunications Act to strengthen the power of the Commissioner of Complaints for Telecommunications Services , including the creation of a code of conduct for wireless services .
We will also create a compliance and deterrent power that allows the … [ CRTC ] to block [ unsolicited text message ] and similar unfair charges in the future . "
The platform document also said a Conservative government would make further investments to internationally recognized science and technology projects in Canada .
As I pointed out exactly one month ago today , John McCain has ties to the gambling industry that seem strange , at best .
His contributors are the upper management of casinos , indicating an expectation of gambling expansion with his support .
A watchdog group , called ‘ Campaign Money Watch ’ has released a new ad exploring the McCain / gambling industry connection .
Watch :
The following is a list I compiled last month of just Winn casino ( and closely affiliated entities ) employees that donated to John McCain and the RNC from April to July of this year .
That ’s right , this amount of money from only one casino operation in just three months :
Contributor Date Amount Recipient Early , Peter L 5/7/2008 $ 28,500 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Schorr , Marc 5/7/2008 $ 28,500 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Wynn , Elaine 5/7/2008 $ 28,500 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Maddox , Matt 5/7/2008 $ 7,700 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Peterson , Scott E 5/7/2008 $ 7,700 Republican National Cmte ( R ) BUTLER , DE RUYTER O 5/2/2008 $ 3,000 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Sinatra , Kimmarie 5/29/2008 $ 2,900 Republican National Cmte ( R ) Wooden , Maurice L 5/7/2008 $ 2,700 Republican National Cmte ( R ) EARLY , PETER L MR 4/28/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) KRAMER , RONALD J MR 7/31/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) MADDOX , MATT MR 5/9/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) NADY , LAURIE B MRS 4/28/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) OSELAND , ROBERT L MR II 5/9/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) PETERSON , SCOTT E MR 5/9/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) SCHORR , MARC D MR 5/2/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) SINATRA , KIMMARIE MRS 5/31/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) SINATRA , KIMMARIE MRS 5/31/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) Thomas , Roger 5/7/2008 $ 2,300 Republican National Cmte ( R ) THOMAS , ROGER MR 5/9/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) WOODEN , MAURICE L MR 5/9/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) WYNN , ELAINE MRS 4/30/2008 $ 2,300 McCain , John ( R ) ALLISON , WESLEY MR 5/9/2008 $ 1,000 McCain , John ( R ) SCHALL , JASON M MR 5/9/2008 $ 1,000 McCain , John ( R ) TOUREK , KEVIN JAMES MR 5/9/2008 $ 1,000 McCain , John ( R ) Oseland , Robert L II 5/7/2008 $ 200 Republican National Cmte ( R ) $ 142,600
Information gathered from FEC reports through opensecrets.org
Something ’s wrong with this picture .
Why so much money , in such a short time from just one of the casino operations ?
Surely they ’re getting something if McCain wins , and I doubt it ’s any sort of oversight .
You see , John McCain is a gambling man .
He freely admits it .
He plays craps , he gambles massive amounts of money .
He ’s been spotting gambling in high rollers rooms , not just run of the mill ones .
This is a guy who does n’t understand probability , someone who thinks that , for some reason , they are above certain mathematical truths .

Roll Call Staff
September 23 , 2008
Everything that you are about to read might be wrong .
Roll Call ’s annual attempt to rank the riches of Members of Congress is hampered by one fundamental flaw :
It is based on the lawmakers ’ financial disclosure forms , which are extraordinarily unreliable sources of information .
The disclosure rules allow Members to report assets in broad categories , so there is no way to tell the difference between a $ 20 million investment and a $ 5 million investment .
The top category on the Members ’ forms is “ over $ 50 million , ” so it is impossible to accurately account for anything worth more than that — like a professional sports team , for example .
There is also a gaping loophole for assets owned by the Members ’ spouse or dependent children ; anything worth more than $ 1 million in value can be reported as “ over $ 1 million . ”
There is no way to tell whether that is $ 1.2 million or $ 1.2 billion .
The rules also do n’t require reporting things of value that are not used to produce income — most notably any primary residence or other home that is not used for rentals .
That loophole removes from most Members ’ portfolios hundreds of thousands of dollars and in come cases millions of dollars worth of assets .
Airplanes , fancy cars , antiques or other valuable items are not reported .
In filing a detailed disclosure form on behalf of Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) , his accountants added this editorial note , which sums up the problem :
The form is meant to comply with Senate disclosure rules but “ is not intended to be a complete presentation of Senator Corker ’s financial position . ”
Beyond all of these flaws , there remains the fact that many , many financial disclosure forms filed by Members of Congress are simply inaccurate .
A check mark placed in the wrong box can inflate or deflate a Member ’s apparent net worth by millions of dollars , and misunderstandings of the rules have led Members to understate some assets , overstate others and claim additional assets they no longer own .
Where the errors are obvious or have created noticeable discrepancies from prior - year filings , Roll Call has attempted to contact the offices to get a proper understanding of the actual value of the asset or assets in question .
What remains below is a ranking of the 50 wealthiest Members of Congress based on the minimum net worth reported on their financial disclosure forms .
To achieve these numbers , Roll Call totaled the assets listed on financial disclosure forms filed in 2008 ( covering calendar year 2007 ) using the lowest number in the ranges in which Members are required to report .
An asset from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million is counted as being worth $ 500,000 , unless the Member has provided a brokerage statement or other documentation that offers more specific detail .
Liabilities , which are also reported in ranges , are calculated based on the minimum value , and are subtracted from total minimum assets to establish total net worth .
Assets that are not included on the forms but have values that have been established by Roll Call or other publications are not included for the purposes of assembling this ranking , because the Members are not required to report these numbers .
This ranking is based only on what is reported on the annual disclosure forms .
1. Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . )
$ 230.98 million
The Massachusetts Senator claims the mantel of richest Member in the 110th Congress .
Kerry ’s actual holdings , however — including those of wife Teresa Heinz Kerry , widow to ketchup heir Sen. John Heinz ( R - Pa. ) — are likely much greater .
In an April 2008 article , Forbes.com estimated Heinz Kerry ’s net worth at $ 1 billion .
Kerry ’s disclosure forms list the value of more than 180 assets — including Heinz family trusts and investment funds — only as “ over $ 1 million , ” rather than the more specific ranges including $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
Senators are allowed to list assets in the “ over $ 1 million ” category only if the items are held independently by a spouse or dependent child .
2. Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif . )
$ 225.96 million
The wealthy Californian , who remains heavily invested in Harman International Industries , has seen her wealth increase nearly $ 10 million since filing her 2006 report .
Harman ’s report lists three accounts , including one held solely by her husband , totaling a combined minimum of $ 125 million in stock and options in the company .
Harman ’s spouse founded the company , which manufactures electronics under the brand names AKG Acoustics , Harman Kardon , Infinity and JBL , among others .
3. Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . )
$ 160.62 million
The Golden State lawmaker added $ 2 million to his bottom line in 2007 , increasing his fortune by a little more than 1 percent .
Issa , founder of the Vista , Calif . - based Directed Electronics , which manufactures car alarms , claims an investment worth at least $ 50 million in DEI and $ 25 million to $ 50 million in Greene Properties Inc .
Both corporations own and operate office and industrial properties in California .
4. Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . )
$ 80.40 million
A descendant of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller , the West Virginian ’s vast assets remained stable in 2007 , as his net worth increased by a little more than 1 percent .
Rockefeller ’s fortunes are stored primarily in three blind trusts with JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Wachovia Corp. and United National Bank , valued at more than $ 50 million , $ 25 million to $ 50 million , and $ 5 million to $ 25 million , respectively .
Another family trust is listed at simply “ over $ 1 million . ”
The Senator lists at least $ 5.5 million in debt on two loans , down from $ 6.5 million in 2006 , when he listed an additional $ 1 million loan from United National Bank in Charleston , W.Va .
5. Rep. Robin Hayes ( R - N.C. )
$ 78.96 million
The Tar Heel State lawmaker ’s wealth more than doubled since 2006 , when he identified about $ 36 million in assets .
According to Hayes ’ office , the increase , including more than $ 36 million in new trust funds , is the result of an inheritance .
Hayes ’ mother passed away in 2007 .
Among the holdings in Hayes ’ numerous trust funds are a mix of stocks and bonds , as well as properties including land in Lake County , Minn. , and Sheldon , S.C. , valued at least $ 5 million and $ 1 million , respectively .
The funds include at least $ 1 million in stock in corporations such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Merck , Pfizer , General Electric and Altria , the parent company of Philip Morris USA .
The North Carolinian also lists a commercial loan of at least $ 1 million to finance his private airplane .
6. Rep. Vern Buchanan ( R - Fla . )
$ 65.49 million
Buchanan , the owner of several car dealerships , watched his wealth dip slightly in the past year , dropping $ 1.74 million , or more than 2 percent below his 2006 total .
While the Florida lawmaker ’s empire — comprising several automobile dealerships , an aircraft charter business , real estate holdings and investment accounts — amounts to $ 102.34 million , it carries with it nearly $ 37 million in debt .
7. Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. )
$ 55.33 million
Lautenberg , who made millions from the payroll processing company he created five decades ago , reported that his total minimum assets jumped about 24 percent , from $ 45 million in 2006 , but that number is still not very revealing .
Lautenberg ’s two biggest assets are two blind trusts that he set up for himself , each worth $ 5 million to $ 25 million .
Together they count for $ 10 million of his assets for this list , though they could be worth five times that amount .
8. Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . )
$ 52.34 million
Together with her husband , financier Richard Blum , Feinstein claims a diversified portfolio that grew by $ 1.8 million , or an increase of just under 4 percent , since 2006 .
The Californian lists assets with her husband that include ownership of all or part of numerous limited partnerships .
Among those , the Blum Family Partners , owned entirely by Blum , claims “ over $ 1 million ” in stock in RAE Systems , a manufacturer of chemical and radiation detection equipment .
The fund also includes “ over $ 1 million ” in a real estate investment trust .
In addition , Feinstein lists a $ 5 million to $ 25 million investment in Carlton Hotel Properties in San Francisco and owns condos in both Tahoe City , Calif. , and on Kauai in Hawaii , both valued at $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
Feinstein also lists at least $ 2 million in debt to Bank of America for two loans made to Blum Capital Partners .
9. Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . )
$ 47.62 million
Much of Kennedy ’s wealth stems from family trusts , and the Massachusetts Senator reported almost no change in 2007 , with an increase of less than 1 percent .
Kennedy lists one family trust valued from $ 25 million to $ 50 million , as well as four trusts worth at least $ 5 million each and a blind trust totaling at least $ 1 million .
The Bay State lawmaker also owns a rental property in Hyannisport , Mass. , valued at at least $ 1 million and lists a plot of undeveloped land in Lafayette , La. , owned by his wife , worth from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million .
Kennedy lists $ 1 million in mortgage debt from Northern Trust Co. for his Hyannisport property .
10 . Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore . )
$ 28.65 million
If you take financial disclosure forms seriously ( never a good idea ) , you might be led to believe that Smith ’s net worth tripled last year .
His 2006 financial disclosure form disclosed net assets of about $ 8.5 million .
But Smith ’s worth is largely derived from Smith Food Sales , a purveyor of frozen vegetables .
In 2006 he listed that asset as being worth $ 5 million to $ 25 million .
In 2007 , the value has jumped to the next category , $ 25 million to $ 50 million , so even if the value of the asset rose from just under to just more than $ 25 million .
11 . Rep. Michael McCaul ( R - Texas )
$ 23.93 million
The Lone Star State lawmaker saw his wealth increase by more than $ 6 million in 2007 , largely thanks to his wife ’s investment in a San Antonio real estate partnership .
Together with his wife and family , McCaul also invests at least $ 12.1 million in Clear Channel Communications , the company founded by his father - in - law , Lowry Mays .
The McCauls also list nearly $ 1 million invested in Live Nation , a Clear Channel spinoff .
12 . Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R - N.J . )
$ 22.41 million
He lists an investment of at least $ 1 million in Procter & Gamble Co. , and one family trust lists an additional $ 5 million to $ 25 million invested in the same company .
Frelinghuysen ’s holdings in Johnson & Johnson decreased in minimal value by half in 2007 , dropping to $ 500,000 from $ 1 million last year .
13 . Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . )
$ 19.64 million
McCain ’s true value is impossible to estimate because most of the major assets are listed in the name of his wife or children , thereby requiring far less detailed disclosure .
Other news outlets have suggested that Cindy McCain ’s net worth may exceed $ 100 million , but there is no documentation to prove that figure .
McCain ’s disclosure form lists 12 items with values of “ over $ 1 million ” that are owned by his wife and children .
In 2007 , the family liquidated a trust set up by Cindy McCain ’s late mother that had a reported value in 2006 of more than $ 2.5 million .
The proceeds were then distributed to three other trusts , which show a minimum value of $ 1.4 million .
Cindy McCain also liquidated a blind trust in 2007 , selling millions of dollars worth of stock , and the reported value of the stock she owns through Hensley & Co. — her family ’s beer distributorship — dropped more than $ 4 million in value last year .
The only assets McCain claims as his own are a checking account with a balance of $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 , a money market fund worth less than $ 15,000 and several book deals .
14 . Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. )
$ 19.42 million
McCaskill watched her net worth grow in 2007 , increasing more than 24 percent over her estimated $ 15.66 million total in 2006 .
Among McCaskill ’s major assets : approximately 270 limited partnerships in affordable housing real estate and a handful of “ enterprise trust investment funds ” held by her husband that showed a combined increase of approximately $ 2.7 million in value from last year .
15 . Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . )
$ 19.19 million
In 2006 , Corker sold off several commercial properties , thereby eliminating more than $ 20 million in mortgages that had counted as liabilities against his assets .
With those liabilities out of the way , Corker ’s minimum net worth jumps from about $ 1.5 million on his 2006 report to more than $ 19 million on his 2007 report .
In 2007 , according to an explanatory note attached to his disclosure form , Corker also divested himself of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of publicly traded stock in order to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interest .
16 . Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - N.Y . )
$ 19.01 million
The New York lawmaker saw her estimated net worth increase more than 44 percent over the past year , up from $ 13.18 million .
The jump results from growth in her portion of a real estate development company , which moved up from the $ 1 million minimum category to the $ 5 million minimum category , effectively adding $ 4 million to Maloney ’s bottom line .
The Democrat also owns a “ rental property and residence ” in New York valued at $ 5 million to $ 25 million , a rental property in New Canaan , Conn. , ( $ 1 million to $ 5 million ) and a Washington , D.C. , house ( $ 1 million to $ 5 million ) .
17 . Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . )
$ 18.71 million
The Californian ’s net worth rose nearly 16 percent in 2007 , adding $ 2.5 million to her personal wealth .
Among her assets , Pelosi lists a Norden , Calif. , town house valued at $ 1 million to $ 5 million and a real estate investment in Napa , Calif. , worth at least $ 500,000 .
In addition , her husband owns a commercial property in San Francisco valued at $ 5 million to $ 25 million .
In 2006 , the property was listed as worth $ 1 million to $ 5 million , so that property alone added $ 4 million to Pelosi ’s net worth last year .
The couple also owns a vineyard in St. Helena , Calif. , valued at $ 5 million to $ 25 million .
The Speaker ’s husband also increased tenfold his holdings in Apple Computer Inc. stock to at least $ 5 million , up from a minimum of $ 500,000 in 2006 .
Pelosi and her husband also owe mortgage debt on several of their properties , including the vineyard , totaling at least $ 8.75 million .
Other debts listed by Pelosi include lines of credit totaling at least $ 3.5 million .
18 . Rep. Nita Lowey ( D - N.Y . )
$ 17.77 million
The largest asset on Lowey ’s disclosure form is an account in her husband ’s name with the investment firm Ingalls & Snyder listed with a value of $ 5 million to $ 25 million .
In 2006 , Lowey listed the same asset with a value of $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
19 . Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - N.C. )
$ 16.45 million
The North Carolinian and her husband , former Sen. Bob Dole ( R - Kan. ) , saw a modest rise in their wealth , increasing a little more than 2 percent since 2006 .
The Doles ’ assets include the only liability listed by the couple multiple checking and money market accounts worth at least $ 1.12 million , including one account held by Bob Dole valued at “ over $ 1 million . ”
The former Senator also claims a stake in five investment funds , worth a combined minimum of nearly $ 5 million .
He also lists multiple promissory notes from the Robert J. Dole Irrevocable Trust , including two worth “ over $ 1 million . ”
Elizabeth Dole also lists about 119 acres of land in Johnson City , Kan. , valued at $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
20 . Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine )
$ 15.05 million
21 . Rep. Tom Petri ( R - Wis . )
$ 14.63 million
22 . Rep. Gary Miller ( R - Calif . )
$ 14.49 million
23 . Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . )
$ 12.43 million
The Tennessee Senator ’s largest asset is his stock in Processed Foods Corp. , a Knoxville - based company where Alexander served on the board prior to his election to the Senate in 2002 .
He holds $ 5 million to $ 25 million worth of the company ’s stock , and his wife holds “ over $ 1 million ” as well .
…..
24 . Rep. John Campbell ( R - Calif . )
$ 11.39 million
25 . Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner ( R - Wis . )
$ 11.34 million
Sensenbrenner , who submits one of the lengthiest financial disclosures each year by providing his regular report along with a detailed accounting of his net worth , saw his tally drop by about 3 percent from the previous year .
Much of the Wisconsin lawmaker ’s losses come from a downtick in his $ 6.7 million of investments in stocks and bonds , comprising $ 1.3 million in Merck & Co. Inc. and significant investments in Exxon Mobil Corp. , General Electric Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Abbot Laboratories Inc. ……
26 . Rep. Denny Rehberg ( R - Mont . )
$ 11.20 million
27 . Sen . Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa )
$ 10.50 million
28 . Rep. Kenny Marchant ( R - Texas )
$ 10.49 million
29 . Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y . )
$ 10.39 million
In 2006 , in preparation for her White House bid , Clinton closed a blind trust worth $ 5 million to $ 25 million , reported its stock holdings and then sold them off because of different disclosure requirements for presidential candidates .
In 2007 , her primary assets were two Citibank deposit accounts , each worth $ 5 million to $ 25 million , one of which is new .
While the disclosure form she prepared for the presidential race indicated a minimum net worth of about $ 17 million and her current disclosure only tallies about $ 10 million , the wide ranges reported for the family ’s cash accounts could easily accommodate millions more in assets than she gets credit for in this tally .
Beyond the two giant bank accounts , the family ’s biggest asset appears to be Bill Clinton , who earned more than $ 10 million giving speeches in 2007 .
30 . Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . )
$ 8.64 million
The Alabaman ’s fortunes diminished nearly 6.5 percent in 2007 , a drop of about $ 600,000 .
Shelby owns 48 shares in Tuscaloosa Title , a title abstract and insurance company , with a value of $ 1 million to $ 5 million , and his wife owns two shares worth $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 .
The couple transferred a 49 percent stake in a Tuscaloosa , Ala. , apartment building , listed at $ 500,000 to $ 1 million , to the Shelby Family Trust in late 2007 .
Shelby ’s assets also include a D.C. town house and a Tuscaloosa home , both valued in the “ over $ 1 million ” category , as well as a Tuscaloosa office building listed at $ 500,000 to $ 1 million .
The Senator lists $ 1 million in mortgage debt on the apartment building , as well as a personal note issued by Regions Bank for $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 .
31 . Rep. Steve Pearce ( R - N.M . )
$ 8.40 million
32 . Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D - Texas )
$ 8.38 million
Since Members of Congress are required to report only properties that are producing income , it is not uncommon to see assets hop on or off Members ’ disclosure forms from year to year when they start or stop renting them .
Doggett appears to be a case in point :
An Austin , Texas , property that was not reported in 2006 appears on his 2007 form with a value of $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 , producing $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 in income .
There is no reported transaction , which suggests that Doggett already owned it but began renting the “ garage apt ” last year .
His other holdings , which showed a solid increase over the prior year , include investments of at least $ 500,000 in several Vanguard investment funds , as well as Whole Foods Market Inc .
33 . Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R - Ga . )
$ 8.20 million
34 . Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah )
$ 7.93 million
35 . Rep. Heath Shuler ( D - N.C. )
$ 7.81 million
36 . Rep. John Spratt ( D - S.C. )
$ 7.50 million
37 . Rep. Bill Foster ( D - Ill . )
$ 7.37 million
38 . Rep. Steve Kagen ( D - Wis . )
$ 7.31 million
39 . Rep. Fred Upton ( R - Mich . )
$ 7.21 million
40 . Rep. David Dreier ( R - Calif . )
$ 7.03 million
41 . Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb . )
$ 7.02 million
42 . Rep. Tom Price ( R - Ga . )
$ 6.99 million
43 . Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. )
$ 6.20 million
44 . Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . )
$ 5.88 million
45 . Sen. John Warner ( R - Va . )

47 . Rep. John Linder ( R - Ga . )
$ 5.67 million
48 . Rep. Randy Neugebauer ( R - Texas )
$ 5.50 million
49 . Sen . Herb Kohl ( D - Wis . )
$ 5.49 million
50 . Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill . )
$ 5.02 million

Saudi Arabia wants lower petroleum prices .
As a country with enormous reserves , Riyadh would like to preserve their value .
In contrast , countries like Algeria with relatively shallow reserves want to get top dollar for their petroleum while it lasts .
Businessweek provides the telling quote :
As banks and markets crash , what can science do to reshape economics and make it fit for a finite world ?
“ Economists see no limits to growth – ever ” ( Graph : Springer - Verlag , Berlin , Heidelberg , New York )
THE graphs climbing across these pages ( see graph in detail , or explore the data ) are a stark reminder of the crisis facing our planet .
Consumption of resources is rising rapidly , biodiversity is plummeting and just about every measure shows humans affecting Earth on a vast scale .
Most of us accept the need for a more sustainable way to live , by reducing carbon emissions , developing renewable technology and increasing energy efficiency .
But are these efforts to save the planet doomed ?
A growing band of experts are looking at …
Why many game critics love to quarrel over good games -- such as whether or not Grand Theft Auto IV deserves a 9.9 or 10 -- all factions can unite over a dreadful game .
Seriously , if you see two gamers arguing over whether Mega Man 2 or Mega Man 3 was the best in the series , just lob Pac - Man for the Atari 2600 between them .
They 'll be slapping each other on the back in no time because there is just no contest there .
That game was a botch job .

Shaq
Fu is another of those rare gems , a game so universally reviled that everybody can sit down and agree over its awfulness .
Now , I 'm not going to pull a total contrarian here and somehow argue that Shaq Fu was an underappreciated game with strands of genius coursing through its digital DNA .
But upon revisiting the game recently , I have to concur that Shaq
Fu is not nearly as bad as everybody makes it out to be .
In fact , there are a few avenues of defense , despite the game 's packaging doing everything it can to foster absolute loathing .
After all , Shaq Fu dropped in 1994 , which was not yet the zenith of the Shaquille O'Neil phenomenon , which eventually gave us the perfect storm of Shaq Diesel rap ( which cannot be defended ) and roles in bombs like Steel and Kazaam .
The basketball star 's ego had reached such critical mass that it developed its own gravitational pull .
And when an ego gets that large , the people that fed the ego to begin with love to turn on it .
Shaq
Fu is , as you likely know , a fighting game -- which were very much en vogue thanks to Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat .
And once you step around the bizarre presence of Shaq , and it's even sillier story ( set up with a borderline offense view of downtown Tokyo that implies the city is nothing but pagodas ) , the fighting action in Shaq
Fu really is n't that bad .
In fact , its simplicity is actually kind of charming .
Instead of being forced to memorize a zillion moves , you simply need to understand the basic timing of kicks and punches , plus a handful of specials , like Shaq 's projectile attack , the Shaq - Urikin .
If you 're entirely put off by something like Soulcalibur IV and Virtua Fighter 5 , which seem to punish you for not having 80 hours to train on the game , Shaq Fu may be more your speed .
Not that I cannot imagine at least a dozen other fighters I 'd push in your direction first … but you get the idea .
Two things about Shaq Fu stand out .
One , the world map screen , where you get to run around to the different arenas and choose your fight , is a good idea .
Instead of random battles on the way to the top , you get to select each stage in the order desired .
Maybe you save your most troublesome battles for the end while first zeroing in on the opponents you have a better idea on how to beat .
But the second solid feature in Shaq Fu is the animation .
And that can be wholly credited to the game developer : Delphine If Delphine sounds familiar to you , then perhaps you 've played Out of this World and Flashback .
Both are landmark titles and in no small part due to their incredible art and animation .
Shaq
Fu uses the rotoscoping technique that made the world in Out of This World come alive so well , and the result is pretty impressive .
Even if the moves themselves are n't exactly crazy -- really , it 's tough to compete with Street Fighter on this level -- they are extremely smooth , especially when linked together .
It 's worth appreciating a developer that likely understand they are n't working on a great game , but still puts as much artistry into it as possible .
Of course , a lot of the good will generated by the game 's positives is negated by an awful cast of characters that includes a mummy , a weird lizard - like dude , and a cheeseball jetpack guy .
The aforementioned goofy story , Shaq enters an alternate dimension through a door in the back of a shop by a very stereotypical wizened Asian man , is an anvil .
But with 14 years between now and the release of Shaq Fu , a lot of that residual irritation over the forced fame of Shaq beyond the basketball court , has dissipated .
You can now play the game without that initial kneejerk reaction , although the large - scale lampooning of the game will likely be tough to get around and give the game a fair shake .
The point is , just because a game seems collectively detested , does n't mean it 's without merit .
Sometimes the rejection and ridicule of a game just feeds on itself , earning the title a reputation it does n't entirely deserve .
Shaq
Fu is one of those games .

Powell on Obama : ' He is a transformational figure ' Reuters
Colin Powell , George Bush 's former secretary of state , yesterday dealt his own party a major blow when he threw his weight behind Barack Obama 's bid to become the next president of the United States .
The retired four - star general spurned his good friend , the Republican John McCain , to heap praise on the " transformational figure " of Obama , the Democratic party candidate , saying America needed a " generational change " .
In a swipe at both Bush and McCain , he added : " I firmly believe that at this point in America 's history , we need a president who will not just continue , even with a new face and with the changes and with some maverick aspects , who will not just continue basically the policies that we have been following in recent years . "
Coming 15 days before the US presidential election , Powell 's endorsement was the second important boost to Obama yesterday .
The other was the news that his campaign had raised a record $ 150 m ( £ 86 m ) in September , dwarfing his previous monthly high of $ 65 m in August , and bringing the total raised to $ 605 m .
At the weekend , Obama also attracted his biggest US audience of the campaign , when 100,000 people attended a rally in St Louis , Missouri .
On Saturday evening , 75,000 people attended an Obama rally in Kansas City .
The huge turnouts came as the latest national polls showed the presidential race essentially static , with Obama maintaining a lead of 4 % - 7 % .
Speaking on the TV programme Meet the Press , Powell , 71 , offered an impassioned endorsement of Obama , and a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign .
" It was not easy for me to disappoint Senator McCain in the way that I have done this morning , " Powell said .
" We need a transformational figure , a president who is a generational change , That is why I 'm supporting Barack Obama .
" Because of his ability to inspire , because of the inclusive nature of his campaign , because he is reaching out all across America , because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities - and you have to take that into account - he has both style and substance , he has met the standard of being a successful president , being an exceptional president . "
He said race was not a factor in his decision , but added : " It will be an historic event for an African - American to become president , and , if that happens , all Americans should be proud . "
Powell , who said he had made up his mind over the last two months , was damning about McCain 's response to the economic crisis , about what he described as the Republican party 's drift further to the right during the campaign , and the attack politics of recent weeks .
He also had harsh words for McCain 's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as running mate .
" He [ McCain ] was a little unsure about how to deal with the economic problems , " Powell said .
" That concerned me .
I was also concerned at the selection of Governor Palin ... I do n't believe she 's ready to be vice - president of the United States .
That raises some questions ... about the judgment Senator McCain made . "
He also criticised the McCain campaign for focusing on Obama 's alleged ties to the 1960s radical William Ayers .
" Why do we keep talking about him and why do we have these robocalls going on ? " he asked .
" This goes too far ... it 's not what the American people are looking for .
The party has moved even further to the right ...
The approach of the Republican party and Mr McCain has become narrower and narrower .
Obama has been more inclusive , " Powell said .
Obama said he was " beyond honoured and deeply humbled " by Powell 's support .
At a rally in Fayetteville , North Carolina , he said : " [ Powell ] knows , as we do , that this is a moment where we need to come together as one nation - young and old , rich and poor , black , white , Hispanic , Asian , Native American , Republican and Democrat . "
Addressing a crowd of 10,000 , Obama added : " He reminded us that at this defining moment we do n't have the luxury of relying on the same political games , the same political tactics that have been used in so many elections to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another . "
McCain said he was not surprised by the endorsement .
He was pleased he had the backing of four other former secretaries of state and many military leaders .
Speaking on Fox television , he said : " We 're very happy with the way the campaign is going .
I 've been on enough campaigns , my friend , to sense enthusiasm and momentum , and we 've got it . "
Despite Obama 's lead in both poll ratings and fundraising , McCain said he could sense " things are heading our way . "
" I love being the underdog .
You know every time that I 've gotten ahead , somehow I 've messed it up , " McCain said .
Powell 's endorsement should aid Obama in foreign policy and national security , areas in which he is thought to be weaker .
Powell served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan , was appointed chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by the first President George Bush , and was secretary of state during the current president 's first term .
While his endorsement carries great weight with Republicans , his standing among liberals was knocked following his speech to the UN before the invasion of Iraq .
His enthusiastic support for Obama's " steadiness " and " intellectual vigour " , however , will reassure many Democrats .
The money raised in September enables Obama to push his campaign into Republican areas , forcing the McCain campaign to spend money to shore up support in what should be safe states .
The Obama campaign said the average donation was less than $ 100 .
September brought 632,000 new donors , bringing the total number during the campaign to 3.1 million .
The Democratic national committee also raised $ 49.9 m in September .
McCain chose to accept public funding of his campaign , which limits the amount he can spend in September and October to $ 84 m .
The Republican National Committee raised $ 66 m in September .
Much of Obama 's financial advantage can be seen on the country 's TV screens , where Democrat campaign commercials outplay McCain by three or four to one .
The Obama campaign has even purchased a half hour prime - time slot on the major networks a week before the election day .

October 1 , 2008
I do n’t have to remind you of the importance of this Thursday ’s debate from a political perspective .
But as you prepare , I invite you to spare a few minutes to look at the opportunity from a moral and religious perspective .
You may wish to examine your conscience regarding how you have acted on key foreign policy issues and reflect on John 8:32 : “ And you shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free . ”
The holy days of religious traditions serve a very useful purpose , if we but take the time to pause and ponder .
I write you on Rosh Hashanah , the first of ten days focusing on repentance .
In Judaism ’s oral tradition Rosh Hashanah is the day when people are held to account .
The wicked are “ blotted out of the book of the living , ” while the righteous are inscribed in the book of life .
Those in the middle are given ten days to repent , until the holiday of Yom Kippur — the solemn Day of Atonement .
If that has a familiar ring to it , Joe , we heard it in as many words at Mass last Sunday in the first reading , from Ezekiel 18 : “ If one turns from wickedness and does what is right and just , that one will live . ”
Same Tradition
At Rosh Hashanah the ram ’s horn trumpet blows to waken us from our slumber and alert us to the coming judgment .
Rabbi Michael Lerner has been a ram ’s horn for me .
On Sept. 28 , he sent a note addressing forgiveness and repentance .
He encourages us to find a private place to say aloud how we ’ve hurt others , and then to go to them and ask forgiveness .
“ Do not mitigate or ‘ explain ’ — just acknowledge and sincerely ask for forgiveness , ” says Rabbi Lerner .
He suggests we ask for “ guidance and strength to rectify those hurts — and to develop the sensitivity to not continue acting in a hurtful way . ”
Again , a familiar ring .
Think , Joe , about the instruction we both received as Irish “ cradle Catholics . ”
Surely you will remember the emphasis on examining one ’s conscience , confessing , and pledging to “ sin no more . ”
The phrase comes back , clear as a bell ; we were to “ confess our sins , do penance , and amend our life , Amen . ” Remember ?
And remember how clean we felt at the end of that therapeutic process ?
I was reminded of that by Monday ’s gospel reading from John 1 , in which Jesus says of Nathaniel : “ Here is a true child of Israel ; there is no duplicity in him . ”
Just think of how Nathaniel must have felt .
Joe , you can feel that clean ; but one cannot short - cut the process .
You must first come clean on your role in greasing the skids for President George W. Bush ’s war of aggression on Iraq .
I use “ war of aggression ” advisedly , for that is the term used by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson to denote “ the supreme international crime , differing from other war crimes only in that it contains the accumulated evil of the whole . ”
There is no getting around that — despite the reluctance of church , state , and the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) to acknowledge it .
I imagine that you , as a lawyer , have moments of acute shame over our country ’s flouting of international law and the U.N. Charter , duly ratified by the Senate and thus the law of the land .
And there is no getting away from the important role you played in roping Congress into facilitating that war .
Were the war not to have killed , injured , displaced hundreds of thousands , your lame circumlocutions regarding your own culpability would be laughable — on a par with , say , some of the recent comments of your rival for vice president .
But they are in no way funny .
Fulsome Prose
For my own penance , I made myself read again through your marathon , “ in - depth ” interview with the late Tim Russert on Apr. 29 , 2007 .
Your comments are notable for two things : ( 1 ) periodic sentences that can be diagrammed only by a German philologist with the patience of Job in waiting for verbs and an empty quiver for dangling participles ; and ( 2 ) lies .
It is not hard to spot the lies half - hidden in the underbrush of euphemism and circumlocution .
I do not refer to relatively harmless ones like your firm denial of any interest in running for vice president .
I ’m talking about the real whoppers — the ones we used to call mortal sins .
Despite the goings - on in Washington in recent years , Joe , I do n’t believe anyone has actually passed legislation repealing the commandment against false witness .
It ’s time you come clean .
Confess
What ?
– For some reason , you were calling for an invasion of Iraq and making unsupported claims about its “ weapons of mass destruction ” even before President George W. Bush came into office .
Later , on Aug. 4 , 2002 , after it had become clear to many of us that Bush was intent on attacking Iraq , you declared that the U.S. was probably going to war .
That was three weeks before Vice President Dick Cheney voiced his spurious “ intelligence ” and set the terms of reference for the war .
And it was a month before the administration launched its marketing campaign for the new “ product . ”
– You became the administration ’s most important congressional backer of Bush ’s preemptive - with - nothing - to - preempt war advocated by neoconservatives and various oil - thirsty functionaries .
– Former U.N. weapons inspector and ex-U.S. Marine Major Scott Ritter was correct in describing the hearings you chaired during the summer and fall of 2002 , from which you were careful to exclude Ritter and other expert witnesses , as a “ sham …to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq . ”
What the country needed was an appropriately skeptical Sen. William Fulbright who listened to dissenters after he got burned on Vietnam .
Instead , you took unusual pains to ensure that those dissenting on Iraq would not get a fair hearing .
– Ritter : “ While we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition of Iraq ’s proscribed weaponry , we did ascertain a 90 - 95 percent level of verified disarmament …
It is clear that Sen. Biden and his colleagues have no interest in such facts . ”
Indeed , just before the Senate voted to give Bush authorization to attack Iraq , you plagiarized Cheney in assuring your Senate colleagues that Iraq “ possesses chemical and biological weapons and is seeking nuclear weapons . ”
– And why , tell us , Joe , why did you join Sen .
John McCain and others in voting against the amendment offered by Sen.
Carl Levin that would have forced the president to obtain U.N. Security Council approval before launching war on Iraq ?
‘ Explaining ’ the Unexplainable
– Then , in 2007 , when your catastrophic misjudgments were obvious and hundreds of thousands were dead and maimed , you borrowed administration rhetoric to “ explain ” to Russert how “ everyone in the world thought Saddam had them [ WMD ] . ”
That was rank hyperbole .
When you added , “ The weapons inspectors said he had them , ” that was a lie .
– Please , no more torturous explanations of the kind you gave Russert ; I mean like this one : “ It [ the resolution ] allowed the president to go to war .
It did not authorize him to go to it . ”
Come on , Joe .
The resolution says : “ The president is authorized to use the armed forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate . ”
Sen. Robert Byrd who , unlike you and other Senate Democrats , had no presidential ambitions , rightly observed at the time that those who “ voted for a use - of - force resolution handed a ‘ blank check ’ to the president . ”
– When the war / occupation brought bloody chaos , you expressed regret only that the Bush people were n’t doing it right .
For example , in 2004 you told Charlie Rose and in 2007 Russert : “ If I ’d known that they were going to be so incompetent in using it , I would have never , ever given them the authority . ”
So you approve of preemptive war as long as no one botches the job ?
– More recently , Joe , you have said of your vote to authorize the war : “ It was a mistake .
I regret my vote . ”
Pardon the comparison , but you sound like the disgraced Colin Powell , who has expressed regret only for the “ blot ” on his record .
But wait , Joe : “ Imagine All the People . ”
Im - Palin Old Joe
If you do not find my suggestion for confession and repentance morally compelling , Joe , then think of it this way .
Your debate partner on Thursday evening will be loaded for bear .
I assume you wish to avoid being field dressed .
Ai n’t no way out of your dilemma but by making a clean breast of it , Joe .
She is going to wave her finger at you and quote your fulsome remarks at length — no stranger she to dangling participles .
She will do a John Kerry on you , which worked so well four years ago .
You were for the war before you were against it , she will wink .
And she will have a field day , if not a field dressing .
I do n’t know what your motives were in giving the president permission to attack Iraq — whether it was the neoconservative - cum - Israel - lobby cabal , the Cheney notion that the only way to ensure the supply of foreign oil is to control it , or a calculated move to ensure your viability as a candidate for president ( the kind of thinking that turned out to be , deservedly , the kiss of death for Sen. Hillary Clinton ) .
You had more luck , landing on your feet — sort of .
But you are a “ grave and growing ” danger ( so to speak ) to the campaign of Sen.
Obama ; that is , unless you mount a ( God forgive me ) “ preemptive attack . ”
And you have only two days — not ten — in which to prepare .
It will not wait for Yom Kippur .
Here ’s What You Do…
… and it makes sense from a practical , as well as a moral , point of view .
Forget the natural inclination to try to defend the indefensible on your cheerleading for the war .
To claim you were fooled by the administration , after almost 30 years in the Senate is not going to be any more persuasive or exculpatory than to cite what other pressures you may have yielded to .
Here ’s an idea that might not have occurred to you , since it involves a practice that has been out of vogue for so long .
Shock everyone by telling the truth !
( But briefly , please . )
Some suggested text :
Gov. Palin , I feel terrible about the role I played in helping President Bush launch this godforsaken war .
I confess ; it was a terrible decision .
I apologize to you and to other mothers whose children have been sent to Iraq , to the hundreds of thousands who have died and been injured , to all Americans and all Iraqis .
And I ask for forgiveness .
I have learned a painful but powerful lesson ; you can count on me never letting that kind of thing happen again .
Heed Rabbi Lerner ’s caution : “ Do not mitigate or ‘ explain ’ — just acknowledge and sincerely ask for forgiveness . ”
Now , Joe , to be quite honest , I cannot guarantee a good result from this kind of approach , since I have no empirical evidence .
That is , although I ’ve been in Washington 45 years , I ’ve not seen unvarnished honesty ever risked in quite this way .
But I am guessing it could be quite disarming , and could send your debate partner scurrying for less effective talking points .
You will be debating a “ fundamentalist , ” but that is actually a misnomer .
The fundamentals of Judeo - Christian morality have to do with truth telling , justice , and concern for the unprivileged .
Confessing , forgiving , and repenting are also fundamentals .
Do n’t be ashamed of them , Joe. Embrace them .
My guess is that if you do , you will leave your debate partner shocked — if not speechless .
In the process , you will have succeeded in drawing a stark contrast between the “ lies to nowhere ” that she continues to tell on the one hand , and your ( hopefully ) terse , disarming honesty , on the other .
You will be free to go ahead and demonstrate that in John McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin , no presidential candidate in the history of this country has made a more irresponsible selection for his running mate .
And best of all , you will be able to sit back and smile next Sunday as you listen to the second Scripture reading ( from Philippians 4 ) :
Whatever is true , honorable , and just … think about these and keep on doing them …
Then the God who gives peace will be with you .
Let Nathaniel be your model : no duplicity .
Sincerely ,
Ray McGovern

Waxing Woes
This was in my inbox .
I find it so completely funny I was PMP .
My husband did not see any humor in it all and gave me the deer - caught - in - the - headlights look .
Waxing Woes
All methods have tricked me with their promises of easy , painless removal : the Epilady , the standard razor , the scissors , the Nair , the EpilStop , and now ... The Wax .
My night began as any other normal weekday night .
I came home , I fixed dinner for my family and got everyone settled for the night .
I then had the thought that would ring painfully in my mind for the next couple hours : " Maybe I should use that wax in my medicine cabinet . "
I made sure no one would need me and I could head for the bathroom in peace .
It was one of those cold wax kits .
No melting a clump of hot wax , you just rub the clear strips in your hand , peel them apart , press it on your leg ( or wherever ) .
No muss , no fuss .
" How hard can this be ? " I mean , I 'm not the girliest of girls but I 'm mechanically inclined so maybe I can figure out how this works .
You 'd think .
So I pull one of the thin strips out .
It 's two strips facing each other , stuck together .
I 'm supposed to rub it in my hand to warm and soften the wax .
I go one better .
I pull out the hair dryer and heat it to ten thousand degrees .
Cold wax , noooo .
I lay the strip across my thigh .
I hold the skin around it and pull .
OK , so it was n't the best feeling in the world , but it was n't bad .
I can do this !
So with my next wax strip , I 'll move north .
After checking on my beloved family again , I sneak into the bathroom for The Ultimate Hair Fighting Championship .
I drop my panties and place one foot on the toilet .
Using the same procedure , I then apply the wax strip across the right side on my bikini line , covering the right half of my vagina and stretching up into the inside of the right cheek .
( Yeah , it was a long strip . )
I inhale deeply .
I brace myself .
RRRIIIIPPP !!!!
I 'm blind from the pain !
Vision returning .
Oh crap .
I 've managed to pull off only a half an inch of the strip .
Another deep breath .
And RIIIP !
Everything is swirly and tie -dyed .
Do I hear crashing drums ?
OK , coming back to normal again .
I want to see my trophy -- my wax covered pelt that caused me so much agony .
I want to revel in the glory that is my triumph over body hair .
I hold the wax strip like an Olympic gold medalist .
But why is there no hair on it ?
And why is the wax mostly gone ?
Where could the wax go , if not on the strip ?
Slowly , I eased my head down , my foot still perched on the toilet .
I see hair -- the hair that should be on the strip .
I touch .
I feel .
I am touching wax .
I look to the ceiling and silently shout " Nooooooo ! ! "
I peel my fingers off the softest , most sensitive part of my body that is now covered in cold wax and matted hair , and make the next big mistake -- up until this point , you 'll remember , I 've had my foot on the toilet .
I know I need to move , to do something .
So I put my foot down on the floor .
And then I hear the slamming of the cell door .
Vagina ?
Sealed shut .
Butt ?
Sealed shut .
A little voice in my head says , " I hope you do n't have to shit anytime soon . " I penguin walk around the bathroom trying desperately to figure out what I should do next .
Hot water !
Hot water melts wax !
I 'll run the hottest water I can stand and get in .
The wax should melt and I can gently wipe it away , right ?
Wrong .
I get in the tub -- the water is slightly hotter than is used to torture prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment -- and I sit .
Now the only thing worse than having your goodies glued together is having them glued together and then glued to the bottom of a tub .
In scalding hot water .
Which , by the way , does not melt the cold wax .
So now I 'm stuck in the tub -- literally !
I call my friend , Liz , because she once dropped out of beauty school so surely she has some secret knowledge or trick to get wax off skin .
It is however , never good to start a conversation with " So my butt and vagina are stuck to the tub . "
She wants to know exactly where the wax is on the butt .
" Are we talking cheek , here ? " she asks .
She is n't even trying to hide the giggles now .
I give her the run -down of the entire night .
She tells me to call the number on the side of the box , but to have a good cover story for where the wax actually is .
" You know that if we were working the help line at XX Wax Co. and somebody called with their entire crack sealed shut we'd just put them on hold and then record the conversation for everyone we know .
You 're going to end up on a radio show or the internet if you tell them the truth . "
While we go through various solutions , I have resorted to scraping the wax off with a razor .
Boy , nothing feels better to the girlie goodies than covering them in wax , sticking them to a tub in super hot water and THEN dry shaving the sticky wax off !
In the middle of the conversation ( which has inexplicably turned to " other " subjects ! )
I find the lotion provided with the wax to remove the excess .
I rub some in and start screaming " It 's working !
It 's working ! "
I get hearty congratulations from Liz and we hang up .
I successfully remove all the wax and notice , to my dismay , that the hair is still there .
So I shaved the stuff off .
I was numb by that point anyway .
I put the box of wax back in my medicine cabinet .
Never know when a moustache might start to come in ....
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia hopes to deploy a new nuclear missile next year designed to penetrate anti-missile defenses and will build eight submarines to carry it , defense officials said on Thursday .

The latest statements underline Moscow ’s determination to upgrade its nuclear strike forces on land , sea and air .
They are regarded by Russian commanders as the cornerstone of the country ’s defenses .
Colonel - General Vladimir Popovkin , head of armaments for the Russian armed forces , told the Defense Ministry newspaper “ Red Star ” that Russia ’s recent war with Georgia “ compels us to rethink the current state of the armed forces and how they should develop further . ”
President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have both pledged to extend Russia ’s recent military build - up with extra funds to buy new , high - tech arms .
On Wednesday , Putin announced an extra $ 3.1 billion of spending next year , partly to replace equipment lost in the Georgia war .
Despite the billions of dollars spent on them since Putin came to power as president in 2000 , Russia ’s 1 million - strong armed forces remain poorly equipped , badly paid and reliant on a large proportion of unwilling conscripts .
The deputy commander in chief of the Russian navy , Admiral Alexander Tatarinov , said on Thursday that by 2015 Moscow would build a fleet of nuclear - powered submarines to carry a new , nuclear - capable strategic missile .
“ The navy has gone over to building ships and nuclear submarines by the batch , ” Tatarinov told Interfax news agency .
“ A new state armaments program includes a plan to build a batch of eight nuclear submarines that would be armed with new Bulava strategic missiles . ”
SPENDING
Defense analysts based in Moscow say much of the extra spending has not reached the front line because of corruption or mismanagement and many weapons programs are running late .
One of these is the Bulava , a submarine - launched long - range nuclear missile which Putin says will be capable of penetrating any missile defenses -- a reference to Washington ’s plans for a new global system to shoot down hostile rockets .
The Bulava , a modified version of the land - based Topol - M , has had a checkered history with several test launch failures and is running at least two years late .
The navy pronounced the latest Bulava exercise on September 18 a success , saying the missile flew from the White Sea across Russia to the Far East .
Popovkin , who is also deputy defense minister , said he hoped the armed forces would accept the Bulava for service next year .
Upgrading Russia ’s strategic nuclear forces remained a priority because they were the cornerstone of its defenses , he said .
“ As long as we are a nuclear power , no hotheads will venture to attack our country , ” Popovkin said in the interview .
” ...
We have already this year started fitting out strategic nuclear forces with the Topol - M missile , ” he added .
Russia also plans to modernize its nuclear - capable Tupolev TU - 160 supersonic strategic bombers and to fully commission the first nuclear - powered submarine to carry the Bulava missile , he added .
The submarine , the Yuri Dolgoruky , was launched in February , six years after its original scheduled date , though it still lacks the missiles it was designed to carry .
They seem to be getting down to last - straw mean tactics , but we have to be ready for them !
The New York Times today hit the nail on the head with this headline OBAMA AND '60s BOMBER : A LOOK AT CROSSED PATHS .
This is prescient coverage , indeed , anticipating the R's next step , for anyone who is slightly paying attention now , to get ready for the next campaign barrages , which will probably go all month : Obama as Muslim , Obama as African - American , Obama as Radical , Obama as ( I have even heard and rec'd such things from folks I normally consider as sane ) Satanist .
Next comes Obama the Friend of the Radical Weatherman Bomber , Bill Ayers .
Well , this is what I have to say about that : back in the late 60's and early 70's , I remember meeting Mark Rudd , and think I met Angela Davis , and golly : very early one Sunday morning after one of the famous San Francisco Peace Marches to end the Vietnam War in 1967 or was it 1968 , I even saw , driving a yellow Porsche Convertible about 60 miles an hour through Haight Ashbury , JANIS JOPLIN !
I visited Patty Hearst at the San Mateo County Jail after she got arrested for Bank Robbery .
So what ?
I gave her Patty book to help her while away the hours .
Does that mean I was in the Symbionese Liberation Army ?
Naaah ....
Those were wild times , and sometimes I am quietly very proud of such unusual stories ...
Just because twenty years ago , you befriend anyone and talk intelligently with them , years ago : what does that mean , anyway ?
That you are learning .
Does that mean you are sitting at the feet of 9/11 bombers ?
No .
Of course not , but the Republicans will use this ludicrous and deranged line of reasoning to scare the elderly as they have already done in South Florida , the undecideds , the apathetics , the rural Americans who do n't read the New York Times everyday , etc .
And let 's face it : SUCH TACTICS ALWAYS WORK ON THE PURELY IGNORANT AND RACIST AMONG AMERICANS !
AP 's Headline Reflects the Republican Urgency :
Onus on McCain to Turn Race Around
Direct quote from AP : " The onus is on Republican John McCain to turn the race around under exceptionally challenging circumstances -- and his options are limited . "
McCain 's advisers say he will gear up major broadside attacks ( that pray on the ignorance of many ) by saying that Obama is " too liberal " and " too risky . "
Obama 's advisers retort that McCain is incabable of communicating any economic overview different from Bush's .
Associated Press interviews nationwide show :
Democrats are optimistic of victory if nervous over whether Obama can hold his advantage while Republicans are worried that the race may be moving out of reach though hopeful that McCain will beat the odds as he did in the GOP primary .
Both sides note that plenty can change in one month -- and they 're right .
South Carolina GOP Chairman Katon Dawson said that given McCain 's standing , '' I 'd be concerned at this time , but I would never count this guy out .
He 's got the political hide of an alligator . ''
McCain will not be able to win without keeping most of the states that Bush won , and he 's tied or trailing in public polls in 10 of them -- Colorado , Florida , Indiana , Iowa , Missouri , New Mexico , Nevada , North Carolina , Ohio and Virginia .

Philosophical Problems
with Calculus
Issac Newton 's mathematics of " fluxions " was the first form of differential calculus .
Newton himself used geometrical methods ; the following algebraic method came later , though not much later ( if at all ) by way of Leibniz .
There were objections to calculus at the time , and philosophical problems with it , or at least questions about it , continue .
The statement by John Stillwell , above , goes to show that some mathematicians also continue to have questions .
The philosophical objections , then and now , have made no difference in the success or application of the mathematics .
This is due to the abstract nature of mathematics and the logically sufficient nature of scientific method , as understood by Karl Popper ( i.e. that scientific theories are sufficient conditions , but not necessary conditions , of the phenomena of observation , prediction , and experiment ) .
Developments in mathematics , however , do not eliminate the philosophical issues , although it is common to think so just because the math works -- that is a form of the " Sin of Galileo . "
The metaphysics of mathematics , which is what is at issue when serious consideration is given here to the implications of infinitesimals or of division by zero , is part of meta - mathematics , not mathematics proper .
The following method of developing a derivative is the classic version involving limits .
This replaced , as Stillwell notes , the earlier approach , used by both Newton and Leibniz , of infinitesimals .
However , this classic approach now also has tended to fall out of favor .
More recently , discussion of either infinitesimals or limits can be replaced by descriptions in terms of functions in the most abstract sense -- i.e. dy / dx is simply a formal operation that turns some equations into other equations .
Thus , even expressions like " let x tend to zero " can be eliminated and the whole sense can be excised that x and y in calculus are about changing quantities -- i.e. we may not see x or y , as indeed we did not when infinitesimals alone were used .
There is nothing mathematically wrong with that , since we can define things any way to do whatever we want , but a function notation ( like " f( x ) " ) is already more abstract than an equation that is simply between variables like " y " and " x . "
In " f( x ) , " " f " itself is a variable , a predicate variable for the form of the equation .
Where we are interested in ratios of changing quantities , which is what the derivative is all about , this is not particularly revealing .
The traditional notation of dy / dx is still used these days , but its derivation and meaning , whether from infinitesimals or limits , is less clear from the new approach .
Depending on the text , it may be introduced rather arbitrarily after functional analysis is developed [ note ] .
Thus I have chosen to state this traditional method of taking a derivative .
Limits still keep us within conceptual grasp of infinitesimals .
If the purpose of the analysis in terms of functions was to obscure the philosophical questions about infinitesimals , it was not a good idea .
If the idea is that the philosophical questions about infinitesimals do n't exist because derivatives can be analyzed merely in terms of functions , it is deceptive , for that implication does not follow .
Actually , the following seven steps ( an application of the " four step rule " ) can be used without the slightest attention to either infinitesimals or limits .
Once we get y/ x , relying on no more than ordinary algebra , we have the derivative by nothing more mysterious than setting y and x to zero .
We can happily go on our way , if we wish , without looking back .
The complications , then , are all philosophical .
We notice that if y and x are zero , then y/ x is 0/0 , about which we may feel uneasy .
This is where philosophical quesitons will start , and I found the problem of 0/0 , in its own right , most intriguing .
And this is where infinitesimals can be brought in to solve the mystery : y and x are not really set to zero , just to something so small , " right before zero , " that it can not be written as a number and is effectively zero .
As dy / dx , y/ x is not really 0/0 .
But , since there really is n't a number " right before zero , " limits will solve the paradox in a different way , without worrying as much about metaphysics ; but if we then ask what the limit will look like , it will look just like the equation where y and x have been set to zero .
So we 're really back to the beginning .
Kant would say that we have returned to the same ignorance whence we began ; and in Zen , the mountain is just a mountain again .
But none of this matters to the use of calculus , which shows that the metaphysical questions are part of meta- mathematics , not mathematics proper -- although the whole business is probably related to the Continuum Problem , about which there seems to have been little progress in decades .
Thus , while the philosophical discussion about calculus seems to be consumed with the alternatives of infinitesimals or limits , they both go back to the paradox of 0/0 , whose awkwardness both wish to resolve , sometimes with approaches the manage to avoid mention of the problem at all .
Because of this , I would say that the philosophers should pay more attention to 0/0 first , since that is where the trouble starts .
TAKING A DERIVATIVE I. y = 3x2 + 4 x + 5 Given an equation ,
where y is a function of x : ( y = f ( x ) ) .
II . y + y = 3 ( x + x ) 2 + 4 ( x + x ) + 5
If the value of x changes , then value of y
will change .
We add in the changes in the
values ( x and y ) to the original values .
III . y + y = 3 ( x2 + 2x x + x2 ) + 4 ( x + x ) + 5 ( x + x ) 2 is multiplied out .
IV . y + y = 3x2 + 6 x x + 3 x2 + 4 x + 4 x + 5
The constants are multiplied into all
the terms .
V. y + y = 3x2 + 6 x x + 3 x2 + 4 x + 4 x + 5
-(y = 3x2 + 4 x + 5 )
= y = 6x x + 3 x2 + 4 x
The original equation ( I ) is now
subtracted from equation IV .
This
gives us an equation about the change
in y ( or y ) .
VI . y/ x = ( 6 x x + 3 x2 + 4 x ) / x = 6 x + 3 x + 4
Now both sides of the equation are
divided by the change in x ( or x ) ,
giving us an expression for the ratio
between the change in y and the
change in x ( i.e. y/ x ) .
VII .
If x becomes small and approaches zero as a limit , y also approaches zero ; and ( 6 x + 3 x + 4 ) approaches ( 6 x + 4 ) .
This is expressed as ( dy / dx = 6 x + 4 ) , which is the " derivative " of the original equation ( I . y = 3x2 + 4 x + 5 ) .
Note that , from the original equation , each x variable drops one power , the constant on each variable is multiplied by the previous power , and the lone constant is simply lost .
These are general characteristics of derivatives .
Since constants are lost in derivatives , the opposite of derivation , integration , always ( for indefinite integrals ) introduces a constant ( whose value will then be unknown , though it may = 0 ) .
If y is in units of distance ( s ) and x in units of time ( t ) , the derivative ( ds / dt ) is the velocity , indeed , the " instantaneous " velocity of a moving object , at a point in time and space .
This in itself was philosophically paradoxical , hearkening back to the pardoxes of motion described by Zeno of Elea , since an object that does not move a finite distance might be said to have no velocity , since it is not moving .
For 3 x in VI to be zero , x would have to be zero ; but then y would also be zero .
dy / dx therefore would seem to represent zero / zero , which is ordinarily a useless or meaningless relationship in mathematics : zero divided by anything is zero ; and anything divided by zero is often said to be " undefined , " which is a polite ( or wimpy ) way of saying " infinite . "
How a difference could be both zero and infinite is a good question .
As it happens , it looks like zero divided by zero can be any quantity , so it is not really undefined but indefinite .
It does not give us a particular quantity .
The explanation of this in Newton and Leibniz was that y and x were not really zero , but that dy / dx represents the quantity they have just before they reach zero .
That quantity " just before " zero is an " infinitesimal " -- a number smaller than any number that can be written , but not yet nothing .
But , it is objected , there is no quantity " just before " zero .
Either there is a finite number , in which case 3 x is not zero , or there is zero , in which case dy / dx is either meaningless or indeterminate .
Infinitesimals already existed .
They were useful as an approach to areas within curves .
Thus , the area within a circle can be divided into wedges , whose areas as triangles can easily be determined .
However , they do not then cover the area of the circle , since there is space left between the straight outer edge of the triangle and the curved boundary of the circle .
This problem can be avoided if the length of the straight outer edge is " infinitesimal , " i.e. infinitely small but not exactly zero .
Indeed , as the length approaches zero , the sum of the area of the triangles approaches the area within the circle .
A purely conceptual and philosophical objection to this was already lodged in 1656 by Thomas Hobbes against the mathematician John Wallis .
As this objection was ignored by Newton and Leibniz , calculus only made things worse ; and subsequent British philosophers , like George Berkeley and David Hume , not only could repeat the earlier logical objection , but , as Empiricists , they could add their own epistemological objection , that as infinitesimals would be invisible to perception , they could not be a matter of empirical , and so any , knowledge .
Since later positivistic and analytic philosophy tended to view Hume as its spiritual forebearer , neither the logical nor epistemological objections could be easily dismissed .
It is natural for mathematicians to respond by dealing with the matter in such a way that the metaphysical or epistemological issues do n't arise .
This is not difficult , and the replacement of infinitesimals first by limits and then by a use of functions that does n't even need x and y are ways of doing that .
But , as John Stillwell says in the epigraph , " ... nonstandard analysis is not yet as simple as the old Leibniz calculus of infinitesimals , and there is a continuing search for a really natural system that uses infinitesimals in a consistent way . "
So even some mathematicians are left with a desire for something better .
A RECENT TREATMENT
Approaches to infinitesimals were discussed in a popular article in Scientific American , " Resolving Zeno's Paradoxes , " by William I. McLaughlin , November 1994 .
McLaughlin mentions how talk about infinitesimals is usually replaced by talk about limits :
When analysts thought about rigorously justifying the existence of these small quantities , innumerable difficulties arose .
Eventually , mathematicians of the 19th century invented a technical substitute for infinitesimals : the so - called theory of limits .
So complete was its triumph that some mathematicians spoke of the " banishment " of infinitesimals from their discipline .
In terms of limits , ( 6 x + 4 ) is never actually reached ; but as x approaches zero , ( 6 x + 3 x + 4 ) approaches ( 6 x + 4 ) " as a limit , " i.e. the quantity it would be when x is zero , even though x will never quite get there .
In this case , however , 3 x is never quite zero but then is treated as zero , which sounds like the definition of an infinitesimal after all .
McLaughlin then continues to explain how infinitesimals have come be included in mathematics anyway :
By the 1960s , though , the ghostly tread of infinitesimals in the corridors of mathematics became quite real once more , thanks to the work of the logician Abraham Robinson of Yale University [ see " Nonstandard Analysis , " by Martin Davis and Reuben Hersh ; Scientific American , June 1972 ] .
Since then , several methods in addition to Robinson 's approach have been devised that make use of infinitesimals .
.... Edward Nelson of Princeton University created the tool we [ McLaughlin & Sylvia Miller ] found most valuable in our attack [ on infinitesimals ] , a brand of nonstandard analysis known by the rather arid name of internal set theory ( IST ) ....
Nelson adopted a novel means of defining infinitesimals .
Mathematicians typically expand existing number systems by tacking on objects that have desirable properties , much in the same way that fractions were sprinkled between the integers .
Indeed , the number system employed in modern mathematics , like a coral reef , grew by accretion onto a supporting base : " God made the integers , all the rest is the work of man , " declared Leopold Kronecker ( 1823-1891 ) .
Instead the way of IST is to " stare " very hard at the existing number system and note that it already contains numbers that , quite reasonably , can be considered infinitesimals .
Technically , Nelson finds nonstandard numbers on the real line by adding three rules , or axioms , to the set of 10 or so statements supporting most mathematical systems .
( Zermelo - Fraenkel set theory is one such foundation . )
These additions introduce a new term , standard , and help us to determine which of our old friends in the number system are standard and which are nonstandard .
Not surprisingly , the infinitesimals fall in the nonstandard category , along with some other numbers I will discuss later [ i.e. the reciprocals of infinitesimals , which are indefinitely large , but not infinite , quantities ] .
Nelson defines an infinitesimal as a number that lies between zero and every positive standard number .
At first , this might not seem to convey any particular notion of smallness , but the standard numbers include every concrete number ( and a few others ) you could write on a piece of paper or generate in a computer : 10 , pi , 1/1000 and so on .
Hence , an infinitesimal is greater than zero but less than any number , however small , you could ever conceive of writing .
It is not immediately apparent that such infinitesimals do indeed exist , but the conceptual validity of IST has been demonstrated to a degree commensurate with our justified belief in other mathematical systems .
" Commensurate with our justified belief in other mathematical systems " means that the three extra axioms of IST do not produce any contradictions with any other axioms or with any known theorems in Set Theory .
This is what could be expected from Gödel 's proof of the incompleteness of mathematics :
New branches of mathematics may involve the addition of new axioms to the existing logical system .
That the new branches can be constructed is the kind of thing that mathematicians like to do anyway ; but whether they are good for anything is another question .
IMPLICATIONS
That infinitesimals address originally philosophical objections to calculus is an interesting case .
Calculus has actually worked for several centuries despite the philosophical problems with it .
In scientific terms , that is good enough ; and most mathematicians , physicists , engineers , etc. have thought so .
The need for a seemingly superfluous philosophical explanation is not always apparent to non-philosophers .
However , what often happens with new branches of mathematics is that they turn out to be applicable to unanticipated things .
That may not have happened yet with infinitesimals , but it is really the practical justification for pure research in mathematics :
We do n't know what is going to happen in the future .
With infinitesimals , we can avoid the " zero divided by zero " paradox .
An infinitesimal divided by an infinitesimal can easily be a finite quantity .
3 x in the example above may not be zero ; but if it is itself merely an infinitesimal , then it can be ignored without harm in any calculations where all we want are finite numbers .
An infinitesimal will not matter in building a bridge -- though one wonders : Chaos Theory is about the sensitivity of systems , whether natural or mathematical , to small variations in initial conditions .
If infinitesimal variations in initial conditions produce macroscopic differences in the world , then infinitesimals would suddenly be an important part of physics .
It has been objected by a correspondent that infinitesimals cannot possibly figure in a physical application of Chaos Theory because infinitesimals cannot become finite numbers merely by being multiplied by other infinitesimals or by finite numbers .
An infinitesimal would have to be multiplied by an infinite number to give a finite result .
However , this overlooks the circumstance that finite velocities even in Newton were the result of an infinitesimal being divided by an infinitesimal .
An infinitesimal distance divided by an infinitesimal time is a finite velocity .
Infinitesimal changes in either quantity would thus make a finite difference .
Thus , questions which at the time might be dismissed as the absurd rantings of philosophers often return in more respectable garb and do n't seem so absurd after all .
The real philosophical question , the metaphysical question , about infinitesimals , however , is just that they appear to involve a contradiction .
They are zero without being zero and number without being number .
The extra axioms of nonstandard analysis may provide a breathing space for them , but , as Stillwell says , it would be nice to have " a really natural system " that can define infinitesimals in way that would not offend the intelligence of Thomas Hobbes or anyone else .
This may not be possible , but there may nevertheless be a reasonable logical principle that can be employed , whether Hobbes or Berkeley would like it or not .
The principle would be that similar to what we find with imaginary numbers , i.e. we have an entity that exists in representation , that does not correspond to a real object , perhaps because of some contradiction , but which does enable us to derive results for real objects .
This would not be strange to anyone who would have thought , like Aristotle , that mathematics is just a device for calculation .
It is just disturbing in terms of the mathematical realism of someone like Plato .
My own basic sympathies in the matter are Platonic , but I am not actually a Platonist , but a Kantian .
In Kant , our knowledge is both real and representational , with characteristics that may apply to reality , or to representation , but not both .
A kind of compromise is then possible .
The mathematical results that apply to the world are real , and the Platonist can be happy .
But it may be that calculation can generate entities that work in representation , but cannot apply to reality .
Imaginary numbers and infinitesimals can fall into that category .
Indeed , the very concept of " nothing " may fall into that category .
Parmenides argued that a concept of something must be , in truth , of something , while the concept of " nothing , " by definition , is not something .
So speaking of nothing treats it , incongruously , as something .
While such an argument might strike many as silly , since even Parmenides obviously talks about " nothing , " this consideration produced the ontological principle ex nihilo nihil fit , " from nothing , nothing comes , " which survives in the very non-silly context of the principles of the conservation of mass and the conservation of energy in modern physics .
The concept of " nothing " is thus certainly useful in our representation , and gives real results , despite its birth in paradox .
Suitably , infinitesimals themselves are things which are nothing , yet nevertheless something , in much the same way as concerned Parmenides .
As it happens , not only can we write an infinitesimal quantity in ordinary mathematical notation but that we can then derive zero from it .
We can do this by considering , first , how an infinitesimal would have to be written .
Since it is the smallest possible quantity before zero , we could only write it with a decimal point , followed by an infinite number of zeros , followed by a 1 ( the smallest positive integer ) .
Writing a finite number of zeros , we could always write a smaller number by introducing an extra zero .
We cannot write , of course , an infinite number of zeros .
We can consider , however , what would happen if we subtracted such a number from the number 1 .
This would produce a repeating decimal with the number 9 : i.e. 0.9999 9 , where we indicate the repeating group in a repeating decimal by underlining it .
The number 0 . 9 differs from 1 only by our decimal followed by an infinite number of zeros followed by 1 .
That number itself , then , our infinitesimally small number , can be indicated by the expression ( 1 - 0 . 9 ) .
Now , repeating decimals are rational numbers and can be expressed as a ratio of integers .
There is also simple technique for discovering such a ratio .
Randomly make up repeating decimal .
100,000x = 75,674 . 74 -( 1,000 x = 756 .
74 ) -------------------- 99,000x = 74,918
74
10 x = 9 . 9 -( x = 0 . 9 ) --------- 9x = 9
9
9
So it turns out that our infinitesimal quantity , the decimal point followed by an infinite number of zeros followed by 1 , is actually equal to 0 .
This curious effect would seem to imply that even if there are infinitesimals , which would explain a finite quantity for a derivative , they actually do equal zero , so that the factor 3 x , in the example above , can be put equal to zero in all good conscience .
At the same time , 9 does give us a well - defined and clear notational difference , strictly addressing an infinitesimal difference , with 1 .
If we just allow 9 to hang there for a while , it opens a temporary window where areas under curves and derivatives ( and the integrals that express areas under curves ) can rush in .
Of course , perhaps it is n't that simple .
Infinitesimals have infinitesimal differences , which are not so small as to be zero and not so large as to be finite numbers .
They all fit into 1 - 0 . 9 .
The infinitesimal differences are not things that we can represent in notation , except in the most important sense , that the equivalent of 0/0 becomes a definite quantity , rather than an indeterminate quantity .
That is the real payoff for the small and fictional entity of representation .

I spoke on the phone Sunday with Sarah Palin , who was in Long Beach , Calif. , preparing to take off on her next campaign trip .
It was the first time I ’d talked with her since I met her in far more relaxed circumstances in Alaska over a year ago .
But even though she ’s presumably now under some strain and stress , she seemed , as far as I could tell , confident and upbeat .
In terms of substance , some of what she had to say was unsurprising :
She does n’t have a very high opinion of the mainstream media , and she believes an Obama administration would kill jobs by raising taxes .
But she said a couple of things that were , I thought , either personally touching or politically provocative .
At one point , noting that Palin had remarked ruefully almost a week ago that her son Track had been , since his recent deployment to Iraq , in touch with his girlfriend but not his mother , I asked whether she had subsequently heard from him .
Palin told me she had .
“ He called the day of the debate , and it was so wonderful because it was the first call since they were deployed over there , and it was like a burden lifted even when I heard his voice . ”
Palin said that she told him that she had a debate that night .
“ And he says , ‘ Yeah , I heard , Mom , ’ and he says , ‘ Have you been studying ? ’
And I said , ‘ Yeah , I have , ’ and he goes , ‘ O.K. , well I ’ll be praying . ’
I ’m like  total role reversal here , that ’s what I ’ve been telling him for 19 years . ”

For years , heroin dealers have used “ brand stamps ” as a way to inform customers of their quality .
Even before Frank Lucas ’s “ Blue Magic ” in the 1960s , “ good ” dealers have found ways to make their product stand out among the poorer quality majority .
Once the high quality dealers started doing this , everyone else started as well since it was a low cost way of increasing the apparent quality of the bags .
For only the cost of a stamp and ink , a dealer could copy the stamp from the highest quality heroin on the street .
This lack of copyright laws made the high quality dealers constantly have to shift their brand names and stay topical , since the best brands were copied within days .
Illustrating this : just recently , 52 glassine bags of heroin stamped both with “ OBAMA ” and an image of Sen.
Barack Obama were confiscated following a routine car stop on Interstate 95 in Upper Chichester , according to Pennsylvania State Police .
That ’s an interesting way to support your candidate .
Examples of heroin brand stamps :

To find out , Kamakura - based IT company KAYAC Co. , Ltd. has developed a sophisticated botanical interface system that lets plants post their thoughts online .
A succulent Sweetheart Hoya ( Hoya kerii ) named " Midori - san " is now using the system to blog daily from its home at bowls Donburi Cafe in Kamakura .
The plant interface system , which is built around technology developed by Satoshi Kuribayashi at the Keio University Hiroya Tanaka Laboratory , uses surface potential sensors to read the weak bioelectric current flowing across the surface of the leaves .
This natural current fluctuates in response to changes in the immediate environment , such as temperature , humidity , vibration , electromagnetic waves and nearby human activity .
A specially developed algorithm translates this data into Japanese sentences , which are used as fodder for the plant 's daily blog posts .
Diagram of plant interface system
Midori - san started blogging about a week ago .
So far , the plant 's highly structured posts summarize the day's weather , temperature and lighting conditions , describe its overall physical condition , tell how much light it received via the user - activated lamp ( see below ) , and explain how much fun the day was .
Each post also includes a self - portrait photo and a plant - themed pun ( in Japanese ) , which Midori - san likely did not write .
A graph at the top of the sidebar shows the plant 's surface potential in real - time .
Readers can also treat Midori - san to a dose of fluorescent light either through the website or this widget :
To activate a web - controlled fluorescent lamp positioned next to the plant inside the cafe , click the " Give Light to Midori - san " ( ?????????) button at the bottom of the widget , enter your name ( or a nickname ) , and click OK .
( Get the widget code here . )
Once the lamp activated , the widget shows a real - time view of Midori - san under the light .
Judging from the blog content and the numerous " thank yous " below the fold of each post , Midori - san seems to really appreciate every chance it gets to photosynthesize .
In addition to exploring the potential of intelligent networks that involve the natural environment around us , KAYAC hopes this entertaining plant interface system will inspire people to think about the environment in new ways .

" ... And they lived happily ever after . "
You 're smart .
You know life is no storybook .
But admit it : Somewhere deep in your subconscious lurk romantic visions of Cinderella , or maybe Julia Roberts .
The images may be sketchy and a little outdated , but you can still make out the silhouette of the bride and Prince Charming riding off into the sunset .
In real life , sometimes your Disney fairy tale ends up feeling more like a Wes Craven horror flick — and you 're the chick who keeps falling down and screaming for her life .
I 've been there .
Let 's face it , marriage is not for the faint of heart .
You want to believe your pure love for each other will pull you through .
And it does .
But it ai n't always pretty .
That may sound grim .
But here 's a secret : Sometimes it 's the least romantic parts of marriage that have the most to teach you about yourself , your partner , and the nature of love .
Read on for some simple truths that will unlock the surprising treasures and pleasures in your imperfect , unstorybook , real - life love .
1 . You will look at the person lying next to you and wonder , Is this it ?
Forever ?
When you get married , you think that as long as you pick the right guy — your soul mate — you 'll be happy together until death do you part .
Then you wake up one day and realize that no matter how great he is , he does n't make you happy every moment of every day .
In fact , some days you might wonder why you were in such a hurry to get married in the first place .
You think to yourself , This is so not what I signed up for .
Actually , it is .
You just did n't realize it the day you and your guy were cramming wedding cake into each other 's faces , clinking champagne glasses , and dancing the Electric Slide .
Back then you had no idea that " for better and for worse " does n't kick in only when life hands you a tragedy .
Your relationship mettle is , in fact , most tested on a daily basis , when the utter sameness of day - in / day - out togetherness can sometimes make you want to run for the hills .
That 's when the disappointment sneaks in , and maybe even a palpable sense of loneliness and grief .
It 's not him .
It 's just you , letting go of that sugarcoated fantasy of marriage that danced in your eyes the day you and your beloved posed in all those soft - focus wedding photos .
You 're learning that marriage is n't a destination ; it 's a journey filled with equal parts excitement and tedium .
Waking up from a good dream to face the harsh morning daylight may not seem like a reason to celebrate .
But trust me , it is .
Because once you let go of all the hokey stories of eternal bliss , you find that the reality of marriage is far richer and more rewarding than you ever could have guessed .
Hard , yes .
Frustrating , yes .
But full of its own powerful , quiet enchantments just the same , and that 's better than any fairy tale .

2 . You 'll work harder than you ever imagined .
Early on , when people say , " Marriage takes work , " you assume " work " means being patient when he forgets to put down the toilet seat .
In your naiveté , you think that you will struggle to accommodate some annoying habit , like persistent knuckle cracking or flatulence .
If only it were that easy .
Human beings , you may have noticed , are not simple creatures .
Your man has mysterious , unplumbed depths — and from where he sits , you 're pretty complicated , too .
You have to learn each other the same way that you once learned earth science or world geography .
And getting married does n't mean you 're done — it just means you 've advanced to graduate - level studies .
That 's because every time you think you 've mastered the material , he 'll change a bit .
And so will you .
As two people grow and evolve , the real work of marriage is finding a way to relate to and nurture each other in the process .
" It 's like losing weight , " says Andrea Harden , 45 , of Buffalo , NY .
" You want it to be a one - time deal .
You lost it , now just live .
But then you learn it 's a lifestyle .
That 's marriage .
The effort is a forever thing . "
So do n't be too hard on yourself — or him — on those days when you feel like you 're struggling through remedial math .
3 . You will sometimes go to bed mad ( and maybe even wake up madder ) .
Whoever decided to tell newlyweds " Never go to bed angry " does n't know what it 's like inside a bedroom where tears and accusations fly as one spouse talks the other into a woozy stupor until night meets the dawn .
If this scenario sounds familiar , I 've got three words for you : Sleep on it .
You need to calm down .
You need to gain perspective .
You need to just give it a rest .
I 've found that an argument of any quality , like a fine wine , needs to breathe .
A break in the action will help you figure out whether you 're angry , hurt , or both , and then pinpoint the exact source .
Maybe the fight that seemed to erupt over the overflowing garbage can is really about feeling underappreciated .
Could be you 're both stressed out at work and just needed to unload on someone .
Taking a break will help you see that , and let go .
Or maybe you really do have a legitimate disagreement to work out .
Without a time - out , sometimes a perfectly good argument can turn into an endless round of silly back - and - forth , rehashing old and irrelevant transgressions as you get more and more wound up .
Even when you do manage to stay focused and on topic , there are some fights that stubbornly refuse to die by bedtime .
And if you stifle your real feelings just to meet some arbitrary deadline , your marriage will surely be the worse for it .
" This was a huge lesson for me , " says Andrea .
" As women we 've been trained to make nice .
But the whole kiss - and - make - up thing just to keep the peace was eating me up inside .
I 'd let things build up inside me until I just exploded .
Now I wait a while to get hold of myself — let the emotions settle a bit — and state my position .
Even if that means reopening the fight the next day . "
4 . You will go without sex — sometimes for a long time — and that 's okay .
There are few men in the Western world sexier than my husband .
And I do n't say this because I know he may read this article .
I 've seen women checking him out when they think I 'm not looking .
( Honestly , ladies , you do n't have to sneak a peek .
I do n't mind if you stare . )
That said , there are times that I just do n't feel like having sex — often for reasons that have nothing to do with Genoveso .
( See ?
Even his name is sexy . )
I can't lie and say this is always okay with him .
But the fact is , there are also plenty of nights when he 's not in the mood .
So maybe a few days go by when we do n't do it .
And then a few more .
And ....
Sexless periods are a natural part of married life .
A dry spell is n't a sign that you 've lost your mojo or that you 'll never have sex again .
It just means that maybe this week , sleep is more important than sex .
( I do n't know about you , but between work , 3 a.m. feedings , the PTA , soccer , T - ball , and everything else , I sometimes crave sleep the way a pimply , hormonal adolescent longs to cop a feel . )
And do n't kid yourself ; no one in America is doing it as often as popular culture would have you believe .
Instead of worrying about how much you think you " should " be having sex , keep the focus on figuring out your own rhythm .
" I used to think , What 's happened to us ?
We always used to be in the mood , " says 35 - year - old Kim Henderson of Oakland , CA , who 's been married for five years .
" Now I know better .
Life happens .
My husband just started a new job .
He has a long commute , and we have two small children .
I think we 're good . "
The key is to make sure that even if you 're not doing " it , " you 're still doing something — touching , kissing , hugging .
Personally , my heart gets warm and mushy when my husband rubs my feet after a long , tiring day .
He may not be anywhere near my G - spot , but that little bit of touch and attention keeps us connected even when we 're not having spine - tingling sex .
5 . Getting your way is usually not as important as finding a way to work together .
I can be a bit of a know - it - all .
There , I said it .
It 's really not my intention to be hurtful or brash with people I love .
It 's just that a lifetime of experience has taught me that in most areas , at most times , I am right about most things .
What shocked me several years into my marriage , though , was the realization that the more " right " I was , the more discontented my husband and I were as a couple .
See , oddly enough , throughout his life Genoveso has been under the misguided impression that he 's right most of the time ( go figure ! ) .
So we 'd lock horns — often .
That is , until I learned a few things .
Namely , that when it comes to certain disagreements , there is no right or wrong — there is simply your way of looking at things and your husband's .
" I used to be very black - and - white earlier in our marriage , " says Lindy Vincent , 38 , who lives in Minneapolis .
" Now I see that I 'm not all right and my husband is not all wrong .
There 's more gray in life than I thought , and that 's taught me patience and the value of compromise . "
The more I get to know and appreciate my husband for who he is , the more I respect his positions .
That does n't mean I always agree with him .
But I can see the value in striking a balance that satisfies us both .
And instead of harping on how wrong he is , I can usually swallow the verbal vitriol and simply say something like , " I see your point " or " I had n't considered that . "
After I sincerely acknowledge his view , it seems to become easier for him to hear mine .
And because I know I 'm being heard , most of the time now , I do n't even want to prove how right I am anymore .
Funny how that works , is n't it ?
6 . A great marriage does n't mean no conflict ; it simply means a couple keeps trying to get it right .
Maybe you think that because of my newfound wisdom , Genoveso and I never fight anymore .
Ha !
As important as it is to strike a balance , it 's also important to have a big , fat fight every now and then .
Because when you fight , you do n't just raise your voices ; you raise real — sometimes buried — issues that challenge you to come to a clearer understanding of you , your man , and your relationship .
I would n't give up our fights for anything in the world , because I know in the end they wo n't break us ; they 'll only make us stronger .
7 . You 'll realize that you can only change yourself .
Ever seen the ' 80s sci - fi cult classic Making Mr. Right ?
When the stylish heroine , played by Ann Magnuson , is hired to teach a robot how to act like a human , she seizes the chance to create a perfect guy .
A hotshot commercial whiz , she uses her marketing prowess to shape John Malkovich 's android character into her personal version of the ideal man — sensitive , eager to please , and willing to listen .
There is a bit of that makeover fantasy in all of us — something that makes us believe we can change the person we love , make him just a little bit closer to perfect .
We may use support and empathy or shouts and ultimatums , but with dogged conviction we take on this huge responsibility , convinced we 're doing the right thing .
Whatever our motives , the effort is exhausting .
Transforming a full - grown man — stripping him of decades - old habits , beliefs , and idiosyncrasies — is truly an impossible task .
And you will come to realize , sooner than later if you 're lucky , that it is far easier to change the way you respond to him .
Here 's a perfect case in point : " I used to go off on my husband because he did n't empty the sink trap when he cleaned the kitchen , " says Kimberly Seals Allers , 36 , of Bay Shore , NY .
" It got me nowhere ; my rants only made him resentful .
Now I come home and when the kitchen looks clean , I 'm like , ' Cool , now all I have to do is empty the sink trap . ' "

8 . As you face your fears and insecurities , you will find out what you 're really made of .
I 've got issues .
Trust issues .
Control issues .
And others , I 'm sure , that I 've yet to fully discover .
I guess I 've always known I was n't perfect .
But in more than a decade of marriage , I 've been smacked upside the head with the cold , hard evidence .
There were clues when Genoveso and I were dating , especially with the trust thing .
Early on , I was supersuspicious of him .
He used to say things like , " I 'll call you at 8 . "
Then , just to try to trip me up , he 'd call at 8 .
I knew he was up to something , I just could n't figure out what .
The same kinds of experiences followed after the wedding .
Except occasionally he would actually mess up .
And I had no sense of scale when it came to rating his offenses ; everything was a major violation .
Whether he teased me about a new haircut or came home late , I seethed for days and even let thoughts of divorce creep into my head .
I figured , if he loved me — really and truly — this stuff would n't happen .
I 'd like to be able to say that this irrational behavior lasted only a few months and I eventually worked it out .
Kind of , sort of , is closer to the truth .
After years of looking deeply into my soul and talking to good friends and the best sister a girl could ever have , I 've come to recognize certain things about myself .
Not to get all Dr. Phil about it , but I 've had to examine my history with an emotionally distant dad and a strong - willed mom and face up to all the ways , both good and bad , that those relationships have affected how I approach my marriage .
I still struggle as a work in progress .
But I am completely clear in the knowledge that many of the deepest frustrations in your relationship are an opportunity for you to confront yourself .
That can be difficult to accept — after all , it 's so much more comforting to keep a running tab of your hubby 's deficits and tell yourself that his failings are the only thing standing between you and a better marriage .
But if you let it , this bumpy journey toward self - awareness can be one of the more fulfilling rewards of a committed , long - term relationship — you 'll learn to love your quirks and be compassionate toward yourself , just as you 're learning to do with him .
That 's the strange beauty of marriage :
It 's full of hard times and hard lessons that no one can ever prepare you for .
But in the end , those are the things that give richness to your life together — and make your love even deeper and stronger than when it began .

Sao Paulo Special
BBC World Service
Digital Planet 's Gareth Mitchell tests out " green " wi-fi in Sao Paulo This week BBC World Service Digital Planet programme is in Brazil .
Here the show looks at efforts to use solar power to get more people online .
While many net users in developed nations can get online pretty much anywhere thanks to reliable electricity and telecoms networks , the same is not true in developing nations where power sockets and fixed line links can be few and far between .
A project at the University of Sao Paulo aims to overcome one of these hurdles by using the sun to power a self - contained wi-fi access point .
The creators of the access - point - in - a - box hope that it will help many poor communities get free access to the net .
The project is the creation of Professor Marcelo Zuffo , Interactive Electronics Coordinator at the University of Sao Paulo , and prototypes are being tested on lamp posts dotted around the institution 's campus .
" It was designed to work in an open environment , like a forest , a park or a low - income neighbourhood , " he told BBC Digital Planet presenter Gareth Mitchell .
Inspiration
The low cost , solar - powered access point is ready as soon as it is unpacked and needs neither maintenance nor a power socket to get going .
Green wi - fi tries not to disturb the natural world that lives beside it , like bird 's nests " It is a completely autonomous wi- fi hotspot , it does n't need any internet or energy connection , " said Prof Zuffo .
" Everything comes from the sun and we have plenty of that in Brazil , " he said .
Prof Zuffo believes the self - contained unit will prove popular with schools that lack a reliable electricity source to power access points or computers that students can use to surf the web .
" One of the original motivations of this project was a high school where we deployed the internet and they do not have power plugs in their classrooms , " said Prof Zuffo .
" We came up with the idea of taking energy that is most plentiful and cheap , ie the sun , and try and transform this in bits , " he said .
" We have a solar panel , a cheap motorcycle battery and a circuit that is responsible for energy management .
The internet comes from a mesh , from different buildings , " said Professor Zuffo .
Rather than rely on dedicated connections to make a link back to the core of the net , the self - contained units form an ad hoc network and pass data between each other to connect to the larger internet .
Each unit effectively becomes a relay station for all the boxes scattered across a neighbourhood or campus .
" We can have up to two days of full internet coverage and our goal is to increase that to 10 days - so that in the rainy season and the winter - you can have the internet for free , " said Prof Zuffo .
" The natural plan is to miniaturise the system so that we can save on costs .
" So by the end you can imagine these wi- fi solar mesh devices being the size of a cellphone or playing card , " said Prof Zuffo .

Protest against government cuts in school and university research funding has escalated with mass street demonstrations and occupations spreading across the country .
Massive protests are taking place in many Italian cities and towns against Berlusconi 's government school reforms , which consist of cuts on public university and research funds , the introduction of student behavior evaluation and the separation of foreign students from the Italian ones in different classes .
For almost 1 month throughout Italy High Schools and Universities have been occupied by students and teachers , and lessons are taking place outdoors .
Massive street protests have disrupted the normal functioning of the cities .
The demonstrations are growing as they go along and this trend is expected to continue next month .
There was an assault on the Roma Film Festival as Al Pacino arrived , and on Sunday primary schools children joined the protest .
Many of the demonstrations have been of a highly creative and amusing variety .
The mainstream media has remained quite quiet on the issue , but News has been spreading via social networking and user generated content websites such as youtube .
Here are some examples :

When the speculative fever finally broke in America 's housing industry and house prices began falling in search of equilibrium levels , banks everywhere suffered defaults and subsequent losses on a range of assets .
In short order , the housing contraction morphed into a banking crisis .
Among most economists , it came as a surprise that the banking industry and , indeed , most of the financial sector , was so devoted to houses .

Georgia voters stand in line for 12 hours Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Patricia Lewis would not be deterred by an hours - long wait that kept her at the Frank Bailey Senior Center in Riverdale , Georgia deep into the night to cast her vote .
" I vote every election , and I could n't pass this one up , " she said to WSB - TV .
" I think about my dad and all the struggles that he went through , and for me to vote again ... it 's amazing . "
" I stand in long lines to shop , " she added .
" Six hours to vote ... nothing . "
Voters in Clayton County , Georgia reportedly waited in line between eight and twelve hours on Monday , in some cases into early Tuesday morning .
The county 's election supervisor Annie Bright blamed the state for the delays , citing computer problems , while the Secretary of State 's office lodged the blame back to the county .
" I feel good , " said poll worker Beatrice Lyons , who was on her 18th hour , but excited to see the turnout .
" They can just come on -- stay all night long .
I 'll be right here . "

In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act - 1984 , George Orwell
Barack Obama is leading Republican presidential rival John McCain in two battleground states , Florida and Ohio , where voters have more confidence in his ability to handle the troubled economy , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
In Ohio , a state that has been battered for years by unemployment and plant closings , the Democrat is leading McCain , 49 % to 40 % , among people likely to vote .
In Florida , a state that was considered a likely win for Republicans not long ago , McCain is trailing , 50 % to 43 % .
In both states , Obama has opened commanding leads over McCain among women , young people , first - time voters , and blacks and other minorities .

McCain still is widely viewed as far better equipped than Obama to deal with terrorism and the war in Iraq .
But voters in Ohio and Florida do not see those issues as paramount in light of the turmoil in the economy and on Wall Street .
The poll results undercut McCain ’s closing argument that Obama is no friend of working people such as Joe the Plumber -- the Ohio man who said he feared his taxes would rise if Obama were elected .
Among registered voters in Ohio , the survey found , Obama won support from 52 % of white , working - class voters , compared with 38 % for McCain .
The poll defined “ working class ” as people with no college degree and a household income of less than $ 50,000 .
“ Barack Obama understands Joe the Plumber better than John McCain , ” said Theresa Riddle , a 48 - year - old Republican in Springfield , Ohio , who participated in the survey and spoke in a follow - up interview .
“ When John McCain talks about the economy , he says nothing . ”

Others worry that Obama has too little experience to manage the far - reaching economic and financial crisis gripping the world .
“ McCain ’s been in politics ” for a long time , said Jerry Mills , a 40 - year - old welder in Edgerton , Ohio , whose wife was just laid off .
“ Obama has been on one side of the city of Chicago .
Going from Chicago to the entire U.S. is a big jump . ”
Still , Obama has apparently impressed more voters as having the temperament and personality to be president : Nearly 6 in 10 respondents in each state said the Democratic nominee was temperamentally better suited than McCain .
Both candidates have begun locking down some of their supporters in early voting in these two battlegrounds .
Among poll respondents who already have voted in Ohio , Obama has a big lead : 57 % to 35 % .
But McCain is slightly ahead in Florida among early - voting respondents , 49 % to 45 % .

The Times poll focused on Ohio and Florida because they are vote - rich states that have been closely contested and could decide the outcome of the presidential race .
The two were pivotal to the outcome of the last two presidential contests : Florida , with its dramatic recount in 2000 , was key to President Bush ’s election ; in his 2004 reelection , Ohio put him over the top with a slim 51 % - 49 % victory .
Unlike in the 2000 election , when Ralph Nader siphoned votes from Democrat Al Gore , third - party candidates are not likely to change the 2008 outcome in Florida and Ohio , the poll indicates .
When voters were asked how they would vote when presented with a five - candidate field -- including independent Nader , Libertarian Bob Barr and Green Party candidate Cynthia A. McKinney -- Obama still came out ahead of McCain , with his margin growing among Florida voters and shrinking in Ohio .
McKinney and Barr are former members of Congress .
Gloom about the economy is pervasive in Ohio .
Among registered voters polled , about 90 % say the economy is doing badly , and that affects how they size up the candidates .
Fully one - half of Ohio registered voters polled said that domestic issues such as the economy were most important in their choice of presidential candidate .
Only 16 % cited national security issues , which many see as McCain ’s strong suit .
Ohio voters polled said they trusted Obama more than McCain to make the right decisions about the economy , 50 % to 38 % .

It is hard to measure the effect of Obama ’s race .
In Florida , the poll indicates that he draws 43 % of the white vote , about the same as Sen. John F. Kerry did in 2004 .
But in Ohio , the poll shows that Obama has a lower share of the white vote : 42 % to Kerry ’s 47 % .
Jerry Mills of Edgerton , in northwest Ohio , said that being African American hurts Obama in small towns .
“ There are no blacks in this part of the state , ” he said .
“ That ’s got to go against him . ”
What is more , Obama has been dogged by a rumor that he is Muslim .
( Obama is Christian . )
The poll indicated that 7 % in each state believed he was Muslim .
Nearly half of respondents in Ohio and 44 % in Florida said they were not sure what his religion was .
Nonetheless , Obama is benefiting from the fact that voters say they are looking for a candidate who will bring change to Washington , even more than experience .
Of those who gave priority to change , 8 in 10 respondents in both states were backing Obama .

McCain has tried to distance himself from Bush and portray himself as an agent of change .
But the poll indicates he has had only limited success .
Among crucial independent voters , 47 % in Ohio and 52 % in Florida said they believed McCain would continue Bush ’s policies .
Both Obama and McCain are proving to have appeal among independent voters -- but in different places .
In Florida , Obama leads among independent respondents by 51 % to 35 % .
In Ohio , McCain leads among them , 49 % to 38 % .
Obama is leading solidly among women in both states , as he has elsewhere .
But he also is competitive among men : Florida men polled slightly favored him , 49 % to 44 % , and Ohio men gave McCain only a 44 % - 41 % edge .
An age gap also is evident : Obama dominates the 18 - 34 age group by double - digit margins .
McCain does better -- but more narrowly -- among the over - 65 crowd .
That is an especially important constituency in Florida .
Advertisement
But Obama ’s show of strength in Florida is particularly striking because Republicans long thought the state was in the bag for McCain .
Obama has poured resources into the Republican - dominated state to register tens of thousands of new voters -- and it seems to be paying off .
“ Some people were n’t inclined to vote in the past because they thought it was a slam - dunk for Republicans , ” said Virginia Fitch , 68 , in Alva , Fla .
“ People are very excited about Obama . ”
The survey was conducted Saturday through Monday under the supervision of Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus .
In Florida , 809 registered voters were interviewed , including 639 deemed likely to vote .
In Ohio , 816 registered voters were interviewed , including 644 likely voters .
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points for registered voters , plus or minus 4 points for likely voters .

For years , lawyers , family members and advocates for Donald Odoms have combed courthouse corridors and basement vaults for Exhibit 11 – the rape kit that helped send him to prison 23 years ago — only to come up empty , only to find boxes with case numbers falling digits short .
It may only be preserved in Donald Odoms ’ memory .
“ I can still see it in the DA ’s hands , ” says Odoms , now serving his 23rd year behind bars in a South Texas prison .
His lawyers say tests on the kit ’s DNA would buttress the story of family members who ’ve always sworn they were with him more than 170 miles away from Houston the morning of the rape .
“ We were in East Texas , ” his ex-wife Josie Odoms says .
“ That is the only thing that I know and stake my life on .
There ’s no ifs and maybes about it .
We were in East Texas .
I know this . ”
On an official level , silence surrounds the case .
The lead Houston police investigator , Ralph Yarborough , and the district attorney , Charles Rosenthal , refuse to talk about it .
The lab analyst , Jim Bolding , did n’t return phone calls .
The murky chain of events stretches back to Feb.
2 , 1984 , when a Texas health department inspector pulled her Mercury Cougar into the parking lot of a meat plant and a man with a knife forced his way in .
He raped her a few blocks from the plant , took $ 50 from her purse and drove away .
The victim described to police what she remembered :
Her attacker was black , mustached , about 20 years old , about 5 - foot - 9 , maybe 145 pounds .
He wore a knit cap and a green work uniform .
Though Odoms was 23 and had a mustache , he stands barely 5 - 3 .
At the hospital , nurses collected the rapist ’s semen by swabbing the victim ’s body .
The specimens then were packaged in a rape kit to be analyzed by the Houston Police Crime Lab .
Forensic tests at the time could n’t derive a rapist ’s genetic identity from his semen , only , potentially , his blood type .
But in this case , the analyst did n’t perform the blood test , reports show .
That analyst , Bolding , eventually was forced to resign as head of Houston ’s lab after a spate of flawed analyses in unrelated cases , including one linked to the false conviction of a sex - assault suspect .
Four days after the rape , Houston police found the victim ’s car , and on it the fingerprints of a career criminal named David Wilkes .
He had recently been paroled on a burglary conviction .
The car had been ditched within blocks of Wilkes ’ employer , an auto repair shop .
Wilkes was black , mustached , 24 years old , 5 - 9 and 140 pounds .
Records indicate that Houston police Sgt. Yarborough , the lead investigator , cleared him as a suspect almost immediately .
“ Checked and learned that he does not fit the description , ” Yarborough wrote , without documenting how .
He did document how Wilkes walked into the police station eager to give Yarborough a name to work with : Donald Odoms , an acquaintance from Acre ’s Home in Houston , a poor section of town where they both grew up .
Wilkes said he remembered seeing Odoms driving a white Cougar one afternoon in early February .
He said his fingerprints must have rubbed off on the car while he leaned against it to talk to Odoms .
From that point on , Odoms , then an honorably discharged Army veteran with a check - forgery conviction , would be the detective ’s main suspect .
Yarborough showed a photo spread to the rape victim .
She picked the third one — a mug shot of Odoms from his forgery case .
At the time of the rape , Odoms did n’t live in Houston , but rather in Center , Texas , a three - hour drive to the east , with his new wife , Josie , and their two young daughters .
The family shared a home with Josie ’s uncle , Horton Hatcher .
In May 1984 — three months after the rape — the couple decided to move to Houston to earn more money and live on their own .
Among their neighbors was Wilkes , whom Josie describes as “ trouble from the first time I met him . ”
He would drop by high on drugs and pocket their valuables , she recalls .
He burglarized his own sister ’s apartment nearby , Odoms says , information he passed on to Wilkes ’ sister , angering Wilkes .
There ’s another piece of information still preserved in Josie ’s memory :
Wilkes often wore a green uniform from “ Trees of Houston , ” a landscaping business where he once worked , she says .
She remembers it down to the yellow and green decal on the breast .
During the second week of May , the police knocked on their door .
“ Guns were drawn .
My children are grabbing my legs .
I said , ‘ Put the guns down !
I have two daughters here , ' ” she says .
Josie told them they had the wrong man because her husband was n’t living in Houston during the attack .
The date was fixed in her memory because she remembers Hatcher picking Odoms up for work the morning after her uncle ’s birthday party .
The police did n’t buy it , and led him off in handcuffs .
Yarborough then set up another lineup , arguably tainting the process by again placing Odoms third in the sequence .
The victim identified him a second time .
Other questionable practices put Odoms on a fast track to prison .
His defense attorney Frank Rush never investigated Wilkes and did n’t investigate blood testing of the semen that may have excluded Odoms immediately , according to records .
During trial , Odoms took the stand himself , along with Josie and his uncle Hatcher — all swearing that they were together the evening before and the morning of the rape .
But prosecutors dismissed their testimonies , arguing they were covering for each other .
Perhaps the most dramatic testimony occurred when Wilkes took the stand .
“ Do you recall what statement you made ? ” the prosecutor asked .
“ Not really , because it was n’t a true statement , ” Wilkes said .
“ It was a statement made against my will , really . ”
Wilkes went on to say that he had fingered Odoms only because Yarborough was pushing him , calling him at work and seeking a suspect ’s name to work with .
Despite Wilkes ’ about - face — and the lack of physical evidence —
Odoms got 65 years in prison .
“ The day that he was sentenced , they took everything that was good and made it bad , ” Josie said .
“ Everything that was pure became rotten . ”
By the 1990s , Odoms at Darlington Prison started hearing the buzz about DNA exonerations .
He turned his mind turned to Exhibit 11 .
“ Help me find the rape kit , ” he wrote in letters to anyone who would listen .
In 1998 , he captured the interest of New York - based Innocence Project lawyers Nina Morrison and Vanessa Potkin .
Among Potkin ’s first phone calls : to Yarborough , who , she recalls , told her that the kit had probably been destroyed .
But he offered no other information , no proof .
The protocol called for the Harris County court clerk and the lab to store evidence after trial .
For the next nine years , the attorneys and up to 10 law students would hit only dead ends .
Their letters to Odoms ended the same way .
“ I ’m truly sorry . ”
Last January , The Denver Post searched the courthouse ’s evidence rooms for the kit , also coming up empty .
The only court records available on Odoms ’ case refer to a 2000 destruction of exhibits , with no mention of Exhibit 11 .
“ They just did n’t get the right guy , ” said Nick Barzoukas , the lawyer who took over the case after the Innocence Project closed it ; the group only actively pursues cases where DNA is present .
“ Here the police had their hands on somebody who eerily fit the description .
His hands were all over the crime .
And he somehow skates on by . ”
Last May , Barzoukas submitted an inch - thick file on Odoms to the Texas Pardon and Parole Board outlining the flaws with the case and the results of a polygraph test Odoms passed with ease .
Wilkes was in the Houston city jail , charged with a string of robberies , when The Post approached him in April for comment .
He declined .

Lots of people have mentioned the loveliness of the Obama campaign logo , with its stripey field , rising sun , and handy reminder of the first letter of the candidate ’s name .
While I ’ve already spent some time analyzing and mocking the McCain campaign ’s terrible design work , something occurred to me watching another one of his angry mobs rallies on TV yesterday : his “ logo , ” a shaded 5 - pointed star , is nothing but a Zapf Dingbat .
Zapf Dingbats , for the un - font - obsessed , was one of the original “ symbol ” fonts ; instead of letters , typing on your keyboard gets you various shapes and doodads to spice up your PowerPoint presentation –snowflakes , squares , check - marks , and yes , stars .
So , which letter do you think one must type while using the Zapf Dingbats font to create McCain ’s star , my friends ?
That ’s right : his crack team of designers came across this patriotic symbol by typing shift - O .
After the jump , the Zapf Dingbats character map , just as proof .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Sept. 30 - Oct. 2 has Barack Obama leading John McCain by seven percentage points , 49 % to 42 % .
Obama has held a statistically significant lead over McCain for each of the past seven days , ranging from four to eight points .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Most of the interviewing in today 's three - day rolling average was conducted before Thursday night 's vice presidential debate between Sen.
Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin .
Saturday 's tracking results will begin to show any impact the heavily watched face - off may have had on voter preferences for president .
Voters ' mindsets about the election in the coming days could also be influenced by the new Labor Department report out today , showing a bigger job loss in September than many analysts had predicted .
The pattern of voter preferences in September -- with McCain 's post -Republican convention lead slipping away after the extraordinary Wall Street failures that began in mid-September , and Obama 's lead expanding to as much as eight points -- suggests that Obama has benefited from Americans ' intensified economic anxiety during this period .
Obama 's advantage on this issue was evident in Gallup 's post - presidential debate polling on Sept. 27 , when the poll found Obama receiving much better scores from debate watchers for his performance on the economy than McCain .
The troubling new jobs report will most likely only reinforce , if not deepen , Americans ' economic concern in the coming days .
McCain and Obama 's presidential debate this Tuesday could thus prove to be a critical opportunity for Obama to either cement his advantage on the economy , or for McCain to turn it around .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Sept. 30 - Oct 2 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,728 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The Coca -Cola Co. , the world 's biggest beverage company , moved to expand its operations in the fast - growing Chinese market Wednesday with a US $ 2.5 billion bid for major juicemaker China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd .
Anzeige
Under the deal , Coca - Cola 's wholly - owned subsidiary Atlantic Industries would purchase the Chinese company 's shares for HK $ 12.20 ( US $ 1.56 ) each , almost triple their last closing price , the companies said in a joint statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange .
That would value the Beijing - based juice producer at around HK $ 17.9 billion ( US $ 2.3 billion ) .
Coca - Cola also offered to pay for all outstanding convertible bonds and options , bringing the total amount of the deal to as much as HK $ 19.6 billion ( around US $ 2.51 billion ) .
According to research firm Dealogic , it is the largest - ever deal in China 's food and beverage industry .
Anzeige
If approved by regulators , the acquisition would mark Coca - Cola 's biggest in China since it began operating in the country in 1979 and increase its share in the beverage market .
Huiyuan is China 's leading maker of pure fruit juices and nectars with about 31 production facilities .
„ This acquisition will deliver value to our shareholders and provide a unique opportunity to strengthen our business in China , “ Coca - Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said .
Anzeige
In particular , the U.S. company would bring a sprawling distribution and supply network along with management and strategies that could help develop Huiyuan 's brand .
„ There are anticipated synergies that will drive operational and cost efficiencies , particularly in Huiyuan 's production footprint and in The Coca - Cola Company 's distribution and raw material purchasing capabilities , “ the companies said in their statement to the exchange .
Already , Huiyuan has secured „ irrevocable undertakings “ from three large shareholders , accounting for 66 percent of the company 's shares , to accept the deal , the companies said .
Anzeige
Huiyuan shares , down more than 50 percent this year , jumped to HK$ 11.10 early Wednesday , suggesting investors believe the deal will go through .

. NET 1.1+ . NET 1.1 + Check if an Enumeration Value is Defined by Richard Carr , published at http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/EnumIsDefined.aspx
Variables that are declared as enumerated types can contain values that are not defined within the related enumeration .
Sometimes it is necessary to check whether a numeric value or a name exists within the list of constants .
This tip explains how .
Enum .
IsDefined Method
The Enum class is the base type for all enumerated types .
It contains a set of methods that can be used to process and query enumerations .
One of the static methods of this class is named " IsDefined " .
This method tests if a particular value or name is defined within an enumeration 's list of constants .
The IsDefined method requires two parameters .
The first parameter is the type of the enumeration to be checked .
This type is usually obtained using a typeof expression .
The second parameter is defined as a basic object .
It is used to specify either the integer value or a string containing the name of the constant to find .
The return value is a Boolean that is true if the value exists and false if it does not .
Testing for Integer Values
The following example shows a sample enumeration and two IsDefined checks .
One check looks for a valid value and the other for a non-existent constant :
enum Status { OK = 0 , Warning = 64 , Error = 256 } static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { bool exists ; exists = Enum.
IsDefined ( typeof ( Status ) , 0 ) ; // exists = true exists = Enum . IsDefined ( typeof ( Status ) , 1 ) ; // exists = false }
Testing for Constant Names
The second example shows two further IsDefined checks .
This time the name of the constant is passed to the method within a string .
The enumeration declaration is omitted , as it is the same as in the previous sample :
exists = Enum. IsDefined ( typeof( Status ) , " OK " ) ; // exists = true exists = Enum . IsDefined ( typeof ( Status ) , " NotOK " ) ; // exists = false
NB : The test is case - sensitive .
In the example , checking for " ok " will return false .
Limitations
When using an enumeration that holds a bit field , you cannot check for a value that is a combination of two or more constants .
If the specified number or string does not exist as a single constant , the return value will be false .
Check HBOS 's share price See Lloyds TSB 's shares Robert Peston on the HBOS deal Lloyds TSB is in advanced merger talks with HBOS to create a UK retail banking giant worth £ 30bn , the BBC has learned .
A deal would end uncertainty about the strength of Halifax - Bank of Scotland after a run on its shares .
The government has also said it will over - rule any concerns that competition authorities may raise , BBC Business Editor Robert Peston has learned .
He added the prime minister was involved in negotiating the deal , which has the blessing of UK authorities .
HBOS and Lloyds have declined to comment .
The advanced talks are being encouraged by both the Treasury and Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) as a deal will ease concerns about the health of the UK banking sector , our business editor added .
Global turmoil
The credit crunch has wreaked havoc on some of the world 's financial institutions in recent days .
Barclays
Bank is to buy some Lehman Brothers assets after the fourth - largest US investment bank , filed for bankruptcy protection , dealing a blow to the fragile global financial system .
The US Treasury stepped in with an $ 85 bn rescue package to bail out AIG amid fears the group , once the world 's largest insurer , could face collapse .
Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch in a $ 50bn deal - making the Merrill the third top US investment banks to fall prey to the sub - prime crisis within six months .
In Russia , trading on the country 's main stock exchanges was halted after steep falls this week .
Meanwhile , in the UK recent economic news has done little to lift the gloom , with unemployment rising once again as the number of job vacancies fell .
Deal welcomed
It was not in the government 's interest for there to be the faintest risk that it would have another Northern Rock on its hands
Robert Peston , BBC Business Editor Understanding credit crunch jargon Q&A : HBOS - Lloyds TSB deal
Our business editor said there was a real concern that any run on HBOS shares would create enough fear among the bank 's financiers - providers of wholesale credit who give the bank its money - for there to be a withdrawal of credit for HBOS .
" Clearly the watchdog and Treasury will welcome a deal as it will put the bank on a sounder footing , " he said .
" The last thing they want is a fully fledged crisis . "
He added that the deal was negotiated at a very high level , with Prime Minister Gordon Brown telling Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank that it would helpful if Lloyds could end the uncertainty surrounding HBOS by buying it .
" It was not in the government 's interest for there to be the faintest risk that it would have another Northern Rock on its hands , " he added .
Competition concerns Fears had been voiced that the proposed deal would face objections from competition watchdogs over the combined market share the enlarged group would have in mortgages and savings .
HBOS customers give their views about the bank and the merger talks
In pictures
However , the government has since said it would over - ride the powers of the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission to push the deal through " in the interests of financial stability " , our business editor said .
In an effort to avoid this potential stumbling block , the Treasury and the Bank of England have not been asked to help support the deal using taxpayers ' money .
HBOS and Lloyds are instead relying on the Bank to push through a permanent successor to its current Special Liquidity Scheme , which lets lenders swap potentially risky mortgage debts for secure government bonds .
On the London market , HBOS shares have seen wild swings during morning trading , climbing as high as 220 p and falling as low as 88 p .
Sounder footing A buyout would create a banking giant that would be able to cope with the current crisis hitting financial markets across the globe .
While Lloyds would gain access to a larger share of the UK mortgage market , it would also be a case of " the bigger the better " as it would leave the enlarged bank on a sounder financial footing .
HBOS , which was created by the merger of the Halifax and Bank of Scotland in 2001 , has come under pressure in recent days amid concerns about its exposure to the US sub - prime market .
Questions have been raised about whether it will be able to refinance its debt of more than £ 100 m in coming months .
HBOS is the largest mortgage lender in the UK and has been hit by recent weakness in the property market .
It also borrows a large proportion of its funding from the wholesale money markets where available funding has been drying up .
While the firm itself has offered reassurances about its financial health , the FSA has also moved to reassure the market saying the bank is " a well - capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way " .
Consolidation
" It is interesting to see this as an indication of the consolidation into the financial system , " said finance expert Dr Paolo Subacchi , of think - tank Chatham House .
" We are clearly through a phase of restructuring and consolidation and the fact that two big players in the market are signalling their intention to merge is another sign that we are going in that direction . "
James Ferguson from the stockbrokers Pali International added that the deal was a " second bite of the apple " for Lloyds as it had signalled its interest in taking over Northern Rock when the lender ran into trouble last year .

CANBERRA ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The Internet is not just changing the way people live but altering the way our brains work with a neuroscientist arguing this is an evolutionary change which will put the tech - savvy at the top of the new social order .
A Chinese girl looks at a computer screen while having her lunch at an internet cafe in Shanghai February 15 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Aly Song
Gary Small , a neuroscientist at UCLA in California who specializes in brain function , has found through studies that Internet searching and text messaging has made brains more adept at filtering information and making snap decisions .
But while technology can accelerate learning and boost creativity it can have drawbacks as it can create Internet addicts whose only friends are virtual and has sparked a dramatic rise in Attention Deficit Disorder diagnoses .
Small , however , argues that the people who will come out on top in the next generation will be those with a mixture of technological and social skills .
“ We ’re seeing an evolutionary change .
The people in the next generation who are really going to have the edge are the ones who master the technological skills and also face - to - face skills , ” Small told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ They will know when the best response to an email or Instant Message is to talk rather than sit and continue to email . ”
In his newly released fourth book “ iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind , ” Small looks at how technology has altered the way young minds develop , function and interpret information .
Small , the director of the Memory & Aging Research Center at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior and the Center on Aging at UCLA , said the brain was very sensitive to the changes in the environment such as those brought by technology .
He said a study of 24 adults as they used the Web found that experienced Internet users showed double the activity in areas of the brain that control decision - making and complex reasoning as Internet beginners .
“ The brain is very specialized in its circuitry and if you repeat mental tasks over and over it will strengthen certain neural circuits and ignore others , ” said Small .
“ We are changing the environment .
The average young person now spends nine hours a day exposing their brain to technology .
Evolution is an advancement from moment to moment and what we are seeing is technology affecting our evolution . ”
Small said this multi-tasking could cause problems .
He said the tech - savvy generation , whom he calls “ digital natives , ” are always scanning for the next bit of new information which can create stress and even damage neural networks .
“ There is also the big problem of neglecting human contact skills and losing the ability to read emotional expressions and body language , ” he said .
“ But you can take steps to address this .
It means taking time to cut back on technology , like having a family dinner , to find a balance .
It is important to understand how technology is affecting our lives and our brains and take control of it . ”
The boss of a successful US hedge fund has quit the industry with an extraordinary farewell letter dismissing his rivals as over - privileged " idiots " and thanking " stupid " traders for making him rich .
Andrew Lahde's $ 80 m Los Angeles - based firm Lahde Capital Management made a huge return last year by betting against subprime mortgages .
Yesterday the 37 - year - old told his clients that he had hated the business and had only been in it for the money .
And after declaring he would no longer manage money for other people , because he had enough of his own , Lahde said that instead he intended to repair his stress - damaged health ; he made it clear he would not miss the financial world .
" The low - hanging fruit , ie idiots whose parents paid for prep school , Yale and then the Harvard MBA , was there for the taking , " he wrote .
" These people who were ( often ) truly not worthy of the education they received ( or supposedly received ) rose to the top of companies such as AIG , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government , " he said .
" All of this behaviour supporting the aristocracy only ended up making it easier for me to find people stupid enough to take the other side of my trades .
God bless America . "
Lahde became one of the biggest names in the investment industry when one of his funds produced a return of 866 % last year , largely by forecasting the US home loans industry would collapse .
In his farewell letter , which concluded with an appeal for the legalisation of marijuana , Lahde said he was happy with his rewards and did not envy those who had made even more money .
" I will let others try to amass nine , 10 or 11 figure net worths .
Meanwhile , their lives suck , " he wrote , citing a life of back - to - back business appointments relieved only by a two - week annual holiday in which financiers are still " glued to their Blackberries " .
Lahde 's retirement came amid an implosion among the hedge fund industry - some 350 of the funds have liquidated this year , according to Hedge Fund Research .
His final words of advice ?
" Throw the Blackberry away and enjoy life . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson certainly has his Democratic detractors , but they are n’t the only ones who have some serious doubts about his controversial $ 700 - billion bailout plan .
In an appearance on ABC ’s “ This Week With George Stephanopolous ” on Sunday , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich blasted Paulson ’s plan , calling it “ un- American ” and even opining that Paulson should have resigned .
ABC News ’ “ Political Radar ” blog :
Gingrich even expressed concern with Paulson ’s connections to Wall Street .
The treasury secretary served as the chairman of a major global investment banking and securities firm before joining the Bush administration .
“ You have the former Chairman of Goldman Sachs asking for 700 billion dollars , and in his initial request , asking for it in such an un-American way that I think he should have resigned , ” said Gingrich .
“ I think Paulson has terminally misunderstood the nature of the American system .
Not just no review , no judicial review , no congressional accountability .
Give me 700 billion dollars , 700 BILLION dollars !
‘ I ’ll be glad to spend it for you . ’
That ’s a centralization of power that is totally un-American . ”

As anticipated , Muxtape was unable to maintain its original form under assault from the RIAA and slow moving legal negotiations with the labels .
The first red flag came in August .
Up until then all the discussion had been about numbers , but as we closed in on an agreement the talk shifted to things like guaranteed placement and “ marketing opportunities . ”
I was denied the possibility of releasing a mobile version of Muxtape .
My flexibility was being constricted .
I had been worried about Muxtape getting a fair deal , but my biggest concern all along was maintaing the integrity and experience of the site ( one of the reasons I wanted to license in the first place ) .
Now it was n’t so simple ; I had agreed to a variety of encroachments into Muxtape ’s financials because I wanted to play ball , but giving up any kind of editorial or creative control was something I had a much harder time swallowing .
Instead , the site will become more of a stripped - down MySpace for bands wanting to put their music online .
Disappointing because Muxtape , as originally conceived , was obviously what everyone but the “ music industry ” wanted .
Some of that simplistic magic will likely transfer over to the new incarnation but it wo n’t be as cool as mix tapes for your pals .
( thx , mark )
Update :
For posterity , I ’m pasting Justin ’s whole note in here .
I love music .
I believe that for people who love music , the desire to share it is innate and crucial for music itself .
When we find a song we love , we beckon our friends over to the turntable , we loan them the CD , we turn up the car stereo , we put it on a mixtape .
We do this because music makes us feel and we want someone else to feel it , too .
The story of Muxtape began when I had a weekly show at my university ’s radio station in Oregon .
In addition to keeping the station ’s regular log I compiled my playlists into a web page , with each show represented by a simple block that corresponded to a cassette recording for that week .
At the time , mixtapes were already well into their twilight , but long after my show ended I could n’t stop thinking about how the playlist page served a similar purpose , and in many ways served it better .
Like a mixtape , each playlist was a curated group that was greater than the sum of its parts .
Unlike a mixtape , it was n’t constrained by any physical boundaries of dissemination , but … it also did n’t contain any actual music .
Someone might come across the page and smile knowingly at the songs they knew , but shifting the burden of actually compiling the mix to its intended listener defeated the purpose entirely .
Five years later , internet technology had advanced significantly .
I was working on experimental user interfaces for web sites when I started thinking about that playlist page again , and ultimately set out to bring it to life .
My desire to share music ( in the mixtape sense ) had n’t gone anywhere , but the channels to do so were becoming extinct .
Popular blogging services allow you to post audio files in an ephemeral sort of way , but it was n’t the context I was looking for .
A physical cassette tape in your hands has such an insistent aesthetic ; just holding one makes you want to find a tape player to fulfill its destiny .
My goal with Muxtape ’s design was to translate some of that tactility into the digital world , to build a context around the music that gave it a little extra spark of life and made the holder anxious to listen .
The first version was a one - page supplement to my tumblr , and was more or less identical to what it would become later .
The feedback was great , and the number one question rapidly became “ can you make one for me , too ? ”
At first I started thinking about ways I could package the source code , but the more I thought about it the more it seemed like massively wasted potential .
Distributing the source would mean limiting access to the small niche of people who operate their own web server , whereas I wanted to make something that was accessible to anyone who loves music .
The natural conclusion was a centralized service , which suddenly unfolded whole other dimensions of possibility for serendipitous music discovery .
What seemed before like the hollow shell of a mixtape now seemed like its evolution .
I knew I had to try building it .
Three weeks of long nights later , I launched Muxtape .
It was successful very quickly .
8,685 users registered in the first 24 hours , 97,748 in the first month with 1.2 million unique visitors and a healthy growth rate .
Lots of press .
Rampant speculation .
Tech rags either lauded it or declared it an instant failure .
Everyone was excited .
I was thrilled .
There was a popular misconception that Muxtape only survived because it was “ flying under the radar , ” and the moment the major labels found out about it it ’d be shut down .
In actuality , the labels and the RIAA read web sites like everyone else , and I heard from them both within a week or so .
An RIAA notice arrived in triplicate , via email , registered mail , and FedEx overnight ( with print and CD versions ) .
They demanded that I take down six specific muxtapes they felt were infringing , so I did .
Around the same time I got a call from the VP of anti-piracy at one of the majors .
After I picked up the phone his first words were , “ Justin , I just have one question for you : where do I send the summons and complaint ? ”
The conversation picked up from there .
There was no summons , it was an intimidation tactic setting the tone for the business development meeting he was proposing , the true reason for the call .
Around the same time another one of the big four ’s business developers reached out to me , too .
I spent the next month listening .
I talked to a lot of very smart lawyers and other people whose opinions on the matter I respected , trying to gain a consensus for Muxtape ’s legality .
The only consensus seemed to be that there was no consensus .
I had two dozen slightly different opinions that ran the gamut from “ Muxtape is 100 % legal and you ’re on solid ground , ” to “ Muxtape is a cesspool of piracy and I hope you ’re ready for a hundred million dollar lawsuit and a stint at Riker’s . ”
In the end , Muxtape ’s legality was moot .
I did n’t have any money to defend against a lawsuit , just or not , so the major labels had an ax over my head either way .
I always told myself I ’d remove any artist or label that contacted me and objected , no questions asked .
Not a single one ever did .
On the contrary , every artist I heard from was a fan of the site and excited about its possibilities .
I got calls from the marketing departments of big labels whose corporate parents were supposed to be outraged , wanting to know how they get could their latest acts on the home page .
Smaller labels wanted to feature their content in other creative ways .
It seemed obvious Muxtape had value for listeners and artists alike .
In May I had my first meeting with a major label , Universal Music Group .
I went alone and prepared myself for the worst , having spent the last decade toeing the indie party line that the big labels were hopelessly obstinate luddites with no idea what was good for them .
I ’m here to tell you now that the labels understand their business a lot better than most people suspect , although they each have their own surprisingly distinct personality when it comes to how they approach the future .
The gentlemen I met at Universal were incredibly receptive and tactful ; I did n’t have to sell them on why Muxtape was good for them , they knew it was cool and just wanted to get paid .
I sympathized with that .
I told them I needed some time to get a proposal together and we left things in limbo .
A few weeks later I had a meeting with EMI , the character of which was much different .
I walked into a conference room and shook eight or nine hands , sitting down at a conference table with a phonebook - thick file labeled “ Muxtape ” laying on it .
The people I met formed a semi-circle around me like a split brain , legal on one side and business development on the other .
The meeting alternated between an intense grilling from the legal side ( “ you are a willful infringer and we are mere hours from shutting you down ” ) and an awkward discussion with the business side ( “ assuming we do n’t shut you down , how do you see us working together ? ” ) .
I asked for two weeks to make a proposal , they gave me two days .
I had to make a decision .
As I saw it I had three options .
The first was to just shut everything down , which I never really considered .
The second was to ban major label content entirely , which might have solved the immediate crisis , but had two strong points against it .
The first , most visibly , was that it would prevent people from using the majority of available music in their mixes .
The second was that it did nothing to address the deeper questions surrounding ownership and usage for everyone else who was n’t a major label : mid-size labels and independent artists who have just as fundamental a right to address how their content is used as a large corporation , even if they do n’t carry quite as big a stick .
The third option was to approach a fully licensed model , which I had been edging toward since I met with Universal .
I knew other licensed services so far had met with mixed success , but I also knew Muxtape was different and that it was at least worth exploring .
The question about whether or not the labels saw value in it had been answered , the new question was how much it was going to cost .
It was June .
I approached a Fifth Ave law firm about representing me in licensing negotiations with the major labels , and they took me on .
Two weeks later I met with all four , flanked by lawyers this time , and started the slow process of working out a deal .
The first round of terms were stiff and complex , but not nearly as bad as I ’d imagined , and I managed to convince them that allowing Muxtape to continue to operate was in everyone ’s best interest .
Things were going well .
I spent the next two months talking with investors , designing the next phases of the site itself , and supervising the negotiations .
A big concern was getting a deal that took into consideration the fact that Muxtape was n’t a straightforward on - demand service , and should pay accordingly less than a service that was .
Another reason I liked the licensing option from the outset was that it seemed like an uncommon win-win ; I did n’t want the ability to search and stream any song at any given notice , and they were reluctant to offer it ( for the price , anyway ) .
Muxtape ’s unusual limitations were its strength in more ways than one .
The first red flag came in August .
Up until then all the discussion had been about numbers , but as we closed in on an agreement the talk shifted to things like guaranteed placement and “ marketing opportunities . ”
I was denied the possibility of releasing a mobile version of Muxtape .
My flexibility was being constricted .
I had been worried about Muxtape getting a fair deal , but my biggest concern all along was maintaing the integrity and experience of the site ( one of the reasons I wanted to license in the first place ) .
Now it was n’t so simple ; I had agreed to a variety of encroachments into Muxtape ’s financials because I wanted to play ball , but giving up any kind of editorial or creative control was something I had a much harder time swallowing .
I was wrestling with this when , on August 15th , I received notice from Amazon Web Services ( the platform that hosts Muxtape ’s servers and files ) that they had received a complaint from the RIAA .
Per Amazon ’s terms , I had one business day to remove an incredibly long list of songs or face having my servers shut down and data deleted .
This came as a big surprise to me , as I ’d been thinking that I had n’t heard from the RIAA in a long time because I had an understanding with the labels .
I had a panicked exchange of emails with Amazon , trying to explain that I was in the middle of a licensing deal , that I suspected it was a clerical error , and that I was doing everything I could to get someone to vouch for me on a summer Friday afternoon .
My one business day extended over the weekend , and on Monday when I was n’t able to produce the documentation Amazon wanted ( or even get someone from the RIAA on the phone ) , the servers were shut down and I was locked out of the account .
I moved the domain name to a new server with a short message and the very real expectation that I could get it sorted out .
I still thought it was all just a big mistake .
I was wrong .
Over the next week I learned a little more , mainly that the RIAA moves quite autonomously from their label parents and that the understanding I had with them did n’t necessarily carry over .
I also learned that none of the labels were especially interested in helping me out , and from their perspective it had no bearing on the negotiations .
I disagreed .
The deals were still weeks or months away ( an eternity on the internet ) meaning that at best , Muxtape was going to be down until the end of year .
There was also still the matter of how to pay for it ; getting investment is hard enough in this volatile space even with a wildly successful and growing web site , it became an entirely different proposition with no web site at all .
And so I made one of the hardest decisions I ’ve ever faced : I walked away from the licensing deals .
They had become too complex for a site founded on simplicity , too restrictive and hostile to continue to innovate the way I wanted to .
They ’d already taken so much attention away from development that I started to question my own motivations .
I did n’t get into this to build a big company as fast as I could no matter what the cost , I got into this to make something simple and beautiful for people who love music , and I plan to continue doing that .
As promised , the site is coming back , but not as you ’ve known .
I ’m taking a feature that was in development in the early stages and making it the new central focus .
Muxtape is relaunching as a service exclusively for bands , offering an extremely powerful platform with unheard - of simplicity for artists to thrive on the internet .
Musicians in 2008 without access to a full time web developer have few options when it comes to establishing themselves online , but their needs often revolve around a common set of problems .
The new Muxtape will allow bands to upload their own music and offer an embeddable player that works anywhere on the web , in addition to the original muxtape format .
Bands will be able to assemble an attractive profile with simple modules that enable optional functionality such as a calendar , photos , comments , downloads and sales , or anything else they need .
The system has been built from the ground up to be extended infinitely and is wrapped in a template system that will be open to CSS designers .
There will be more details soon .
The beta is still private at the moment , but that will change in the coming weeks .
I realize this is a somewhat radical shift in functionality , but Muxtape ’s core goals have n’t changed .
I still want to challenge the way we experience music online , and I still want to work to enable what I think is the most interesting aspect of interconnected music : discovering new stuff .
Thank to you everyone who made Muxtape the incredible place it was in its first phase , it could n’t have happened without your mixes .
The industry will catch up some day , it pretty much has to .

Have you noticed how environmental campaigners almost inevitably say that not only is global warming happening and bad , but also that what we are seeing is even worse than expected ?
This is odd , because any reasonable understanding of how science proceeds would expect that , as we refine our knowledge , we find that things are sometimes worse and sometimes better than we expected , and that the most likely distribution would be about 50 - 50 .
Environmental campaigners , however , almost invariably see it as 100-0 .
If we are regularly being surprised in just one direction , if our models get blindsided by an ever - worsening reality , that does not bode well for our scientific approach .
Indeed , one can argue that if the models constantly get something wrong , it is probably because the models are wrong .
And if we cannot trust our models , we cannot know what policy action to take if we want to make a difference .
Yet , if new facts constantly show us that the consequences of climate change are getting worse and worse , high - minded arguments about the scientific method might not carry much weight .
Certainly , this seems to be the prevailing bet in the spin on global warming .
It is , again , worse than we thought , and , despite our failing models , we will gamble on knowing just what to do : cut CO2 emissions dramatically .
But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected ; in many respects , they are spot on , or even better than expected .
That we hear otherwise is an indication of the media 's addiction to worst - case stories , but that makes a poor foundation for smart policies .
The most obvious point about global warming is that the planet is heating up .
It has warmed about 1C ( 1.8 F ) over the past century , and is predicted by the United Nations ' climate panel ( IPCC ) to warm between 1.6-3.8C ( 2.9 - 6.8 F ) during this century , mainly owing to increased CO2 .
An average of all 38 available standard runs from the IPCC shows that models expect a temperature increase in this decade of about 0.2C .
But this is not at all what we have seen .
And this is true for all surface temperature measures , and even more so for both satellite measures .
Temperatures in this decade have not been worse than expected ; in fact , they have not even been increasing .
They have actually decreased by between 0.01 and 0.1C per decade .
On the most important indicator of global warming , temperature development , we ought to hear that the data are actually much better than expected .
Likewise , and arguably much more importantly , the heat content of the world 's oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements .
Whereas energy in terms of temperature can disappear relatively easily from the light atmosphere , it is unclear where the heat from global warming should have gone – and certainly this is again much better than expected .
We hear constantly about how the Arctic sea ice is disappearing faster than expected , and this is true .
But most serious scientists also allow that global warming is only part of the explanation .
Another part is that the so - called Arctic oscillation of wind patterns over the Arctic Ocean is now in a state that it does not allow build - up of old ice , but immediately flushes most ice into the North Atlantic .
More importantly , we rarely hear that the Antarctic sea ice is not only not declining , but is above average for the past year .
IPCC models would expect declining sea ice in both hemispheres but , whereas the Arctic is doing worse than expected , Antarctica is doing better .
Ironically , the Associated Press , along with many other news outlets , told us in 2007 that the " Arctic is screaming , " and that the Northwest Passage was open " for the first time in recorded history . "
Yet the BBC reported in 2000 that the fabled Northwest Passage was already without ice .
We are constantly inundated with stories of how sea levels will rise , and how one study after another finds that it will be much worse than what the IPCC predicts .
But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea - level increase of 18 - 59 cm ( 7 - 23 in ) this century .
This is of course why the thousands of IPCC scientists projected that range .
Yet studies claiming one metre or more obviously make for better headlines .
Since 1992 , we have had satellites measuring the rise in global sea levels , and they have shown a stable increase of 3.2 mm per year ( 1/8 of an inch ) – spot on compared to the IPCC projection .
Moreover , over the last two years , sea levels have not increased at all – actually , they show a slight drop .
Should we not be told that this is much better than expected ?
Hurricanes were the stock image of Al Gore 's famous film on climate change , and certainly the United States was battered in 2004 and 2005 , leading to wild claims of ever stronger and costlier storms in the future .
But in the two years since , the costs have been well below average , virtually disappearing in 2006 .
That is definitely better than expected .
Gore quoted MIT hurricane researcher Kerry Emmanuel to support an alleged scientific consensus that global warming is making hurricanes much more damaging .
But Emmanuel has now published a new study showing that even in a dramatically warming world , hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries .
That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media .
Of course , not all things are less bad than we thought .
But one - sided exaggeration is not the way forward .
We urgently need balance if we are to make sensible choices .

Due to an editing error in this article the extent of the decrease in global temperature was given as between 0.01C and 0.1C per year , rather than per decade .
This has been corrected .
LITTLE ROCK , Ark .
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s most loyal supporters here say they have a new reason to back the man who dashed her presidential hopes :
They want Sen. Barack Obama to appoint her to the U.S. Supreme Court if he wins the White House .
“ I would have liked to see her win , but I ’m not wistful , ” said Grace Block , 77 .
“ We ’d love to see her on the Supreme Court if he would ask her . ”
Voters attending Mrs. Clinton ’s homecoming rally , a campaign event for her one - time rival , said they will now back Mr. Obama , and most of them , unprompted , told The Washington Times they want him to choose their former first lady for the high court .
“ Having her on the Supreme Court would help us a lot .
She could make sure we cement Roe v. Wade , ” said Judi Woods , a Little Rock supporter who campaigned for Mrs. Clinton across the country during the prolonged primary .
The last time Mrs. Clinton was in Little Rock in January , before the Super Tuesday primaries , she was lauded by locals as the woman who would remember Arkansas when - not if - she reached the White House .
During the rally Friday on the steps of the state Capitol here , Gov. Mike Beebe introduced Mrs. Clinton as “ Arkansas ’ First Lady , ” and noted her 69 percent Feb.
5 victory , her largest primary margin .
“ Senator Obama , we brought with us a special person , ” Mr. Beebe said .
“ It ’s somebody you know well because she took you all the way to the mat … somebody who will be an ally for you in the halls of the United States Senate , speaking out with a voice loud and clear for those who could otherwise not speak for themselves . ”
Mrs. Clinton also nodded to her own primary showing as an “ unbelievable percentage , ” thanking her old friends who worked on her behalf .
“ But I am here today to ask you , ask all of you who worked for me , all of you who voted for me , to do the same for Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the next weeks , ” she said .
She modified a line she used to promote her own candidacy .
“ I remember very well it took a Democrat who used to serve in this Capitol to clean up after the first Bush , and it ’s going to take a Democrat to clean up after this Bush , ” she said , the same quote she used during the primary , except she would substitute “ Clinton ” for the word “ Democrat . ”
The small change of rhetoric was a symbol of the great shift in her role since Mr. Obama clinched the Democratic nomination .
Now the election ’s outcome will determine how Mrs. Clinton , 60 , will be viewed by Democrats and the nation , along with her political legacy .
“ She is a good senator , but she ’s on a different level now , ” said Gary Green of Little Rock .
“ She ’s got a great future . ”
If she ’s interested in the Supreme Court nomination , Mrs. Clinton , with four years left in her current Senate term , offered no hints .
When thanking the members of the congressional delegation at the rally , she declared : “ I look forward to serving with them for years to come . ”
The Obama campaign declined to comment for this article .
Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant dismissed the hypothetical , since he thinks Sen. John McCain will win Nov. 4 , but mocked the idea of Justice Clinton since Mr. Obama “ did n’t think enough of Hillary Clinton to even consider her for a spot on his ticket . ”
Republicans exploit lingering Clinton - Obama primary wounds , but supporters seem to have left hard feelings behind .
“ I was supportive of Hillary , but we ’re going to move right on to him , ” said rally attendee Sue McDonald .
“ We need a change , and both of them stood for that . ”
Mrs. Clinton has attended more than 50 events for the Democratic ticket - including a rally in Scranton , Penn. , with former President Bill Clinton , who told voters they had just celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary .
Mrs. Clinton received a warm welcome in Pennsylvania , another state she dominated during the primary , while making the case for Mr. Obama .
“ I have n’t spent 35 years in the trenches fighting for universal health care , for children , for families , for women , for middle - class people to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our nation and the hopes of our people , ” she said .
Some of her Arkansas supporters said she should try again for the White House .
“ It is kind of sad to see her in this different role , and I ’m sure she felt it , too , ” said Sharon Ursery , who hopes Mrs. Clinton will give the White House another try in 2016 .
“ Her being here is very gracious .
It shows what a good sport she is . ”
Not everyone is moving on , though .
A September national poll showed more than one - third of Clinton voters were n’t sold on Mr. Obama .
An Arkansas Obama volunteer said a house on her block once displayed a “ Hillary ” sign , but the front yard now proclaims support for Mr. McCain .
“ My next - door neighbors said they are not voting because Hillary did n’t win , and I thought that was the stupidest thing I ’ve ever heard , ” Ms. Block said .

Could Linux users one day play native ports of Half - Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 the same way they can Enemy Territory : Quake Wars today ?
According to Phoronix , that may very well be so .
The site says it has " received information " that confirms Valve ’s plans to port its Source game engine to Linux .
Valve first hinted at those plans last year , when it put up a job posting for a Senior Software Engineer .
One of the items under the list of tasks required from the candidate was , " Port Windows - based games to the Linux platform . "
Since then , game studio Running With Scissors has announced that its Source - based shooter Postal III will come out for Linux and Mac OS X .
Both of those operating systems have Unix - like underpinnings , and they would both require a version of the Source engine based on the OpenGL graphics API instead of Microsoft ’s Direct3D .
As Phoronix points out , Valve could find a market for its games on the Linux platform , too .
CodeWeavers , a developer that writes Windows compatibility software for the open - source operating system , ranks Valve ’s Steam game distribution app first in its " top 25 " of software Linux users wish to run .
Microsoft ’s Office 2003 is ranked second , with Apple ’s iTunes coming in third .
This scandal is as easy to follow as it is transparently outrageous .
Since choosing her as VP , the McCain campaign has been trying it 's hardest to make the case that as " Commander in Chief " of the Alaskan National Guard , Sarah Palin has relevant national security experience .
On August 31 , the actual commander of the Alaska National Guard -- Major General Craig Campbell -- punctured a hole in that meme when the AP reported Campbell saying :
" [ Palin plays ] no role in national defense activities , even when they involve the Alaska National Guard . "
On September 3 , Campbell went even further , saying :
" The Alaskan governor is not in the site 's chain of command and has no authority over its operations . "
Realizing that Campbell was severely undercutting one of the campaign 's main talking points , it appears someone leaned on him and got him to change his tune ... on FOX News :
" In the last few days , I 've been watching the press , and I 've not been very pleased with what I 've been seeing about the chastising of the National Guard by having it diminished by the insinuation that a commander - in - chief of the National Guard does n't really control the military .
The National Guard has 500,000 people in it around this great country , serving in states and overseas .
National Guards are state military forces run by governors , and Sarah Palin does it great . "
Now , for being a good soldier , Campbell has gotten a major promotion .
Change we can believe in , huh ?
VetVoice has much more .
Believe it or not , this actually is n't the first power - generating dance floor to harness some of the pent up energy of club - goers , but it is apparently the first one to hit the UK , and hopefully a sign of more to come .
As you can see above , the dance floor makes use of a piezoelectric system that produces electricity as the dancers jump up and down , which charges some batteries that are used to power parts of the club .
While that 's certainly a practical application for the technology , we 're guessing it 's only a matter of time before some enterprising club owner combines one of these with an LED dance floor to create a dance floor that powers itself , and thumbs its nose at other do - gooder clubs .

The Ultimate Speed Bump
The local government in ShanXi province , China , decided they had enough of people speeding on their highways .
In an effort to stop speeders once and for all , they built a 100 foot long and 2 foot high winding speed block in the middle of the Jing Zhuang highway .
Unfortunately for the drivers , the speed bump is so narrow that a large number of cars end up scraping against the side even when driving careful .
The speed bump has also taken the 2 lane highway down to a single lane , which has resulted in daily traffic jams .
So all you Chinese speeder better “ Slon Doon . ”

Russia 's invasion of Georgia reminded me of a conversation I had three years ago in Moscow with a high - ranking European Union official .
Russia was much freer then , but President Vladimir Putin 's onslaught against democratic rights was already underway .
" What would it take , " I asked , " for Europe to stop treating Putin like a democrat ?
If all opposition parties are banned ?
Or what if they started shooting people in the street ? "
The official shrugged and replied that even in such cases , there would be little the EU could do ....
In 2005 , Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage , special effects experts better known by thetitle of their popular Discovery Channel series , " MythBusters " , wereasked during an interview about the myth they would most like to test providedan unlimited budget .
" Jamie and I have done the research , and figured that the only way to endthe debate about the ' myth ' of the Apollo moon landing is to go there , " Savage replied to Slashdot , a technology news website , about thebelief held by some that the United States faked thelunar landings .
Three years later , the Mythbusters are ready to share the results of their ' trip ' as they devote their next show , airing on Wednesday , to the moon landinghoax claims .
" We built a hybrid rocket that was fueled by poo and nitrous oxide — thought we had enough Teflon tape on the seals but the stink got throughanyway .
Too bad that the footage got lost in transit to the editors , " Hyneman told collectSPACE.com , explaining that their limited budget would not cover the cost of regular rocketfuel .
Of course , he was joking .
" Dude , I sooo wished we could have gone there , " Savage admitted .
So , with their feet firmly planted on the Earth ( at least for most of the time , but more on that later ) , Hyneman and Savage , along with fellow Mythbusters ToryBelleci , Kari Byron and Grant Imahara , set out to use science to ' bust ' orconfirm the truth behind the hoaxers ' claims .
Low hanging fruit
Hoaxbelievers have had 40 years to devise reasons why the Apollomoon landings must have been filmed in an Earth - based studio .
As specialeffects experts , Hyneman felt they were well suited for the subject .
First however , they needed to choose which parts of the myth to test .
" We looked at the ones that for some reason or other , seemed mostprevalent , " Savage explained in an e-mail interview .
" We took the low hanging fruit , " Hyneman added .
" The key ideawas that the footage that proved we were there was a special effect .
Adam and Iare experienced effects artists , so it was natural for us to dig into it . "
" We wanted to tackle the ones that actually take some experimentation toprove , " Savage said .
To narrow the field however , the Mythbusters sought the assistance of someonevery familiar with debunking the moon hoax myth , or they would have if he hadnot come calling first .
" I was actually first involved with the Mythbusters early on , when I wascontacted by one of their producers asking if I had any astronomical myths forthem to bust , " shared Dr. Phil Plait , a.k.a.
" The Bad Astronomer " , in an interview with collectSPACE.com .
Anastronomer who worked with the Hubble Telescope , Plait created a website , BadAstronomy , aimed at dispelling astronomy and science based myths , includingthe moon hoax , which expanded into books and his recent appointment aspresident of the James Randi Educational Foundation .
" I made some suggestions but sadly they did n't use any of them , ?
Plaitsaid .
?
I guess most of them do n't make very good TV . "
That early interaction , which was followed by meeting the Mythbusters atconferences , led to Plait establishing a relationship with the show .
So he wassurprised when a fellow astronomer contacted him about the Mythbustersinvestigating the moon hoax .
" I had n't heard anything about [ this show ] so I fired off an e-mail toAdam Savage and said , ' What gives ? ' and he e-mailed me back and said , ' Oh oh oh , we 're going to ask you about this , ' " recalled Plait .
" Over the course of a few days , they were on the phone with me and a lotof other people who knew about , for example , the properties of the lunarsurface , to try to figure out not just the best way of debunking the moon hoaxbut the best aspects of it ... so they wanted to know which ones that they hadfound were the ones that I ran into and what were the best ways to tackle them .
It was actually a lot of fun . "
Ultimately , Hyneman , Savage and the others settled on three major areas of thehoax : how light interacted with the lunar surface , how the astronauts appearedto move in the low gravity of the Moon and how items behaved in the airlessvoid of space .

KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Afghan authorities have arrested 13 people , including employees of DHL courier service , after a shooting killed two foreign nationals and a security guard in Kabul Saturday , an Interior Ministry official said .
Afghan policemen move the victims ' bodies on to a vehicle at the site of the shoot - out in Kabul .
Ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary said employees and guards at DHL's Kabul office are among those arrested .
It is unclear exactly how the Afghan security guard died , but a British man and South African man , both DHL employees , were killed after being caught in the crossfire of a gunfight outside the DHL office , a Kabul police official said .
The DHL office is located near the presidential palace in the capital .
DHL has spoken to the men's relatives , according to the British Foreign Office .
" Consular assistance is being provided and further details have yet to be established , " the office said .
The South African Department of Foreign Affairs said it is also assisting the family .
Neither government identified the men .
DHL released a statement saying only that the 8:30 a.m. shooting killed two of its employees .
DHL is cooperating with police and will not be releasing further details at this time , the statement said .
" At this difficult time our thoughts are with the families , friends and colleagues of those who have lost their lives under such tragic circumstances , " it said .
Meanwhile , The Associated Press reported officials as saying that a private guard working for DHL opened fire and killed the company 's country director and his deputy on Saturday before turning the gun on himself .
A preliminary investigation found that one of the Afghan security guards protecting the DHL compound opened fire on the car carrying the two victims when it pulled into the company headquarters , said Mirza Mohammad Yarmal , the Interior Ministry official in charge of criminal investigations , in quotes carried by AP .

The guard then put the barrel of his Kalishnikov rifle to his head and killed himself , Yarmal told AP .
He added that the guard had been hired only about a month ago from an area north of Kabul where Pashtuns -- the ethnic group the Taliban draws its fighters from -- lives .
But he said police had no conclusive evidence linking the guard to the insurgent militia .
A Taliban spokesman denied that the militia was involved in the attack , according to AP .
DHL 's headquarters are also located across the street from the Iranian Embassy and close to Afghanistan 's intelligence service .
The area is considered a relatively secure part of the city .
Earlier this week a woman with dual UK - South African citizenship was shot dead on her motorbike in Kabul .
Gayle Williams , 34 , was working as a relief worker in Afghanistan .

What is Copyleft ?
Copyleft is a general method for making a program ( or other work ) free ( in the sense of freedom , not “ zero price ” ) , and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well .
The simplest way to make a program free software is to put it in the public domain , uncopyrighted .
This allows people to share the program and their improvements , if they are so minded .
But it also allows uncooperative people to convert the program into proprietary software .
They can make changes , many or few , and distribute the result as a proprietary product .
People who receive the program in that modified form do not have the freedom that the original author gave them ; the middleman has stripped it away .
In the GNU project , our aim is to give all users the freedom to redistribute and change GNU software .
If middlemen could strip off the freedom , our code might “ have many users , ” but it would not give them freedom .
So instead of putting GNU software in the public domain , we “ copyleft ” it .
Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software , with or without changes , must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it .
Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom .
Copyleft also provides an incentive for other programmers to add to free software .
Important free programs such as the GNU C++ compiler exist only because of this .
Copyleft also helps programmers who want to contribute improvements to free software get permission to do so .
These programmers often work for companies or universities that would do almost anything to get more money .
A programmer may want to contribute her changes to the community , but her employer may want to turn the changes into a proprietary software product .
When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute the improved version except as free software , the employer usually decides to release it as free software rather than throw it away .
To copyleft a program , we first state that it is copyrighted ; then we add distribution terms , which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use , modify , and redistribute the program 's code , or any program derived from it , but only if the distribution terms are unchanged .
Thus , the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable .
Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users ' freedom ; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom .
That 's why we reverse the name , changing “ copyright ” into “ copyleft . ”
Copyleft is a way of using the copyright on the program .
It does n't mean abandoning the copyright ; in fact , doing so would make copyleft impossible .

Robert Shiller on the US Bailout ' Plugging Holes in a Sinking Ship '
In a SPIEGEL interview , Yale economist Robert Shiller discusses the causes and consequences of the global economic crisis .
He argues there is a substantial risk of recession and that the next few years will be lean ones .
( CNN ) --
A week ago he was a little - known plumber quietly practicing his trade in northwestern Ohio .
Now Joe Wurzelbacher is a talking point in the race for the White House .
Barack Obama , left , shakes hands with Joe " the Plumber " Wurzelbacher at a Sunday campaign event .
Wurzelbacher , now dubbed " Joe the Plumber , " heard his name invoked in whole or in part more than two dozen times during Wednesday 's presidential debate in Hempstead , New York , first by Sen.
John McCain and then by Sen. Barack Obama .
" I was just really surprised that my name was mentioned , " he told reporters after the debate .
" I think it helped them get their points across , so I was happy about that . "
Wurzelbacher , 34 , unintentionally stepped onto the political scene over the weekend when Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , was campaigning in Holland , Ohio , just west of Toledo .
Wurzelbacher was playing football with his son when Obama was campaigning door - to - door in his neighborhood .
Watch Wurzelbacher 's take on the candidates »
Wurzelbacher works for Newell Plumbing & Heating Co. , a small firm in the Toledo area , The Toledo Blade reported .
Local election officials confirmed that Wurzelbacher was registered to vote .
They said that he was incorrectly registered as Samuel Joseph Worzelbacher and that he voted for the first time in Pennsylvania 's Republican primary on March 4 .
The officials said Wurzelbacher 's name was misspelled in the voter registration database .
Wurzelbacher is keeping who he plans to vote for to himself but says he leans conservative .
In his exchange with Obama , Wurzelbacher asked if the presidential candidate believed in the American Dream .
Wurzelbacher said he was about to buy the plumbing company that he works for and was concerned that Obama would tax him more because of it .
Families making more than $ 250,000 could see taxes go up under Obama 's middle - class tax cut plan , while those making less than $ 250,000 would not see any increase .
See debate highlights , analysis »
Obama explained his tax plan in depth to Wurzelbacher , saying it 's better to lower taxes for Americans who make less money so they can afford to patronize his business .
" I think that when you spread the wealth around , it 's good for everybody , " Obama told Wurzelbacher .
At the debate , McCain said Obama 's plan would give the government the power to redistribute wealth by raising taxes .
Watch a humorous take on the candidates , Wurzelbacher »
" We 're going to take Joe 's money , give it to Sen. Obama , and let him spread the wealth around .
I want Joe the plumber to spread the wealth around , " McCain said .
He added , " Why would you want to increase anybody 's taxes right now ?
Why would you want to do that to anyone , anyone in America , when we have such a tough time ? "
iReport.com : Joe the Plumber wins debate
Obama countered that both he and McCain want to cut taxes , but that his plan would cut taxes for " 95 percent of American families , " more than McCain 's plan .
Thursday morning , Obama 's running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , said plumbers would not be affected by the Democrat 's tax policies .
" You notice John [ McCain ] continues to cling to the notion of this guy Joe the Plumber , " Biden said on NBC's " Today " show .
" I do n't have any Joe the plumbers in my neighborhood that make $ 250,000 a year that are worried . "
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the mean annual wage for plumbers , pipefitters and steamfitters in the United States in 2007 was $ 47,350 .
Wurzelbacher is the second " Joe " invoked by the McCain campaign , which is attempting to appeal to so - called average Americans .
Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin referred to " Joe Six - Pack American " in a radio interview this month in which she touted the folksiness that 's been central to her political success in Alaska .
" I think they 're just not used to someone coming in from the outside saying , ' You know what ?
It 's time that normal Joe Six - Pack American is finally represented in the position of vice presidency , ' and I think that that 's kind of taken some people off - guard , " she told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt .

Passive smoking kills hundreds of thousands every year in India
A ban on smoking tobacco in public has come into force in India .
Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss says he aims to cut the number of smokers and to protect passive smokers from the harmful effects of tobacco .
The government says India has more than 120 million cigarette smokers .
Observers say the ban will need to be strictly enforced .
Those flouting it face fines of 200 rupees ( $ 4.50 ) .
Tobacco smoking in India kills 900,000 people a year .
That figure is expected to rise to a million by 2010 .
In pictures
India 's health ministry says hundreds of thousands of people who have never smoked die each year by inhaling smoke from other people 's cigarettes and bidis ( small hand - rolled cigarettes common in India ) .
" From 2 October India is going to go smoke - free in all public places , " Mr Ramadoss said .
" The aim is to discourage the smokers , to make them quit or reduce smoking .
Also all non-smoking employees have a right to a 100 % smoke - free atmosphere .
" The perils of passive smoking are equally bad . "
' Teething problems '
Health experts say passive smoking contains more than 4,000 chemicals and exposure can cause lung cancer , heart disease , bronchitis and asthma .
PUBLIC PLACES DEFINED
Auditoriums , cinema halls Hospitals , health institutions Railway stations , bus shelters Restaurants , hotels , bars , pubs Offices , libraries , courts Markets , shopping malls Airports Discotheques , coffee houses Schools , colleges , fun parks
Can the ban work ?
In the capital , Delhi , no -smoking notices have been posted at many office buildings , restaurants and hotels .
The government has provided an exhaustive list of what it deems to be public spaces as well as officials who have the authority to fine law - breakers .
People will still be able to smoke inside their homes , and in open areas .
The health minister says he has written to all state governments asking them to ensure the ban is observed .
Legislation to outlaw smoking in public in India was first passed in 2003 .
A ban was supposed to have taken effect in 2004 , but it has taken four more years to work out guidelines before it could be implemented .

Thursday - the first day of the ban - is a public holiday in India with offices and most markets closed and it will be some time before the first violations will be reported .
Some say they believe the law will be used by the police and other authorities to harass people .
The health minister admits there will be " teething problems " .
Campaign
But he says the " smoke - free campaign is a movement launched with massive public support " and he is confident that it will succeed .
" I expect there will be problems , but it will be done .
I appeal to the people to please do self - policing and abide by the act . "
To raise public awareness about the ban , the health ministry is running a publicity campaign in newspapers and on television and radio and billboards .
A new website is also being launched on Thursday to provide information about the ban .

MONTGOMERY , Alabama ( AP )  Alabama , pushed to second in national obesity rankings by deep - fried Southern favorites , is cracking down on state workers who are too fat .
The state has given its 37,527 employees a year to start getting fit — or they 'll pay $ 25 a month for insurance that otherwise is free .
Alabama will be the first U.S. state to impose a surcharge on overweight state workers who do not work on slimming down .
A handful of other states reward employees who adopt healthy behaviors .
Alabama already charges workers who smoke — and has seen some success in getting them to quit — but now has turned its attention to a problem that plagues many in the U.S. South : obesity .
The State Employees ' Insurance Board this week approved a plan to charge state workers starting in January 2010 if they do n't have free health screenings .
If the screenings turn up serious problems with blood pressure , cholesterol , glucose or obesity , employees will have a year to see a doctor at no cost , enroll in a wellness program , or take steps on their own to improve their health .
If they show progress in a follow - up screening , they wo n't be charged .
But if they do n't , they must pay starting in January 2011 .
" We are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health , " said state worker Robert Wagstaff , who serves on the insurance board .
Government statistics show Alabamians have a big weight problem .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 30.3 % are now obese , ranking the state behind only Mississippi .

In a wide - ranging and sometimes - combative interview with two Gartner analysts yesterday , always - feisty Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer touched on various points that have kept the grapevine buzzing .
He dismissed Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) as a competitor and re-opened the door to a team - up with Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) .
Ballmer also defended Windows Vista and Windows 7 , said Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) is adopting a new business model and discussed cloud computing -- giving the audience a peek at the company 's future plans .
However , he constantly shifted the focus of the discussion when quizzed by Gartner analysts Neil McDonald and David Smith during the interview , being held on the last day of the Gartner ITxpo in Orlando , Fla .
Asked about Google Apps , which Gartner analyst McDonald said " provide features that are better than what you have , " Ballmer said " nobody uses these things " and dismissed Google Apps as " pretty primitive . "
Google Apps are " flatlined , and Microsoft Office is growing 30 percent in the consumer market , " he added .
Google Apps " do n't have the best word processor or spreadsheet we compete with ; we get more competitive pressure from OpenOffice and StarOffice than we do from those guys , " Ballmer said .
OpenOffice , from OpenOffice.org , is an open source office software suite that goes head to head with Microsoft Office .
It is based on StarOffice , which is offered by Sun Microsystems at a lower price than Microsoft 's offerings .
Responding to Gartner analyst Smith 's comment that half of 400 users surveyed by Gartner yesterday said they were using Google Apps , Ballmer replied " the real statistics are people try , they do n't use . "
Pain in the Apps
However , Ballmer tacitly conceded that Google Apps are hurting Microsoft in at least one area .
University students , who are " the leading edge of all consumerization phenomena " use Office but " when it comes to sharing stuff they use Google Apps , which is why we 're moving to Office Live , " he said .
Advertising is where Microsoft sees Google as a competitor .
" Google has the lead , but , if we 're good at advertising , we 'll compete with them in the consumer business , " Ballmer said .
That ability to serve up ads online and to do online searches is what drove Microsoft to bid for Yahoo , and Ballmer said Microsoft views search as a critical functionality .
" Search is a fundamental thing , and we 're out selling [ business intelligence ] , selling search , " he explained .
Yahoo has repeatedly rebuffed bids from Microsoft .
Asked why it would not make sense to bid for Yahoo now that its price has fallen , Ballmer re-opened the door to a possible purchase .
" They did n't want to sell when we offered $ 33 , and we learned they want to remain independent , but perhaps there 's an opportunity to work together around search , " he said .
" I still think it would make sense economically . "
Shortly after Ballmer 's interview , however , Microsoft released a statement challenging the notion that the door to a future tie - in with Yahoo still remained ajar .
" Our position has n't changed .
Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo ; there are no discussions between the companies , " it said in a statement .
Despite the statement , Yahoo's after - hours share price at press time Thursday evening was $ 13.39 , up 40 cents or 3.08 percent .
Earlier , during the day 's discussion McDonald asked why adoption rates for Vista are only 10 percent two years after its release , according to Gartner 's research .
Ballmer replied that Vista 's growth has been faster than the adoption rate for Windows XP , and " we 're now seeing a ramp up . "
Told that 61 percent of the audience at Gartner 's infrastructure and operations management conference in June said they would either skip Vista or had not yet decided whether to buy it , Ballmer turned the focus to Windows 7 , which is " compatible with Vista . "
Windows 7 is " bigger than a breadbasket , smaller than a refrigerator , it 's a real release , " Ballmer said , adding that it will " clean up in nice ways on the user interface , we 'll pioneer touch and multitouch in the UI and improve the shell . "
Looking into tomorrow
Ballmer then gave the audience a peek at what 's coming down the line .
" The most important thing we 'll have to do beyond Windows 7 is redesign our applications and operating system to take advantage of the new processors from Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) and AMD , " ( NYSE : AMD ) he said .
In addition , Microsoft will make " a lot of enhancements we can do on the fundamental NT code base , " Ballmer said .
Asked about virtualization , Ballmer said that will be shipped as part of Microsoft 's desktop optimization pack next year , and it will be " technology that lets you run the hypervisor and virtualization on the client but wo n't require a fundamental rewrite of the application . "
The high court yesterday condemned as " deeply disturbing " a refusal by the US to disclose evidence that could prove a British resident held at Guantánamo Bay was tortured before confessing to terrorism offences .
The court said there was " no rational basis " for the American failure to reveal the contents of documents essential to the defence of Binyam Mohamed , who faces the death penalty .
In a particularly damning passage , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said claims by Mohamed 's lawyers that the US was refusing to release the papers because " torturers do not readily hand over evidence of their conduct " could not be dismissed and required an answer .
The judges said they were unaware of any precedent for such serious allegations against " the government of a foreign friendly state and our oldest and closest ally " as those made in this case .
The US had not provided any explanation for its conduct , though it had had " ample time " to do so , the judges said .
Thomas and Lloyd said the documents provided the " only independent evidence " capable of helping Mohamed and his defence .
Suppressing the material " would be to deny him the opportunity of timely justice in respect of the charges against him " , which was a principle dating back to " at least the time of Magna Carta and which is a basic part of our common law and of democratic values " .
They said David Miliband , the foreign secretary , conceded there was an " arguable case " that Mohamed had been subjected to torture and inhuman treatment .
Yet Miliband also wanted to suppress relevant documents , not because they would reveal any intelligence operations but because the US claimed that if they were disclosed serious harm would be done to " intelligence sharing " between the UK and the US .
The judges said it was clear Britain had " facilitated " Mohamed 's interrogation when he was unlawfully detained in Pakistan before being secretly rendered to Morocco , Afghanistan , and then to Guantánamo .
The US was using confessions made after two years of unlawful " incommunicado detention " on charges where the death penalty might be sought , the judges said yesterday .
They noted that a military prosecutor at the US base had recently resigned in protest against the treatment of prisoners , including the use of a " frequent flyer programme " .
The judges described this as a " euphemism for a sleep deprivation programme " .
They added : " This is a practice which the United Kingdom expressly prohibits . "
Charges against Mohamed - including that he was involved in a dirty bomb plot - have been dropped , allegedly to prevent the US from revealing torture evidence .
The US authorities now planned to charge him with other offences , the judges noted yesterday .
The judges took the extraordinary step of inviting the media to challenge previous decisions to hold many of the case 's hearings in camera .
" Although the argument took place in closed session , " they said , " the issue is one of considerable importance in the context of open justice [ and ] to the rule of law . "
They suspended proceedings pending a case in the US courts , where defence lawyers are also trying to force disclosure .
That federal court , the British judges said yesterday , might be given explanations about US conduct " denied to this court " .
Clive Stafford Smith , the director of the charity Reprieve , described Mohamed 's treatment by the US as a " litany of misconduct " .
" First they tortured him , then they held him for more than six years without trial , now they want to cover up evidence that could set him free , " he said .
" What is the point of a ' special relationship ' if the UK government cannot secure basic justice for Mr Mohamed ? "
Richard Stein , one of Mohamed 's lawyers , said : " The grave concerns expressed by the court about the dealings of the Americans in this case are not surprising , given the torture Mr Mohamed has suffered .
This underlines the British government 's duty to do more than gently nudge its ally across the Atlantic when it comes to criminal acts taken against a British resident . "
Mohamed , 30 , an Ethiopian national and British resident , was held in Pakistan in 2002 , when he was questioned by an MI5 officer .
He was later secretly rendered to Morocco , where he says he was tortured by having his penis cut with a razor blade .
The US subsequently flew him to Afghanistan and he was transferred to Guantánamo Bay in September 2004 .
Backstory
Attempts to get the UK courts and parliament to take notice of the case of Binyam Mohamed began more than three years ago .
Clive Stafford Smith , director of the charity Reprieve , told the Guardian about a hunger strike by Guantánamo Bay prisoners , including Mohamed , who was rendered to the US base in Cuba .
Mohamed 's case was taken up by the all - party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition , chaired by Andrew Tyrie MP
UK citizens and residents held at Guantánamo were released between 2005 and 2007 , but Mohamed was kept .
This summer , the high court heard about the way the US and British governments tried to stop the release of evidence about his case .
Defence lawyers argued that MI5 misled MPs about his treatment .
In August , in an interim judgment , the high court ruled that MI5 had participated in Mohamed 's unlawful interrogation .

Sorry the only update in a while came to this , I 'm just really , really tired .
Recently , I got mail from someone who read my opinion piece about PHP and inquired about my closing line :
PHP is ripe for having its lunch eaten , really .
The question obviously suggests itself : by whom ?
The answer is , I do n’t know .
There is no obvious candidate .
I do however think that I know what such a candidate would have to look like .
It will have to be more than just a programming language , because PHP itself is really more than a programming language .
It includes a crude web framework ( an invocation model reminiscent of CGI , with extensions ) plus a crude deployment solution ( just make all the libraries part of the language and let the sysadmin worry about it – who in turn often defers to his operating system vendor ) .
This is PHP ’s way of taking the worse - is - better philosophy to dazzling new depths :
It provides everything necessary for writing web apps , by default .
The functionality may not be particularly well designed , and contemporary trend among seasoned PHP developers may be to spend more time working around it than with it , but it ’s there .
As a developer , you can rely on it – if PHP is there at all ( and nowadays , where is it not ? ) , so are these features .
If you are a user interested in an application that is written in PHP , all parts of application deployment other than uploading the application code itself are Someone Else ’s Problem – namely the system adminstrator’s .
This means PHP apps can be installed by almost anyone who can buy web space , because they need to know nothing about either programming or system administration .
This recipe has very obviously been a resounding success .
So I think whatever eats PHP ’s lunch is going to be a standardised programming environment rather than a mere language by itself – one that might conceivably even be language - agnostic , though in that case platform features among participating languages will likely have to be reasonably similar .
An example of what I am thinking of might be Google ’s App Engine .
While it uses Python , it ’s much more than just web hosting with Python support .
We see the same principles in action as with PHP : all the bits required by web apps are included , and the installation of any libraries is Someone Else ’s Problem as far as the user is concerned .
Note that I ’m not saying App Engine is the PHP killer ( or even a PHP killer ) .
It could become that , if web hosters were to start providing App Engine hosting and people were to start writing App Engine apps that are so good that non-programmers want to run them .
And it ’s certainly a possibility that this will eventually happen , even if at this point it seems rather less likely than it might have at the time of App Engine ’s unveiling .
Google have provided everything necessary for other companies to copy App Engine , and as long as its popularity is low , they can afford to keep it around indefinitely .
( What if popularity does surge ?
Why , mission accomplished of course . )
In a post to the Firefox planning newsgroup , Mozilla Corp ’s Mike Shaver , announced that there will be at least two betas for Shiretoko , Firefox 3.1 code name .
The main reason is to allow enough time to bake a high quality private mode as announced earlier this week but some other minor but sensible changes will take place as well .
We ’re still hammering out the details , but we know that there is a core list of features that we ’ll be looking to land between beta 1 and beta 2 , likely : extending TraceMonkey ‘s capabilities into the DOM and other parts of our system
completing private browsing
a bunch of UI cleanups and improvements building on FF3 ’s success , and incorporating things we ’ve learned from other browsers and add- ons
some core improvements to systems like PFS [ Plugin Finder System ] and our security UI
Though there ’s no official schedule , code freeze for Beta 1 is targeted for September ’s end , so it should be around by mid-October .
If Beta 2 gets to close to December , it will probably push release candidates and final release to early 2009 .
Monsanto's " seed police " snared soy farmer Homan McFarling in 1999 , and the company is demanding he pay it hundreds of thousands of dollars for alleged technology piracy .
McFarling 's sin ?
He saved seed from one harvest and replanted it the following season , a revered and ancient agricultural practice .
" My daddy saved seed .
I saved seed , " said McFarling , 62 , who still grows soy on the 5,000 acre family farm in Shannon , Mississippi , and is fighting the agribusiness giant in court .
Saving Monsanto's seeds , genetically engineered to kill bugs and resist weed sprays , violates provisions of the company 's contracts with farmers .
Since 1997 , Monsanto has filed similar lawsuits 90 times in 25 states against 147 farmers and 39 agriculture companies , according to a report issued Thursday by The Center for Food Safety , a biotechnology foe .
In a similar case a year ago , Tennessee farmer Kem Ralph was sued by Monsanto and sentenced to eight months in prison after he was caught lying about a truckload of cotton seed he hid for a friend .
Ralph 's prison term is believed to be the first criminal prosecution linked to Monsanto 's crackdown .
Ralph has also been ordered to pay Monsanto more than $ 1.7 million .
The company itself says it annually investigates about 500 " tips " that farmers are illegally using its seeds and settles many of those cases before a lawsuit is filed .
In this way , Monsanto is attempting to protect its business from pirates in much the same way the entertainment industry does when it sues underground digital distributors exploiting music , movies and video games .
In the process , it has turned farmer against farmer and sent private investigators into small towns to ask prying questions of friends and business acquaintances .
Monsanto's licensing contracts and litigation tactics are coming under increased scrutiny as more of the planet 's farmland comes under genetically engineered cultivation .
Some 200 million acres of the world 's farms grew biotech crops last year , an increase of 20 percent from 2003 , according to a separate report released Wednesday .
Many of the farmers Monsanto has sued say , as McFarling claims , that they did n't read the company 's technology agreement closely enough .
Others say they never received an agreement in the first place .
The company counters that it sues only the most egregious violations and is protecting the 300,000 law - abiding U.S. farmers who annually pay a premium for its technology .
Soy farmers , for instance , pay a " technology fee " of about $ 6.50 an acre each year .
Some 85 percent of the nation 's soy crop is genetically engineered to resist Monsanto 's herbicide Roundup , a trait many farmers say makes it easier to weed their fields and ultimately cheaper to grow their crops .
" It 's a very efficient and cost - effective way to raise soy beans , and that 's why the market has embraced it , " said Ron Heck , who grows 900 acres of genetically engineered soy beans in Perry , Iowa .
Heck , who is also chairman of the American Soybean Association , said he does n't mind buying new seed each year and appreciates Monsanto 's crackdown on competitors who do n't pay for their seed .
" You can save seed if you want to use the old technology , " Heck said .
The company said the licensing agreement protects its more than 600 biotech - related patents and ensures a return on its research and development expenses , which amount to more than $ 400 million annually .
" We have to balance our obligations and our responsibilities to our customers , to our employees and to our shareholders , " said Scott Baucum , Monsanto 's chief intellectual property protector .
Still , Monsanto 's investigative tactics are sowing seeds of fear and mistrust in some farming communities , company critics say .
Monsanto encourages farmers to call a company hot line with piracy tips , and private investigators in its employ act on leads with visits to the associates of suspect farmers .
Baucum acknowledged that the company walks a fine line when it sues farmers .
" It is very uncomfortable for us , " Baucum said .
" They are our customers and they are important to us . "
The Center for Food Safety established its own hotline Thursday where farmers getting sued can receive aid .
It also said it hopes to convene a meeting among defense lawyers to develop legal strategies to fight Monsanto .
The company said it has gone to trial five times and has never lost a legal fight against an accused pirate .
The Supreme Court in 1980 allowed for the patenting of genetically engineered life forms and extended the same protections to altered plants in 2001 .
Earlier this year , a Washington , D.C. , federal appeals court specifically upheld Monsanto 's license .
" It 's sad .
It 's sickening .
I 'm disillusioned , " said Rodney Nelson , a North Dakota farmer who settled a Monsanto suit in 2001 that he said was unfairly filed .
" We have a heck of an uphill battle that I do n't think can be won . "

The craft will survey the moon 's surface
India will launch its first unmanned mission to the Moon on 22 October , the country 's space officials say , weather conditions permitting .
The spacecraft , named Chandrayaan - 1 , will orbit the Moon , surveying its surface with high - resolution equipment .
The launch had been scheduled for April , but was pushed back due to technical problems .
The project will cost $ 83 m and has the direct involvement of six other countries , including the US and Europe .
Over the next two years , it will survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and its three - dimensional topography .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) is supporting the mission , supplying three instruments .
These will investigate the Moon 's surface and near - surface composition , and the way the lunar body interacts with the fast - moving particles streaming away from the Sun .
Chandrayaan - 1 will also drop a small impact probe on to the lunar surface to test its properties .
' Over ambitious '
India announced its Moon mission in 2003 .
It has also announced plans to send a man to the Moon in the next few years .
The government 's lunar activities have not been welcomed by all , however .
Critics say it is " over ambitious " and a " waste of resources " in a country where millions still lack basic services .
The Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) , was founded in 1969 , and launched its first satellite in 1975 .
Since then , it has developed a number of launch vehicles as well as satellites for Earth observation , telecommunications and weather forecasting .
Together with China and Japan , it is part of a fast - developing Asian space sector .
Lately I ’ve been doing most of my testing with doctest , primarily using stand - alone text files .
I generally like it ( otherwise I would n’t be using it ) , but it does make me frustrated with doctest sometimes .
On my wishlist ( roughly in order ) :
I wish output was always displayed , even when there ’s an exception .
I see no reason for the current behavior .
Really exceptions could be treated like any other output ( if ELLIPSIS was on by default ) .
I wish you could turn on options like ELLIPSIS from within a doctest , for all expressions .
( # doctest : +ELLIPSIS on every line is beyond ugly . )
< BLANKLINE > is terribly ugly .
There ’s no way of saying “ I do n’t care what this prints ” .
You ca n’t do : >>> some_function ( ) ... because the ... is treated like a continuation .
Plugging in an alternate output checker is kind of tedious , and ca n’t be done from within a doctest ( without horrible hacks ) .
I ’d like to be able to easily jump into an interactive state from doctest .
Maybe pdb can do this , but I ’ve never figured that out exactly .
Getting nose to run . txt files as doctests is really hard , involving a combination of options I always forget .
There ’s no way to abort the doctest .
Sometimes I ’d like to run some environment checks early on , and be able to stop the test if they fail .
I wish it was easier to apply to non-Python code .
( I ’ve adapted it via subclassing for Logo but I would n’t do that often . )
I wish I could copy and paste from doctests to consoles .
But I do n’t see any solution to this problem .
The integration with unittest is pretty hacky .
Not that I ’ve used unittest in years .
But some other test frameworks build off this integration .

The one company most responsible for the decline in young cyclists across the US .
By carrying out their Campaign of Terror Bell has chosen to misrepresent the dangers of cycling in order to sell helmets .
Bell Helmet has also paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobbyists to promote mandatory helmet laws across the US and elsewhere , against the wishes of a majority of cyclists who oppose such laws .
Inaccurate claims and fear mongering , clearly visible in this ad , are responsible for the large number of parents who drive their children to and from school even though they might live only a few blocks away .

Only you can do something about this company 's misleading and unethical marketing .
Please do not purchase products manufactured by Bell ( or their wholly - owned subsidiary Giro ) and write them with your thoughts .
Yes , people .
You ’re looking at the first shots of Amazon ’s Kindle 2 .
The follow - up to their popular e-book reader .
Our ninja sent us a ton of shots , and we have to admit , they look pretty good .
The unit did n’t go down too much in size which is unfortunate , but then again , you want something pretty large so it ’s comfortable to read on .
He says that the unit is a little wider and a little longer , but it should help those that thought the first unit was a little too awkwardly - shaped .
What ’s even better is that with the new unit , while holding it , you wo n’t accidentally flip the page like the old one .
Hit the jump for the rest !
As far as buttons go , on the right side , the bottoms from top to bottom are : Home , Next Page , Menu , a joystick , and Undo .
On the left side , there ’s Previous , Page , and Next Page .
We ’re told the buttons are significantly smaller to avoid accidental page turning .
The joystick takes the place of the scroll wheel and it “ takes a little getting used to . ”
As far as the redesigned keyboard … it “ has a good layout , but lettering on the keys could be darker . ”
Continuing our tour around the unit , next to the sliding sleep button , there ’s the headphone jack , and on the right side edge you ’ve got the volume up / down buttons .
What ’s interesting ( and you can see this in the photos ) is that the backside of the unit is mostly metal with the speakers at the bottom pf the back .
One more plus ?
They ’ve finally ditched their own charger .
The Kindle 2 is able to be charged with a miniUSB cable .
Our ninja did n’t have a pocket ruler , but he said that the size of the display is approximately the exact same as the original Kindle even though at first glance it looks a little smaller .
What might be a little troublesome is the fact that the battery does not look to be user - accessible , and there ’s no more SD card slot .
In the top left corner of the device , it gives you a display of how much memory is left , and our guy ’s unit showed 1403 MB .
Lastly , it still uses EV - DO for downloads , and it comes with a leather pouch as opposed to the binder - style piece of nonsense that would constantly let the unit fall out .
All in all , the unit is thinner , has a slightly heavier feel , and it feels much sturdier .
Mr. Badass Ninja does n’t like the metal back , and he ’s not convinced on the joystick yet .
That ’s all for now , folks !
Thank our ninja in the comments , and let us know what you think .
Shots are of course in the world - famous BGR gallery

Talks to agree a huge $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) bail - out of the US financial industry have ended in a " shouting match " .
After several hours of discussions with President George W Bush , a group of Republican members of Congress blocked the government plan .
The proposal would have seen the government buy bad debts from US banks to prevent more of them collapsing .
President Bush is due to make a statement about the negotiations at 0935 in Washington ( 1435 BST ) .
Both sides have agreed to resume talks later on Friday .
The leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , told ABC News that she " hoped " a bailout plan could be agreed within 24 hours , because " it has to happen " .
Financial markets are gummed up because banks do not know exactly how much bad debt they hold and are therefore reluctant to lend to businesses , consumers and each other .
The fall - out of this credit crunch continues to make a huge impact :
The United States suffered its largest bank failure yet , when regulators moved in to close down Washington Mutual and then sold it to US rival JP Morgan Chase for $ 1.9bn
In a co-ordinated move the European Central Bank , the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank announced new short - term loans to the banking sector worth tens of billions of dollars
Banks continued to cut costs , with UK banking giant HSBC saying it would axe 1,100 jobs
Shares in UK bank Bradford & Bingley fell another 20 % to 17 pence before recovering slightly .
' Full throated discussion '
On Thursday , Democratic and Republican legislators appeared to have struck a deal .
A group of Democrats and Republicans even made a public statement , with Senator Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , announcing that they had reached " fundamental agreement " on the principles of a bail - out plan .
President Bush has lost authority to an extent that must be unprecedented in modern times
Justin Webb
North America editor
Justin Webb 's blog Robert Peston on the crisis Bail - out : For and Against Regulator shuts Washington Mutual But after the White House meeting , the top Republican on the committee , Richard Shelby , told reporters : " I do n't believe we have an agreement . "
The intense discussions reportedly saw US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson literally down on one knee , begging Ms Pelosi to help push through the bail - out package .
However , the agreement unravelled when a group of Republican legislators objected to the principle of the plan .
The talks at the White House , led by Mr Paulson and US President George W Bush , then descended into what one participant described as " a full - throated discussion " .
Officials with the campaign team of Republican presidential candidate John McCain spoke of " a contentious shouting match " .
The Republican critics of the bail - out plan worry about both its cost and how it would involve the government in the financial sector .
Instead , they want a government - backed insurance policy for the huge amounts of bad debt built up by US banks .
This proposal , however , was described as " unworkable " both by Democratic politicians and some US government officials .
Doubts over presidential debate Some Democrats were scathing about the lack of support for the Paulson plan .

More from Today programme " For House Republicans to take a walk is just appalling , " said Democrat Barney Frank .
He later added that the passage of the bill depended on the Republicans .
" It depends on the House Republicans dropping this revolt against the president and cooperating in trying to amend the plan , " he said .
The breakdown of talks has put a huge question mark over the first debate in the presidential election campaign in the US .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Mr McCain were supposed to meet in Oxford , Mississippi .
But Mr McCain said he wanted to pull out and focus on getting a bailout plan agreed instead .
Democrats accused him of posturing and avoiding telling voters how he would solve the crisis .
Bank failure
As the credit crunch continues to bite , regulators moved in and shut down Washington Mutual ( WaMu ) , one of the largest savings and loan institutions in the US .
Depositors had withdrawn $ 16.7 bn from the bank during the past 10 days alone .
HAVE YOUR SAY $ 700 bn should pay off a lot of mortgages - bail the people out not the companies Wen Wy , London
They immediately sold on the bank to banking giant JPMorgan Chase for $ 1.9bn .
" With insufficient liquidity to meet its obligations , WaMu was in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business , " said the Office of Thrift Supervision .
WaMu had seen its share price drop by more than 80 % this year , after suffering considerable losses due to failed mortgages .
Earlier this year JPMorgan Chase also bought investment bank Bear Stearns when it faced collapse .

Judging from the participation in our Opinion Journal forum today , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is inspiring intense reactions across this fair land .
Here are a few recent comments :

Comparing E-mail Address Validating Regular Expressions
Summary
This page compares regular expressions that validate e-mail addresses in order to find the best one .
The expression with the best score is currently the one used by PHP's filter_var ( ) , which is based on a regex by Michael Rushton :
/^(?!(?:(?:\x22?\x5C[\x00-\x7E ] \x22 ? ) |(?:\x22 ?[ ^\x5C\x22]\x22 ? ) ) { 255, } ) ( ?!(?:(?:\x22?\x5C[\x00-\x7E ] \x22 ? ) |(?:\x22 ?[ ^\x5C\x22]\x22 ? ) ) {65,}@ ) (?:(?:[ \x21\x23-\x27\x2A\x2B\x2D\x2F-\x39\x3D\x3F\x5E-\x7E ] +) |(?:\x22(?:[ \x01-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F\x21\x23-\x5B\x5D-\x7 F ] |(?:\x5C[\x00 -\x7 F ] ) ) * \x22 ) ) (?:\.(?:(?:[ \x21\x23-\x27\x2A\x2B\x2D\x2F-\x39\x3D\x3F\x5E-\x7E ] +) |(?:\x22(?:[ \x01-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F\x21\x23-\x5B\x5D-\x7 F ] |(?:\x5C[\x00 -\x7 F ] ) ) * \x22 ) ) ) *@( ?:(?:(?!.*[ ^.]

The best one that 's been verified to work in JavaScript is Arluison Guillaume 's improvement of Warren Gaebel 's regex :
/^[-a-z0-9~!$ %^&*_=+}{\'? ]+( \.[-a-z0-9~!$ %^&*_=+}{\'? ]+) *@( [a-z0 - 9 _ ] [ -a- z0 - 9 _ ] *( \.[-a- z0 - 9 _ ]+)*\.( aero|arpa|biz|com|coop|edu|gov|info|int|mil|museum|name|net|org|pro|travel | mobi|[ a -z ] [ a - z ] ) |( [ 0 - 9 ] {1,3}\ .[ 0 - 9 ] {1,3}\ .[ 0 - 9 ] {1,3}\ .[ 0 - 9 ] { 1,3} ) ) ( :[ 0 - 9 ] { 1,5} ) ?$ / i
Introduction
I was writing a web application and wanted to find a regular expression to validate user 's e-mail addresses , but when I searched for one I found dozens of slightly different variations of the same expression .
Almost all of the posts were followed by comments describing examples of false - positives or false - negatives .
But dispite all the criticism , I could n't find a definitive " best " expression .
So , I setup arrays of some of the most promising ones to run against a set of known valid and invalid addresses .
I think that it 's better to accept a few invalid addresses than reject any valid ones , so I 'm shooting for 0 false - negatives and as few false - positives as possible .
It 's been about 5 years since I initially created this , and I think we 've found a relatively solid answer , but if you know of an expression that tests better than the current one , or if you have some other feedback feel free to contact me .
If you feel think that any of the addresses are incorrectly labeled , please take it up with Cal Henderson or Dominic Sayers , since I 've used their test data .
Notes
There 's no perfect regular expression to validate e-mail addresses
If you need something more advanced than a simple regex , check out RFC 822/2822/5322 Email Address Parser in PHP or is_email ( ) Address Validation .
I think it 's better to allow any TLD , even if it does n't exist , than to put a static list of currently - existing TLDs into the regex .
The problem with a static list is that the regex will be used in production environments , but probably wo n't be updated when new TLDs come out .
Some of these are dependent on being executed using case - insenstive regex functions .
This page uses PHP's ereg ( ) and preg_match ( ) functions , but some of these will work with JavaScript and other languages
These regex 's only check if the address is syntactically valid .
It 's entirely possible that an address which does not exist on any mail server would pass this test .
Checking to see if an address actually exists is n't always practical or necessary , though .
Slow regex 's can be a security risk .
Remember the Robustness Principle when handling addresses that fail to validate .
Some of the test addresses below are very long , and have been truncated for displaying .

The Boeing Company , whose order books are bulging with demand for its planes , was hit by its second major strike in three years early Saturday , when the union that represents 27,000 machinists in Washington State , Oregon and Kansas walked off the job .
The union , the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers , said its members struck Boeing at 3:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time after last - minute talks , held in Florida , failed to bring an agreement .
No new talks were scheduled .
A Boeing spokesman , Tim Healy , said Sunday that there had been no developments in the negotiations over the weekend .
Boeing does not plan to build airplanes while the strike is under way , Mr. Healy said , although it will deliver finished planes that have been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and will provide service to planes already in service .
However , its plants will remain open and employees who are not members of the machinists union are expected to come to work .

McCain mocks nuclear safety : ' Blah blah blah ' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. John McCain ramped up his attacks against Democratic opponent Barack Obama on Saturday , criticizing the Illinois senator for saying that nuclear power needed to be done safely .
The Republican candidate referenced the final presidential debate Oct. 15 , in which Obama qualified McCain 's support of nuclear energy and offshore drilling with the need to protect the environment .
" You know , the other night in a debate I said his eloquence is admirable but pay attention to his words , " McCain said .
" We talked about offshore drilling and he said he would , quote , ' consider ' offshore drilling .
We talked about nuclear power .
Well , it has to be safe , environment , blah blah blah . "
The crowd seemed to enjoy McCain 's flippancy , bursting into cheers before he could continue .
McCain suggested nuclear power is a safe energy resource because " we 've been sailing Navy ships around the world for 50 years with nuclear power plants on them . "
" I have news for Senator Obama , nuclear power is safe , we ought to do it now , " McCain said .
McCain has used recent speeches and television appearances to blast Obama for his " spreading the wealth around " comment to Joe the Plumber , claiming it indicates that Obama is a " socialist . "
But some economists see things differently .
" McCain wants the same tax policy as Bush : tax cuts for the high - end wealthy , " Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research said .

John McCain 's brother exchanged sharp words with a police operator after calling 911 to complain about traffic .
His call , and a call back to reprimand him for an inappropriate use of the service , were recorded by City of Alexandria Police , WJLA first reported .
Here 's the exchange :
Operator : 911 state your emergency Caller :
It 's not an emergency but do you know why on one side at the damn drawbridge of 95 traffic is stopped for 15 minutes and yet traffic 's coming the other way ?
Operator : Sir , are you calling 911 to complain about traffic ?
( pause ) Caller : " ( Expletive ) you . " ( caller hangs up )
The operator then called back , and received this message : " Hi this is Joe McCain I can't take this message now because I 'm involved in a very ... important political project ... I hope on Nov. 4th we have elected John . "
McCain then apparently called 911 again , to complain about the message .
You can listen to the call here ( .wav ) : Part 1 ; Part 2 ; Part 3 .

Brandon McClelland , 24 , was dragged to death beneath a truck driven by two white men in Paris , Texas last month .
McClelland was black .
The site of his death is about 200 miles from the location where James Byrd was murdered in a similar manner ten years ago .
( Image at left : Jacqueline McClelland , Brandon 's mother ; photo courtesy Jesse Muhammad . )
McClelland 's murder took place on September 16 , 2008 .
Parts of his mangled body were found strewn along the highway at great distance .
First responders treated the case as a hit and run .
The county district attorney 's office denied the possibility of racist motivations , and said comparisons to the Byrd lynching were " preposterous . "
The incident was reported in the local newspaper , which later followed with this editorial .
Some bloggers and news sites associated with the Nation of Islam [ * ] have been discussing the killing as a hate crime for weeks , and claim local law enforcement ignored key forensic evidence at the crime scene .
Howard Witt at the Chicago Tribune , who has covered related stories about racial injustice and hate crimes in this region , wrote about the case as a possible hate crime earlier this month .
The story of McClelland 's death — and allegations the investigation by ( white ) local police investigators was botched — seems to be gaining broader attention after having been picked up by AP today : Another Dragging Death In Texas ( Associated Press ) .
Snip from a related story about racism in Paris , Texas , also from Witt at the Chicago Tribune :
The public fairgrounds in this small east Texas town look ordinary enough , like so many other well - worn county fair sites across the nation .
Unless you know the history of the place .
There are no plaques or markers to denote it , but several of the most notorious public lynchings of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries were staged at the Paris Fairgrounds , where thousands of white spectators would gather to watch and cheer as black men were dragged onto a scaffold , scalded with hot irons and finally burned to death or hanged .
One of the most widely - publicized lynchings of a black person in American history took place there 115 years ago .
On February 1 , 1893 , former slave Henry Smith was tortured to death in front of a crowd of ten thousand ( mostly or entirely white ) people .
Here is the New York Times article from that day , documenting the brutal details of his death in explicit detail .
The child 's father , her brother , and two uncles then gathered about the Negro as he lay fastened to the torture platform and thrust hot irons into his quivering flesh .
It was horrible – the man dying by slow torture in the midst of smoke from his own burning flesh .
Every groan from the fiend , every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd of 10,000 persons .
The mass of beings 600 yards in diameter , the scaffold being the center .
After burning the feet and legs , the hot irons–plenty of fresh ones being at hand–were rolled up and down Smith 's stomach , back , and arms .
Then the eyes were burned out and irons were thrust down his throat .
Another snip from that century - old NYT story , which presumed Smith was guilty , and deserved the lynching :
Whisky shops were closed , unruly mobs were dispersed , schools were dismissed by a proclamation from the mayor , and everything was done in a business - like manner .
ANOTHER NEGRO BURNED ; HENRY SMITH DIES AT THE STAKE .
DRAWN THROUGH THE STREETS ON A CAR — TORTURED FOR NEARLY AN HOUR WITH HOT IRONS AND THEN BURNED — AWFUL VENGEANCE OF A PARIS ( TEXAS ) MOB ( NYT )
Update : BB commenter JWB nails it :
This must be viewed in light of the Ashley Todd incident this week .
Todd made up a false story that a black man attacked her and carved a " B " in her face , ostensibly because she supports John McCain .
In Paris , Texas , a hundred years ago , a charge like that would get a black man burned alive .
Today it does n't go quite that far but you could see the shadow of the lynch mob forming in the darker corners of the right - wing blogosphere when the Todd story first circulated .
The Southern Poverty Law Center has an interactive map of racist organizations and businesses ( think : White Pride record stores , KKK branches ) in this part of Texas , which you can view here .

Incidentally , SLPC also categorizes the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party as " hate groups . "

Kunar has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict US and Afghan troops have abandoned a remote village in eastern Afghanistan where militants killed nine US soldiers and wounded a dozen more on Sunday .
A statement said the outpost had been temporary and that " regular patrols " in the area would be maintained .
Afghan police are continuing to fight insurgents after the pullout on Tuesday , local officials say .
The attack caused the biggest American loss of life in battle in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 .
Nato says the rebels also suffered heavy casualties .
It did not name the attackers but there has been a sharp increase in Taleban attacks in the country , and in that region in particular , although other rebel groups are also known to operate there .
' Disestablished '
At least 100 - some reports say 200 - insurgents stormed the small combat outpost in the village of Wanat on the border of Nuristan and Kunar provinces on Sunday .
Some militants briefly broke through defences and into the temporary base .
" We are confirming that we have vacated our combat outpost at Wanat , " said Nato spokesman Mark Laity .
The outpost had only been constructed days before it was attacked .
Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) announced the camp had now been " disestablished " but said there would be a " continued presence " in the area - namely patrols and the use of Afghan security forces .
Omar Sami Taza , a spokesman for the governor of Nuristan , said US troops had withdrawn from the area , " leaving the district in the hands of only 20 policemen " .
" American troops have taken all heavy weapons out of the district , " he told the BBC .
" This is why we have lost the district to the Taleban because our police could n't defend it with one AK - 47 . "
However , the local police chief , Hazarat Ali , told the BBC : " Our police are still in the district , the elders are backing us .
We have not lost our district . "
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul says there are many of these small outposts scattered across eastern Afghanistan as part of the US counter - insurgency strategy which is being followed to the letter in this area .
Our correspondent says the idea is to get small groups of international troops and Afghan security forces out on the ground as a permanent presence to instil more confidence in the local people and show they can provide security , rather than just visiting the area on patrol .
The danger for Nato is they risk being outnumbered and attacked , or even overrun , as almost happened in the raid at the weekend .
There had been reports from Afghan local officials of civilian casualties caused by bombing in the aftermath of the attack on the base , but Nato also put out a statement denying this .
They said the only bombs dropped were more than 40 km ( 25 miles ) away from the villages named by local officials .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON 
An industry group says a record 9.2 % of American homeowners with a mortgage were either behind on their payments or in foreclosure at the end of June , as damage from the housing crisis continued to mount .
The latest quarterly snapshot by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Friday broke records for late payments , homes entering the foreclosure process and for the inventory of loans in foreclosure .
The percentage of loans at least 30 days past due or in foreclosure was up from 8.8 % in the January - March quarter , and up from 6.5 % a year earlier .
In one bit of positive news , delinquencies on subprime adjustable - rate loans dipped 1 percentage point from the first quarter to 21 % .
The seasonally adjusted foreclosure starts rate , the percentage of loans that entered the foreclosure process during the April - June quarter , was 1.19 % , up from 0.99 % in the first three months of 2008 and 0.65 % in the second quarter of 2007 .
The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process at the end of the second quarter was 2.75 % , up from 2.47 % in the first quarter and from 1.40 % in the second quarter of 2007 .
" The national foreclosure numbers continue to be driven by the hardest - hit states continuing to get much worse , " Jay Brinkmann , the association 's chief economist and senior vice president for research and economics , said in a news release .
The increases in foreclosures in California and Florida overwhelmed improvements in states such as Texas , Massachusetts and Maryland , he said .
For the quarter , a majority of the states saw relatively little change one way or the other , with California and Florida alone accounting for 39 % of all of the foreclosures started in the country during the second quarter and 73 % of the increase in foreclosures between the first and second quarters , he said .
The U.S. mortgage delinquency rate of 6.41 % was the highest since at least 1979 , which was when the trade group began its current method of measuring failing home loans .
The increase in the overall delinquency rate was driven by increases in the number of loans 90 or more days past due , primarily in California and Florida .
The 30 - day delinquency percentage remains below levels seen as recently as 2002 , the MBA said .

A date has not been set for the wedding but friends expect it to take place in April , although exactly where remains a mystery .
" The world is her oyster , " her close friend and bridesmaid - to - be Jo Ferguson said yesterday .
" It 's really good news for her .
They have been going out for a while now and she really loves him .
She deserves this . "
Two years ago the Herald revealed Hinze was the mystery blonde dubbed the " Aussie angel " spotted aboard the Texan 's $ 100 million super - yacht , the Athena .
She and Mr Clark cruised the waters of French Polynesia , stopping at Tahiti , Bora Bora and Rangiroa .
In March , Hinze spoke for the first time about her relationship with the father and grandfather , admitting she did not expect to fall in love with a man so many years her senior .
" I never thought I was going to date an older man when I first met him , " she told The Australian Women 's Weekly .
" To me , it was different to hang out with someone with something to say that was so interesting and important and who was truly , incredibly intelligent .
He 's handsome and has so much charisma - and he 's so funny . "
Mr Clark met Hinze in 2006 , about the same time he paid more than $ US125 million to his third wife , the former Forbes reporter Nancy Rutter , to whom he had been married for 15 years .
At the time court papers showed the settlement gave Rutter $ US100 million in cash , stocks , bonds and securities at Goldman Sachs ; $ US23 million in farmland ; a $ US1 million home in New Orleans ; a $ US600,000 stake in the ownership of a Cessna Citation V jet ; an undisclosed number of horses ; and an undisclosed amount in jewellery , furniture and personal effects .
At the time Mr Clark told the Palm Beach Post : " I 'm not getting married again .
Or if I do , it 'll be with a pre-nup . "
Throughout American history , the number of blind rabbis serving in Congress has remained steady at zero .
In a cluttered campaign office next to the Naturoll sushi takeout in Haworth , New Jersey , Dennis Shulman is trying to change that .
Shulman , who is fifty - eight , has a snowy beard and a sunny disposition .
“ I ’m going down to Atlantic City later today to meet with the building - trades guys , and I love them , ” he said the other day , surrounded by a roomful of volunteers .
“ I do n’t think of my life as the sacred and the profane .
I just think of it as expanding my pulpit . ”
Shulman grew up in a family of modest means in Worcester , Massachusetts .
When he was five , he received a diagnosis of bilateral optic atrophy , a nerve disorder that gradually diminished his sight until , about a decade later , he was totally blind .
Nevertheless , through high school he worked afternoons and summers at a toy factory .
“ I wrapped up little plastic brooms and little pans , so little girls would grow up to be housewives , ” he said .
“ The guy who ran the factory was highly regarded at the national level , because he hired the handicapped .
The only problem was that he paid minimum wage , eighty - five cents an hour , which was fine with me , but not with the thirty - five - year - old working next to me . ”
Shulman graduated from Brandeis in 1972 , and four years later he got a doctorate in clinical psychology from Harvard .
His wife , Pam , was in medical school in New York , and eventually they set up practices in the city , hers as an obstetrician and his as a therapist to adults and couples .
In 1981 , they moved to New Jersey , where they raised two daughters , one of whom now works in Texas politics .
“ When I was in college , I thought I was going to be a rabbi when I grew up , but I had a spiritual crisis in my freshman year , when my high - school girlfriend died of leukemia , ” Shulman said .
“ But the feeling never disappeared , and about ten or fifteen years ago I started giving lectures to psychoanalysts about Bible stories , starting with Abraham and Isaac .
My friends could see before I could that I was heading back to my old ambition . ”
Ordained in 2003 , Shulman conducts services every Saturday before a small congregation in the town of Alpine .
Even with two careers , he was restless .
While teaching a course on the theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel , he became haunted by Heschel ’s remark “ To speak about God and remain silent on Vietnam is blasphemous . ”
“ I read that and said , ‘ Oh , shit , I have to run for office , ’ ” Shulman recalled .
“ Besides , my wife was sick of me almost throwing my shoe at the television . ”
Shulman , a Democrat , is running in New Jersey ’s Fifth Congressional District , which includes such suburbs as Ridgewood and Tenafly , in Bergen County , and some rural communities along the Pennsylvania border .
Since 2002 , the incumbent has been Scott Garrett , a Republican with the most conservative voting record of any member of the House from the Northeast .
“ He ’s a Neanderthal , ” Shulman said .
( Garrett declined to comment . )
Starting as an unknown in the district , Shulman won sixty - one per cent of the vote in the June primary against two candidates , Camille Abate and Roger Bacon .
( “ My favorite headline from the primary was ‘ BLIND RABBI ’S OPPONENT IS BACON , ’ ” Shulman said . )
Like New Jersey as a whole , the district has been leaning Democratic in recent years , but in 2006 Garrett won with fifty - five per cent of the vote .
Still , the Congressional Quarterly has upgraded Shulman ’s chances , changing the district ’s rating from “ Safe Republican ” to “ Republican Favored . ”
Yet getting attention from the New York media for a corner of New Jersey is difficult .
“ The people in my district know what Mike Bloomberg eats for breakfast , but they do n’t know Garrett ’s voting record , ” Shulman said .
Shulman makes few concessions to his blindness ; he uses a device that instantly translates Web sites and e-mail into Braille and audio .
And he recognizes that the novelty of his candidacy helps draw attention .
There has never been a rabbi in Congress , and its last blind members left office in 1941 .
Not long ago , Shulman received an encouraging phone call from David Paterson , the governor of New York , who is also visually impaired .
“ We agreed that there should be a conspiracy by the blind to take over all levels of government , ” Shulman said . ♦

And the saga continues …
Yes , I know this Led Zeppelin reunion crap has been going on for too long .
Ever since their infamous O2 gig , things have been hectic , to say the least .
First the band met for some talks in January , then various people began to hint towards a reforming and even possibly a new album !
This despite their long time frontman , Robert Plant , denied the whole things repeatedly , because he wants to concentrate on his solo career .
He ’s got a good thing on his own now , and we should all respect his decision .
However , who says Led Zeppelin needs
Plant in the first way ?
Sure , he ’s part of the heart and should of the band , but just like the replaced John Bonham on drums at O2 , just as well he can also be expendable .
If your memory serves you well , just a few months ago , at Wembley Stadium , John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page joined Dave Grohl on stage to play a few Led tracks .
Dave , of course , performed vocals .
This gives even more credit to the thought , speculation , whatever you want to call it , that Led Zeppelin is going to reform under a new lineup ( read new singer ) .
The highest possible contender to the title , according to the latest rumors that ’ve been buzzing around lately , is Myles Kennedy the current lead singer for Alter Bridge ( an alt rock group mostly composed of ex-Creed members ) and former vocalist of The Mayfield Four .
The rumors about him being the next Led frontman have sprung up after Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider , thanks to his connections in the music industry , stated that Kennedy has a big chance of singing for Led in case Plant is still reluctant .
Recently , Plant totally dismissed once and for all any ‘ silly ’ reunion rumors , through an internet message , where he said he ’s not looking for any touring , especially since he just wrapped one on October 5th , after traveling the world with Alison Krauss .
“ Robert has no intention whatsoever of touring with anyone for at least the next two years .
Contrary to a spate of recent reports , Robert Plant will not be touring or recording with LED ZEPPELIN .
Anyone buying tickets online to any such event will be buying bogus tickets ”
Dee Snider recently appeard on Much Music ‘s “ Where Yout At Baby ” show , once again confirming the rumors on national television , that Led will be fronted by Kennedy .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , the kid is fantastic !
He ’s got a golden voice and I ’m sure he can sing the hell out of any Led songs , maybe , pardon my blasphemy , even better then Plant himself .
The issue , however , is that it ’s NOT Plant .
I mean , are we so desperate for a Led Zeppelin reunion , that we do n’t care anymore who ’s up there , on the stage ?
Would any of you buy a ticket to a Led / Kenney show ?
That ’s what I want and need to know .
Bellow is a video of Alter Bridge ’s Broken Wings .
John McCrea of Plaxo has written a cleverly titled guest post on TechCrunchIT , Facebook Connect and OpenID Relationship Status : “ It ’s Complicated ” , where he makes the argument that Facebook Connect is a competing technology to OpenID but the situation is complicated by Facebook developers engaging in discussions with the OpenID .
He writes
You see , it ’s been about a month since the first implementation of Facebook Connect was spotted in the wild over at CBS ’s celebrity gossip site , TheInsider.com .
Want to sign up for the site ?
Click a single button .
A little Facebook window pops up to confirm that you want to connect via your Facebook account .
One more click – and you ’re done .
You ’ve got a new account , a mini profile with your Facebook photo , and access to that subset of your Facebook friends who have also connected their accounts to TheInsider .
Oh , and you can have your activities on TheInsider flow into your Facebook news feed automatically .
All that , without having to create and remember a new username / password pair for the site .
Why , it ’s just like the vision for OpenID and the Open Stack – except without a single open building block under the hood !
...
After the intros , Allen Tom of Yahoo , who organized the event , turned the first session over Max Engel of MySpace , who in turn suggested an alternative – why not let Facebook ’s Julie Zhuo kick it off instead ?
And for the next hour , Julie took us through the details of Facebook Connect and the decisions they had to make along the way to get the user interface and user experience just right .
It was not just a presentation ; it was a very active and engaged discussion , with questions popping up from all over the room .
Julie and the rest of the Facebook team were engaged and eager to share what they had learned .
What the heck is going on here ?
Is Facebook preparing to go the next step of open , switching from the FB stack to the Open Stack ?
Only time will tell .
But one thing is clear : Facebook Connect is the best thing ever for OpenID ( and the rest of the Open Stack ) .
Why ?
Because Facebook has set a high bar with Facebook Connect that is inspiring everyone in the open movement to work harder and faster to bring up the quality of the UI / UX for OpenID and the Open Stack .
There are a number of points worth discussing from the above excerpt .
The first is the implication that OpenID is an equivalent technology to Facebook Connect .
This is clearly not the case .
OpenID just allows you to delegate to act of authenticating a user to another website so the user does n't need to create credentials ( i.e. username + password ) on your site .
OpenID alone does n't get you the user 's profile data nor does it allow you to pull in the authenticated user 's social graph from the other site or publish activities to their activity feed .
For that , you would need other other " Open brand " technologies like OpenID Attribute Exchange , Portable Contacts and OpenSocial .
So it is fairer to describe the contest as Facebook Connect vs. OpenID + OpenID Attribute Exchange + Portable Contacts + OpenSocial .
The question then is who should we root for ?
At the end of the day , I do n't think it makes a ton of sense for websites to have to target umpteen different APIs that do the same thing instead of targeting one standard implemented by multiple services .
Specifically , it seems ridiculous to me that TheInsider.com will have to code against Facebook Connect to integrate Facebook accounts into their site but code against something else if they want to integrate MySpace accounts and yet another API if they want to integrate Linked In accounts and so on .
This is an area that is crying out for standardization .
Unfortunately , the key company providing thought leadership in this area is Facebook and for now they are building their solution with proprietary technologies instead of de jure or de facto ( " Open brand " ) standards .
This is unsurprising given that it takes three or four different specs in varying states of completeness created by different audiences deliver the scenarios they are currently interested in .
What is encouraging is that Facebook developers are working with OpenID implementers by sharing their knowledge .
However OpenID is n't the only technology needed to satisfy this scenario and I wonder if Facebook will be similarly engaged with the folks working on Portable Contacts and OpenSocial .
Facebook Connect is a step in the right direction when it comes to bringing the vision of social network interoperability to fruition .
The key question is whether we will see effective open standards emerge that will target the same scenarios [ which eventually even Facebook could adopt ] or whether competitors will offer their own proprietary alternatives ?
So far it sounds like the latter is happening which means unnecessary reinvention of the wheel for sites that want to support " connecting " with multiple social networking sites .
PS : If OpenID phishing is a concern now when the user is redirected to the ID provider 's site to login , it seems Facebook Connect is even worse since all it does is provide a pop over .
I wonder if this is because the Facebook folks think the phishing concerns are overblown .

As you age , your mitochondria become ever more damaged and dysfunctional , a process that causes further biochemical damage throughout your body , and is in fact an important component of aging .
cells entirely populated with damaged mitochondria start churning out large quantities of free radicals - through another , more forceful mechanism - into the body at large .
That 's a path to age - related degeneration and fatal conditions like atherosclerosis .
The free radical theory of aging is based upon the harm done to tissues , structures and processes by these damaging biochemicals .
Can ongoing mitochondrial degeneration be slowed ?
Well , yes - calorie restriction appears to slow down every catalogued aspect of aging , and evidence suggests that regular exercise is just about as good for everything except extending maximum species longevity .
But can we do better than this for failing mitochondria via new medical technologies ?
I stumbled over recent research that suggests there are comparatively simple genetic changes that will slow the rate at which your mitochondria cause the damage that leads to aging :
Doing something about the decay of mitochondrial function has a number of evident benefits , as demonstrated above .
But slowing things down is a second rate strategy at best - especially if it involves genetic engineering , a technology unlikely to be in widespread use for humans for another ten to twenty years .
A slowing of damage does little for those who are already damaged and aged .
What we really want to be capable of achieving is reversal of existing damage - to be able to restore old and damaged mitochondria to a pristine state .
This goal is unlikely to be any more expensive or time - consuming than engineering a slowing of mitochondrial decay , so it should be the first priority .
If you look back in the Fight Aging ! and Longevity Meme archives , you 'll find mention of a range of potential technologies at varying stages of research :

Making love to Madonna ' was like cuddling a piece of gristle '
A gaunt - looking Madonna was seen leaving the Kabbalah Centre in New York on Saturday .
Wearing shades and a baseball cap it seemed the marriage break - up was taking its toll on the 50 - year - old mega - star .
But the pop queen 's obsession with maintaining a perfect body has been cited as one of the factors behind her split with Guy Ritchie .
Madonna appeared gaunt as she left the Kabbalah Centre in New York on Saturday
Her insistence on sticking to a gruelling four - hour exercise routine has been blamed for destroying the pair 's seven - and - a - half year marriage .
The strict regime reportedly meant the couple went for 18 months without making love .
When they did find time to make love , it was like ' cuddling up to a piece of gristle ' , Ritchie is said to have told friends .
Madonna 's exercise regime reportedly meant her and husband Guy Ritchie went for 18 months without making love
A close friend told the News of the World : ' When the cracks began to show in their marriage , Madonna would n't budge .
' Guy was pleading with her to spend more time with him but she would n't have it .
She 'd insist she did her four - hour workout and that would be half the day gone . '
' They 've been apart so much in the last two years the times when they could have made love have been pretty limited .
' And they 've been in separate bedrooms a lot after rows so there has been no making - up .
They might as well be brother and sister . '
' All the soft feminine tones have been replaced by the build of an athlete . '
Another fighting point in their marriage was Madonna 's devotion to the mystic religion Kabbalah .
Ritchie , 40 , is said to have walked out of a marriage counselling meeting with rabbis after they suggested he should always be subordinate to his wife 's wishes .
The source said : ' Guy thinks it is just mumbo jumbo .
He was appalled she wanted the religion to intervene . '
He is said to have become disillusioned with the religion which he had originally embraced to please Madonna .
Film producer Ritchie is said to be resigned to the fact that Madonna will begin openly dating New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez .
Sources say the pop star is preparing to go public about her friendship with baseball player A - Rod when her world tour ends in December .
Kabbalah leaders are said to have given their blessing to the friendship after Rodriguez threw himself into the religion .
Exercise obsession : Ritchie is said to have compared Madonna 's gym - toned body to ' a piece of gristle '
Madonna also recently sneaked the multi-millionaire into a front row seat at her gig which had previously been reserved for her husband .
An insider told the Sunday Mirror : ' Alex is bewitched by her .
She is a very intoxicating woman and it seems she has offered him a pathway to happiness and enlightenment through Kabbalah .
' He thinks she is phenomenal , but his friends are n't sure they have much in common . '
Rodriguez 's wife Cynthia filed for divorce in July this year , citing Madonna as one of his many infidelities .
She is said to have found a letter to Madonna in which Rodriguez ' called her his ' soulmate ' .
Madonna , worth around £ 300 million , has agreed Ritchie will have full access to their sons , eight - year - old Rocco and adopted David Banda , three .
The singer also has a daughter Lourdes , 12 , by fitness trainer Carlos Leon .
Ritchie's £ 10 million divorce settlement will see him own Ashcombe House , their 1,200 acre £ 10 million estate in Wiltshire , while Madonna will keep the couple 's £ 7 million townhouse in Marylebone in central London .
The following guest post on measuring a blog ’s success has been submitted by Mark Seall .
A guide to systematically troubleshooting your blog ’s performance by focusing on the measures that make a difference .
Apparently it ’s really easy to get zillions of subscribers to your blog – Just follow a few simple steps , work hard and write good stuff .
I know this , because I read it every week on various pro-blogging sites which are keen to dispense the wisdom of their own success whilst making you feel inferior for having less than 20,000 RSS subscribers .
Unfortunately for many of us , the promise of multiple thousands of subscribers is unrealistic no matter how hard we try – sometimes because we work in less popular niches , sometimes because we just do n’t have the available time , and sometimes because we just do n’t have that magic mix of talent and luck .
Ultimately this leads to frequent disappointment among bloggers .
Many of the bloggers I speak with are at a loss as to how to increase traffic , enviously regarding the multi- thousand subscriber club .
Blogging is not a hobby or a profession for those without perseverance .
The reason that we obsess over our statistics
The only reason so many of us obsess over our statistics is because page views and subscriber numbers are the most obvious ways to measure our success .
But are they really ?
A business that only measures itself by its profits is unlikely to be successful in the long term .
Profits are obviously important , but profit is only one measurement of success , and crucially , it is an outcome not a determiner .
Outcomes are the things that ultimately we are judged by , but they do n’t tell you anything about the underlying factors which will make future success possible , and which are making current success difficult .
For example , a firm which is making roaring profits today is a poor investment if their products are so bad that few of their customers return tomorrow .
A blog might have 10,000 hits today from social media , but that ’s hardly a success if visitors do n’t find any reason to return the next day .
So how can we measure ourselves
To truly understand and address what ’s driving your success it is necessary to understand the web of relationships between the different determiners which lead to the outcomes that you are looking for .
The diagram below shows the network of measurable items which make up these relationships , showing how each is interconnected .
Some of these measures can be determined by statistics and some require a little more subjective judgement .
What ’s important to grasp initially are the actual outcomes in which you are interested .
Measures marked in red represent these outcomes .
If you blog for money , then obviously ad - revenue is the most important outcome for you .
But if you blog only for pleasure then perhaps your level of reader engagement ( which can be determined largely by comments ) is more important to you ?
If your blog is part of a longer term plan , then perhaps generating kudos within the blogging community is your best measure of success ?
Next , consider ( or do n’t consider ) the things which you ca n’t influence directly – such as page views .
There is nothing you can do to directly influence these , so to a large extent you should n’t waste time worrying about them .
However , do n’t ignore them completely .
These determiners can provide you with useful information as to why your blog is not performing as expected .
For example , if you have few new visitors each month ( often the case after the first few months ) then perhaps you are getting poor search engine placement , or you are lacking in inbound links ?
If a quick check on Google shows that you are lacking in links , then perhaps it is time to re-focus on community interaction again ?
It is important to troubleshoot poor results in a systematic way to avoid firing random shots in the dark .
Finally , put all of your energy into the green items – the things that you can influence .
Time and energy are always at a premium among bloggers , and it is usually unrealistic to expect that anybody can focus on everything .
However , properly understanding all of the current performance measurements of your blog , and how they interact , will allow you to choose where to focus for the best results .
It ’s worth noting that things which have multiple connections have a greater influence on downstream results – hence the constant emphasis on quality content .
Final thoughts
In reality , most bloggers ( myself included ) will continue to obsess over page views and find it difficult to walk past the computer without stopping to check on stats .
However , putting a bit more focus on the wider measures of success can often delay the onset of the ‘ blogging blues ’ and give you the motivation to create that great content that we all love reading .
The deal calls for the U.S. Federal Reserve to lend up to $ 85 billion to AIG for two years in exchange for that 79.9 percent equity stake .
AIG will pay interest at a steep 8.5 percentage points above the three - month London Interbank Offered Rate , making the current rate equal to about 11.4
percent .
This gives AIG a big incentive to embark on a massive asset sale program to pay back the loan quickly .
The deal also severely dilutes existing shares of the company .
Index futures pointed to a higher market open on Wednesday after the news .
Former Allstate Corp CEO
Edward Liddy will be named the new chief executive of AIG , replacing Robert B. Willumstad .
AIG had been racing against the clock to avoid a bankruptcy filing on Wednesday , making efforts to work out a deal with the Federal Reserve to shore up its finances .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke met with Senate and House leadership Tuesday night to discuss how to assist AIG , sources said .
The Fed 's financial aid for the troubled insurer marks a reversal of its decision on Monday to refuse a bridge loan to AIG .
The death watch is on for Eta Carinae , a relatively nearby massive star that ’s set to explode as a supernova .
The Chandra X - Ray Observatory delivered this beautiful photograph of the star and its surrounding nebula ; layers of material that it ’s already shed in its death throes .
When it does explode , Eta Carinae is going to be spectacular .
It ’s thought to have between 100 and 150 times the mass of our own Sun .
Not only that , it ’s a mere 7,500 light years away .
Its brilliant display of fireworks will rival the light of the full Moon , and should be easy to see in the middle of the day ; you could read a book by it at night .
So when ’s it going to blow ?
Well , astronomers disagree on this point .
The majority think that Eta Carinae has one final stage to go through , called a Wolf - Rayet star .
Others think it ’s already passed this stage , and it ’s ready to go .
It could explode tomorrow , or it could be 100,000 years away .
Still , that ’s a blink of the eye cosmically speaking .

Excuse me , but when did the words “ Muslim ” and “ Arab ” become acceptable epithets ?
I ’m not a Muslim , and perhaps I was slow to see this coming .
Four months ago , I blithely advised a group at a local mosque not to obsess over the anti-Muslim undertones of the presidential campaign .
At that point , Barack Obama was defending his Christian bona fides against “ accusations ” of “ being a Muslim ” ( as if it had suddenly become a Class - D felony ) , but was doing so without condemning the implicit slurs against Islam , Muslims and Arabs .
In a “ do n’t worry , be happy ” tone , I breezily noted that although the stoking of racial fear and xenophobia was a cherished tradition of American politics , I really did n’t think that this time around the candidates would permit the wholesale slander of Islam or Muslims .
Apparently , I was wrong .
The undertones have become screaming overtones .
And it is past time to object .
If it was n’t clear before , it became crystal clear last week in the aftermath of Republican rallies .
Fomenting fear to shore up drooping support , Republicans sadly used heated demagoguery about “ palling around with terrorists , ” about “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and about how Obama does n’t “ see America like you and I , ” words that mixed subliminally to conflate “ terror ” with “ Muslim ” and to whip crowds into xenophobic anger .
After his enraged supporters were recorded uttering death threats and racial slurs , McCain was forced on several occasions to try to tamp down the anger in the audience and to defend his opponent .
That was a good step one -- until McCain blew it .
A woman stood up in the audience and said that she just could n’t trust Obama because , as she put it , “ he ’s an Arab . ” McCain shook his head , took the microphone and said : “ No , ma’am .
He ’s a decent family man , citizen , that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . ”
So , what is he saying ?
Arabs are n’t decent family men ?
They ca n’t be citizens ?
The fact is , neither McCain nor Obama -- who continues to combat absurd attacks on his Americanness -- has been willing to speak out against the implicit slurs against Arabs and Islam .
Is it really too difficult for Obama to respond : “ For the hundredth time , I am a Christian , and if you are suggesting that there is something wrong with Islam or being a Muslim , you are wrong ” ?
Would it be so hard for McCain to say : “ There is no room in my campaign or in America for religious or ethnic intolerance -- that ’s what we ’re fighting against ” ?
Maybe I missed the denunciations amid all the hoopla over field - dressing moose , but it looks like the next ice age will arrive before the NAACP , the National Conference of Christians and Jews or the Anti-Defamation League loudly objects to the implicit defamation of Muslims and Arabs that has seeped into this presidential campaign .
Women rightly protested gender bias during Hillary Clinton ’s run , but we failed to strongly challenge the earlier bias against Mormons during Mitt Romney ’s bid , and we are currently failing to refute the anti-Muslim bias embedded in the assaults on Obama .
It is a failure we need to correct now .
Constance L. Rice is a civil rights attorney in Los Angeles .
YouTube said it believed it was a safe environment for children YouTube has been criticised by MPs , who say it must do more to vet its content .
In a review of net safety , the Culture , Media and Sport select committee said a new industry body should be set up to protect children from harmful content .
It also said it should be " standard practice " for sites hosting user - generated content to review material proactively .
YouTube 's owners said the site had strict rules and a system that allowed users to report inappropriate content .
The committee also wants a rethink on how best to classify video games - but there is disagreement over who should run the new ratings system .
MPs say the same body which gives age ratings to films - the British Board of Film Classification - should be in charge , but the games industry supports its own voluntary code .
Effective
In its report , the committee said that some websites it had monitored as part of its review had a " lax " approach to removing illegal content .
It said it was " shocked " that the industry standard for removing child abuse images was 24 hours .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Google , the firm which owns YouTube , said it was confident the video - sharing site was safe for children .
" We have strict rules on what 's allowed , and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly , " said a spokesman .
A direct link from every YouTube page makes the process easy , he added .
" Given the volume of content uploaded on our site , we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly , " he said .
The committee acknowledged that the volume of content on sites such as YouTube - which has 10 hours of videos uploaded every minute - made it unrealistic to watch every video before it went online .
But , it said that the practice of removing clips only after they are flagged up by users was not working either .
Dark side Self regulation had resulted in an " unsatisfactory piecemeal approach which lacks consistency and transparency , " the committee concluded .
While it recommended the creation of an industry body responsible for policing the web , it stopped short of making regulation mandatory .
The body - likely to be known as the child internet safety council - will be set up later this year .
" The internet has transformed our lives and is overwhelmingly a force for good .
However there is a dark side and many parents are rightly anxious , " said committee chairman John Whittingdale .
A clip of a gang rape on YouTube was used as one example of the " dark side " of the net .
Other sites which promote extreme diets , self - harm and suicide were also cited .
YOUR COMMENTS ON CALLS TO VET ONLINE CONTENT
I totally agree with video sites being more aware of what they put on their sites .
I was looking at YouTube a few months back and was disgusted to find a video showing 2 men cruelly treating an elephant by sticking hooks into it 's back .
This made me feel sick and very angry because YouTube always say they monitor content but they clearly do not .
Sarah , Birmingham , UK Yet again the Government is sticking its nose in where it does n't belong .
What kids see on the net is an issue for their parents .
When my son is old enough he will get free reign on the net as I did when I was young .
Between now and then I shall be trying to teach him how to be safe , what not to do and why he should avoid certain places .
That 's my job as I 'm his parent .
David Combe , Edinburgh
Any content that I have seen on YouTube that I find offensive or inappropriate I immediately flag up .
This is the beauty of the internet which I do n't think MP 's fully appreciate .
The internet polices itself by and large ; monitoring legitimate websites like YouTube is simply a waste of money .
I 'm afraid this is an example of MPs who are behind the times and do n't really understand the relevance of new technology .
Thomas Sherborne , Cricklade
My son loves YouTube but I was shocked to discover that they have no language censorship .
I found him watching a SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon which someone had overdubbed with virtually every possible swear word and given pornographic overtures .
I am by no means a prude but I feel items with such content should at least carry a warning or have restricted access
Steve , Norwich , Norfolk
How about the parents have a go at vetting what their children see ?
Richard , Kent
This approach is completely wrong .
More legislation only creates more unenforceable laws , a greater drain on tax - payers ' money and a headache for everyone involved ( particularly the companies providing the service ) .
Parents should be educating their children about what 's acceptable and what 's not , maybe even teaching them to flag unacceptable content when they find it .
As long as young people want to get some kind of content legislation is n't going to stop them .
If they know to stay away from it that 's what 's going to make the difference .

Why does the net have to be censored just because some parents can't be bothered to control what their kids watch ?
Mike Williams , Truro Cornwall
YouTube is constantly full of very undesirable and shocking material and should adhere to the same standards as other media .
If the BBC or any other organisation was allowed to actively expose people to the same sort of stuff they would be closed down immediately .
The current system for screening or removing undesirable content simply does not work and should be reformed or YouTube punished if it does not clean up it 's act .
That 's what would happen to other media organisations .

Google Inc. Chief Executive Eric Schmidt will hit the campaign trail this week on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , signaling Mr. Schmidt 's push for a greater voice in politics while giving the Obama campaign a boost from a highly desirable constituency .
Although the Internet - search company has numerous issues pending on Capitol Hill , Mr. Schmidt said in an interview that " I 'm doing this personally , " adding that " Google is officially neutral " in the campaign .
Mr ....
ONLY ELITISTS CARE ABOUT PRONUNCIATION ….
Barack Obama pronounces “ Pakistan ” correctly , with a soft “ a , ” just like a lot of people who know what they ’re talking about , including Gen. David Petraeus .
Apparently , having completely run out of compelling policy arguments to make , some high - profile conservatives have decided to make this their latest campaign hobbyhorse .
The National Review ’s Mark Stein , for example , said that Obama prefers the “ exotic pronunciation . ”
He added , “ [ O ] ne thing I like about Sarah Palin is the way she says ‘ Eye - raq ’ . ”
This came after the National Review ’s Kathryn Jean Lopez posted an email that argued , “ [ N ] o one in flyover country says Pock - i - stahn .
It ’s annoying . ”
The inanity of what the right decides to whine about never ceases to amaze me .
That Obama ’s pronunciation is accurate is irrelevant .
Mispronunciation apparently makes some conservatives feel better about themselves , and raises doubts about candidates who care to get this right .
“ Elites ” care about country names ; real Americans do n’t .
My friend Adam Serwer ’s take was spot-on :
To pronounce something correctly is to be “ ostentatiously exotic , ” while pronouncing something incorrectly is raised to the level of something like a presidential qualification .
Meanwhile , there are thousands of Americans of Pakistani descent who are themselves “ ostentatiously exotic ” by virtue of their names ( and it would be elitist of them to expect anyone to pronounce them correctly ) and ancestry .
Keep in mind that these are the same people who insist that a culture of ignorance that hold black people back while lauding Sarah Palin ’s vast ignorance of public policy as some kind of tremendous virtue .
They demand merit from others and only mediocrity from themselves , because said mediocrity is touted as proof of authenticity .
The right ’s anti-intellectualism seems to be getting worse , does n’t it ?
Apple Inc. is donating $ 100,000 to fight Proposition 8 , which seeks to end same - sex marriage in California by amending the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman .
" Apple was among the first California companies to offer equal rights and benefits to our employees ' same - sex partners , and we strongly believe that a person 's fundamental rights - including the right to marry - should not be affected by their sexual orientation , " the company said Friday in a statement on its Web site .
Apple joins Google , which came out publicly against Prop. 8 last month .
Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page reportedly have donated a combined $ 140,000 to fight the measure .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
In revealing its support , Google officials voiced similar points , saying the company sees the issue as one of equality and is opposed to the elimination of fundamental rights .
" While we respect the strongly held beliefs that people have on both sides of this argument , we see this fundamentally as an issue of equality .
We hope that California voters will vote no on Proposition 8 - we should not eliminate anyone 's fundamental rights , whatever their sexuality , to marry the person they love , " Brin said .
It is not common practice for either company to take a stand on political measures .
It remains to be seen what effect the move might have on Proposition 8 supporters , who might avoid doing business with companies that oppose the measure .
Kingpins of Military - Industrial complex say they will " brand " websites they consider " trustworthy and reliable sources of information "
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
September 15 , 2008
A foundation populated by the giants of business , banking , government and military wants to " vet " websites and limit the spread of information that it says creates " conspiracy theories " .
The World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , fronted by Internet creator Sir Tim Berners - Lee , says it is worried about the way the web has been " used to spread disinformation " .
Speaking to the BBC , Berners - Lee said that there needed to be a new system that would give websites a " label for trustworthiness " once they had been proved reliable sources .
Only then would the rise of " cult thinking " be avoided according to Berners - Lee .
" On the web the thinking of cults can spread very rapidly and suddenly a cult which was 12 people who had some deep personal issues suddenly find a formula which is very believable , " Berners - Lee said .
" A sort of conspiracy theory of sorts and which you can imagine spreading to thousands of people and being deeply damaging . "
Deeply damaging to who ?
one might ask .
The answer is revealed in the list of The World Wide Web Consortium ’s 400 plus members , the cream of the corporate world in conjunction with government agencies such as National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) and military entities like the Defense Information Systems Agency ( DISA ) .
Berners - Lee cites two examples of such " disinformation " or " conspiracy theories " in his interview with the BBC , both of which speak volumes about the aims and goals of this elite consortium :
Sir Tim talked to the BBC in the week in which Cern , where he did his pioneering work on the web , turned on the Large Hadron Collider for the first time .
The use of the web to spread fears that flicking the switch on the LHC could create a Black Hole that could swallow up the Earth particularly concerned him , he said .
In a similar vein was the spread of rumours that the MMR vaccine given to children in Britain was harmful .
First of all , the fears that the CERN atom smasher could create dangerous miniature black holes was not simply made up out of thin air by tin foil hat wearing kooks .
It was a theory cited by preeminent scientists such as Professor Otto Rössler , a German chemist at the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen , who were so worried they attempted to obtain an injunction from the European Court of Human Rights that would block the collider from being turned on at all .
A further lawsuit was filed by two American environmentalists in the Federal District Court in Honolulu who sought to force the U.S. government to withdraw its participation in the experiment .
The debate and furor over the LHC that followed was in reaction to legitimate news articles and reports surrounding the project and the opposition to it .
So you see , far from what the W3C would have you believe , the fears were not unfounded " conspiracy theories " pedaled by basement dwelling internet trolls .
But of course , that would n’t matter to W3C given that they proudly list CERN itself as one of their members , thus any dissenting or critical material would naturally be considered " disinformation " .
Example two , the " damaging conspiracy theory " that MMR
vaccines are harmful , stems not from paranoid forum postings and misquoted blog entries , but from scientific research into the mercury based preservative thimerosal , developed by Eli Lilly and subsequently used in the MMR vaccine , along with many other vaccines .
Another big pharma kingpin , Merck & Co. , Inc , is the world ’s largest supplier of the MMR triple jab , which was linked to autism a decade ago by scientists such as Dr Andrew Wakefield , amongst others .
Studies have shown a direct relationship between mercury in children ’s vaccines and autism .
Further studies have shown a decline in neurodevelopmental disorders after the removal of thimerosal - containing vaccines .
The preservative has been banned or limited in Europe , Japan , England and Russia .
Furthermore , there are no reported instances of autism amongst religious groups
such as the Amish community and very few instances are reported in the third world .
Autism was a practically unknown affliction some decades back , but now one in every 150 children is affected .
Mercury is the second most toxic metal known to man behind Uranium .
Thimerosal is used in vaccines not because it is good for you , but purely because it prevents vaccine contamination .
Yet some have questioned why thimerosal is even considered for vaccines because there are obviously safer alternatives to preventing contamination .
Many believe the only reason it is still in vaccines is that it allows substantial savings for pharmaceutical companies .
Questions also remain about how those companies conduct vaccine research and how the government regulates them .
While the corporate media continues to hype reports that contend the evidence for links between mercury laden vaccines and autism are not concrete , there are scores of studies and testimony from credible figures asserting the exact opposite , some of which we have previously covered in depth .
However , it is little wonder W3C considers such information to be " damaging " given that Eli Lilly and Merck & Co. , Inc. are both paid up and approved members of the Consortium !
Other W3C members include Novartis Pharma AG and Pfizer Inc. , two more giants of the pharmaceutical industry .
Though it is abundantly clear that the aim of the World Wide Web Consortium is to relegate and eventually eliminate any information that its corporate and government sector members consider dissenting , the BBC article concludes , " The Foundation will also look at concerns that the web has become less democratic , and its use influenced too much by large corporations and vested interests . "
The irony , the horrible horrible irony .
If anyone should be labeled with an " unreliable " rating , it is the WC3 , a private interest group with a client list of big pharma titans as long as your arm telling you that their multi million dollar vaccine industry is totally safe and that any dissenting scientific fact or opinion , is a damaging conspiracy theory .
The efforts of groups and movements such as W3C represent an ongoing move to reign in the internet and limit its freedom .
On weekly basis we at Infowars and Prisonplanet receive e mails from across the US and the UK from people who have attempted to visit our websites yet found them to be blocked by filtration software that lists them as " hate " or " violence " .
The sites are already categorized as " untrustworthy " on forums and social networks , despite the fact that 90 % of the material we post is made up of mainstream news articles .
This precedent is merely the first indication of what is planned for the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years , with the traditional web becoming little more than a vast spy database that catalogues people ’s every activity and bombards them with commercials , and where only government - approved websites that have obtained permission by means of an accepted registration application are allowed to be seen by web users .
Those who comply with centralized control and regulation of content will be free to enjoy the new super - fast Internet mark 2 , where DVD quality movies can be downloaded in seconds , but at the cost of the Internet losing its role as the last true outpost of freedom of speech .

During its weeklong deliberations , Congress made many changes to the Bush administration ’s original proposal to bail out the financial industry , but one overarching aspect of the initial plan that remains is the vast discretion it gives to the Treasury secretary .
The draft legislation , which will be put to a House vote on Monday , gives Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and his successor extraordinary power to decide how the $ 700 billion bailout fund is spent .
For example , if he thinks it wise , he may buy not only mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , but any other financial instrument .
To be sure , the Treasury secretary ’s powers have been tempered since the original Bush administration proposal , which would have given Mr. Paulson nearly unfettered control over the program .
There are now two separate oversight panels involved , one composed of legislators and the other including regulatory and administration officials .
Still , Mr. Paulson can choose to buy from any financial institution that does business in the United States , or from pension funds , with wide discretion over what he will buy and how much he will pay .
Under most circumstances , banks owned by foreign governments are not eligible for the money , but under some conditions , the secretary can choose to bail out foreign central banks .

Click to viewThere 's something about the big-box , flat - pack furniture phenomenon known as IKEA that attracts the DIY type , and it's not the 99 - cent breakfasts .
Cheap furniture broken into easy - to - swap parts lets you roll your own solutions to nearly anything lacking around your home , from bicycle space to a cheap desk to cord mess and way , way beyond .
With a nod to the IKEA Hacker blog , from which we 've drawn many great links , we 've assembled 10 of our favorite ways to do something different with IKEA kits and parts .
Ditch the instruction manual and read on for some great weekend projects .

Put together a four - leg desk by hand using one of the Allen wrenches IKEA throws in every box , and you 'll have an idea what Repetitive Strain Injury feels like .
If you 've got one left over from a previous project , IKEA or otherwise , consider snipping off the angled parts and sticking the long end into a drill .
Now you could chain - assemble a dozen funny - named desks , drawers and other furniture with nary a complaint , at least until the battery wears out .
9 . Make your workspace cordless .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
IKEA does n't have a cordless desk anywhere in their gigantic stores , but they do offer a $ 10 " Signum " under - desk attachment that makes elegantly cordless workspaces — like those detailed by Adam and Gina — darn simple .
Gina mounted hers under her desk next to an extra - wide , spaced - out power strip hung with some twisted wire .
Both guides explain their de-cording process in detail .

Rachael Ray espouses the time - saving and clean - making convenience of the " garbage bowl , " a container you shove all your scraps , rinds , small messes , and anything else destined for the trash or compost heap instead of running over to it .
If you agree , or tend to make a lot of salads or mixed dishes , embedding a stainless steel bowl into your counter or a wheeled butcher cart might make a lot of sense .
Easy to clean out , always available when needed , and it's one less dish you have to clean out after a serious meal .
It takes a fair deal of tool work , including router work , but it 's perfect for the butcher carts you occasionally see on sale at IKEA , Target , or any other big - box store .

If you 're not the type who likes to show off and explain their knife collection , a simple saw cut into any non-permanent rack can save you a good deal of counter or wall space .
One hacker thought it worked well on a $ 60 Bekvam cart , but if you were n't afraid to take a circular ( or band ) saw to your counter space , and you do n't have long - limbed kids to worry about , it makes for a nice quick - grab workspace in the kitchen .

This one 's more of an inspiration than a do - this - exactly project .
IKEA Hacker picks up a photo - filled forum post detailing how a few spare parts from IKEA furniture — picked up for cheap at the store or yanked from furniture on its way to the curb — can be made into a great place to stash your noise - canceling headphones .
The object - oriented parts from many IKEA kits can be put to similar problem - solving use , so it 's often worth keeping them in storage until inspiration strikes .

Need to stash two bikes with minimum floor space use ?
One clever craftsmen took $ 40 in parts from IKEA 's spare catalog — helpfully linked in the IKEA Hacker post — and a few easily - obtained materials to create a solid , economical rack for his two bicycles .
Not too hard , no welding required , and you can cut and shape it to fit your particular domicile .

When it comes down to it , your desk need not be much more than a slab that holds your work things which you can stand to look at .
Taking a cue from the college playbook , Jonas grabbed a door from the Pax closet system and made it into his workspace .
The door itself was n't all that wide , so he grabbed two Lack racks ( those weird , weird names ) and created a DIY desk he could be proud of .
It 's just a few screws and a bit of time between you and the same result , if you want it .

If you dig the idea of a box to contain all your power - hungry gadgets ( as illustrated below ) , but not the energy leeching ( or battery weakening ) of having your gear plugged in constantly , Instructables takes IKEA box - modding to a higher level .
It costs only a tiny bit more than the original , and leaves you with the dual good feelings of DIY accomplishment and eco-friendliness .
2 . Make your own custom charging station .
Advertisement
Many of IKEA 's smaller storage containers and desktop organizers can be converted into gadget / laptop charging stations that eliminate cord clutter and are often indistinguishable from the rest of your ( potentially ) orderly desk .
You can , for example , turn a $ 15 Estetisk compartmentalized storage bin into a wooden , laptop - gripping charge station .
If your gear goes somewhere other than your desk , a $ 3 plastic box conversion keeps your cables out of the way and your phones , MP3 players and other toys together .

No , you probably wo n't need six quad - core processors and the associated fans , RAM sticks , and motherboards for any project you 're working on ( or even dreaming of ) .
But freelance 3D animator Janne is an inspiring reminder that paying serious cash for the box your computer merely sits in is n't always necessary — especially when units like the $ 40 Helmer make for such nice CPU homes .
We 'd love to hear about or ( even better ) see pics of your own build - your - own furniture hacks , whether they draw from the Swedish Yellow Giant or elsewhere .
Share the links , pics , or how - tos in the comments .
The Arduino - based , DIY GamePack is sort of like the Mignon Game Kit we saw in 2005 , but it definitely looks much , much radder .
For a mere $ 249.93 , all the necessary parts -- CPU , " Inputshield " customizable , vibrating controller / button component ( say , for right or left - handed configurations ) , " TouchShield Stealth " OLED display unit , and " MeCap " lithium battery pack -- can be yours .
Once you 've cobbled it together , of course , the real fun begins -- it 's pretty much a blank slate with little more than code for a color - changing dot to start with , so if you want to play any " games " on that new " Game Boy " of yours , you 're going to have to write them yourself .

As I believe in freedom of opinion – as well as God – I have no problem with London 's buses carrying the slogan " There is probably no God " ; although I would admire the bravery of the advertisers more if they added " or Allah " .
But , if people want to contribute £ 100,000 to an advertising slogan – great .
It shows that capitalism ( and its adjunct , marketing ) works in the cause of freedom of opinion .
The best guarantee of freedom of expression is not a charter of rights or a bill of free speech , but diversity in media and communications .
I do n't agree with the slogan in question , but then I do n't agree with a lot of advertised opinions .
I know them to be bunkum , like the beauty creams that offer to " turn back time " .
I disbelieve such claims because they do not accord with my experience : such lotions have been employed for years , and time has marched relentlessly on .
The coda in the London bus secularist message " so relax and enjoy life " strikes me as bunkum rather on a par with beauty cream claims , and for the same reasons : it does not accord with my experience .
Far from relaxing and enjoying life , most atheists I have encountered are gloomy blighters with a depressing and nihilistic message that there is no purpose to life so where 's the point of anything ?
They so often fall into the category defined by GK Chesterton : " Those that do not have the faith / Will not have the fun . "
You only have to attend one of their dreary humanist funerals to see that – I am never going to another of those , just to be made miserable .
I 'm not against people having different opinions ; what I 'm against is people in influential positions never having their opinions challenged .
Far more nauseating than the open slogans on the London buses , subscribed to and paid for , are such phenomena as art installations by the likes of Gilbert and George consisting of the words " Ban religion " , over and over again .
They are then fawningly interviewed by a deferential Evan Davis on BBC Radio 4 , when they should be subjected to the same kind of rigour as John Humphrys doing over the chancellor of the exchequer .
Incidentally , if Gilbert and George had lived in a country which banned religion – Enver Hoxha 's Albania – they would have been dispatched to perform menial agricultural work , if not to a gulag .
In short , let us have discourse and debate about these matters of faith and non-faith .
Does it not say in St Paul : " Come , let us reason together " ?
Advertising is discourse : it is a form of communication which people are free to accept or reject .
It probably further stimulates debate .
It may even stimulate someone to write a book called " The Tolerant Atheist " , in which the author affirms that while he is not a believer himself , he accepts the evidence that for countless numbers , religious faith gets them through the night : and its beauty , language , optimism , music and architecture helps them relax and enjoy life .
If you need proof that this is the most important election in a generation , get this : Jewish grandkids are flying to Florida to visit their grandparents -- without being guilted into it -- to talk their elders out of voting for John McCain .
The Jewish Council for Education and Research -- a new pro-Obama political action committee -- is organizing “ The Great Schlep , ” in which hundreds of Jews will make the Southern exodus on Columbus Day weekend , Oct. 10 - 13 .
They will travel to the Fort Lauderdale area , where they will visit their grandparents , organize political salons in their condos and eat incredibly bad food .
The grandkids also will meet up at a bar one night , which -- if the psychological impact of spending a few days with frail , elderly , widowed relatives is taken fully into account -- may do more to repopulate the world ’s Jews than the creation of Israel .
More than hockey moms or gun-toting God lovers , old Floridian Jews are the most important demographic in this election .
They make up about 5 % of the voters in a swing state with 27 electoral college votes .
They never miss so much as a condo board vote and are normally reliable Democrats .
Barack Obama ’s trouble winning over older Jewish voters has been difficult for pollsters to explain , so I came here this week to visit my grandmother , Mama Ann , and find out what the hang - up is .
After a long discussion about policy , I asked her if the reason she was leaning toward voting for McCain was because Obama is black .
She assured me that it was not .
Though during dinner , she did casually mention that her grandfather used to express a superstition that if you ate marrow , you ’d date a black man .
I had no idea that for so many generations , Jews have hated marrow .

Mama
Ann thought the three days of the Great Schlep would be very effective .
“ Oh boy , the grandparents will start cooking three days ahead , ” she said , making me worry that many Schleppers wo n’t last through three days of canned pineapple and dry chicken .
“ If they see their grandchildren , they ’ll go along .
They just need more assurance on Israel . ”
Israel , Mama
Ann explained , is the key issue her condo friends vote on .
When McCain sings about bombing Iran , he is singing a sweet serenade to Florida ’s electoral collegians .
To persuade Mama Ann to vote for Obama , I used many of the talking points suggested to me by Great Schlep organizer Mik Moore .
These included the fact that Obama went to Columbia and Harvard , and McCain got bad grades in college ; that Obama has been criticized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson ; and that Obama ran the business side of his campaign better than any other candidate .
I did not know that I could be so racially offended by my own people .
After convincing Mama
Ann not to vote for McCain , I then had to persuade her not to write in Hillary Clinton , who the old Jews here love for her feisty , scrappy Estelle Getty - ness .
Feeling confident , I headed down to the condo Hadassah meeting , where I asked some people who they were voting for .
A few had Obama buttons in Hebrew .
One wanted to tell me how Lyndon Johnson helped the Jews more than people know .
Seven wanted to set me up with their granddaughters despite the fact that I was wearing my wedding ring .

But many more were sure Obama was Muslim and that extremist Arabs “ had his ear . ”
I strongly urge Obama to take one day off campaigning and go to a courthouse to legally change his middle name from “ Hussein ” to “ Seriously , People , I ’m Not a Muslim . ”
Having tackled the Hadassah meeting , I drove over to Palm Beach with Mama Ann to talk to her first cousin , Rochelle Bramsen .
When Rochelle ’s daughter and son - in - law , whom she lives with , argued for Obama , she bristled .
I joined in , and asked -- as suggested by the talking points -- if she inaccurately thought Obama was a Muslim .
Both Aunt Rochelle and Mama
Ann said yes , they thought he was .
When we all tired of arguing about that , I asked if it would be such a big deal if Obama were a Muslim .
This was , I quickly realized , not on the list of recommended talking points for good reason .
“ For me , personally , that would be an issue , ” said Rochelle .
Thinking we ’d trapped her in a rhetorical corner , her kids and I asked why Muslims in office would be worse than Christians .
To which Rochelle deftly responded , “ Who says I ’m OK with Christians ? ”
Rochelle was also upset that Obama did n’t wear an American flag lapel pin at first .
I asked Rochelle if she wore a flag pin .
“ No , but I expect more from our leaders , ” she said .
I am pretty sure Rochelle just does n’t trust anyone who does n’t wear at least some jewelry .

Still , by the end of our discussion , Rochelle seemed to have joined Mama Ann as an Obama supporter .
But there ’s a fair chance that by Columbus Day , both Mama Ann and Aunt Rochelle will have forgotten that .
So it ’s important that other grandchildren -- hopefully some who are vaguely my age and shape -- fly down here for the Great Schlep salons .
Even if they fail , they wo n’t be sorry : I saw a movie for $ 3.50 , had dinner for $ 10 and was treated like whatever the Jewish equivalent of a saint is by everyone in the condo complex just for stopping by .
I say we do this every Columbus Day .
Next year , hopefully , we ’ll be hanging poolside with retiree John McCain .

MIT E -Voting Project To Analyze Experience Of Voters in Election
As the election approaches , a question lingers with increasing urgency on the minds of concerned citizens : to e-vote or not to e-vote ?
The question , of course , cannot be defined so simplistically , as electronic voting refers to several types of voting that include electronic means of both casting and counting the vote .
These systems both present pluses and minuses , and have been the focus of a public backlash amid growing security problems .
Following the Florida fiasco of 2000 , the nation ’s recent rush to embrace e-voting has been hampered by controversy over issues of security , reliability , privacy , and cost .
The release earlier this month of a short video by a group of scientists at the University of California Santa Barbara showing how a single person can hack an election on a Sequoia touch - screen voting system undetectably is the latest in a series of such demonstrations over the past two years .
The hack demonstration also shows how the so - called “ security - seals ” placed on such machines after they have been programmed for an election can be easily defeated without detection .
These enormous flaws reinforce the insecurities surrounding the use of electronic voting technology and the need for better technology and legislation .
Amid growing evidence of security flaws and pressure to stop the use of similar systems in American elections , researchers at the Caltech - MIT Voting Technology Project are hard at work analyzing the security and impact of e-voting systems .
The Caltech - MIT Project
“ It ’s a general program that studies a lot of issues , including e-voting .
One of the issues we are working on is trying to figure out ways that voters can make sure their vote has been counted , without receiving a paper receipt , ” said Charles H. Stewart III , head of MIT ’s political science department and a member of the VTP faculty .
“ You do n’t want to carry a piece of paper around , ” he said in a telephone interview last week .
Established by the California Institute of Technology President David Baltimore and MIT President Charles M. Vest in December 2000 to respond to the need for academic guidance in the wake of the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election , the Caltech - MIT VTP seeks to improve voting in the United States through the use of the latest technologies .
Its tasks include evaluating the reliability and administrative practices of existing voting systems , establishing guidelines for their reliability and performance , and proposing standards for the design of new voting technologies .
Judging by the titles of the posts on the initiative ’s blog , they still have a lot of work to do .
“ Plan for the worst , ” the Election Assistance Commission urges in its Election Management Guidelines , and “ Voter Registration Problems Reported in Michigan , ” the blog quotes the Detroit Free Press as saying .
With regards to the upcoming election , MIT is trying to collect as much data as possible through two data - related projects of the Caltech - MIT initiative .
The first one is simply collecting the Election Day returns from the states , so that one can see the difference electronic voting machines made , Stewart said .
“ All states report information about the machines they use and the problems they encountered . ”
The other big data project is the development of the first large - scale public opinion poll of American voters to ask them about their experience with voting on Election Day .
“ We will sample over 10,000 voters , drawing samples in each state of the country .
So , we will be able to gauge not only how well the election went nationally , we will also be able to tell whether particular states offered special problems , or went especially well , ” Stewart said .
“ Another big project we are working on is trying to understand empirically all the things that are related to voting machines , ” Stewart said .
“ One thing we are trying to look at is voting machines not recording the votes people have made .
As what happened in Florida in 2004 when the votes had to be re-counted , some machines are more prone to break down , more prone to confuse voters .
That ’s what we study , ” he said .
“ It ’s an issue we call ‘ lost ballots ’ . ”
Auditing the election — a tricky task
As for whether MIT will try to audit this election , the MIT project is not an auditing project per se , Stewart said .
“ Some of us on the Caltech - MIT Project will be doing analyses after the election to try and understand the role that voting technologies played in the results of the election , which will have some characteristics of an audit , ” he said .
“ It ’s a term that ’s being thrown around a lot , ” he added .
“ What my colleagues are going to do is research nationwide to see if the machines that are set up nationwide are prone to break down .
That ’s more a statistical task , ” he added .
Auditing can at times be theoretical , and at times applied , Stewart said .
“ The amount of data that is produced is enormous . ”
Thus , he continued , “ it ’s physically impossible for a human being to take a look at every single paper ballot , ” which is what people usually refer to when they talk about “ auditing ballots . ”
Ronald L. Rivest , professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of the VTP faculty , is doing research on auditing , elections and cryptography — a technology some voting systems use to ensure that votes were cast correctly , detect possible fraud or malfunction , and provide a means to audit the original machine .
Rivest , who is also a member of the technical advisory board of the Election Commission , which regulates voting , is currently working on a system that sample precincts .
In an interview , he stressed that MIT is not doing research on paperless voting systems .
“ My own research does not involve paperless voting systems , although paper can be used in a variety of ways to improve a voting system .
A purely electronic voting system would typically not be ‘ software independent , ’ and so you would have to trust that the software is correct and unmodified in order to have confidence that the election result is correct , ” he said .
“ By and large , paperless voting systems would be ‘ software dependent , ’ so that an undetected error or change in the software could cause an undetectable change in the election outcome .
This would be very undesirable , ” he said .
No MIT voting machines
As to whether MIT will one day make its own voting machines , Rivest said , “ we do research on voting systems , and may produce prototypes .
We do n’t produce them for others to use , a vendor would do that . ”
Stewart said MIT is not working on building electronic machines , but is studying the impact of electronic voting machines .
“ That MIT might be working on its own machines is an idea that dates back to 2001 , ” Stewart said , “ but we are less interested in making our own machines than in providing more technical information and fundamentals in science and engineering . ”
As examples of MIT research closely tied to e-voting machines , he cited former Caltech - MIT VTP co-director Ted Selker ’s work on electronic interfaces , protocols for securing votes electronically , and on audio systems that could read back votes cast on electronic voting machines .
One application of the latter is for blind and visually - impaired people to have a way of having their vote read back to them so they can ensure it has been recorded correctly .
Jonathan Goler ’ 04 , who designed and developed the Caltech - MIT VTP as a UROP , said in an interview earlier this month , “ MIT will never produce its own e-voting machine .
MIT will probably continue to release concepts for improving the electronic voting process , such as the Low Error Voting Interface and Secure Architecture for Voting Electronically . ”
This is the first half of a two - part series on electronic voting .
The second half will be published this Friday .
One aspect of the H.B.S. method , with its emphasis on problems of actual corporations , is sometimes referred to as the " case cracker " problem .
The case studies are static , generally a snapshot of a troubled company , frozen in time ; the various " solutions " students proffer , and then defend in class against tough questioning , tend to have very short shelf lives .
They promote rigidity , inappropriate surety .
This is something H.B.S. graduates , most of whom land at large or midsize firms , learn in their first few years in business .
They discover , often to their surprise , that the world is dynamic , it flows and changes , often for no good reason .
The key is flexibility , rather than sticking to your guns in a debate , and constant reassessment of shifting realities .
In short , thoughtful second - guessing .
George W. Bush , who went off to Texas to be an oil wildcatter , never had a chance to learn these lessons about the power of nuanced , fact - based analysis .
The small oil companies he ran tended to lose money ; much of their value was as tax shelters .
( The investors were often friends of his father 's . )
Later , with the Texas Rangers baseball team , he would act as an able front man but never really as a boss .
Instead of learning the limitations of his Harvard training , what George W. Bush learned instead during these fitful years were lessons about faith and its particular efficacy .
It was in 1985 , around the time of his 39th birthday , George W. Bush says , that his life took a sharp turn toward salvation .
At that point he was drinking , his marriage was on the rocks , his career was listless .
Several accounts have emerged from those close to Bush about a faith " intervention " of sorts at the Kennebunkport family compound that year .
Details vary , but here 's the gist of what I understand took place .
George W. , drunk at a party , crudely insulted a friend of his mother's .
George senior and Barbara blew up .
Words were exchanged along the lines of something having to be done .
George senior , then the vice president , dialed up his friend , Billy Graham , who came to the compound and spent several days with George W. in probing exchanges and walks on the beach .
George W. was soon born again .
He stopped drinking , attended Bible study and wrestled with issues of fervent faith .
A man who was lost was saved .
His marriage may have been repaired by the power of faith , but faith was clearly having little impact on his broken career .
Faith heals the heart and the spirit , but it does n't do much for analytical skills .
In 1990 , a few years after receiving salvation , Bush was still bumping along .
Much is apparent from one of the few instances of disinterested testimony to come from this period .
It is the voice of David Rubenstein , managing director and cofounder of the Carlyle Group , the Washington - based investment firm that is one of the town 's most powerful institutions and a longtime business home for the president 's father .
In 1989 , the catering division of Marriott was taken private and established as Caterair by a group of Carlyle investors .
Several old - guard Republicans , including the former Nixon aide Fred Malek , were involved .
Rubenstein described that time to a convention of pension managers in Los Angeles last year , recalling that Malek approached him and said : " There is a guy who would like to be on the board .
He 's kind of down on his luck a bit .
Needs a job .
. . .
Needs some board positions . "
Though Rubenstein did n't think George W. Bush , then in his mid-40's , " added much value , " he put him on the Caterair board .
" Came to all the meetings , " Rubenstein told the conventioneers .
" Told a lot of jokes .
Not that many clean ones .
And after a while I kind of said to him , after about three years : ' You know , I 'm not sure this is really for you .
Maybe you should do something else .
Because I do n't think you 're adding that much value to the board .
You do n't know that much about the company . '
He said : ' Well , I think I 'm getting out of this business anyway .
And I do n't really like it that much .
So I 'm probably going to resign from the board . '
And I said thanks .
Did n't think I 'd ever see him again . "
Bush would soon officially resign from Caterair 's board .
Around this time , Karl Rove set up meetings to discuss Bush 's possible candidacy for the governorship of Texas .
Six years after that , he was elected leader of the free world and began " case cracking " on a dizzying array of subjects , proffering his various solutions , in both foreign and domestic affairs .
But the pointed " defend your position " queries -- so central to the H.B.S. method and rigorous analysis of all kinds -- were infrequent .
Questioning a regional supervisor or V.P. for planning is one thing .
Questioning the president of the United States is another .
Still , some could n't resist .
As I reported in " The Price of Loyalty , " at the Bush administration 's first National Security Council meeting , Bush asked if anyone had ever met Ariel Sharon .
Some were uncertain if it was a joke .
It was n't : Bush launched into a riff about briefly meeting Sharon two years before , how he would n't " go by past reputations when it comes to Sharon .
. . .
I 'm going to take him at face value , " and how the United States should pull out of the Arab - Israeli conflict because " I do n't see much we can do over there at this point . "
Colin Powell , for one , seemed startled .
This would reverse 30 years of policy -- since the Nixon administration -- of American engagement .
Such a move would unleash Sharon , Powell countered , and tear the delicate fabric of the Mideast in ways that might be irreparable .
Bush brushed aside Powell 's concerns impatiently .
" Sometimes a show of force by one side can really clarify things . "
Looking at “ the media attention granted the right - wing attacks on ACORN , ” politics writer Glenn W. Smith poses a question to Editor & Publisher readers ( 10/15/08 ) : “ Why does it seem to be a greater sin to be suspected of voter registration mistakes than to publicly engage in voter suppression efforts ? ”
Smith ’s response to his own query looks to U.S. election history :
One answer to this question might be simple editorial bias .
E&P ‘s Greg Mitchell detailed the right ’s pioneer suppression efforts in his book , The Campaign of the Century : Upton Sinclair ’s Race for Governor of California and the Birth of Media Politics .
As reported by Mitchell , in the 1934 race for governor of California , Republicans hatched perhaps the most sophisticated voter suppression scheme undertaken up to that time in America .
Taking the shrewd advice of a former New York prosecutor , Eli Whitney Debevoise , opponents of Democrat Upton Sinclair leveled wild charges of voter registration fraud .
A cooperative district attorney drew up a secret list of 200,000 allegedly illegal registrants .
The Los Angeles Times advanced the suppression campaign , writing on the front page that “ it would be far better for a few honest persons to lose their votes than for a hundred thousand rogues to defeat by fraud the majority will of the people . ”
The publicity , the conspirators knew , would frighten those who were afraid they just might be on that list .
Rather than risk capture ( for a vague crime they had no understanding of ) , they ’d stay away from the polls .
Martin Dwaine Johnson told authorities that an associate and an accomplice were planning to kill Sen.
Barack Obama using a sniper rifle simply because he is black , but the threat was not deemed credible by federal authorities .
Colorado ’s U.S. Attorney Troy Eid said today the threats did not meet the legal standard to charge the men with making a threat against Obama .
“ There is a difference between a true threat and the reported racist rantings of drug abusers , ” Eid said during a press conference .
But Eid did announce his office had filed federal gun and drug charges against Tharin Gartrell , Shawn Adolf and Johnson
“ ( Shawn ) Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama on the day of his inauguration and additionally stated that Adolf said he would specifically use a 22 - 250 sniper rifle and high powered scope , and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama , ” according to a federal criminal complaint filed today .
The documents say Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver with Adolf specifically to kill Obama .
Gartrell and Johnson were charged with possession of a firearm and possession of body armour by felons and possession of methamphatamine with intent to sell , according to court records .
Johnson was also charged with alleged possession of a firearm by an offender and possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell .
Eid insisted that the men posed “ no credible threat ” to Obama or visitors to the Democratic National Convention .
“ This involved a gang of meth - heads who were all impaired at the time , ” Eid said .
Johnson made an initial appearance on related state drug charges this morning in Denver court and waived the reading of the charges against him .
He is being held on $ 10,000 bail .
The case began 1:37 a.m. Sunday when Gartrell , 28 , who was driving a rented Dodge pickup , was pulled over in Aurora after he was seen swerving and driving erratically .
He was driving without a license and was on probation for a methamphetamine conviction , authorities learned .
Police then saw a wig and two high - powered rifles in the truck , along with a hunting scope , a bulletproof vest , a walkie - talkie , several boxes of ammunition and methamphetamine .
One rifle was threaded for a silencer attachment .
The other , which was stolen from the Sherman County Sheriff ’s Office in Goodland , Ka. in 2005 , according to court records released today .
Three backpacks contained equipment for making methampahetamines : three large boxes of matches , two glass cooking vessels , pseudo - ephedrine pills and a bottle of pH base .
Officers found a baggie of suspected methamphetamine in Gartrell ’s pocket .
Gartrell told authorities the weapons belonged to his cousin Adolf , according to federal documents .
Police went to the Denver Tech Center Hyatt Hotel , 7800 E. Tufts St. and contacted Johnson , 32 , and a girl .
He told police that Adolf was at a sixth floor room at Cherry Creek Hotel in Glendale .
At 6:37 a.m. Sunday , police knocked on Adolf ’s hotel room door .
Adolf told officers to wait while his wife changed her clothes .
Officers then heard “ glass breaking inside the room and an unknown female screaming . ”
Adolf , 33 , had jumped from the sixth - floor window , landed on an awning four floors down and then jumped to the ground , breaking his ankle , Glendale Police Chief Victor Ross said .
An unnamed female witness from Fort Morgan , who had been driven to Denver on Saturday with Adolf , told Colorado State Patrol officers about possible threats against Obama , according to the federal court records .
The witness said in the Hyatt hotel room , Adolf and Gartrell talked “ negatively ” about Obama using racial epithets .
She believed they were “ white supremacists . ”
They “ could not believe how close he was to becoming president , ” and that no black should live in the White House .
In a subsequent interview between CSP troopers and Johnson , the suspect said he was with Adolf and two women at the Hyatt at 10 p.m.
Saturday when one of them started talking about killing Obama with a camera with a gun hidden in the lens .
But Adolf and Gartrell dismissed her statements .
Johnson cried and said Adolf and Gartrell talked about going hunting , but what they meant was that they were going to kill Obama during his speech Thursday .
“ There were no political reasons for wanting to kill Obama , and that the only reason to kill Obama is because Obama is black , ” the court record says .
Adolf is being held in lieu of $ 1 million bail on numerous warrants from across Colorado , Aurora police Lt. Bob Stef said .
One of the warrants is out of Texas on a felony charge of tampering with government records , according to CBI records .
He also is being held on a Weld County warrant for burglary , vehicular theft , theft ; an Adams County warrant for larceny ; a Jefferson County warrant for a drug case ; and a Kit Carson County warrant for three theft counts .
In addition , he is wanted out of Kit Carson County on a separate warrant for failure to appear on a felony charge , according to CBI records .
Adolf has an extensive criminal record .
He was sentenced to eight years in prison in 1997 for drug and illegal - weapons charges .
He also served sentences for assault , forgery and numerous theft charges .
Gartrell is being held on $ 50,000 bail on amphetamine possession and on an Arapahoe County arrest warrant , according to CBI records .
He was convicted of drug- possession charge in 2005 and was arrested for a drug charge in May 2007 .
According to court records , he had been living at a friend ’s house for the past three months while unemployed .
For five years , he was self - employed disc jockey .
He recently lost his job as a cook at a Centennial Pizza Hut .
He quit school after the 11th grade , the records indicate .
After his home life became unstable , Gartrell moved away from his parents at the age of 15 , said Vanessa Sand , who said he found shelter at her home and couch for several months about 16 years ago .
Sand said Gartrell was nicknamed Thermos back then and that he never showed any violent tendencies .
“ He was all about making music and making people happy and giving people a venue to forget their stuff , ” Sand said .
Sand said that six years ago , she moved from the Denver area to Los Angeles .
She said she kept in touch with Gartrell over the Internet but gradually lost close contact with him .
Sand said she moved back to Denver about a year ago and has seen Gartrell sporadically since then .
She said that the group Gartrell was associated with when he was a teenager was “ all rough and tumble kids , the skate punks of the town . ”
Still , she stressed there was no violence associated with anyone in the group .
“ I ’m still in shock , ” Sand said .
“ He was always a loving and helpful friend . ”
Johnson was arrested on a Greeley shoplifting warrant and for suspicion of drug dealing , according to CBI records .
Johnson was convicted in 2006 on an identify - theft charge .
He also previously was arrested for forgery .
During his first appearance in court today , Johnson , wore blue jeans and a T - shirt which read , “ If I do n’t remember , It did n’t happen . ”
Johnson ’s mother , Karola , who today held a funeral for her husband , Dwaine Johnson , who died of bone cancer , said Nathan has paid dearly for bad decisions in his life but that he is no killer .
“ My son would never do something like that , ” she said referring to any attempt to kill Obama .
“ I know my son .
That ’s not him . ”
She also said he has never been involved with white - supremacist groups .
She said her son has been blackballed by law enforcement , but declined to elaborate .
She said he is a trucker who hauls gravel .

Know about Camping Beds and Camping Cots for Smooth and Safe Camping Sleep
Another influenza season is beginning in the northern temperate zone , and our government ’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) will strongly urge Americans to get a flu shot .
Health officials will say that every winter 5 — 20 percent of the population catches the flu , 200,000 people are hospitalized , and 36,000 people will die from it .
The CDC ’s 15 - member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) makes recommendations each year on who should be vaccinated .
Ten years ago , for the 1999 — 2000 season , the committee recommended that people over age 65 and children with medical conditions have a flu shot .
Seventy - four million people were vaccinated .
Next season ( 2000 — 01 ) the committee lowered the age for universal vaccination from 65 to 50 years old , adding 41 million people to the list .
For the 2002—03 season , the ACIP added healthy children 6 months to 23 months old , and for 2004 — 05 , children up to 5 years old .
For the 2008—09 season the committee has advised that healthy children 6 months to 18 years old have a flu shot each year .
Its recommendations for influenza vaccination now covers 256 million Americans — 84 percent of the U.S. population .
Only healthy people ages 19 — 49 not involved in some aspect of health care remain exempt .
Pharmaceutical companies have made 146 million influenza vaccines for the U.S. market this flu season .
Almost all the ACIP members who make these recommendations have financial ties to the vaccine industry .
The CDC therefore must grant each member a conflict - of - interest waiver .
The CDC mounts a well - orchestrated campaign each season to generate interest and demand for flu shots .
Along with posters for the public , flyers , and health care provider materials , it encourages doctors to " recommend / urge flu shots . "
Medical groups , nonmedical organizations ( like the YMCA ) , and the media trumpet CDC - released messages on influenza , notably : " Flu kills 36,000 per year , " " This could be a bad / serious flu year , " and " Flu vaccine is the best defense against flu . "
The government promotes National Vaccination Week , which this year is December 8 — 14 .
This year , however , rather than uniformly following the government ’s " Seven - Step Recipe " for generating demand for flu shots , the mainstream media has questioned their benefits .
The New York Times had an article in the September 2 , 2008 issue titled " Doubts Grow Over Flu Vaccine in Elderly , " which says , " The influenza vaccine , which has been strongly recommended for people over 65 for more than four decades , is losing its reputation as an effective way to ward off the virus in the elderly .
A growing number of immunologists and epidemiologists say the vaccine probably does not work very well for people over 70 , the group that accounts for three - fourths of all flu deaths . "
The article refers to a study done by the Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle on 3,500 people , age 65 — 94 , to determine if flu vaccines are effective in protecting older people against developing pneumonia ( Lancet 2008;372:398—405 ) .
The National Vital Statistics Reports compiled by the CDC show that only 1,138 deaths a year occur due to influenza alone ( 257 in 2001 , 727 in 2002 , 1,792 in 2003 , 1,100 in 2004 , and 1,812 in 2005 ) .
Bacterial pneumonia causes some 60,000 deaths each year , mainly in the winter , when surveillance data show increased prevalence of the flu virus .
Using a mathematical ( Poisson ) regression model , officials estimate that the flu virus triggers some of the winter - time deaths from pneumonia , along with deaths in people with cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses .
More than 34,000 of those " 36,000 " flu deaths are what officials estimate are " influenza - associated " pneumonic and cardiovascular deaths .
The Group Health study reported in the New York Times and other newspapers around the country found that flu shots do not protect elderly people against developing pneumonia .
Pneumonia occurs with equal frequency in people over age 65 with or without a flu shot .
Earlier studies , biased by the " healthy user effect , " over - estimated the vaccine ’s effect on pneumonia because they did not adjust for the presence and severity of other diseases in unvaccinated people .
As the Group Health authors point out , " The study found that people who were healthy and conscientious about staying well were the most likely to get an annual flu shot .
Those who are frail may have trouble bathing or dressing on their own and are less likely to get to their doctor ’s office or a clinic to receive the vaccine .
They are also more likely to be closer to death . "
Other investigators question that there is a mortality benefit with influenza vaccination .
Vaccination coverage among the elderly increased from 15 % in 1980 to 65 % now , but there has been no decrease in deaths from influenza and pneumonia ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2008;178:527—33 ) .
As one vaccine researcher puts it , " I think the evidence base [ for mortality benefits from flu shots ] we have leaned on is not valid " ( Lancet Infect Dis 2007;7:658—66 ) .
Vaccine Safety Manual ... Miller , Neil Z. Best Price : $ 1.64 Buy New $ 34.80 ( as of 06:35 EST - Details )
There is also a lack of evidence that young children benefit from flu shots .
A systematic review of 51 studies involving 260,000 children age 6 to 23 months found no evidence that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo ( Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006 ;1:CD004879 ) .
Randomized controlled trials are the most reliable way to determine the efficacy — and safety — of a given treatment .
No randomized trials show that flu shots reduce mortality from influenza or flu - related pneumonia .
Some do show that the flu vaccine is somewhat effective in preventing influenza .
In one widely quoted study , 1838 volunteers age 60 and over were randomized to receive a flu shot or placebo ( a shot of saline ) .
The flu shot reduced the relative risk of contracting ( serologically confirmed , clinical ) influenza by a seemingly impressive 50 % .
The incidence of influenza in the unvaccinated people in this study was 3 % .
In the vaccinated group it was 2 % ( JAMA 1994;272:1661 — 5 ) .
Flu shots reduced the absolute risk of contracting influenza by a meager 1 % ( not 50 % , as the " relative risk " portrays it ) .
In actuality , for every 100 people that have a flu shot only one will benefit from it — this , in medical parlance , is the " number needed to treat " ( NNT ) in order to achieve any benefit from the treatment .
A flu shot provides no benefit for the other 99 people — 2 of them will get influenza anyway — and all 100 risk being harmed by the vaccine .
Another randomized trial by Zaman and coworkers published recently ( NEJM 2008;359 : published online September 17 , in print October 9 ) found that the incidence of influenza in infants whose mothers had a flu shot during their pregnancy was 4 % ( 6/159 ) .
The incidence of flu in infants whose mothers did not have a flu shot was 10 % ( 16/157 ) .
In this study ( done in Bangladesh and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , Wyeth Pharmaceuticals , and others ) flu shots reduced the relative risk of influenza illness in infants by a seemingly impressive 63 % .
But only 6 out of 100 infants benefited from the shot .
The other 94 received no benefit — 4 got influenza anyway — and all are at risk from being harmed by the vaccine , particularly from the mercury , aluminum , and formaldehyde in it .
After officials select the three strains of flu virus that they think are most likely to be circulating during the next winter season ( they picked the wrong ones last year ) , vaccine makers grow the viruses in fertilized chicken eggs , with 500,000 eggs per day ( each examined by hand ) for up to eight months .
Formaldehyde is used to inactivate the virus .
It is a known cancer - causing agent .
Aluminum is added to promote an antibody response .
It is a neurotoxin that may play a role in Alzheimer ’s disease .
Other additives and adjuvants in the flu vaccine include Triton X - 100 ( a detergent ) , Polysorbate 80 , carbolic acid , ethylene glycol ( antifreeze ) , gelatin , and various antibiotics — neomycin , streptomycin , and gentamicin — that can cause allergic reactions in some people .
Two - thirds of the vaccines made for the 2008— 09 flu season , 100 million of them , contain full - dose thimerosal , an organomercury compound , which is 49 % mercury by weight .
( An unidentified number of the other 50 million vaccines contain either " no " or " trace " amounts of thimerosal . )
It is used to disinfect the vaccine .
Each one of these 100 million flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury , a mercury content that is 50,000 part per billion , 250 times more than the Environmental Protection Agency ’s safety limit .
Mercury is a neurotoxin , which has a toxicity level 1,000 times that of lead .
There is some evidence that flu shots cause Alzheimer ’s disease .
This most likely is a result of combining mercury with aluminum and formaldehyde , which renders them much more toxic together through a synergistic effect than each would be alone .
One investigator has reported that people who received the flu vaccine each year for 3 to 5 years had a ten - fold greater chance of developing Alzheimer ’s disease than people who did not have any flu shots ( Int J Clin Invest 2005 ; 1:1—4 ) .
( The brains of people with Alzheimer ’s disease display three pathologic hallmarks : neurofibillary tangles , amyloid plaques , and phosphorylation of tau protein .
Brain cells grown in test tubes develop these changes when exposed to nanomolar doses of mercury , doses similar to the amount of mercury a person gets from a flu shot . )
Evidence of Harm David Kirby Best Price : $ 1.89 Buy New $ 15.00 ( as of 06:45 EST - Details )
Mercury in vaccines has also been implicated as a cause of autism .
Vaccine makers have now removed thimerosal from all childhood vaccines , except flu shots .
For more on this subject see my article " Mercury on the Mind , " with its recommended reading list , and Evidence of Harm : Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic : A Medical Controversy by David Kirby .
Three serious , acknowledged adverse reactions to the flu vaccine are joint inflammation and arthritis , anaphylactic shock ( and other life - threatening allergic reactions ) , and Guillain - Barré syndrome .
Guillain - Barré syndrome ( GBS ) is a paralytic autoimmune disease that fells people several weeks after their flu shot .
One woman with post - vaccination GBS writes :
" I had a flu shot in November , and by December I became weak and continued to get weaker until I collapsed and was taken to the hospital …
I was helpless , totally paralyzed with Guillain - Barré syndrome …
I was in ICU for three weeks and then transferred to a rehabilitation center .
Three months later I was released to come home because I could ambulate approximately 100 feet with a walker .
I continued rehabilitation as an outpatient for the next three months until I could walk with hand crutches .
Today , I need a cane .
I was not forewarned of any possible hazard when they gave me the flu shot . "
Another :
" I have a friend , now in a wheelchair , who took the flu shot , got Guillain - Barré and now cannot walk . "
Another woman , diagnosed with GBS after a flu shot , spent 16 months in the hospital paralyzed on a ventilator and life support .
After several subsequent multi-month hospitalizations she writes :
" On my last visit to my neurologist I was able to walk about 6 feet holding his hand , not much but it took years to be able to do that .
I scratch my head when I hear them promoting flu shots …
Most people that I come into contact with — in the hospital and out ( nurses , doctors , and regular people ) — after hearing my story , feel that it is better to chance the flu and not get the shot . "
( These statements are in Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners : Guide to Immunizations Risks and Protection by Neil Miller [ no relation ] , pages 84 — 86 . )
The package inserts that come with the flu vaccine note that GBS is a potential complication .
There are 1 to 2 cases of GBS per 1 million vaccinated persons .
( There were 10 times that many cases of GBS in 1976 with the flu vaccine used that year ) .
Taking a flu shot is essentially the same as buying a lottery ticket for acquiring Guillain - Barré syndrome .
Seventy percent of doctors do not get a flu shot .
Flu virus exists in people year - round , and new strains seed a population during the " off- season . "
In the northern and southern temperate zones , flu epidemics occur in the cold part of the year , October — March and April — September respectively .
Flu epidemics occur in the tropics during the rainy season .
Explanations for why flu epidemics occur in the winter when it is cold — people being indoors in close contact , drier air dehydrating mucus and preventing the body from expelling virus particles , the virus lingering longer on exposed surfaces , like doorknobs , with colder temperatures — do not explain why flu epidemics occur in the tropics .
Something that can explain why flu epidemics also occur both in warm and cold climates is this :
During a flu epidemic , wherever it may be , the atmosphere blocks ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation from the Sun .
In the temperate zones above latitude 35 degrees North and South , the sun is at a low enough angle in the winter that the ozone layer in the atmosphere absorbs and blocks the short - wavelength ( 280— 315 nanometers ) UVB rays .
In the tropics during the wet season , thick rain clouds block UVB rays .
Skin contains a cholesterol derivative , 7 - dehydrocholesterol .
UVB radiation on skin breaks open one of the carbon rings in this molecule to form vitamin D . The activated form of vitamin D ( 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D ) attaches to receptors on genes that control their expression , which turn protein production on or off .
Vitamin D regulates the expression of more than 1,000 genes throughout the body .
They include ones in macrophages , cells in the immune system that , among other things , attack and destroy viruses .
Vitamin D switches on genes in macrophages that make antimicrobial peptides , antibiotics the body produces .
Like antibiotics , these peptides attack and destroy bacteria ; but unlike antibiotics , they also attack and destroy viruses .
Vitamin D also expresses genes that stop macrophages from overreacting to an infection and releasing too many inflammatory agents — cytokines — that can damage infected tissue .
Vitamin D , for example , down regulates genes that produce interleukin - 2 and interferon gamma , two cytokines that prime macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to attack the body ’s tissues .
In the 1918 — 19 Spanish flu pandemic that killed 500,000 Americans , young healthy adults would wake up in the morning feeling well , start drowning in their own inflammation as the day wore on , and be dead by midnight , as happened to my 22 - year - old grandmother and my wife ’s 24 - year - old grandmother .
Autopsies showed complete destruction of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract resulting , researchers now know , from a macrophage - induced severe inflammatory reaction to the virus .
In a terribly misguided way , these victims ’ own immune system attacked and killed them , not the virus , something in future pandemics vitamin D , in appropriate doses , can prevent .
A creditable hypothesis that explains the seasonal nature of flu is that influenza is a vitamin D deficiency disease .
Cannell and colleagues offer this hypothesis in " Epidemic Influenza and Vitamin D " ( Epidemiol Infect 2006;134:1129—40 ) .
They quote Hippocrates ( circa 400 B.C. ) , who said , " Whoever wishes to investigate medicine properly should proceed thus : in the first place to consider the seasons of the year . "
Vitamin D levels in the blood fall to their lowest point during flu seasons .
Unable to be protected by the body ’s own antibiotics ( antimicrobial peptides ) that this gene - expresser engineers , a person with a low vitamin D blood level is more vulnerable to contracting colds , influenza , and other respiratory infections ( e.g. , respiratory syncytial virus ) .
Studies show that children with rickets , a vitamin D - deficient skeletal disorder , suffer from frequent respiratory infections ; and children exposed to sunlight are less likely to get a cold .
Given vitamin D’s wide - ranging effects on gene expression , other studies , for example , show that people diagnosed with cancer in the summer have an improved survival compared with those diagnosed in the winter ( Int J Cancer 2006;119:1530 — 36 ) .
The Vitamin D Revoluti ...
Soram Khalsa Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 10.69 ( as of 08:00 EST - Details )
A growing body of evidence indicates that rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults ( both a softening of bones due to defective bone mineralization ) are just the tip of a vitamin D - deficiency iceberg .
Tuberculosis and various autoimmune diseases , such as multiple sclerosis , lupus , and type I diabetes have a causal association with low vitamin D blood levels .
Vitamin D deficiency plays a causal role in hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , and stroke .
It is also a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes , chronic fatigue , seasonal affective disorder , depression , cataracts , infertility , and osteoporosis .
At the bottom of the vitamin D iceberg lies cancer .
There is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency is a causal factor in some 15 different common cancers .
( NEJM 2007;357:266—81 . )
The increased number of deaths that occur in winter , largely from pneumonia and cardiovascular diseases , are much more likely due to vitamin D deficiency than to an increased prevalence of serologically - positive influenza virus ( which also results from vitamin D deficiency ) .
Experts reckon that an optimum blood level of vitamin D ( 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ) is 50 — 99 ng / ml .
( Children need a blood level > 8 ng / ml to prevent rickets .
It takes a concentration > 20 to maintain parathyroid hormone levels in a normal range .
A level > 34 is needed for peak intestinal calcium absorption .
And in elderly people neuromuscular performance steadily improves as vitamin D blood levels rise to 50 ng / ml . )
The government ’s recommended daily allowance ( RDA ) for vitamin D is 400 IU ( international units ) a day , an amount sufficient to prevent rickets and osteomalacia but not vitamin D’s other gene - regulating benefits .
To achieve all of vitamin D’s benefits one has to take an amount ten times the government ’s RDA — 4,000 to 5,000 IU a day .
A light - skinned person will synthesize 20,000 IU of vitamin D in 20 minutes sunbathing on a tropical beach , at which point vitamin D synthesis shuts down for the day ( it takes a dark - skinned person 6 to 10 times longer to make this amount ) .
Human breast milk does not contain vitamin D , since , from an evolutionary standpoint , our African ancestors ’ infants , reared near the equator , could readily synthesize this gene regulator from sunlight in their skin .
Food contains very little vitamin D. ( The highest concentrations are in wild salmon , mackerel , sardines , and cod liver oil . )
Federal regulations now require that some foods , like milk , be fortified with vitamin D .
But one would have to drink 200 glasses of milk to obtain the amount of vitamin D a light - skinned person can make in 20 minutes sunbathing .
The majority of Americans are vitamin D deficient , with a 25 - hydroxy D blood level < 20 ng / ml , or insufficient , with a level of 20 — < 30 ng / ml .
Cheap vitamin D supplements ( D3 , not D2 ) provide the only way most of us can maintain a year - round vitamin D blood levels greater than 50 ng / ml .
That requires taking 4 — 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day ( 50,000 IU every ten days or 150,000 IU a month ) .
Taking vitamin D in these doses is safe , far safer than a flu shot with all the bad chemicals it contains .
Concerns about vitamin D toxicity are overblown .
One can take a 10,000 IU vitamin D supplement on a daily basis without any adverse effects .
In healthy persons , long - term consumption of more than 40,000 IU a day is necessary to cause an elevation in the blood calcium level ( hypercalcemia ) , the first manifestation of vitamin D toxicity ( Am J Clin Nutr 2006 ; 84:694—97 ) .
Check your vitamin D ( 25 - hydroxy D ) blood level .
People with granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis should also check their blood level of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D , the active form .
Can a shot ( or tablets ) of vitamin D prevent influenza better than a flu shot ?
There is good reason to believe that it can .
Doctors in India and Canada give people a once - yearly injection of 600,000 IU of vitamin D ( MJA 2005 ; 183:10 — 12 ) .
That would be better , and safer , than having a flu shot .
Daily , weekly , or monthly vitamin D tablets work just as well .
For more on this subject see my article " Vitamin D in a New Light " and visit Dr. Cannell ’s Vitamin D Council website .
Investigators have completed one double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trial that shows vitamin D prevents colds and influenza significantly better ( P < 0.002 ) than a placebo pill ( Epidemiol Infection 2007;135:1095 — 6 ) .
A large multi-center randomized trial conducted over multiple flu seasons comparing vitamin D to a flu shot can show conclusively which is better , and safer .
But given the financial stakes underpinning flu shots , and unpatentable vitamin D , who will fund it ?
In the meantime , considering what is most likely to be the outcome of such a trial , if it is ever conducted , I recommend that you avoid flu shots and take vitamin D instead .
Notes
Influenza virus
Flu viruses are classified into types A , B , and C . Type A viruses cause most influenza epidemics .
They exist , replicate , and mutate in swine and horses ; seals , dolphins , and whales ; migratory water birds , geese and ducks ; domestic birds chicken and turkeys ; and humans .
Type B and C viruses exist only in humans and only type B causes ( relatively mild ) infections .
Influenza
A viruses are further categorized into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens ( proteins ) : hemaglutinin ( H ) and neuraminidase ( N ) .
There are 15 different H and 9 different N antigens .
The 1918 — 19 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by an H1NI Type A virus .
Subtypes of influenza viruses are further classified by the names of cities , states or countries , along with the year they were discovered .
For the 2008—09 ( northern temperate zone ) season , officials predict and have directed vaccines to be made against A / Brisbane / 59/2007 ( H1N1 ) , A / Brisbane/10/2007 ( H3N2 ) , and B / Florida /4/2006 .
In an unusual departure , they are all different from the previous season , which missed the strains that caused influenza that season .
What doctors diagnose as " influenza " is often an influenza - like illness caused by a respiratory virus other than the flu .
Serologic tests are necessary to prove that one ’s respiratory illness is actually caused by the flu virus .
Other things to do to prevent the flu Avoid sugar .
It suppresses immunity .
Avoid Omega - 6 vegetable oils ( corn , safflower , sunflower , peanut , canola , and soybean oil ) .
Americans consume 50 times more of these oils than are necessary for good health .
In this amount they are powerful immune suppressants .
Take a well - balanced multivitamin / mineral capsule on a daily basis .
Eat garlic .
Manage stress .
Exercise .
Get enough rest .
And wash your hands .
Viruses spread most often from touching contaminated objects , like doorknobs , phones , shared computer keyboards , and shaking hands .

NBC just released the results of its latest poll .
Obama is opening up a big lead .
More importantly , Palin is the biggest concern voters have about McCain :
NOTE FROM JOHN : Palin ’s negatives have soared , but more importantly , she has now become John McCain ’s greatest liability – greater than voters ’ concern that McCain will be another Bush term .
Normally , voters do n’t care about the VP choice .
In this instance they do .
I think this means that the number one voter concern is John McCain ’s health .
Earlier today , I was watching some footage of McCain in the Republican debates in May .
He was good .
He looked years younger – YEARS younger .
He was smart , quick , funny – he was a younger man .
McCain has aged a lot in the past six months , and that ’s troublesome .
It shows when he talks , it shows in how he thinks and how acts / reacts to crises like the recent Wall Street meltdown .
That is what , in my view , is underlying these polls .
People think , people see with their own eyes , that there is a real chance that John McCain wo n’t make it through his presidency , and that Sarah Palin will be forced to take over .
And real Americans know that Sarah Palin is not , and never will be , ready to be president of the United States of America .
From MSNBC :
Even Moderate Alcohol Seems To Shrink Brain
Using 1,839 subjects in the Framingham Offspring Study examined with functional magnetic resonance imagining ( fMRI ) researchers find that even lower levels of alcohol drinking are associated with more rapid brain shrinkage with age .
Increasing alcohol intake was associated with loss in total brain volume greater than expected from age alone ( P< 0.001 ) , reported Carol Ann Paul , of Wellesley College , and colleagues in the October issue of the Archives of Neurology .
In the cross-sectional study , women were affected more strongly than men by moderate alcohol intake averaging one to two drinks a day ( eight to 14 per week ) .
Do you drink two drinks a day ?
If so , you are probably getting dumber faster than you need to .
The hope was that cardiovascular benefits of moderate alcohol consumption would keep the brain better fed with blood and slow brain aging .
But that hope seems unrealistic now .
The cardiovascular benefits of low to moderate alcohol intake are thought to result from increasing blood flow rates , which would have been expected to benefit the brain also , Paul said .
But rather than preventing normal age - related volume reductions , the effects of moderate drinking were closer to those of heavy drinking , which has been linked to brain atrophy and cognitive decline , the researchers noted .
Your brain is shrinking anyway but alcohol makes it worse .
" Decline in brain volume -- estimated at 2 percent per decade -- is a natural part of aging , " says Carol Ann Paul , who conducted the study when she was at the Boston University School of Public Health .
She had hoped to find that alcohol might protect against such brain shrinkage .
" However , we did not find the protective effect , " says Paul , who is now an instructor in the neuroscience program at Wellesley College .
" In fact , any level of alcohol consumption resulted in a decline in brain volume . "
Brain rejuvenation is going to be the hardest challenge in rejuvenation .
Do n't make it any worse by shrinking your brain any faster than unavoidable .
On the bright side , all the hours I spend every day searching for content for blog posts might be stimulating and exercising my brain .
Web searching seems to stimulate the frontal , temporal and cingulate areas of your brain .
So is all that web surfing really just a prudent anti-aging therapy ?
Does brain exercise slow brain aging ?

It must really suck to be a conservative blowhard these days .
Especially when stuck defending Sarah Palin 's inanities , such as her cheerily informing us that as vice president she'd be " in charge of the Senate . "
Obviously , Buchanan was having very little fun yesterday on Hardball .
And when you have someone like Mark Green reminding the public that Palin has her own extremist pandering -- to the Alaskan Independence Party -- lurking in her background , well , I can imagine most of the right - wing talking heads with any brains capable of exploding just wind up looking for a nice corner they can go hide in .

Youth turnout this year is up an unprecedented 2.3 million have registered to vote , the largest jump of any age group .
After we saw large increases in 2004 and 2006 many wondered , if this year 2008 , would see the same drive .
The energy level is up and these young voters increased in every state ’s primary and caucus , even doubling and tripling in many .
Overall , the number of young voters between 18 - 29 years old in 2008 is 103 % more than in the previous set of primary elections .
There ’s always talk about the impact young voters could have in choosing the next president .
But this truly could be a breakout year for them .
Among the factors : nearly 2 - to - 1 support for Barack Obama among 18 - to 29 - year - olds and a seasoned get - out - the - vote effort that has seen young voter participation steadily rising since 2000 .
An AP - Yahoo News Poll conducted earlier this month found that , among 18 - to 29 - year - old likely voters , 60 percent supported Obama , 33 percent John McCain and 5 percent Ralph Nader .
Not only are young voters increasing in larger numbers , they are also increasing their presence at the polls more than the older voters .
A group of voters who ’ve historically been pegged as Election Day wild cards , but who ’ve also shown they can be counted on — helping get both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton elected , for instance .
If these group of voters show up at the polls – with a large voter turnout this year – that would give Obama a huge advantage in many swing states .
That ’s especially true in key swing states , such as Florida , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia .
In North Carolina , for instance , the most recent tally available shows 579,858 new registrants who are eligible to vote this year .
Many of them 20 somethings , they represent about 9 percent of the state ’s registered voters and could be a difference - maker in a close race , particularly if they support one candidate more heavily than another .
Access and false information in fliers are key problems that we have seen across the nation .
“ Young voters do n’t suffer from a lack of interest .
They suffer from a lack of access , ” Segal says .
In this election , he ’s heard complaints about everything from difficult registration requirements to fliers that falsely tell college students they ’ll lose their student loans if they do n’t vote in their home state .
That is why groups around the nation have formed to help solve these problems – these groups include Save and Rock the Vote .
They make sure the right information gets out to young voters , that they have access to register , and to resolve the problem of a polling place to vote .
Some colleges and universities have taken the initiative to provide transportation to students so that they can vote off campus .
To learn more about Rock the Vote and their programs , here is the link .

As longtime AE readers know , design is my favorite part of this business .
There is nothing like being in one of the design studios and smelling the clay , seeing future vehicle explorations on wall after wall , and , of course , seeing advanced products up close and in the flesh .
The design function is one of the most creative parts of this business and , I would argue , probably its toughest .
Designers inhabit a strange Twilight Zone where they ’re touting upcoming product introductions with the media that they ’ve been living with for four years or more , while at the same time they ’re working on products that wo n’t be revealed for at least four ( or five ) years down the road .
It has been put forth many times that automotive design is a fashion business , and in many respects that is very true .
In the 1950s , the great Italian design houses had tremendous influence on the automobile business .
In fact , GM Styling legend Bill Mitchell would often park the latest Ferrari in the design courtyard at the GM Technical Center so his designers would be inspired .
It often worked , too , because during Mitchell ’s reign GM Styling burnished its reputation as creating some of the most influential mainstream – and successful – vehicle designs in the world , including the Corvette Sting Ray , Buick Riviera , Cadillac Eldorado , Oldsmobile Toronado , several Pontiac models and many , many more .
Design is still very much a fashion business , but like everything else , today is markedly different .
There are design schools all over the world churning out gifted future designers who have been given the kind of depth and breadth of experience that in past eras was very hard to come by .
To say that today ’s young designers hit the ground running is an understatement .
In fact , many are able to make meaningful contributions right from the start of their careers .
As in past eras , trends come and go , but it is amazing to see certain design “ signatures ” – whether they originated in Korea , China , Japan , Europe or the U.S. – sweep the business all over the world seemingly at the same time .
Much of this can be attributed to the similar teaching methods and influences that young designers are exposed to coming up .
The other reasons have to do with the fundamental parameters of the design package itself , meaning the specific drivetrain requirements , the passenger accommodations , the vehicle segment , etc. , etc .
That all seems rational , right ?
I would agree that packaging dictates much of the look and feel of today ’s vehicles , at least up to a point .
But then again , how do you explain the look and feel – and the design sameness – of the vehicles below ?
What , do designers plug the parameters into a computer and out pops the basic shape and they go from there ?
Because that ’s what it looks like to me .
I mean , really , how can designers stand behind this work and call it … good ?
I can just hear them now …
“ Ahem , given our Belchfire EV ’s advanced powertrain and the passenger and cargo packaging requirements , we feel this ‘ four - door coupe ’ design presents the finest expression of our brand , blah - blah - blah … ”
Or something like that .
Ah yes , the “ four - door coupe . ”
This is the design trend originating in Germany that emerged from a battle of one - upmanship between BMW and Mercedes - Benz .
And in design terms : it sucks .
There is no such thing as a “ four - door coupe ” of course , but thanks to those two German luxury manufacturers we ’re all stuck with this design abomination until further notice .
So , take a look at the cars below – forgetting the price points – and revel in the relentless sameness and the bland - tastic design executions .

Today 's rumor says that Citadel 's flagship funds are off forty - percent , losses piling on top of the 35 % decline disclosed last week .
We have n't even bothered to try to confirm this but pretty much everyone is saying it .
CNBC 's David Faber adds one we had n't heard .
In order to raise money , Citadel is said to be approaching fund of funds and other hedge fund investors with an offer .
The gist of it is that if they pull their money out of another hedge fund and give it to Citadel , they 'll get the high water mark that applied at their old fund .
It 's a risky bet for Citadel , and one that is sure to piss off rival fund managers .
It also seems to indicate that Citadel is convinced that no new money is going to come into hedge funds .
At this point it 's all about fighting for dollars that are already in alternative investments .

McCain mocked by Letterman after ' Late Night ' cancellation RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 24 , 2008
Print This Email This After receiving a call from the McCain campaign canceling an appearance on tonight 's Late Night with David Letterman , it was discovered that McCain stopped down the street to be interviewed by CBS ' Katie Couric rather than rushing back to Washington to work on the proposed Wall Street bailout , as Letterman had been told .
" Hey Senator , " Letterman mocked in front of live video of the interview , " can I give you a ride home ? "
Letterman had earlier expressed suspicion at McCain 's move to suspend his campaign .
" This does n't smell right , " he said .
" This is n't the way a tested hero behaves . "
" I think someone 's putting something in his Metamucil ... He can't run the campaign because the economy is cratering ?
Fine , put in your second - string quarterback , Sarah Palin .
Where is she ? "
" What are you going to do if you 're elected and things get tough ? " Letterman added .
" Suspend being president ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Democrats will propose a new stimulus package to " rebuild America " and " help the middle class , " Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , announced Monday .
The package will have some of the same features as one passed earlier by the House but rejected by the Senate , she said , including " aid to the states " on healthcare , food stamps and unemployment .
Last week Pelosi estimated the package could cost as much as $ 150 billion .
Rep. John Boehner , the Ohio Republican who leads his part in the House , criticized the Democrats ' plan in a letter to Pelosi Monday .
" Nothing currently being discussed by the majority as ' stimulus ' will stabilize the economy long - term , " he said , citing press reports about Democratic plans .
" Nothing being discussed will ease the uncompetitive nature of our nation 's tax rates .
Nothing being discussed will bring a single dollar of private capital into our markets , which would help stabilize and restore American families ' savings and retirement accounts .
And nothing being discussed will help small businesses compete and thrive . "
Pelosi and other top House Democrats met a panel of leading economists Monday morning , including Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , now a Harvard professor .
Allen Sinai of Decision Economics said bluntly the U.S. economy is in recession and the world economy is in recession , but given the Democrats ' efforts , things would be better next year .
There has been no official declaration of a recession , but the body that makes such determinations - the National Bureau of Economic Research - usually makes them retroactively , based on broad measures of economic activity .
Part of the psychology of the Greenspan Bubble  a policy of bank credit expansion that distorted market signals and led to the over - valuation of certain assets , such as real estate  has been the vaunted overestimation of America ’s staying power as a global hegemon .
Standing alongside the hubris that brought down the financial edifices of Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs is the foreign policy corollary : the triumphalism of the neoconservatives , who imagined that American military power could solve all the world ’s problems : or , at least , most of our own .
They sneered at the “ declinists , ” like Paul Kennedy , who pointed to “ imperial overstretch ” as the cause of our impending economic and geopolitical demise .
Samuel Huntington , for one , attacked the “ declinists ” as being primarily of a “ liberal or leftist ” bent , and pooh - poohed calls to rein in the budget deficit  which had , at the time ( 1988 ) , reached noticeable proportions  as symptoms of undue alarmism .
Why , even now , he assured us in an article [ .pdf file ] in Foreign Affairs , the situation is undergoing a “ reversal , ” and , besides , the international economy “ naturally generates equilibrating tendencies . ”
Somebody should tell that to Secretary Paulson , the US Congress , and the denizens of Wall Street , because they do n’t seem to understand all they have to do is take a chill pill .
After all , what ’s a couple of thousand - point drop in the stock market , in the face of our inherent invincibility ?
Deficits ?
Not to worry , said Huntington : Papa Bush will take care of that , with some combination of spending cuts , new taxes , and some good old - fashioned fiscal discipline .
One problem : it never happened .
Instead , the spending spree  including an orgy of military spending  continued , as did the policy of bank credit expansion , which was carried to an extreme by former Federal Reserve chieftain Alan Greenspan .
Oh , but do n’t worry .
The US , averred Huntington , is a “ multi- dimensional ” power , one not based on any one factor  economics , geography , ideology , natural resources , demography  but combining all of these into one overwhelming and unassailable force in world history .
While conceding economic power is “ more fungible ” than other forms , Huntington reassured us that the transformation of such power into , say , military heft would be “ costly , ” and , in any case , no other nation on earth had comparable advantages .
This is the big problem with the Huntington analysis , and its imitators over the years : it viewed the US only in relative terms , as a contender in a competition , which pitted America against other possible aspirants to the role of global hegemon 
Russia , during the cold war , and , since then , the EU and notably China .
All , however , were found wanting : they could never measure up , Huntington observed , and so have no fear , we ’re still Number One .
What he was n’t counting on , however , was that , in declining , we would drag everyone else down with us .
The shocks from the US economic meltdown are clearly reverberating throughout the globe .
So , in a sense , Huntington was right : no one is overtaking us  because we ’re all going down .
Some of the anti-declinist rhetoric , looked at in retrospect , is embarrassing .
Here ‘s neocon Robert J. Lieber , one of academia ’s fiercest war - hawks , polemicizing against declinism in the Summer 2008 issue of World Affairs :
“ On the economic front , without minimizing the impact of today ’s challenges , they will likely prove less daunting than those that plagued the U.S. in the 1970s and early 1980s .
The overall size and dynamism of the economy remains unmatched , and America continues to lead the rest of the world in measures of competitiveness , technology , and innovation .
Here , higher education and science count as an enormous asset .
America ’s major research universities lead the world in stature and rankings , occupying seventeen of the top twenty slots .
Broad demographic trends also favor the United States , whereas countries typically mentioned as peer competitors sag under the weight of aging populations .
This is not only true for Russia , Europe , and Japan , but also for China , whose long - standing one - child policy has had an anticipated effect . ”
Here , again , the economic picture is portrayed as a competition of nation - states , when , in reality , it is a seamless web of economic networks and transactions that has been profoundly disrupted on a worldwide scale .
All the insignia of success  we have seventeen out of twenty “ top slots ” in the university research sweepstakes !
 do n’t seem to matter much when the economy is imploding .
And make no mistake about it : this is n’t the economic “ malaise ” of the 1970s and early 1980s  it ’s more like the 1930s .
While economics may not be Professor Lieber ’s area of expertise , what he and Professor Huntington leave out of their apologias for American globalism is the simple arithmetic of imperialism , which adds up to a net loss for the United States and the American taxpayers .
Huntington denies that military spending is a drain on the economy , and blames “ consumerism , not militarism , ” for America ’s status as the world ’s number one debtor .
Yet how does he imagine we financed the biggest military build - up in world history ?
How did we manage to bloat our military budget until it grew larger than the defense expenditures of all the rest of the world combined ?
We rang it up on our national credit card .
We built an empire on a mountain of debt , and now it ’s all come tumbling down .
Yet it ’s more than an economic debacle : the Greenspan Bubble was made possible by a certain kind of psychology , a cultural ethos that gave little thought to the long - term consequences of US monetary and military policy , and lived only in the here - and - now .
The Bubble pumped up not just the stock market , but also our pretensions , our hubris , our sense of entitlement  not only to big overpriced homes and a dozen different credit cards , but also to our global preeminence as world policeman .
If pride really does cometh before a fall , then one can only observe that we had plenty of warning .
The declinists were right : the burden of empire is unsustainable , and had to end in the way it is ending  with a 5,000 - point dive in the stock market , and a crash heard ’round the world .
It ’s important to realize , however , that the decline and fall of the American empire was not due to some defect inherent in our national character , one that grew like a cancer until it overwhelmed an otherwise healthy body politic .
We are bearing the consequences of policies undertaken by our leaders  elected and unelected  who , heedless of critics such as Paul Kennedy , Chalmers Johnson , Ron Paul , and this author , among many others , rushed down a road well - littered with the bones of deceased empires .
In the world of the ancient Greeks , hubris  an overweening pride  was a cardinal sin in the eyes of the gods , and they visited upon prideful sinners all sorts of unpleasant fates , such as suffered by Icarus .
Hubris , in the Greek mythos , was soon followed by Nemesis  the cause of the sinners ’ ultimate downfall .
Our own nemesis is the puffed - up pridefulness of our leaders , who thought they were gods , and believed , as one top official put it , that
“ We ’re an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you ’re studying that reality  judiciously , as you will  we ’ll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that ’s how things will sort out .
We ’re history ’s actors and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ”
Reality has caught up with the lords of the American empire , and all the frenzied attempts at “ creating other new realities ” are to little avail .
Sure , future historians will indeed study these vaunted creatures , “ history ’s actors ” of the year 2008 .
Yet it wo n’t be with any sense of admiration for their great achievements .
They ’ll be studied as exemplars of failure on an unprecedented scale , economic suicide bombers whose spectacular demise shredded the global financial network  and triggered our own long slide into post - imperial senescence .

You know , for allegedly being his strong suit , John McCain 's foreign policy posturing during last night 's debate really cannot be counted as anything but an epic fail .
He meandered all over the place , confused the Pakistani president 's name , and directly contradicted not only his own earlier statements but the Bush Doctrine that he has supported for the last eight years .
I 'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan .
So I 'm not prepared to threaten it , as Senator Obama apparently wants to do , as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan .
Oh , that would be a LIE , McCain :
10:12 p.m .
McCain accused Obama of wanting to stage " military strikes " inside Pakistan , which is a misleading account of what Obama famously said in 2007 :
That he would be willing to go after Al Qaeda targets inside that country with or without the approval of the Pakistani authorities .
" If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n't act , we will , " Obama said .
Obama focuses on terrorists , McCain thinks about civilian targets .
Lovely .
MCCAIN : Now , the new president of Pakistan , Kardari ( sic ) , has got his hands full .
And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great .
* Sigh * First you do n't know that Spain is in Europe and now you do n't know the President of Pakistan 's name ?
( It 's Zardari , by the way , and he's not too happy with the strikes the current administration -- you know , the one you 've supported 90 % of the time -- has been inflicting on his country )
And we 're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people .
And it 's going to be tough .
They 've intermarried with al Qaeda and the Taliban .
And it 's going to be tough .
But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas .
Kind of like we got the cooperation of the Iraqis ?
Luckily , Obama was n't going to take the condescension from McCain without pointing out that McCain has hardly appeared presidential recently :
And , John , I -- you 're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say .
But , you know , coming from you , who , you know , in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and , you know , sung songs about bombing Iran , I do n't know , you know , how credible that is .
I think this is the right strategy .
Suh-nap !
Transcripts ( courtesy of CNN ) below :
MCCAIN : Now , on this issue of aiding Pakistan , if you 're going to aim a gun at somebody , George Shultz , our great secretary of state , told me once , you 'd better be prepared to pull the trigger .
I 'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan .
So I 'm not prepared to threaten it , as Senator Obama apparently wants to do , as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan .
We 've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan .
He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan .
Now , you do n't do that .
You do n't say that out loud .
If you have to do things , you have to do things , and you work with the Pakistani government .
Now , the new president of Pakistan , Kardari ( sic ) , has got his hands full .
And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great .
I 've been to Waziristan .
I can see how tough that terrain is .
It 's ruled by a handful of tribes .
And , yes , Senator Obama calls for more troops , but what he does n't understand , it 's got to be a new strategy , the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq .
It 's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan .
And we 're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people .
And it 's going to be tough .
They 've intermarried with al Qaeda and the Taliban .
And it 's going to be tough .
But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas .
And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they do n't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements .
So we 've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan .
But I 'm confident , now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command , that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and , by the way , there have been 20,000 additional troops , from 32,000 to 53,000 , and there needs to be more .
So it 's not just the addition of troops that matters .
It 's a strategy that will succeed .
And Pakistan is a very important element in this .
And I know how to work with him .
And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I 'm going to attack them .
OBAMA : Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan .
Here 's what I said .
And if John wants to disagree with this , he can let me know , that , if the United States has al Qaeda , bin Laden , top - level lieutenants in our sights , and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act , then we should take them out .
Now , I think that 's the right strategy ; I think that 's the right policy .
And , John , I -- you 're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say .
But , you know , coming from you , who , you know , in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and , you know , sung songs about bombing Iran , I do n't know , you know , how credible that is .
I think this is the right strategy .
Now , Senator McCain is also right that it 's difficult .
This is not an easy situation .
You 've got cross - border attacks against U.S. troops .
And we 've got a choice .
We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again , if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate , or we have to start making some decisions .
And the problem , John , with the strategy that 's been pursued was that , for 10 years , we coddled Musharraf , we alienated the Pakistani population , because we were anti-democratic .
We had a 20th - century mindset that basically said , " Well , you know , he may be a dictator , but he 's our dictator . "
And as a consequence , we lost legitimacy in Pakistan .
We spent $ 10 billion .
And in the meantime , they were n't going after al Qaeda , and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan .
That 's going to change when I 'm president of the United States .
Designer Mac Funamizu , the same guy who is keeping his fingers crossed that the Mac mini will not die , has also released a double pane LCD display concept that sees dual layered LCDs to create a sense of depth whenever you overlay graphics .
This is a much cheaper alternative compared to those 3D emulating displays , although it might not be as realistic .
Hopefully this concept will see action in future devices by showing off interactive maps on cell phones and GPS navigation systems .
Any hardware manufacturers adopting his idea ?

Obama : ' Turn the Page '
In a spot aimed at pre-empting the coming campaign against his character , Obama tries to explain it as a product of McCain 's weakness on the economy :
No wonder his campaign ’s announced a plan to “ turn a page on the financial crisis ” … distract with dishonest , dishonorable “ assaults ” against Barack Obama .

Steve Penny , president of USA Gymnastics , the sport ’s governing body , says the study does n’t accurately reflect gymnastics in an organized setting because it counts things like injuries on school playgrounds and mishaps during a backyard cartwheel .
“ I think most people view gymnastics as a very healthy thing for young girls , ” he said .
At gymnastics centers , business is booming in the wake of the Olympics .
At the California Sports Center in San Jose , enrollment jumped 33 percent in August .
The owner , Dave Peterson , said parents should look for programs that help children develop skills that will enable them to compete all the way up to college if they choose .
Once children reach a skill level that allows for competition , he said , they train just two hours for three days a week .
Over time , the program increases to about 21 hours a week .
He added that the athlete - to - coach ratio should be about 6 to 1 in preschool and about 8 to 1 for older athletes .
In the absence of firm data about the best age to start competitive sports , the solution may not be to discourage young athletes from working out too much , but instead to encourage them to try out more sports .
The journal Pediatrics reported last year that young athletes who participated in a variety of sports had fewer injuries and continued longer than those who specialized before puberty .
For young athletes determined to specialize , doctors recommend breaks from training at least one to two days a week , and long breaks every two to three months to allow the athlete to do another activity or at least cross-train to exercise different muscle groups .
Ms. Miller , the gymnast , says her sport can give children coordination , flexibility and strength that will help them in other sports .
And she adds that the focus should n’t be on competition .
“ The biggest factor is how excited they are to be there , ” she said .
“ Are they enjoying it and having fun ? ”
A few weeks ago , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave clear hints of a Windows - branded product that will be deployed in the cloud .
At 8:55 am PDT Monday , Ozzie christened this service Windows Azure .
As expected , Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie began his first day keynote speech at PDC 2008 ( he 'll be back for Day 2 ) by staking his company 's new claim to software as services .
" The Web has become a key demand generation mechanism , " he said in his characteristic high - flying style , " becoming Web services ' front door . "
IT developers are finding themselves now needing to work more closely together , Ozzie said , preaching to the choir .
Companies are finding themselves adding spare capacity to their main infrastructure , including adding spare data centers , in an obvious lead - up to the need for consolidation .
He spoke of the problem that IT workshops find themselves facing , where their core applications are intensely " inwardly - facing . "
Advertisement
" Is this cloud thing materially different than things we have known in the past ? "
Ozzie asked rhetorically .
" The answer is , emphatically , yes . "
Unlike his counterparts who have fronted PDC in the past , Ray Ozzie speaks using teleprompters .
There are four situated at the front of the stage , which enable him to pace back and forth , looking at the audience in 60 - degree angles -- looking stage left , stage right , stage left again , but rarely straightforward .
Straight ahead has rarely been Ozzie 's best side , and close to 15 minutes into the speech , he was still leading up -- not yet having revealed just what it is that he 's talking about .
Twenty minutes in , Ozzie introduced " Windows Azure , " which he did describe using the phrase " Windows in the Cloud . "
But is it an operating system ?
Maybe not , at least not in the sense we think about Windows ; rather , it 's a service that enables businesses to deploy Windows applications in the cloud .
So for them , it may as well be Windows , because it becomes an alternative for deploying Windows Server on machines they own or in physical space that they lease .
" Today , for those of you in this audience , Windows Azure comes to life .
It is not software that you run on your own servers , but it 's a service that ... runs on Microsoft data centers .
It 's being released today as a Community Technology Preview , " pronounced Ozzie .
10:00 am PT : Verifying some suspicion , Microsoft said it will gradually be moving all of its enterprise - class software as optional cloud - deployed applications , under the Microsoft Online Services banner .
What has not been discussed yet is price .
9:28 am PT : Here 's the basic concept : Using Windows
Azure , businesses will be able to model and develop distributed applications using existing .NET languages .
A component called .
NET Services extends the .NET platform to this large - scale deployment scenario .
Then admins will be able to maintain these applications using a front - end platform that , at least at first , seems to have been inspired by what we 've seen in Windows Home Server .
However , there 's a lot of XML editing involved in that latter process , which Microsoft 's Steve Marx promises will be replaced with more intuitive UI features .
9:12 am PT : Later in the Monday keynote , Microsoft 's Amitabh Srivastava made it clear that Windows Azure was not an operating system , but rather a complete cloud - based hosting management service that , in his words , separates distributed applications from the underlying operating system .
Importantly , Srivastava did not use the term " Windows " in conjunction with that phrase " underlying operating - system . "
The Azure platform will consist in part of a concept called .
NET Services , which will be a system for deploying .
NET - based applications in the cloud .
There will be no need to deploy .
NET applications in the cloud first just for testing purposes , Srivastava said .
Instead , new apps can be tested within a kind of sandbox using new editions of Visual Studio .
That makes it clear that VS 2010 , even in its beta form , will be getting a lot of use over the next few years .
It is not often that home weatherization gets discussed at the presidential level .
Yet there was Senator Barack Obama at the debate on Tuesday night , urging Americans to save energy by fixing up their houses .
“ Each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes , in our buildings , ” Mr. Obama said .
His administration , he said , would incentivize Detroit to make more fuel - efficient cars , and would also be “ making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient ” .
Mr. Obama was responding to a question about what sacrifices his administration would ask American to make during tough economic times .
It is a clever answer , because the trick to energy efficiency , of course , is that it is not actually a sacrifice .
Unlike more expensive green investments like a Prius or solar panels , adding insulation to your house or sealing leaky windows can actually save money in the near term .
While Mr. Obama also touched on more controversial topics like offshore drilling ( it ’s necessary , he said ) , the Democratic candidate urged Americans to reduce their energy consumption at least two other times — these in the context of mitigating challenges posed by Russia and Iran , both huge energy producers .
Perhaps all the talk of energy efficiency is a sign of just how badly the economy is hurting .
But whatever the cause , it must surely delight the ears of advocates like Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute , who has long - argued that a “ soft - path ” approach to energy — with efficiency at its core — is best .
( See my colleague John Tierney ’s article on Tuesday for more on that . )
Senator John McCain , for his part , stuck mainly to his themes of energy independence with the aid of offshore drilling and nuclear power .
“ We ’ve got to drill offshore , my friends , and we ’ve got to do it now , ” he said .
My colleagues Andy Revkin and Matt Wald further parse the candidates ’ pronouncements on oil and nuclear energy at Dot Earth .
Majority of States Now in Recession
In March , 5 states were in recession ; now there are 27 with 14 more at risk .
Oct. 21 , 2008  --
What started out as a housing problem in a few states has now exploded into a full - fledged recession with a majority of states now in or dangerously close to recession .
Just this weekend , President Bush 's top economic advisor used the much - avoided word " recession " to describe the economies in some states .
" We are seeing what I think anyone would characterize as a recession in certain parts of the country , " Edward P. Lazear , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , said on CNN's " Late Edition . "
How Is the Economy Treating You ?
Tell ABC News
Back in March , Mark Zandi , chief economist and co-founder of Moody 's Economy.com , said that only five states were in recession : Arizona , California , Florida , Michigan and Nevada .
Now , he said that 27 states are in recession and another 14 are near recession .
" There 's no way around the map .
It says the nation is in recession .
The recession is coast to coast , " Zandi said .
" Just a handful of states are expanding at this point .
One of the unique features of this downturn is how broad - based it is , regionally . "
What happened between March and today ?
" The job market has eroded measurably and industrial production has weakened sharply in the last couple of months .
Those are the two key things .
The other thing is that retail sales have also sharply weakened , " Zandi said .
The one bright side is part of the middle of the country .
Agriculture and energy are still strong and providing jobs .
Maryland , Massachusetts and New Hampshire are still growing and that is because of health care and educational services .
" In the past , in recessions , you saw people moving from areas that were hard hit , to areas that were holding up better , looking for jobs and better incomes , " he said .
" Now , there is nowhere to go . "
High Unemployment
David Wyss , managing director and chief economist at Standard & Poor 's , said the worst problems are in the old rust belt , Michigan being the worst hit .
The state now has the highest unemployment in the country .
" The recession began , really , with the housing sector and then also very quickly with automobiles , " Wyss said .
" The states that have been hardest hit have been the manufacturing states , in large part because of what happened with cars . "

Now the recession is spreading to other states where the housing bubble never burst .
For instance , Wyss said , the Boeing strike is starting to drag down Washington state 's economy and spread over into Oregon .
" The exception is the part of the country between the Mississippi River and the Rockies , which is still doing pretty well , " he said .
" High farm prices are good if you are in Iowa .
High oil prices are good if you are in Houston . "
Peter Morici , an economics professor at the University of Maryland , said a decline in manufacturing is really hurting the rust belt .
That said , the economy still is very regional and industry - specific .
" It always varies .
Even during the Great Depression , there were people that hardly felt it , " Morici said .
" Recessions and depressions always have varying effects on people and locations . "
Agriculture is doing well because of ethanol development and a growing demand for grains by people in Asia .
Budget Shortfalls
Several state governments already face major budget shortfalls .
" The state governments are an exercise in irresponsibility .
Through the property boom , they enjoyed the increase in people 's assessments , " Morici said .
" They are just not structured to handle the cynical movements in their revenue the way they should be .
" Just like companies , municipalities can behave irresponsibly in good times , not shore up any money for bad times and then go crying to the federal government when they need cash , " he added .
Casey Mulligan , an economics professor at the University of Chicago , said a lot of regions have a few industries .
When those industries suffer , the whole area tends to .
Take New York City , which is now hurting because of troubles in the financial sector based there .
One bright spot on the economy : consumer goods .
Brands like Coca - Cola and General Mills are doing well , Mulligan said , in particular , thanks to strong international growth .
The large high - tech companies also appear to be doing well .
" It 's true in all recessions and booms , " he added , " that there are some places that do n't participate . "

My take :
10 . A body blow to racial identity politics .
An end to the era of Jesse Jackson in black America .
9 . Less debt .
Yes , Obama will raise taxes on those earning over a quarter of a million .
And he will spend on healthcare , Iraq , Afghanistan and the environment .
But so will McCain .
He plans more spending on health , the environment and wo n't touch defense of entitlements .
And his refusal to touch taxes means an extra $ 4 trillion in debt over the massive increase presided over by Bush .
And the CBO estimates that McCain 's plans will add more to the debt over four years than Obama's .
Fiscal conservatives have a clear choice .
8 . A return to realism and prudence in foreign policy .
Obama has consistently cited the foreign policy of George H. W. Bush as his inspiration .
McCain 's knee - jerk reaction to the Georgian conflict , his commitment to stay in Iraq indefinitely , and his brinksmanship over Iran 's nuclear ambitions make him a far riskier choice for conservatives .
The choice between Obama and McCain is like the choice between George H.W. Bush 's first term and George W.'s .
7 . An ability to understand the difference between listening to generals and delegating foreign policy to them .
6. Temperament .
Obama has the coolest , calmest demeanor of any president since Eisenhower .
Conservatism values that kind of constancy , especially compared with the hot - headed , irrational impulsiveness of McCain .
5. Faith .
Obama 's fusion of Christianity and reason , his non-fundamentalist faith , is a critical bridge between the new atheism and the new Christianism .
Since Sarah Palin was selected for the vice - presidential nomination , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has given more press conferences than she has .
That 's the country John McCain believes in .

Greg LeNoir checks on his dog Jake in Isalmorada , Florida .
Jake was attacked by a shark while swimming on Friday .
LeNoir punched the shark , which then let go of the dog .
Jake is expected to recover .
( AP Photo / Miami Herald , Cammy Clark )
A man has saved his pet dog from a shark attack by jumping into the water and punching the fish in the neck .
Greg LeNoir and his rat terrier Jake were swimming at a Florida Keys marina when the attack happened .
The 53 - year - old carpenter said : " I saw a big , dark green shape , which I realised was a big shark 's head .
It zoomed up from under Jake .
" Jake screamed - a death scream - and it sucked him under .
I dove straight down like a battering ram , and I drove my fist under the water into the shark .
" And it pushed him down - it felt like concrete on my hand . "
The shark 's teeth punctured Jake 's skin and some muscle on the dog 's abdomen , chest and back .
Jake also suffered lacerations on his right side and front left leg .
The incident happened on Friday afternoon when Mr LeNoir took Jake to the Worldwide Sportsman 's Bayside Marina pier in Islamorada , Florida for the dog 's daily swim .
Mr LeNoir said he was terrified when he saw the shark , but his only thought was saving Jake , who he described as a fast and fearless swimmer , often retrieving jellyfish and coconuts ..
" Jake is such a big part of mine and my wife 's life - we do n't have children , " he said .
" This is what she considers the closest thing to a child .
And I could n't abandon him . "
Mr LeNoir 's brother , Phillip , told the Miami Herald : " Jake 's doing great .
And I still can't believe my brother jumped in the water and punched a shark . "

Darkroom is a batch processor of RAW images , which are images produced by Digital Single Lens Reflex ( DSLR ) cameras , basically it 's a dump of the internal memory of the sensor , in a sense it is the digital version of the film , while a JPEG / PNG image would be the digital version of the photographic print , hence the application name " Darkroom " , since it was the name given to the room where silver films are transformed .
The target user profile of Darkroom is " William " , a passionate digital photography amateur .
William takes a lot of pictures , and since he wants to be sure he gets the maximum out of his pictures , he shoots photos as RAW .
But William likes to share his passion with friends , or on the internet , or print them , and this means he needs to convert his RAW images to a file format that can be easilly seen and used by other people , Since William takes a lot of pictures , he needs to be efficient when doing the convertion , and have the possibility to easily handle a lot of images at the same time .
There are n't many applications in the Free Software world that enable this workflow : there are some GTK - based applications , there is a command - line tool , dcraw , which is used by Darkroom , Digikam , and Krita when decoding RAW images .
But there was nothing that would integrate nicely in KDE .
I see Digikam as good for managing my collection of pictures , and quickly do some light editing , while Gwenview is a fine light - weight image viewer - the KDE4 version is really good , but it seems unable to open RAW files at this time .
Krita is specialized in high - end single image editing and creation .
And now , Darkroom comes to complete the set of KDE tools for photographers .
The goal for the future is to keep making William 's life simpler and smoother , allowing him to work faster .
There are many interface improvements that need to be implemented , for instance adding filtering support to the list of pictures , and so on .
I am also wondering how KDE technologies can be used in Darkroom : though I do n't want to see any collection management features in Darkroom , it could still be interesting to populate the list of images to process by using a NEPOMUK query , for example .
One day in 1957 , six - year - old Steve Stein was sitting with his mother in a Chinese restaurant in Mount Vernon , New York , when a record came on the jukebox that would ignite a lifelong passion for making familiar music sound fresh and strange .
It was a single called The Flying Saucer by a pair of enterprising pranksters called Dickie Goodman and Bill Buchanan .
Using a reel - to - reel tape recorder , they had constructed a spoof narrative about a UFO landing in Times Square , creating dialogue by taking lines from rock 'n ' roll records .
It sold a million copies and prompted an industry lawsuit citing no fewer than 19 copyright infringements , thus making Goodman and Buchanan trailblazers not just in the field of sampling , but in the field of sampling - related litigation .
The kid , who would later become a pivotal figure in the history of sampling under the name Steinski , was impressed .
" I still remember hearing it and thinking : What the hell is this ? , " says Stein .
" I thought : Damn , that 's really crazy .
That 's really cool . "
Twenty - six years later , Stein , by then a Madison Avenue copywriter , entered a competition to remix a single on hip - hop label Tommy Boy .
With sound engineer Douglas Di Franco , aka Double Dee , Stein spent 14 hours creating Lesson 1 : The Payoff Mix , a playful , wildly imaginative collage that made bed - fellows of Little Richard , Grandmaster Flash , Humphrey Bogart and former New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia .
It was really crazy .
It was really cool .
It won the contest , set a new benchmark for sampling and influenced generations of producers from Coldcut and M / A / R/ R/S to DJ Shadow and the Avalanches .
Double Dee & Steinski made four more mixes together , themed around James Brown , or jazz , or classic hip - hop breakbeats , and Steinski has been producing records on and off ever since .
None of them , however , could be officially released .
For years , they circulated under the radar , but now a compilation of his work , What Does It All Mean ? , has appeared on Illegal Art , a copyright - challenging US label run by a mysterious character who calls himself Philo T Farnsworth , after the inventor of the first totally electronic television .
The same label is home to one of Steinski 's spiritual heirs , Girl Talk , whose albums smash together fragments of famous pop records at bewildering speed , earning rave reviews from critics and remix offers from the likes of Beck and Peter , Bjorn & John .
The art of sampling has always kept lawyers busy .
During the late 1980s , albums such as De La Soul 's 3 Feet High and Rising and the Beastie Boys ' Paul 's Boutique looted pop's toy chest for booty and assembled their findings with breathtaking ingenuity and a cavalier disregard for copyright .
But it could n't last .
In a landmark 1991 case , singer - songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan successfully sued rapper Biz Markie over an unlicensed sample of his hit Alone Again ( Naturally ) , and the free - for - all was over .
Cautious hip - hop producers now base tracks on just one or two cleared samples , while prolific samplers such as DJ Shadow and the Avalanches root through charity - shop bins for obscure source material that wo n't incur punitive licensing costs .
But there is a school of sampling that makes illegality a point of principle .
In 1985 , Canadian sound artist John Oswald coined the word " plunderphonics " to describe the art of flagrant sampling .
" Taking Madonna singing Like a Virgin and rerecording it backwards or slower is plunderphonics , as long as you can reasonably recognise the source , " he explained .
" The plundering has to be blatant . "
He summed up his philosophy thus : " If creativity is a field , copyright is the fence . "
The spirit of plunderphonics spread to the likes of San Francisco 's Negativland , who incurred the wrath of U2's label with their parodic U2 EP ; the KLF ( Kopyright Liberation Front ) , whose sample - stuffed debut album was binned after a legal battle with ABBA ; Gnarls Barkley 's Danger Mouse , who received a cease - and - desist order after combining Jay - Z and the Beatles on The Grey Album ; and mash - up producers such as Freelance Hellraiser and Richard X , both of whom have since gone legit .
In each case , blatancy is the point .
Steinski sampled legendary newscaster Walter Cronkite 's coverage of the murder of John F Kennedy on his 1987 record The Motorcade Sped On. CBS refused to license the clips : " I called this guy and described what I wanted to do and he gave a little snort and said , ' There 's no way in hell that we 'll clear that . '
And he just hung up . "
But Steinski pressed ahead with the Cronkite option because " you want the thing ; you do n't want the almost - thing " .
Wanting " the thing " is fundamental to Girl Talk , aka 26 - year - old Gregg Gillis .
" I was taking a Warhol approach , " he says .
" I did n't want to go crate - digging , searching for the obscure sample . "
If you knew nothing of pop history and heard devoted crate - digger DJ Shadow 's Endtroducing album , you would still get out of it everything that Shadow intended to convey , but much of the pleasure of Girl Talk 's records stems from recognition .
" I always wanted to use recognisable elements and play with people 's emotional , nostalgic connections with these songs , " says Gillis .
" For me the biggest challenge is to make transformative new music out of these huge musical parts that anyone can recognise . "
Gillis 's breakneck sampling makes a case for the common language of pop .
By splicing Elton John with the Notorious BIG , or Jay - Z with Radiohead , he celebrates the curious democracy of the Top 40 world .
" It 's a fun game of running through the forest of the history of pop music . "
Of course , to make that point requires plundering records so famous that he could never clear them all .
" To pay every artist on the record I 'd probably have to sell each album for a few hundred pounds .
When I started doing this music I was n't intending to be an outlaw - I just liked sample - based music .
Every band is rehashing ideas from the past , and you can use a sampler or computer as an instrument .
To me that 's no different from the Rolling Stones being influenced by classic blues guitarists .
I feel that it should be legal . "
Stein , too , would be legit in an ideal world .
" If the money and the means had been there I would have done it legally , " he says .
" Being a romantic copyright criminal is interesting considering the fact I 've led a rather sheltered life .
To the extent that I feel that I have any purpose on earth it's to make these goddamn records .
That it 's against the law is completely off to one side . "
Whether these records really are against the law is some - thing of a grey area .
When Dickie Goodman and Bill Buchanan were sued a second time in 1957 , a judge decided that their records fell under the principle of " fair use " , because they had " created a new work " .
Conceived as a defence of free speech , fair use in the US allows unauthorised use of copy - righted material if it is " transformative " , such as a quote from a book in a review , or an artistic parody , and therefore sufficiently different as not to hurt sales of the original work .
Gillis insists his albums are transformative - if anything , his albums stimulate interest in the original songs - but fair use is a nebulous concept subject to the discretion of individual judges .
Current copyright law does not officially recognise the art of sampling .
That may change .
Last year , much to his surprise , Gillis found himself being mentioned in Congress .
Representative Mike Doyle , who represents Gillis 's hometown of Pittsburgh , brought up Girl Talk during a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on the future of radio .
" Maybe mash - ups are transformative new art that expands the consumers ' experience and does n't compete with what an artist has made available on iTunes or at the CD store , " he suggested .
A measure of the record industry 's apparent change of heart is the fact that , despite Girl Talk 's new album being described by the New York Times as " a lawsuit waiting to happen " , neither his record nor Steinski's have been the subject of legal action .
There is a strong , practical reason for this reluctance to sue .
In an era of file sharing , YouTube and freely available remix software , pursuing individual producers for copyright infringement would be like patching up hairline cracks in a dam that already has gaping holes in it .
" Technology has absolutely blown this thing out of the tub , " says Stein .
" When some cat with a laptop can take all the music he wants , mix it up , post it on YouTube and then go to school , then they 're not going to have much luck [ suing ] . "
But it 's worth noting that if the internet currently enjoys the exhilarating freedom of 80s hip - hop , then it 's possible that an equivalent of the Biz Markie ruling might one day bring the shutters clanging down .
What does it all mean ?
It means that every internet user can now access the technology , if not the imagination , necessary to be a Steinski or a Girl Talk .
More and more consumers of art have the means and , they believe , the right to become active participants in it , by recontextualising songs or images .
In 1986 , critic Robert Christgau described Steinski as " a perpetually disillusioned optimist who still assumes that the sounds and images rippling through the American consciousness are , forget copyright , every American 's birthright - that we 're all free to interpret and manipulate them as we choose . "
Back then , Steinski and John Oswald were , their different ways , fighting a lonely fight .
In 2008 , they have a lot of company .

Against such pronouncements , and to the question of a sacrosanct American horizon best reserved for God ’s signature , Mandelstam is sometimes prompted , in a way that seems inevitable in a story like this , to evoke the windmills in Cervantes ’s “ Don Quixote . ”
“ Quixote is a romantic and chivalrous knight who does n’t want anything to change , ” Mandelstam said .
“ He actually says that windmills are monsters with which he is going to do battle .
That ’s a delusion that he projects onto these windmills . ”
To combat these perceptions , Mandelstam hired a British consultant , RPS , that specializes in computerized models to show Delaware citizens exactly how the wind farm would look after its construction .
Mandelstam says he thought these would help Delaware citizens to see offshore wind turbines as Sancho Panza , Quixote ’s sidekick , saw them  not romantically but practically , as a new technology benefiting humanity .
“ I think it ’s a very powerful literary example of a human phenomenon , ” Mandelstam said .
“ When you see wind turbines rather than imagine them in your mind ’s eye , then you perceive a new object in the landscape for what it is  rather than projecting upon it your own fear . ”
It helped , of course , that Bluewater ’s turbines would be sited more than 12 miles out to sea , as opposed to the 5 to 7 miles for Cape Wind , so that , once constructed , the turbines would appear on the horizon no larger than half the size of a thumbnail , and then only on clear days .
“ The Europeans see offshore wind turbines as sentinels , ” Mandelstam told me , “ protecting them from energy domination by foreign powers .
When you put that against a few winter days of seeing turbines on the beach as you walk your dog , I think that ’s a very easy trade - off . ”
Mandelstam ’s visual consultants showed the public what the turbines would look like when built .
He hired consultants to address public concerns about the effects of wind turbines on migrating birds .
He commissioned private meteorologists to verify the wind resource .
And he and his team met regularly with the Delaware public to discuss the impact of the wind farm on ratepayers .
“ In one 21 - day period , we spent $ 380,000 to do a geophysical investigation of the sea floor , ” Mandelstam said .
“ On land , the same geophysical work would cost $ 5,000 . ”
Four months and $ 5 million later , on Dec. 22 , 2006 , Mandelstam and his staff submitted the Bluewater Wind Park proposal , a 3,400 - page document describing a 200 - turbine , 600 - megawatt , $ 1.5 billion offshore wind farm that would serve as a new electrical power plant .
Still , Bluewater was up against two energy Goliaths .
NRG , a generation company with $ 5.9 billion in annual gross receipts , proposed building a coal - fired power plant ; Conectiv , a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings , a Washington - based electric company with annual revenues of $ 8.3 billion , filed to build a natural - gas power plant .
Conectiv ’s sister company Delmarva Power immediately began to wage a negative advertising campaign .
It used radio spots to try to turn people against wind energy , as did NRG , whose clean - coal plant was well represented by Mike Houghton , an NRG lobbyist and a major fund - raiser for Gov. Ruth Ann Minner .
Six months before the bids were officially due , Governor Minner publicly endorsed NRG ’s clean - coal proposal .
And yet , despite the long odds against Bluewater , Delaware ’s citizens began swinging heavily in favor of the offshore wind project .
They were receptive to Bluewater ’s director of communications , Jim Lanard , who appeared weekly on a local talk show .
“ When I first invited Jim onto my show , ” recalls the host , Randy Nelson , “ nobody cared about wind power , but within five months , Jim would come on , and all the phone lines would light up . ”
According to Nelson , the Bluewater project captured the attention of a citizenry hungry for an alternative to coal - fired plants .
“ Out here , the Delaware shore is all we ’ve got for an economy , ” he says .
“ And the coal plant seemed to put the Delaware shore at risk .
It ’s hard to overstate just how much people hated that . ”
For his part , Mandelstam waged a low - budget campaign of town meetings throughout the state , emphasizing price stability  how Bluewater ’s 25 - year utility contract protected ratepayers from rising fossil - fuel prices .
Mandelstam and his firm reinforced wind power ’s environmental benefits and brought their visual simulation images to show how slight the change would be to the Delaware seascape .
“ They answered questions , ” says R. Chris Clark , a Fenwick Island Council member .
“ They were the only ones doing town meetings . ”
People also responded to the economic benefits that the Bluewater project would bring to the state  hundreds of new union jobs , roughly $ 100 million in direct local union construction wages and spinoff industries .
As a first - mover in offshore wind , Delaware was likely to become a development hub for a big build into the mid-Atlantic .
The construction of the Bluewater Wind Park , moreover , would be part of an important step in decommissioning several old coal - fired power plants , the removal of which would , by some estimates , save the state $ 750 million in health - care costs .
Over time , comments to the Public Service Commission were nearly 10 to 1 in favor of the wind project .
A survey conducted by the University of Delaware concluded that 91 percent of the state ’s residents supported wind power offshore  even if it meant paying more per month for electricity .
Soon Bluewater began picking up important endorsements .
One of the first came from Jack Markell , the state treasurer and a current gubernatorial candidate .
Dozens more followed , including a judicious opinion published by the state ’s Audubon Society , but perhaps none were more important  or telling of the change in public opinion  than those from the half - dozen coastal tourist towns whose “ viewshed ” would be slightly but more or less permanently altered .
Then in May 2007 , after the longest and most exhaustive review process in its history , the Public Service Commission unanimously selected the Bluewater Wind Park as the winner of the open competition and ordered Delmarva Power , the same company that had been actively campaigning against the wind farm , to begin negotiating a contract  what ’s known in the business as a long - term power purchase agreement , or P.P.A. , with Bluewater .
The decision seemed nothing short of miraculous .
“ Two years ago , ” Mandelstam told me shortly thereafter , “ if I told the governor of Delaware that I was going to build a wind farm off the coast , she would have laughed in my face .
Maybe it ’s energy prices .
Maybe it ’s the Al Gore movie .
But nobody ’s laughing now . ”

Republican presidential nominee John McCain abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on CNN's " Larry King Live " Tuesday in retaliation for an earlier interview on the network , in which an anchor raised questions about vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's foreign policy credentials .
In the interview , which aired Monday night , anchor Campbell Brown asked McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds repeatedly to cite " just one decision " Gov. Palin made as commander of the Alaska National Guard , a position Mr. Bounds ...
Jon Stewart : How to tell if you 're a ' real American ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Jon Stewart offered some clues on Monday 's Daily Show for how to tell whether you belong to the " real America " where McCain supporters are in the majority and the fake America that lies everywhere else .
Stewart began by showing McCain advisor Nancy Pfotenhaurer describing northern Virginia -- the Obama - supporting suburbs around Washington , DC -- as not part of " real Virginia . "
" What the pfuck ? " asked Stewart in astonishment .
Pfotenhauer went on to list " places in other states , " like " northern Wisconsin , the Iron Range of Minnesota ... the rural areas of Missouri . "
" So , even if John McCain does n't win the ' election ' in ' America , ' " Stewart summarized , " he 'll still be president of ' real America ' -- the America that matters , the one that Sarah Palin will still take questions from . "
Stewart then ran an audio clip of Palin stating , " We believe that the best of America is in the small towns that we get to visit and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call real America , being here with all of you hard - working , very patriotic , very pro-America areas of this great nation . "
As the audience first laughed uneasily and then booed , Stewart held his hands to his temples in dismay .
" What the pfuck ? "
Stewart asked again , as he raised his head .
" So if small towns are real America , that would make big cities like Washington , DC and New York City the capitals of fake America ... the Ground Zero , if you will , of anti-America -- I bet bin Laden feels like a real asshole now , huh ? "
Stewart then completed the trifecta by showing Rep. Michele Bachman ( R - MN ) telling Chris Matthews , " I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America or anti-America . "
" Right now , " Stewart noted , " you 're probably thinking to yourself , ' Am I one of these un-Americans I 've been hearing so much about ? '
All this real America and fake America can get a little hard to figure out . "
Stewart suggested that viewers might apply a complex formula involving , among other factors , the population of their town multiplied by the number of art house movie theaters and divided by the number of people who wear trucker hats but are not actual truckers .
But since math itself is not the ' real American ' way to resolve questions , he offered instead a pop quiz involving favorite clauses of the Bill of Rights ( free speech vs. guns ) , awareness of vegetables , and " are you voting for A , John McCain , or B , the terrorist . "
In concluding , however , Stewart revealed that the quiz itself was a trick , because " if you answered any of these questions , that means you 're watching the Daily Show -- so you 're clearly not a real American . "

There 's no misunderestimating James Cromwell .
The 68 year - old actor , who came to prominence in the 90s with star turns in the popular Babe films and critically - acclaimed performances in L.A. Confidential and RKO 281 , stands an incredible six foot seven inches tall and has a distinct , authoritative voice -- a combo that continues to make him one of the hardest - working character actors in the business .
A longtime left - wing political activist , Cromwell 's sweet spot is putting his own spin on historically significant figures ; his resume includes portrayals of Lyndon Johnson ( in RFK ) , S&L crook Charles Keating ( The People vs. Larry Flynt ) and Britain 's controversial Prince Philip ( The Queen ) , among others .
This week , his latest historical character governs the big screen as he takes on the role of 41st president George Herbert Walker Bush in Oliver Stone 's W. , which chronicles the unlikely rise to power of his son George Walker Bush ( played by Josh Brolin ) , who became president number 43
The busy actor recently dialed up SuicideGirls during an airport run to discuss the ins and outs of the role and to give us his thoughts on the knife - edge our democracy currently exists on .
I 'd like to hear about your first meeting with Oliver Stone , to discuss this role .
How did that go ?
Well , it was Josh 's idea .
He sort of turned his nose up at it , but Josh said , " No , have a meeting with him . "
So we met at a hotel -- Oliver was late -- and then he sat down and said to me , " You know , I offered this part to Warren Beatty and Harrison Ford , but it 's probably better to have someone who is not as well known , blah , blah , blah . "
And I do n't expect anything more , because I 've auditioned for him before .
Then Josh shows up -- and Josh is delightful -- and Oliver is delightful too .
He said , " I understand your politics are a little to the left ... "
I said , " A little does not describe it . "
And he said , " Well , how are you gonna feel about playing Bush ? "
And I said , " You know , I 'll do my best . "
So , I think he liked that Josh and I hit it off -- Josh knew instantly that it was the right thing -- and they needed somebody of my age and somebody of my height .
I bring something to it that I think they wanted in the picture .
They knew , at least I hope , that I would try to make him as human as possible .
He 's a man who made humongous mistakes , the biggest of which was his son , and is now basically as powerless as the rest of us to change the course of the history his son has created for us .
By the way , speaking of Josh , I noticed you did n't get mixed up in that big bar brawl he and the others were in .
No , I missed a lot of the fights .
I missed the fights and the jail !
Actually , the jail one I 'm sorry I missed .
Let 's talk about H.W. 's personality a bit .
He 's 83 years - old and goes skydiving -- what does that say ?
Well , it depends on how you feel about jumping out of airplanes .
He had an experience as a very young man jumping out of an airplane -- unfortunately he did n't take his crew with him .
He was shot down .
Listen , he was there and I was n't and what it takes to fly an airplane in combat ...
I have great respect for that and respect for him being able to do it .
Jumping out of an airplane -- my son has done it , but I have not , I have no interest in doing it .
No , I think the defining thing about him , at least for me -- and a great deal of the picture is about the relationship between father and son -- is the relationship between H.W. and his father , Prescott .
Prescott was an alcoholic .
He was a strict disciplinarian and used physical force .
The family lied about his alcoholism , not only to the outside world , but to themselves .
The mother always said , " Oh , your father is tired , " but everyone knew he was drunk .
So I believe that Bush , from a very early age , pushed down emotions and had a rather ambivalent attitude toward the truth that one presents to the world -- not necessarily to family members , but to the world .
When emotion comes up in him as it did in the Frost interview or in the Florida legislature , he has no mechanism to handle his feelings appropriately and he is convulsed .
His face breaks , he can't talk -- his son had to step in in Florida .
That is , I believe , why his voice is stuck where it is , which is what people parody .
I tried not to .
He is cut off at the neck from his feeling state , but he has feelings and I believe that in private he cares deeply about his family and his son .
I do n't think he was a particularly good father .
He was a distant father .
He was traveling most of the time .
I think the loss of his daughter affected him greatly .
I think he had very strong ambition , always , to make the next step upwards .
I think that had a profound effect on his son , who is very much more like his mother , who raised him .
His son basically dedicated his life to not appear or behave as weak - willed , as he perceived his father to be .
So the cowboy routine is mostly a response to his perception of his father ?
It 's partially a response to his father , it 's partially a response to the humiliation the first time he ran for congress and was out - Texan'd by the candidate he was up against , who called him a Northern carpetbagger and a Connecticut rich boy .
He said to the guy , " Listen , I 've lived all my life in Texas ! " and he had .
He had a strong affinity , a childhood affinity , to that cowboy macho image .
So it was very easy for him to take that on .
I think it contributes to his inability to articulate certain ideas , because it is an application .
It is not necessarily his nature .
The privileged frat - boy making it on the reputation and patronage of his father is more accurate .
That 's not to say he is n't smart , because he is -- he 's a smart man .
He is smart and he is diligent and he is , unfortunately , a true believer .
Did you and Josh make any efforts to meet your Bush counterparts ?
No .
I think Josh , given his nature , the two of them would have probably gotten along .
I wo n't say that I would n't have gotten along with the elder Bush , but I do n't believe that at this time the Bush family would have been at all interested in having a picture done on the events leading up the Iraq war , with the context being the dysfunction between father and son .
Would the Royal Family have been interested in , even if they knew that was how it would turn out ?
The script they would have gotten would have been very dissimilar to what we finally wound up doing , because dramas have a way of creating their own form .
It ended up becoming very sympathetic to the Queen .
Even with that final script , though , I think the Royal Family would have said , " We do n't need films made about us .
We 're doing just fine , thank you . "
That 's their prerogative .
I happen to have met Philip before and I 'm fond of him and I appreciate what he does -- I can't say that I 'm fond of Bush , but I certainly would n't have wanted to give him the opportunity of doing to me what a number of Senators and congressmen have done .
You ask them about something like the October Surprise and you get the party line .
Unless you 're incredibly grounded in the information that you 're bringing to the conversation , you 're gonna get steamrolled .
To me , what happens in the film is a relationship between a father and a son .
I had a father .
I have sons .
I understand that dynamic and I 've tried to recreate it as accurately as possible given the relationship that we know .
Do you think H.W. resents being a relatively minor figure in political history ?
Does that loom large in the father - son dynamic ?
I think it 's a crushing thing for the father , who felt that he did the best he could to pass the dynasty on -- the dynasty involving both families , the Bush family and the Walker family .
In Kitty Kelley 's book and in another book called , [ they cover ] the amount of work that was put into this .
They always thought that Jeb would be the one , the more rational one to bear the mantle .
What W. has done , I think , in the elder 's mind , is destroy that legacy .
I think H.W. Bush did what he could for the dynasty and is sorely disappointed that his son has destroyed it .
I think one of the reasons he 's doing what he 's doing with Clinton -- and Clinton is doing it for similar reasons -- is to keep a lighter and more benevolent side of the Bush legacy before the American public .
I 'm sure there are altruistic reasons too , I mus n't be too hard on the guy .
He never struck me as a figure who aroused much ire in liberals , or anyone for that matter .
Well , if you read the Kitty Kelley book , if you know anything about Iran Contra , if you know about the October Surprise , if you know about any of the activities of the CIA under his tutelage , if you know what he did and did not do as ambassador to China , if you know about his support of Reagan 's wars and the policies , his economics or the lack thereof ... I think there 's plenty .
That said , hesmart enough to understand that pursuing Saddam Hussein would be the last thing you would want to do .
Of course , their goal was a little different then ; it was basically to assuage the Saudis who felt threatened by Saddam .
I believe that Saddam did ask permission to go into Kuwait , I believe it was granted through the ambassador .
I believe they then changed their minds .
I 'm pretty appalled that there are pictures of Saddam and Rumsfeld , when Rumsfeld sent him all the necessary equipment to produce the gas that he then used on his own people .
We provided that .
There was a very quick turnabout , but their idea was not to destabilize the Middle East .
Thatthe Cheney policy .
It 's not the Bush Doctrine , it 's the Cheney Policy and I believe they 've done magnificently -- it just so happens that the cost of it was bringing down the United States .
You 've been politically active for quite a long time -- does the moment we 're at right now parallel anything you 've seen in the past ?
Well , for those people who went through 1931 , it would be incredibly reminiscent .
I do n't know of that , but I think this is unprecedented in its condemnation of ... I do n't know what to call it ... it's not capitalism .
When you say ' capitalism ' to Americans they think ' My god , that 's small businesses , that 's working folk ! ' and I do n't mean that at all .
I mean that large , predatory , multinational capitalism and the markets it supposedly regulates -- or does n't -- is now defunct .
A new system will have to be developed .
Will we have the will ?
Has this ever happened ?
On the radio they were talking about Lincoln in the midst of the Civil War ; the dilemma for Lincoln was profound , so much so that it made the topic of slavery secondary in his mind to maintaining the union .
The union was at stake .
I believe the survival of this country is definitely at stake , and not only with the economic crisis .
The pursuit of American empire -- the plan laid out by Cheney for American bases from the Tigris to the Euphrates because we basically have no friends and in order to maintain our supremacy we need to control the energy resources in that area of the world -- is a collision course with the rest of the world , which we 'll ultimately lose .
It 'll either destroy us or the entire planet .
It also takes away from the multitude of issues also involving the survivability of the planet , which we should be facing with every resource at our command .
How do we shift this lifestyle of consuming the world 's resources and spitting them out into the atmosphere as pollutants ?
We 're watching the biosphere die in front of us .
So maybe not the best time for the media to be focusing on things like the Weather Underground , in your opinion ?
Of course it 's not the time .
Listen , I understand they 're gonna run that out .
If you wanna talk about things I condemned the elder Bush for , that campaign against Dukakis and the use of Willie Horton and the tank ad are two prime examples of Atwater - Rove manipulation of media that we are now experiencing again .
I understand that McCain 's ads are now 100 percent negative , but that 's only a minor thing that involves one candidate .
The fact that Obama can stand up there and answer questions that have been screened in a debate forum controlled by both parties and under a contract that they will not release to the press , and that they will not include Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader ... the issues have nothing to do with goddamn terrorists they have to do with the terrorists who run our country .
They are not allowed to ask or answer those questions appropriately in this forum .
That is the crisis of this country .
Not only do we know that the last two elections were basically stolen , we 're watching them being stolen again right from under our noses !
No one says fuck all about it !
I do n't know , there 's a pretty healthy alternative media in this country for those who want it .
I totally agree .
Bless our hearts , that is quite true , but when I say that no one says fuck all about it , the mainstream media that reaches the majority of the people .... as almost anybody who tends to agree with us says , they 're asleep , they 're shopping , they 're numb , they 're distracted , they 're lazy , they 're stupid , they 're unwilling , they 're uninformed .
Those people do n't know what we know .
Those people do n't hear the truth .
Only those people are gonna make a difference .
We have to move them to action !
Does the presumptive Obama victory in a few weeks give you any hope ?
I have hope .
The conditions are so bad from this administration that , much like the country that Roosevelt inherited , I hope that Obama is a big enough man to respond to the needs of ordinary American people , and that ordinary Americans learn that it is not our leaders who lead us .
All substantive change in this country has come from the people , not the leaders .
The leaders do n't lead -- they follow .
Now , the question is will we abdicate the way we 've abdicated for the last eight years and probably the last forty years ?
Will we abdicate to the money forces , the Wall Street forces , the multinationals and the military - industrial complex ?
Or will we finally say , " This is it !?
This is our country .
We are taking it back .
We believe in habeas corpus .
We hold these truths to be self - evident .
That all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights .
Among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
That to maintain these rights , governments are instituted among men , who derive their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That when these powers threaten these rights it is the duty and it is the obligation of the people to throw off this government .
" I believe that .
That 's what this country is founded on and that is what we have to rediscover .
Barack Obama ?
As the Black Panthers used to say , you 're either part of the solution or you 're part of the problem .
He has the choice .
If he wants to be part of the solution , he has to listen to more rational voices .
He has to listen to more progressive voices .
He has to listen to his heart .
He has to listen to his wife .
He has to listen to his children and all of our children and do the right thing .
That 's the key , he has to do the right thing .
If you met Dick Cheney , would you shake his hand ?
No .
I would not , but he would n't shake mine either , so it would be a stand - off .
You just want to put him behind you , then ?
Put Cheney in jail .
That would be more appropriate .
I do believe that if that woman wins in Vermont , the attorney general , she will .
Bugliosi 's book is the blueprint for how .
I believe that what happened on September 11th was a crime against the American people and should have been pursued by law enforcement in a rational way .
Then we would have Osama bin Laden -- if in fact Osama bin Laden is responsible -- behind bars .
It was used as an excuse for a coup -- the second in my lifetime , the first one being at the death of JFK .
This is the second coup , the destruction of American democracy .
We need the men who have perpetrated this coup behind bars where they belong , as a lesson to other despots , that they cannot behave this way !
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Alabama elections officials Monday over what it says is an overly expansive policy disenfranchising felons , amid concern from voting rights groups nationwide that voting lists are being culled with too great alacrity by many states .
Like virtually all states , Alabama restricts the rights of many felons to vote , but in Monday ’s suit the group contends the state is going beyond even its own laws .
People convicted of nonviolent offenses like income tax evasion or forgery are at risk of being turned away by voter registrars in Alabama , the A.C.L.U. says .
Alabama does not bar all felons from voting , only those convicted of crimes involving “ moral turpitude . ”
In 2003 , the civil liberties group says , the State Legislature clearly defined what those crimes are : murder , rape , sodomy , sexual abuse , incest , sexual torture and nine other crimes mainly involving pornography and abuses against children .
At issue in the lawsuit is not the list enacted in law but an expanded “ moral turpitude ” list developed by the state ’s attorney general , Troy King , in 2005 .
That list includes about a dozen additional offenses , most of them nonviolent , and several including the sale of marijuana .
Siamo abituati a leggere le notizie che riguardano la tutela dell ’ ambiente e lo sviluppo sostenibile nell ’appedice dei giornali , affiancate alle pagine che recensiscono gli ultimi best - seller usciti in libreria o le prodezze di Ronaldinho .
Da una settimana , invece , l’argomento ha guadagnato stabilmente le prime pagine dei giornali grazie alle vicende legate all ’approvazione del pacchetto clima europeo .
L’Italia in particolare sta tenendo banco ai vari vertici europei , mantenendo un clima di incertezza su quelli che saranno gli esiti del pacchetto che dovrebbe perpetuare gli impegni assunti già a Kyoto , prevedendo una riduzione delle emissioni del 20 % entro il 2020 .
Ma per capire il perchè di tanto fermento e dell ’incertezza sugli esiti del consiglio dei ministri dell ’ ambiente di oggi e degli altri meeting europei dovuti alle politiche italiane , una breve cronistoria della vicenda può essere utile .
Il primo segnale risale già al 14 settembre , quando la presidentessa di confindustria ha dichiarato guerra aperta a questo pacchetto , che produce “ danni enormi alle economie in cambio di benefici infinitesimali per l’ambiente ” .
La seconda tappa di questa breve cronistoria riguarda l’eco di questa polemica riportato in sede europea dal Presidente del Consiglio italiano , che ha invocato una riduzione degli oneri in capo alle imprese in vista della grave crisi economico - finanziaria che stanno attraversando i paesi , che è sfociato negli ultimi giorni nella scelta di guidare un quantomeno eterogeneo fronte del no , che mira ad un rinvio e/o a delle modifiche .
Il fatto è che gli altri paesi , o almeno le economie europee più avanzate , nonostante vivano nella stessa epoca storica , non sono affatto dello stesso parere , anzi .
Molti leader europei si sono esposti chiaramente a riguardo : la tutela dell ’ambiente non è necessariamente solo un costo .
Parte della querelle innescata dalle posizioni italiane in sede europea riguarda proprio anche la questione numeri .
Secondo alcuni i dati presentati da industriali e governo sui costi del pacchetto per le aziende non tengono conto dei vantaggi che questo pacchetto può apportare , che alleggerirebbero quindi il conto totale a carico delle aziende .
Non solo .
E non tanto perchè , come concorda tutta la comunità scientifica , la lotta ai cambiamenti climatici non è più rinviabile , tanto per un motivo prettamente economico .
La carta della leadership nell ’economia pulita potrebbe rappresentare infatti uno ( dei pochi possibili ) assi nella manica per le economie europee , posizionandole su un business in grado di proiettarle nel futuro prossimo con un vantaggio economico da giocarsi contro gli agguerriti competitor internazionali .
L’economia pulita è considerata secondo molte autorevoli voci la bolla che può salvarci dalle bolle ( finanziarie , … ) subite finora , il mezzo per rialzare l’economia mondiale insieme alle sorti del pianeta .
Per concludere con Zapatero : “ la crisi internazionale non deve portarci a fare passi indietro : ridurre la dipendenza dai combustibili fossili e ridurre l’inquinamento non è un problema ma una via d’uscita , una soluzione ” .
Quello che questa vicenda ci segnala è che la tutela dell ’ambiente non è un argomento né secondario né slegato dalle sorti economiche degli stati .
Vedremo se l’Unione Europea sarà in grado di raccogliere questa opportunità , sfidando le inerzie per proiettarsi nel futuro .

It 's a big white building on Mission Boulevard .
You can't miss it ; the Art Deco style is really striking .
The grass is trimmed and it all looks perfectly inviting , except this is a lock - out .
The first Hayward City Hall in California has long been off - limits to occupants because its foundations sit right atop an earthquake fault and it 's gradually splitting in two .
" Look up at the stairwell , " says geologist Russ Graymer , as we peer through a window .
" There are huge cracks , several centimetres broad and many metres long - basically showing the evidence that this building is being torn in half . "
The Hayward Fault is one of a network of cracks in the Earth 's surface running through the San Francisco Bay Area .
The San Andreas Fault is probably the best known , but right now the Hayward is the one everyone 's talking about .
The records show that the past five large earthquakes on this fault have occurred on average about 140 years apart , and the last was - you 've guessed it - 140 years ago .
Tuesday is the anniversary .
At 0755 on the morning of 21 October , 1868 , the Hayward broke with a Magnitude 6.8 quake .
The San Francisco Bay Area is crossed by a number of faults
Enlarge Map
The ground lurched some two metres and the cities of Oakland to the north and San Francisco to the west were shattered .
In the context of post - 1850 quake history in the Bay Area , the tremor is rivalled in size only by the 1906 " Big One " in San Francisco ( 7.8 ) , and the 6.9 event of Loma Prieta in 1989 .
" The difference with Loma Prieta was that the maximum shaking was 50 miles to the south in the mountains , " says Dr Graymer from the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
" The squirrels and the redwoods took the brunt of the shaking in 1989 .
In contrast , this is an urban area and the folks who live here will take the brunt of it if the Hayward decides to go . "
Some have now dubbed the Hayward " the most dangerous urban fault in America " .
" It 's the probability that the Hayward will generate a large earthquake in the next 30 years combined with the fact that it runs right through an urban area .
These two facts taken together make it the most dangerous right now , " says Dr Graymer .
The comparison is often made with Kobe , Japan , which suffered a Magnitude 6.9 earthquake in 1995 .
Kobe , like Hayward and Oakland , sits on the east side of a bay - Osaka Bay - and the Nojima Fault running through Kobe mirrors the Hayward in type ( strike - slip ) and in length .
More than 5,000 people died in the 1995 Kobe event .
The Hayward Fault is creeping by as much as 5 mm a year in some places
When scientists assessed the probabilities of a big quake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area in the coming decades , they pointed to the Hayward and its northern extension , the Rodgers Creek Fault , as being the most likely locations for the tremor .
" There 's a 63 % chance of a Magnitude 6.7 or greater in the next 30 years across the entire Bay Area , " says USGS seismologist Tom Brocher .
" That 's roughly two out of three odds , and about half of that falls on the Hayward / Rodgers Creek Fault .
That 's why we 're focussing on the Hayward and why we 're so concerned about it . "
The concern has been heightened in recent years by research which indicates that the Hayward and the parallel Calaveras Fault might actually be connected at depth , and , as such , could produce , in effect , a single , even more powerful event .
Between two and four million people would experience shaking strong enough to cause damage if the Hayward lets go in a similar fashion to 1868 .
Economic losses could exceed $ 200bn , says the USGS .
The apparent risks have authorities across the Bay racing hard to shore up local infrastructure .
In excess of $ 30 bn has been spent since Loma Prieta .
Roads , rail , bridges , buildings , hospitals , water and other utility systems are all being " retro- fitted " , which involves suspect engineering being swapped out for structures thought more likely to ride out immense shaking .
" The local power company , Pacific Gas and Electric , has been replacing old cast - iron gas pipes with new flexible piping .
A lot of work is being done but we have more to do , " Dr Brocher tells BBC News .
Hayward is now on its third City Hall .
While the first is not expected to survive a big quake , the latest incarnation will rock back and forth on a " pendulum " system fitted to its foundations .
This should see it come through a Magnitude 7 event without major damage .

Sarah Palin Caught Misusing Taxpayer Funds Posted by Pile ( 11359 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Beating Dead Horses ]
Gov. Sarah Palin charged the state for her children to travel with her , including to events where they were not invited , and later amended expense reports to specify that they were on official business .
The charges included costs for hotel and commercial flights for three daughters to join Palin to watch their father in a snowmobile race , and a trip to New York , where the governor attended a five - hour conference and stayed with 17 - year - old Bristol for five days and four nights in a luxury hotel .
In all , Palin has charged the state $ 21,012 for her three daughters ' 64 one - way and 12 round - trip commercial flights since she took office in December 2006 .
In some other cases , she has charged the state for hotel rooms for the girls .
Alaska law does not specifically address expenses for a governor 's children .
The law allows for payment of expenses for anyone conducting official state business .
As governor , Palin justified having the state pay for the travel of her daughters — Bristol , 17 ; Willow , 14 ; and Piper , 7 — by noting on travel forms that the girls had been invited to attend or participate in events on the governor 's schedule .
But some organizers of these events said they were surprised when the Palin children showed up uninvited , or said they agreed to a request by the governor to allow the children to attend .

Unlocking the Verizon Wireless xv6800 ( HTC Titan ) GPS
Skywing
In August 2008 Verizon Wireless released a firmware upgrade for their xv6800 ( rebranded HTC Titan ) line of Windows Mobile smartphones that provided a number of new features previously unavailable on the device on the initial release firmware .
In particular , support for accessing the device 's built - in Qualcomm gpsOne assisted GPS chipset was introduced with this update .
However , Verizon Wireless elected to attempt to lock down the GPS hardware on xv6800 such that only applications authorized by Verizon Wireless would be able to access the device 's built - in GPS hardware and perform location - based functions ( such as GPS - assisted navigation ) .
The mechanism used to lock down the GPS hardware is entirely client - side based , however , and as such suffers from fundamental limitations in terms of how effective the lockdown can be in the face of an almost fully user - programmable Windows Mobile - based device .
This article outlines the basic philosophy used to prevent unauthorized applications from accessing the GPS hardware and provides a discussion of several of the flaws inherent in the chosen design of the protection mechanism .
In addition , several pitfalls relating to debugging and reverse engineering programs on Windows Mobile are also discussed .
Finally , several suggested design alterations that would have mitigated some of the flaws in the current GPS lock down system from the perspective of safeguarding the privacy of user location data are also presented .

The European Union is Pushing to Overhaul the Post - World War II Financial System .
European Union leaders pressed for an overhaul of the global financial system to prevent a repeat of the credit crunch that sparked the biggest stock - market selloff since the Great Depression .
EU leaders called for a global summit as soon as next month to rewrite the 1944 Bretton Woods accord that paved the way for Europe 's post - World War II reconstruction and set up the institutions that oversee the world economy today .
" We had the emerging market crisis , we had the Internet bubble , now we have this massive crisis , " French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters after chairing the first session of an EU summit late yesterday in Brussels .
Europe insists on the " re-foundation of the international financial system . "
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown , author of the British bank - bailout plan that was copied across Europe and in the U.S. , called for an end - of - year deadline to place each of the world 's top 30 banks under the supervision of a panel of regulators from the countries where it is active .
" We now have global financial markets , but what we do not have is anything other than national and regional regulation and supervision , " Brown said .
Treatment of tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and Monaco may be overhauled as part of any new global financial framework , Sarkozy said .
" It will be part of discussions Saturday in Washington , " the French leader said .
" Will we continue to work with tax havens ?
It 's a valid question .
We 've passed into a new era .
It 's a question we 'll put on the table and immediately . "
" There needs to be a new Bretton Woods , " Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said .
" The consensus is very strong and it keeps growing stronger . "
The European initiative is likely to face headwinds from the U.S. , which has used its dominance of international financial institutions to promote a brand of capitalism that has come into at least temporary disrepute .
" The U.S. got what it wanted in 1944 and , I suspect , will do so again simply because the Europeans wo n't be able to decide what they want , " said Martin Weale , director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London .
Trichet Urges Return to ' Discipline ' of Bretton Woods
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet said officials reshaping the world 's financial system should try to return to the " discipline " that governed markets in the decades after World War II .
" Perhaps what we need is to go back to the first Bretton Woods , to go back to discipline , " Trichet said after giving a speech at the Economic Club of New York yesterday .
" It 's absolutely clear that financial markets need discipline : macroeconomic discipline , monetary discipline , market discipline . "
At Bretton Woods , nations agreed to fix exchange rates , establish the International Monetary Fund and start the process of rebuilding Europe 's economy in the aftermath of World War II by encouraging coordinated economic policies .
Brown said national regulators must coordinate their work and banks should be pushed to disclose more trading positions .
" If we do n't have discipline , then we are putting into question the functioning of the market economies and the functioning of our financial markets , " Trichet said .

Can efforts like the Vision for Space Exploration survive a relative apathy about human spaceflight among the general public ?
( credit : Lockheed Martin )
Space exploration at a crossroad Part 1 : lessons to be learned
As we attempt to look 25 years into the future , we catch visions of breathtaking journeys in large man-made planets around the Sun to Mars and Venus , of a new freedom of movement of man across millions of miles of space , of a permanent colony on the Moon and of large space stations or space forts at key locations for the conduct of space research , for aid to space navigation , and for rescue operations .
- Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , March 16 , 1962
For many reasons , we are living at a peculiar time in the exploration of space .
After fifty years , it ’s time to think again about what we have accomplished and where we are going .
We are also at the mid-point in operation of the International Space Station and at the end of the Space Shuttle era .
We will also soon see a new president at the helm of the United States .
This president will be confronted to some of the biggest challenges ever encountered by any of its predecessors : how to end the war in Iraq , how to balance the US budget against the needs of America , how to take care of the climate change crisis and energy needs , and how to meet aging Baby Boomer needs given the prodigious US national debt .
Of course , in this context , the space program will not be a great issue for him .
But , considering the importance of space in terms of economics , education , technology R&D and applications , as well as in geopolitics , it is wise to think about what will happen in the next decade .
Time for reflection November 2008 will mark the tenth anniversary of the International Space Station , with the launch of its first component on November 20 , 1998 .
ISS has been inhabited since November 2000 by successive crews who spent up to six months onboard .
They have accumulated some two billion kilometers of travel , something like a half - dozen Earth - Mars roundtrips .
Laypeople have no idea of what we ’re doing in space .
Many even think that billions spent “ in space ” should be put in better use here on Earth .
ISS is a colossal success considering that it ’s an assembly of complex components built separately in the US , Russia , Europe , Japan , and Canada .
The fact that this assortment has functioned nearly perfectly for a decade is , by itself , a great achievement .
But ISS is also an achievement in that it requires a level of day - to - day collaboration between America and Russia unthinkable twenty years ago .
And who would have though that , following the Columbia loss , Russians would be so kind in keeping the station inhabited during the stand down of the Space Shuttle ?
The station ’s tenth anniversary could also mark the mid-point of the program , since the station will probably be near its end in about ten years .
In July 2009 , we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first man on the Moon .
It will be time to remember nearly fifty years of piloted spaceflight and re-evaluate the role of humans in space : are they worth the expense ?
This question , asked since the early days of the Space Age , will be an important one considering the future of the piloted space program after ISS and the Shuttle .
But perhaps more important will be the arrival in office of a new administration in time to rethink the future of space exploration .
We will then be at the end of the Space Shuttle program , with about only a year of flying this marvelous but cocky machine .
At some point early in his first term , the president will have to decide the future of the space program : what to do with ISS and President Bush ’s Vision for Space Exploration ?
Are we really going back to the Moon ?
If so , at what pace and for what purpose exactly : to stay and live in a Moonbase ( like we ’re doing onboard ISS ) or to continue up to Mars ?
Or , if not , what else ?
What we ’re not telling the public Laypeople have no idea of what we ’re doing in space .
Many even think that billions spent “ in space ” should be put in better use here on Earth .
How many have an idea of the number of spacecraft launched since Sputnik ?
And what purpose are they serving ?
As one of my friends told me recently : “ What ’s happening in space always goes wrong : it ’s astronauts in trouble , launch delays , major failures , cost - overruns … ”
What my friend is saying is that each time he heard about space , it ’s because there ’s a problem .
Like the rest of the public , he is rarely told about achievements , for instance , in Mars and Saturn exploration or about Hubble ’s observations or about the assembly of the International Space Station .
The only time the mass media reports about space these days , it seems , is when something goes wrong .
Of course , what interests most of us is space exploration , mainly piloted flights and planetary exploration .
But who is aware that one of those two is booming with plenty of activities while the other is arriving at a crossroad ?
Never before in the history of humankind are we making so many discoveries about our neighboring universe .
Never in the fifty years of space exploration have we seen so many probes exploring so many interesting places in our solar system .
Right now , a half - dozen robots are working on the surface of and in orbit around Mars , discovering what looks like traces of water .
They even make us think about possibilities of some microbial or other early life forms on the Red Planet !
Thanks to Cassini , we are discovering lakes on Titan , the only place outside Earth where liquid exists on the surface of a world .
And what about the spectacular pictures this probe sends us of Saturn ’s rings and of its strange orbiting worlds ?
We ’re even contemplating the possibility of life in such exotic worlds as Europa and Titan .
There have also been a number of lunar missions launched , or about to be launched , by Europe , Japan , China , the US , and India .
There are also many probes en route to interesting places .
While Venus Express is studying our sister planet , MESSENGER will place itself into orbit around Mercury in 2011 .
From 2011 to 2015 , Dawn will extensively explore the main belt asteroids Vesta and Ceres .
For its part , Rosetta will orbit comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko in 2014 and place a lander on it .
Finally , New Horizons will arrive at Pluto in 2015 .
In fact , 10 % of all probes ever launched are right now busily exploring our solar system !
But the public is rarely told about that .
On the other hand , piloted spaceflight may be approaching a long hiatus .
After nearly thirty years of services , the Space Shuttle is completing assembly of the International Space Station while crews work inside it .
But living and working inside an orbiting lab is not very exciting even to space fans .
So , what will happen beyond 2010 , after the Space Shuttle is retired ?
As we have seen during the Shuttle ’s two - and - a - half - year grounding following the loss of Columbia , we will probably see ISS manned by crews replaced every six months by Soyuz spacecraft .
Not very exciting .
Oh yes , American astronauts are scheduled to come back to ISS around 2015 aboard their brand - new Orion spacecraft , an enlarged Apollo - type capsule .
But what if , in the meantime , some major trouble occurred on board the station ?
What if a critical system fails , or the shell of a module is punctured , or one of its solar arrays is severely damaged , or a vital piece of equipment breaks down ?
What interests most of us is space exploration , mainly piloted flights and planetary exploration .
But who is aware that one of those two is booming with plenty of activities while the other is arriving at a crossroad ?
The Soyuz is a great transport ship for crew and some cargo , but it is no match to the capabilities of the Space Shuttle .
What will happen if we need to carry large or heavy equipment to refurbish or repair the station beyond 2010 ?
In a way , the recent deterioration of the rotating joint of one of the main solar arrays of ISS is an illustration of the kind of trouble ahead for the aging orbital complex .
This problem , we are told , will require many EVAs done by Shuttle astronauts in upcoming missions .
But , without the Shuttle , how would such a problem be tackled in the future ?
Another scenario is the possibility that the Orion spacecraft will not be ready before the end of ISS .
We could thus relive the 1970s , when Skylab was awaiting visits by early Shuttle crew .
Delays in the Shuttle program and intense solar activity made Skylab fall from the sky before it could be reboosted .
In 2018 , the first elements of ISS will be 20 years old and , if everything went well , dozen of crews would have lived aboard for 6,500 days .
The station would probably be at the end of its useful life .
Thus , if Orion is delayed a couple of years , as was the Shuttle , no other American ship could ever come back to ISS after the last Shuttle flight of 2010 .
Does the American public have any idea of what could happen in the next decade ?
Spaceflight at a crossroad
Why do we explore ?
For what purpose , exactly , and at what cost ?
The next president , as busy as he will be in managing national and world affairs , will probably have to tackle these questions .
Of course , he could simply give NASA its yearly allowance without further question .
But with so much red ink left to him by the current administration and so many needs to meet , he will have to make some choices at some point .
Will he decide to cut space spending and stop or delay the Constellation program ?
Or , in a surprising move , will he commit the program to go to Mars ?
Or would he simply delay astronauts ’ arrival on the Moon by not funding NASA enough ?
Of course , we could argue that piloted spaceflight is essential , that it is economically vital to hundreds of thousands jobs all over the country .
It ’s also important for young people , since astronauts , scientists , and engineers are role models for them and make science appealing .
We know these arguments .
But is it really true ?
That is , if the public does n’t care any longer about space exploration , how it is an important stimulus to young people ?
As for the hundreds of thousands of jobs , maybe we could use those talents to solve environmental problems and energy crisis ?
If we expect to continue space exploration , we need to make it appealing not only to scientists , engineers , and space enthusiasts , but also to the public in general .
In his January 2004 announcement of the Vision for Space Exploration , President Bush tried to inspire the nation by sending astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and , later , to Mars .
But , since then , a lot of people are asking why must we come back to a place we ’d already been six times , and why go to Mars at all ?
Is n’t it too expensive ?
Do n’t we need this money here on Earth ?
One of the problems with VSE is its long schedule : the president announced something that could happen in 15 years or more — if everything goes well .
Another problem is that people do not understand why it ’s so important to explore the Moon again , as if we already did n’t know nearly everything we need to know about our neighbor .
Maybe the fundamental problem with the VSE is that the public does n’t care about the Moon !
Back in the 1960s , when President Kennedy announced a lunar landing before the end of the decade , he was appealing to a dream humanity had for centuries .
Looking at night , a lot of people were then dreaming of what it would be like to stand on the Moon .
In addition , Kennedy challenged the nation to do it in less than nine years .
Today , we are not dreaming of being on the Moon again and the same could be said about Mars : with so many spectacular shots taken from its surface by robots , do n’t we already have the impression of having been there ?
Maybe the fundamental problem with the VSE is that the public does n’t care about the Moon !
This impression could be amplified by the wonderful art NASA provides .
Soon after President Bush announced the Vision , NASA published illustrations and video clips showing the real thing .
In a way , Bush ’s vision has already been seen !
The same applied for Mars : looking at NASA ’s wonderful clips showing landing of robots gives us the impression that they are films taken on the spot .
How many people think we had already been on Mars ?
Or , how many are really dreaming of seeing humans strolling on the red surface ?
So , how do we convince the public that it is so important and exciting to go back to the Moon and then on to Mars ?
How do we inspire them that it ’s a fabulous adventure they ’ll need to follow during decades ?
How do we challenge them that it ’s worth the tens of billions of dollars while there are so many urgent needs here on Earth ?
That ’s a challenge — a big challenge — that no one has met yet .
Learning from previous endeavors Instead of going forward to the next big challenge of space exploration , maybe it ’s time to take a break and think about the past three decades .
After thirty years of Space Shuttle missions and ten years of International Space Station operations , what have we learned ?
In this essay , we ’re not talking about scientific , technological , or political lessons , but instead about the big picture .
Each of the five lessons proposed here could be the subject of an essay of its own , but they are discussed briefly just to give some ideas to think about .
Lesson 1 : Public interest is not sustainable for decades Apollo was a true race , not so much against the Soviets than against time .
NASA put two men on the Moon after only eight years of rapid , spectacular ( and sometime tragic ) steps .
But times have changed and big programs like the Shuttle , the Space Station , and the Vision for Space Exploration span decades .
That ’s way too long for the public , politicians , and mass media to stay excited about .
Last July , speaking about developing renewable energy sources , Al Gore confirmed this fact when he said : “ Ten years is about the maximum time that we , as a nation , can hold a steady aim and hit our target . ”
So , the first lesson we could learn from the last thirty years of spaceflight is that public interest is not sustainable for decades .
Lesson 2 : It ’s dangerous to oversell a program When President Nixon announced the Space Shuttle program in 1972 , NASA envisioned a very affordable ( $ 25 million a flight ) and routine ( 50 missions a year ) airline - type access to space .
Even in 1982 , some 500 flights were scheduled for the first twelve years of Shuttle operations .
Well , after thirty years of flight , we ’ll had achieved less than 135 missions for a program that cost at least $ 150 billion ( that ’s more than a billion dollars per flight ) .
Thus , one the main lessons to be learned from the Space Shuttle is that it ’s dangerous to oversell a program .
Lesson 3 : Priorities change over decades
When President Reagan announced the space station program in 1984 , the world was very different from what it is today .
At that time , a newly commercial space sector was developing and dozens of corporations were investing to use a zero - G facility for marketable goods and services .
But when the station finally became available , this private space sector had been dead for some 15 years !
At its origins , the station was suppose to be a huge science lab for research in new medicines , materials , and industries , but President Bush restricted it to the study of long - term effects of space travel on human biology .
No wonder that , 25 years after its announcement , the ISS does n’t seem very useful given its $ 100 - billion price tag .
Lesson 4 : What do we really care about ?
In 1961 , President Kennedy had to choose between building a space station and a space shuttle before going to the Moon , or to go directly to the Moon .
He chose to shoot for humanity ’s dream .
We could n’t say the same about the Shuttle , ISS , or VSE since the general public had to be educated about why these projects are important .
The one exception could be piloted expeditions to Mars .
But , perhaps for some of the above reasons , this dream had already faded out .
Thus , it is important to think about what the public really cares about .
Lesson 5 : Big programs are very vulnerable A fifth lesson is that big - ticket programs are very vulnerable to cuts , delays , and overruns , as we have seen with the Space Shuttle and ISS .
To circumvent this vulnerability , President Bush proposed that most of the funding for VSE come from reallocations within the NASA budget , supplemented by modest overall funding increases for the agency .
Also , the program will progress as technology and costs make it possible — that ’s the pay - as - you - go strategy put forth by the President .
But the VSE is already in trouble because NASA has n’t received the modest increases expected .
Furthermore , paying as you go could stretch out the program , which exacerbates lessons 1 and 3 .
So , what could we do to continue to explore space , considering lessons gleaned from previous endeavors ?
Could we think of a program that really takes into account what people do care — or dream — about and that could sustain public interest over the long term ?
The answer will come in part 2 .

but the fighter still remains
COLUMBUS , Ohio -
When a group is without a leader , you can often count on a narcissist to take charge , a new study suggests .
Researchers found that people who score high in narcissism tend to take control of leaderless groups .
Narcissism is a trait in which people are self - centered , exaggerate their talents and abilities , and lack empathy for others .
" Not only did narcissists rate themselves as leaders , which you would expect , but other group members also saw them as the people who really run the group , " said Amy Brunell , lead author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University at Newark .
Narcissists , by definition , are self - centered and overconfident in their own abilities .
The researchers found similar results in two separate studies involving college students , and one involving business managers in an MBA program .
And while narcissists are more likely to become leaders , results of one of the studies suggests that , once in power , narcissists do n't perform any better than others in that leadership role .
" It 's not surprising that narcissists become leaders , " Brunell said .
" They like power , they are egotistical , and they are usually charming and extraverted .
But the problem is , they do n't necessarily make better leaders . "
The study will appear in an upcoming print issue of the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin .
It is currently available to subscribers online .
The first study involved 432 undergraduate students .
They all completed assessments which measured various personality traits , including narcissism .
They were then put in groups of four , and told to assume they were a committee of senior officers of the student union , and their task was to elect next year 's director .
Each person in a group was given a profile of a different candidate for the position , and each was to argue for their particular candidate .
Following the discussion , they voted on the director , and then completed a questionnaire evaluating the leadership of themselves and the other group members .
Results showed that students who scored higher on one dimension of narcissism - the desire for power - were more likely to say they wanted to lead the group , were more likely to say they did lead the group discussion , and were more likely to be viewed as leaders by the other group members .
The other dimension of narcissism - the desire for attention - was not as strongly related to leadership roles in the groups .
" It 's not surprising , but the desire for power is what really drives narcissists to seek leadership positions , " she said .
In a second study , 408 students were placed in groups of four and given a scenario in which they imagined they were shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and had to choose which 15 salvageable items that the group should take ashore which will best help them survive .
After a group discussion , those who scored highest on the power dimension of narcissism again showed the most desire to lead the group discussion , rated themselves as leaders , and were viewed by other group members as the leaders .
This study went further , though , by seeing how well the narcissists performed as leaders .
Researchers looked at the lists , prepared by each individual and group , of the 15 items that they thought would help them survive .
They compared their lists to one prepared by an expert who has taught survival skills to the U.S military .
Results showed that narcissists did no better than others on selecting the items that would best help them survive .
In addition , groups that overall scored highest on narcissism did no better than other groups on the task .
A third study involved 153 business managers enrolled in an executive MBA program at a large southeastern university .
The managers were also put in groups of four and told to assume the role of a school board deciding how to allocate a large financial contribution from a fictional company .
Two trained observers - professors or doctoral students in industrial / organizational psychology - observed the groups and rated how much of a leadership role each participant assumed in their groups .
Results showed that the MBA students rated highest in narcissism were most likely to be identified as emerging leaders by the expert observers .
" Even trained observers saw narcissistic people as the natural leaders , " Brunell said .
" In addition , this study showed that narcissism plays a role in leadership among real - world managers . "
Brunell said the studies took into account other factors - such as gender and personality traits like high self - esteem and extraversion - that may relate to leadership development .
But even when these factors were taken into account , narcissism still played a key role .
It is important not to confuse narcissism with high self - esteem , she said .
" A person with high self - esteem is confident and charming , but they also have a caring component and they want to develop intimacy with others , " Brunell explained .
" Narcissists have an inflated view of their talents and abilities and are all about themselves .
They do n't care as much about others . "
Brunell said she believes the results apply to many parts of life , from the politics of the presidential race to Wall Street .
" Many people have observed that it takes a narcissistic person to run for president of the United States , " she said .
" I would be surprised if any of the candidates who have run were n't higher than average in narcissism . "
The same is true for the leaders of Wall Street firms that have made and lost millions of dollars in the past few years .
" There have been a lot of studies that have found narcissistic leaders tend to have volatile and risky decision - making performance and can be ineffective and potentially destructive leaders , " she said .
However , that does n't mean all the troubles in Washington or Wall Street can be blamed on narcissistic leaders .
" I 'm sure some of these leaders had to be overconfident and too sure of their abilities .
But there 's a lot more behind the troubles of government and business than the personalities of their leaders . "

FAIRFAX , Va. 
Voters by the thousands will begin casting ballots for president this week in an early voting process that 's expected to set records this year .
Residents of Virginia , Kentucky and Georgia are among the first in the nation eligible to vote in person , as well as by mail .
During the next few weeks , at least 34 states and the District of Columbia will allow early in - person voting for Nov. 4 elections .
Experts such as Paul Gronke of the Early Voting Information Center predict nearly a third of the electorate will vote early this year , up from 15 % in 2000 and 20 % in 2004 .
In closely contested Colorado , Nevada and New Mexico , about half the voters are expected to cast ballots before Election Day .
Florida could be 40 % .
" It 's a sea change , " says Rosemary Rodriguez , head of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission .
" This is a little bit astounding . "
It 's all part of the most extensive early voting process in history .
The campaigns of Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are already focused on getting voters to the polls , even as their general election contest is taking shape — and before any of the debates .
What used to be a 72 - hour get - out - the - vote effort has become " a 720 - hour program , " says Rich Beeson , the Republican National Committee 's political director .
Each side says it 's ready .
" We go through massive efforts to make sure our supporters know all the ways that they can vote , " says Jon Carson , Obama 's national field director .
The boom in early voting is fed by election officials ' desire to expand turnout without overwhelming polls .
" The operative word is options , " says Pedro Cortés , president of the National Association of Secretaries of State .
In Georgia , where voting begins today , Secretary of State Karen Handel has urged voters to cast ballots early and expects about 1 million to do so — 25 % of the electorate .
" We do n't want voters to have to wait in line on Election Day , " she says .
A couple of counties in Virginia and Kentucky allowed voting late last week .
On Friday , 244 people voted in Fairfax County , Va .
A day earlier , 96 people kicked off the process in Louisville , despite widespread power outages caused by Hurricane Ike .
Both states only allow absentee votes by people unable to get to the polls on Election Day .
Thirty - one states are more liberal , allowing anyone to vote early .

This Spanish - language television advertisement for Senator Barack Obama is intended for Latino voters in battleground and other states .
Called “ Two Faces , ” it is 30 seconds long .
PRODUCER Obama media team
THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama speaks first , in accented Spanish , saying he approves the message .
Then an indignant male voice says : “ They want us to forget the insults we ’ve had to endure .
Intolerance .
They ’ve made us feel marginalized in this country that we love so much .
John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces .
One tells lies to get our votes .
The other , even worse , follows the failed policies of George Bush , putting the interests of powerful groups ahead of working families .
John McCain : more of the same Republican deceit . ”
THE SCREEN After Mr. Obama ’s introduction , the screen splits in two .
At the top is a Hispanic mother and her young child ; at the bottom is a picture of Rush Limbaugh and the phrase “ stupid , unskilled Mexicans . ”
The image of a middle - aged Hispanic woman in front of a store follows , with another phrase attributed to Mr. Limbaugh : “ Shut your mouth or get out ! ”
At the first mention of “ two faces , ” the images of Mr. McCain and President Bush appear .
A newspaper headline reads “ they made immigration reform fail , ” attributing the phrase to a McCain campaign advertisement .
As an image of an oil rig on the left gives way to a gasoline pump and then the accusation of deceit , Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush are shown together again on the right .
ACCURACY
This advertisement is misleading .
Mr. McCain ’s history on the immigration issue , though complicated , is misrepresented here , as is his relationship with the nativist wing of his party and Mr. Limbaugh .
With Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Mr. McCain sponsored overhaul legislation in 2006 .
He later backed away from his own bill for reasons still being debated , and though he now says the borders must be secured first , he has not repudiated his support for the principle .
( He has tried in his own advertisements to shift the blame for the bill ’s failure to Mr. Obama . )
On the campaign trail , Mr. McCain has also repeatedly praised the Hispanic contribution to American life .
Not one of the anti-Hispanic slights in the advertisement came from Mr. McCain ’s mouth .
And while Mr. McCain has mentioned the failure of the effort to overhaul immigration in one of his own Spanish - language advertisements , he has not celebrated it .
If Sarah Palin is so awful , why did McCain pick her ?
McCain camp trying to scapegoat Palin
John McCain 's campaign is looking for a scapegoat .
It is looking for someone to blame if McCain loses on Tuesday .
And it has decided on Sarah Palin .

In recent days , a McCain “ adviser ” told Dana Bash of CNN : “ She is a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone . ”
Imagine not taking advice from the geniuses at the McCain campaign .
What could Palin be thinking ?
Also , a “ top McCain adviser ” told Mike Allen of Politico that Palin is “ a whack job . ”
Maybe she is .
But who chose to put this “ whack job ” on the ticket ?
Was n’t it John McCain ?
And was n’t it his first presidential - level decision ?
And if you are a 72 - year - old presidential candidate , would n’t you expect that your running mate ’s fitness for high office would come under a little extra scrutiny ?
And , therefore , would n’t you make your selection with care ?
( To say nothing about caring about the future of the nation ? )
McCain did n’t seem to care that much .
McCain admitted recently on national TV that he “ did n’t know her well at all ” before he chose Palin .
But why not ?
Why did n’t he get to know her better before he made his choice ?
It ’s not like he was rushed .
McCain wrapped up the Republican nomination in early March .
He did n’t announce his choice for a running mate until late August .
Was n’t that enough time for McCain to get to know Palin ?
Was n’t that enough time for his crackerjack “ vetters ” to investigate Palin ’s strengths and weaknesses , check through records and published accounts , talk to a few people , and learn that she was not only a diva but a whack job diva ?
But McCain picked her anyway .
He wanted to close the “ enthusiasm gap ” between himself and Barack Obama .
He wanted to inject a little adrenaline into the Republican National Convention .
He wanted to goose up the Republican base .
And so he chose Palin .
Is she really a diva and a whack job ?
Could be .
There are quite a few in politics .
( And a few in journalism , too , though in journalism they are called “ columnists . ” )
As proof that she is , McCain aides now say Palin is “ going rogue ” and straying from their script .
Wow .
What a condemnation .
McCain sticks to the script .
How well is he doing ?
In truth , Palin ’s real problem is not her personality or whether she takes orders well .
Her real problem is that neither she nor McCain can make a credible case that Palin is ready to assume the presidency should she need to .
And that undercuts McCain ’s entire campaign .
This was the deal McCain made with the devil .
In exchange for energizing his base by picking Palin , he surrendered his chief selling point : that he was better prepared to run the nation in time of crisis , whether it be economic , an attack by terrorists or , as he has been talking about in recent days , fending off a nuclear war .
“ The next president wo n’t have time to get used to the office , ” McCain told a crowd in Miami on Wednesday .
“ I ’ve been tested , my friends , I ’ve been tested . ”
But has Sarah Palin ?
I do n’t believe running mates win or lose elections , though some believe they can be a drag on the ticket .
Lee Atwater , who was George H.W. Bush ’s campaign manager in 1988 , told me that Dan Quayle cost the ticket 2 to 3 percentage points .
But Bush won the election by 7.8 percentage points .
So , in Atwater ’s opinion , Bush survived his bad choice by winning the election on his own .
McCain could do the same thing .
But his campaign ’s bad decisions have not stopped with Sarah Palin .
It has made a series of questionable calls , including making Joe the Plumber the embodiment of the campaign .
Are voters really expected to warmly embrace an ( unlicensed ) plumber who owes back taxes and complains about the possibility of making a quarter million dollars a year ?
And did McCain ’s aides really believe so little in John McCain ’s own likability that they thought Joe the Plumber would be more likable ?
Apparently so .
Which is sad .
We in the press make too much of running mates and staff and talking points and all the rest of the hubbub that accompanies a campaign .
In the end , it comes down to two candidates slugging it out .
Either McCain pulls off a victory in the last round or he does n’t .
And if he does n’t , he has nobody to blame but himself .

Aftermath of the Baluchistan earthquake
Agencies
At least 170 people have been killed after a powerful earthquake hit south - west Pakistan , leaving thousands homeless .
The death toll is expected to rise .
The aid agency Care International put the death toll at 500 -600 .
Several villages were reduced to rubble .
Local television pictures showed lines of bodies in white shrouds with victims ' names written on them .
The earthquake struck in the early hours of the morning about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north - east of the provincial capital Quetta .
There were aftershocks throughout the day including a powerful tremor at about 5.30 pm local time .
" We went to a village , Wam , where we saw mass graves being dug , " said Hasan Mazumdar , Care International 's country director in Pakistan .
" Bodies were still arriving .
I estimate that 200 died in that village alone .
" There was a big jolt while we were standing there .
The mountains shook .
Boulders came crashing down .
The people were really scared .
They never experienced anything like this .
I spoke to a man in his early 30s who had lost four daughters .
He was just completely heartbroken . "
The earthquake of 2005 in northern Pakistan claimed about 73,000 lives .
Quetta , the provincial capital of Baluchistan , was flattened in 1935 by an earthquake that killed 30,000 .
The Pakistan meteorological department put the magnitude of today 's quake at 6.5 .
The official death toll is around 170 but reports are still coming in from remote areas .
The army has been sent in , bringing tents and blankets flown , but thousands are spending tonight in the open because their homes were destroyed or they are too frightened to go back indoors .
Sub - zero temperatures are expected .
Khalil Gill , a worker with Oxfam who was in Quetta , said : " It was very cold this morning , we just ran out , no shoes , no jackets .
There was a shock around 8 am .
This evening was the strongest , the whole town was shaking .
Everything shook for about two minutes .
We rushed outside .
Women and children were crying .
We are too frightened to go back into any buildings .
We are all spending the night outside . "
The former British hilltop resort of Ziarat and around eight surrounding villages were the worst hit .
Hundreds of mud and timber houses destroyed , including some buried in landslides triggered by the quake .
" There is great destruction , " said Ziarat 's mayor , Dilawar Kakar .
" Not a single house is intact . "
Ziarat is a rural part of an impoverished province .
The majority of houses are made of mud , so have little resistance to earth tremors .
It is estimated 30,000 people have been affected by the earthquake , with around 15,000 made homeless .
Army helicopters flew in relief supplies but there was limited distribution of aid today , leaving shortages of food , water , blankets and tents .
Baluchistan is Pakistan 's largest province geographically but is thinly populated .
Pakistani officials said they could manage the situation and did not need international assistance so far .
Western Digital ( WD ) and Fujitsu will likely have 1TB 2.5 - inch disk drives available by early 2010 according to industry sources .
WD has just announced that it has started volume shipping its 500 GB 2.5 - inch Scorpio Blue drive , a notebook drive with 250 GB per platter and a 5,400 rpm spin speed .
Seagate expects to ship its half terabyte 2.5 - incher before the end of the year .
Our sources say WD and Fujitsu will have 750 GB 2.5 - inch drives by mid-2009 and 1 terabyte units by early 2010 , if not the end of 2009 .
WD is building quite a track record of pipping Seagate by introducing notebook drives at progressively higher capacity points first , doing this with 250GB , 320GB and now 500 GB models .
This may not continue as Seagate has been catching up and will strive to match and exceed WD .
Seagate may well have its 750GB and 1TB notebook drives available before WD . ®
On last night 's Exiled , the absolutely worst Super Sweet 16 brat thus far , Chelsi , was shipped off to the most punishing locale weather wise thus far .
It 's one thing to shovel elephant dung and carry jugs of water in warm climates like those in Thailand and Africa .
It 's totally different to be in danger of getting frostbite while freezing your ass off in the frozen tundra of the Arctic Circle .
Chelsi , an 18 - year - old girl who does n't do her own laundry , her own hair , or know how to pack her own suitcase , was sent to live in a teepee and herd reindeer with a Norwegian family .
And while she certainly bitched and moaned a bunch once she was in the cold , some of her more ridiculous behavior happened before she even left home .

You 're more likely than ever to buy a smartphone , not just because they do so much more than dumb feature phones , with real email , decent web browsing and downloadable applications , but because they 're cheaper than ever .
With the exception of some expensive ass unlocked - but - unsubsidized European models , you generally do n't have to pay more than $ 300 for a balls - to - the - wall smartphone — though the voice plan plus data fees can easily run you $ 80 or more per month .
Here 's a rudimentary overview of your choices ( more now than ever before ) , why you might pick them , and why they might suck for you .

ANDROID by Google
The splashy new entrant into smartphone land , Android is Google 's Linux - based open source mobile platform meant to bring real , constantly connected internet to phones .
Even though it 's debuting on a single phone , the G1 from HTC , expect to see the free OS show up on tons of phones , from HTC , Motorola , and others .
It 's totally modern and powerful , and the fact that it 's open source makes it incredibly appealing to some developers , so most signs point to awesome applications and mobile internet .

So its real strength is the power that developers hold — we 're hoping to see some of the wildest , most innovative applications hit Android first .
You 'll have tons of hardware options , from low to high end , and pretty much any input you want — touchscreen , QWERTY , whatever — once the ball gets rolling .
This is the ultimate geek phone .

BLACKBERRY by RIM
Research in Motion 's BlackBerry started out as a glorified two - way pager before evolving into what most consider the best smartphone for email .
It is also a shining validation of tightly integrated hardware / software model — they make the phones , they make the operating system .
Previously it was a phone that corporations gave to people in suits because of its BlackBerry Enterprise Server , which integrates it with a corporation 's email , plus its Exchange support and high security .
Now , though , it 's increasingly popular with real live people .
The BlackBerry Bold offers the latest version of the standard OS , while the recently announced Storm uses one modified for a touchscreen .
BlackBerry Bold Review
If you were feverishly anticipating a cellphone this year , it was one of two phones : this is the… Read more
Advertisement
Why You 'll Use It It has the best email experience around — in part thanks to their traditionally awesome keyboards , so the touchscreen Storm is something of a risk .
The OS is really to easy use , with everything neatly presented up front using rows and rows of icons .
There 's a reason it has surpassed Windows Mobile in marketshare and is the corporate drone phone of choice .
Also , RIM seems intent on juicing up its already solid dev community , so expect even more great apps in the future .
( Catching a pattern with the importance of apps ? )
Why It Sucks
It 's totally closed and proprietary .
You 've gotta buy a BlackBerry phone to get the OS .
If you 're not using the Bold , Storm or the Flip Pearl , it 's not very sexy and can easily look dated .
Also , in past models , the web browsing experience was absolute garbage .
Now just finding its stride as a consumer device , it 's not as media - centric as some others , but that is fortunately changing as well .

IPHONE OS X by Apple
Some haters still stay that the iPhone is n't really a smartphone , but for all practical intents and purposes it is .
Running a stripped down but very real version of Mac's OS X , it 's one of the most powerful and modern OSes of the bunch .
Advertisement
Why You 'll Use It It 's the most attractive and usable smartphone around , period .
It has the best mobile internet browser , largely thanks to multitouch navigation .
But its killer feature might be its ability to run third - party apps , which come from one of the most vibrant dev communities around , and are often — but not always — actually useful .
Not to mention that , as an iPod , it 's also the best music phone on the planet — at least until that mystery Zune phone appears .
Advertisement
Why It Sucks For being so powerful and modern , it can't do things even the dumbest phones do , like MMS , or copy and paste , a smartphone standard .
Also email and corporate features are n't quite up to BlackBerry standards , lacking email search among other deficiencies .
Apple tightly controls it , which might hurt development and innovation .
And the whole making a phone call thing itself still kinda blows .

WINDOWS MOBILE by Microsoft
Unlike the iPhone and OS X , the only thing Microsoft 's smartphone OS shares with actual Windows is the name .
It has its roots in Windows CE and originally went by the Pocket PC moniker before becoming Windows Mobile .
Mostly for corporate troopers , the current version number is 6.1 , and it comes in touchscreen and non-touchscreen flavors .
It recently fell behind RIM's BlackBerry in marketshare .
Advertisement
Why You 'll Use It Diehards swear by its power , even if it is n't so easy for Joe Six - Pack to pick up and run with .
It runs on handsets from a bunch of manufacturers , and unlike the BlackBerry and iPhone platforms , you can build your own device to run it .
So much of the most advanced mobile hardware you 'll lay your eyes on runs Windows Mobile , including the HTC Touch HD and Sony Xperia X1 .
It 's got a corporate soul , so it 's designed for business users , and it has specialty applications ( like in the medical field ) that some professionals need and can't get anywhere else .
Advertisement
Why It Sucks
There 's a reason premiere Windows Mobile handset makers have become increasingly adept at covering up the user interface :
It 's frankly terrible , especially when it comes to touch navigation .
It is n't a great media phone , has a god - awful native browser and does n't look so hot either .
Unfortunately the next version , WM7 , is over a year away .

PALM GARNET
Oh , whither Palm .
Without getting into the complicated story of Palm 's various fits , seizures and splits , the Palm OS goes all the way back to 1996 , when it powered Palm 's PDAs .
All but dead now , its last hurrah was on the Centro before Palm plunged ahead with Windows Mobile .
Supposedly work on its Linux - powered follow - up is well under way , but it 's been delayed multiple times .
Advertisement
Why You 'll Use It Though dated , the Palm OS makes a great starter smartphone , hence the success of the cheaper - than - dirt Centro .
The learning curve is shallow and it provides most of the smartphone features you expect , even if it does look like it 's still trapped in 1996 .
Advertisement
Why It Sucks Uh , it 's basically dead .
You probably wo n't see it on another phone post - Centro , Palm 's more pricey phones use Windows Mobile , and prospects on the upcoming Palm OS overhaul are dicey .
( They should take Android and use it as a powerful foundation for the next Palm OS , but that 's just my two cents . )

SYMBIAN by Nokia
Symbian is the world 's most popular smartphone platform , thanks to Nokia .
The most prominent variant right now is S60 .
While it does n't seem so ubiquitious in the US , abroad it 's far more common .
It powers some seriously sick hardware , like Nokia 's N series , and has a solid dev community , though the free side of that is n't as big as on other platforms .
Advertisement
Why You 'll Use It Did you miss the " world 's most popular smartphone " thing ?
Buy a Nokia multimedia phone , and you buy Symbian .
It offers a lot of the best smartphone features — strong email , web and calendar , plus a large global development community — in a package that is far more usable than Windows Mobile .
Also , it works with Macs with far less hassle than Windows Mobile .
Advertisement
Why It Sucks
It can be overly complicated , and still not as easy to use as a BlackBerry or the iPhone .
If you 're not using a really solid piece of hardware , it can be really sluggish .
Also , connecting to the web can be annoying .
And while it's on handsets from a couple of other manufacturers , for the most part , you had better love Nokia hardware .

And that 's pretty much the lay of the land , at least for now .

As John McCain and GOP operatives rattle their sabers about ACORN ’s alleged “ voter fraud ” tactics , tag - team investigators Greg Palast and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have released some truly scary findings , in the latest Rolling Stone , from their investigation into Republican efforts to steal the 2008 presidential election .
However , the news is n’t all bad : Palast and Kennedy have put together a nonpartisan site , StealBackYourVote.org , to help counter voter fraud .
I 'm sure Michelle Bachmann was hoping that her apology for seeming a little overly McCarthylike the other day would put all the controversy surrounding her remarks to rest so that she could maybe get that party funding back .
Ah , but once the spotlight comes on ...
The Uptake at Huffpo has the video and transcript of her remarks at a primary debate in Minneapolis earlier this year in which she lets the ol ' xenophobia out of the bag :
There is a movement afoot that 's occurring and part of that is whole philosophical idea of multi-cultural diversity , which on the face sounds wonderful .
Let 's appreciate and value everyone 's cultures .
But guess what ?
Not all cultures are equal .
Not all values are equal .
And one thing that we 're seeing is that in the midst of this violence that 's being encouraged by al Jazeera and by the jihadists that 's occurring , is that we are seeing that those who are coming into France -- which had a beautiful culture -- the French culture is actually diminished .
It 's going away .
And just with the population of France they are losing Western Europeans and it's being taken over by muh ... by a Muslim ethic .
Not that Muslims are bad .
But they are not assimilating .
Hmmm .
My guess is that she was staying up late reading Mark Steyn .
With attention understandably focused elsewhere , thereâs a flurry of activity up north as Alaskaâs legislature has just completed its 263 - page report on â Troopergate.â 
The legislature is going to be briefed this morning on the findings and is scheduled to vote later today on whether to release the report .
The McCain - Palin campaign is wasting no time responding .
As the Anchorage Daily News puts it , the campaign âlooked to discredit the investigator 's report without having seen it.â 
Pointing out that investigators didnât interview , among others , Palin , Palinâs lawyer said the report , â is going to be half - done at best .
And anything that 's half - done will likely be half - baked . " ( Last month , a Palin spokesman said the governor was " unlikely to cooperate " with the inquiry " as long as it remains tainted . "
Acting on advice from Palinâs administration , other witnesses had also initially resisted subpoenas for the bipartisan panel . )
Yesterday , as part of that effort , the McCain - Palin campaign also released its own report exonerating Palin .
Citing a McCain spokesman , the Associated Press says the report was âwritten by the McCain - Palin campaign staff.â 
The question at the center of the case , of course , is whether Palin pressured and ultimately fired Alaska public safety chief Walt Monegan for not dismissing a trooper , Mike Wooten , who was involved in a personal dispute with Palinâs family .
â Monegan 's dismissal was a result of his insubordination and budgetary clashes , â concluded the campaign .
" Trooper Wooten is a separate issue . "
The New York Times has done its own digging and came to a slightly different conclusion .
As todayâs Times puts it , â To a far greater degree than was previously known , the governor , her husband and her administration pressed the commissioner and his staff to get Trooper Wooten off the force , though without directly ordering it.â 
" To all of us , it was a campaign to get rid of [ Wooten ] as a trooper and , at the very least , to smear the guy and give him a desk job somewhere , " Monegan 's former assistant told the Times .
Weâll see if the legislatureâs investigation came to a similar conclusion .
Either way , weâll post the report as soon as itâs available .
Some Haredi Jews have embraced modern technology , with limits
The BBC's Erica Chernofsky looks at how Israel 's highly traditional ultra-Orthodox Jewish community is tackling the challenges and opportunities of new communications technologies .
When Israeli father Avi tried to register his six - year - old twin daughters for his local ultra-Orthodox school this year , he was happy to sign a form saying his children did not watch television or use the internet at home .
But he was surprised to discover he had to give a " kosher cellphone number " .
He did not have one .
Avi lives in Har Nof , one of the main ultra-Orthodox , or Haredi , neighbourhoods of Jerusalem .
I feel I can control myself not to use the bad features - but do I trust my children ?
Avi
The community separates itself from mainstream society through its traditional religious practices and distinctive attire of black hats , coats and sidelocks for the men and long skirts and sleeves for the women .
Like most other men in his community , Avi studies the Jewish scriptures daily , keeps the Sabbath and eats only kosher food .
But he has not yet opted for the new religious adaptation to modern technology that has swept the Haredi world in Israel .
' Immodest ' behaviour
The kosher cellphone looks like an ordinary cellphone , can make and receive calls , and may have a calculator and alarm clock .
One of the defining features of kosher mobiles is a rabbinical stamp
But it cannot send or receive text messages , browse the internet or take photos - all activities that could potentially involve behaviour considered " immodest " among Haredis .
For example , SMS capability could lead to the unwitting receipt of mass text messages publicising secular events .
It could also be used as a method of illicit communication between male and female teenagers .
And all photos of women are forbidden , as is accessing websites with content deemed inappropriate .
The phone 's other defining feature is a rabbinical stamp of approval , similar to those seen on kosher food items .
All the major Israeli cellphone companies have accommodated the powerful Haredi constituency by providing kosher phones , and cheaper - than - normal packages which connect only with other Haredi numbers .
As the companies have created distinct code prefixes to accompany the kosher phone plans , the phone numbers have quickly become a badge of religious observance .
Not only do some Haredi newspapers refuse to publish ads with non-kosher phone numbers , but parents are worried their children will be blacklisted by the shadchan , or matchmaker , if their numbers are not kosher .
Banana filtered " What do you associate with the Haredi community ?
You wear black trousers , a white shirt and some sort of hat , but today the things that define you have changed , " says Avi .
Protected surfing is calibrated differently for different Haredi groups
He says he feels there is a sense that anyone who does not have a kosher phone " should be excluded from society " .
" If you say you are associating yourself with us , please act according to our codes , otherwise do not call yourself Haredi and do not send your kids to our schools . "
But while they have managed to adapt the cellphone to their lifestyles , Haredis have had a harder time with the internet .
Last year , an Orthodox rabbi and an Israeli technology executive established an internet service provider ( ISP ) called Rimon , which claims to be the only filtering service provider in Israel that offers customised surfing packages .
The company says it cuts out pornography , violence , and gambling , and then provides the user with five levels of further filtering , from the " protected " level that blocks images of women in intimate apparel to the " hermetic " level , which allows users to view only unchanging , vetted websites such as encyclopaedias .
There are many things on the internet that are not appropriate for me as a Haredi woman , things I would prefer that my family and I did n't see or hear
Miriam " If your kid puts ' banana ' into Google , some of the first sites he 'll get are porn , " explains chairman Moshe Weiss .
" Put banana into Google on Rimon , and you get all the same sites without the porn . "
One Haredi sect , the Belz , which normally forbids online access , has partially endorsed the use of Rimon , but only for those who need the internet for business purposes .
The general rule for the local Haredi community still remains no radio , no TV , no internet and no movies - though Rimon is hoping that once it starts targeting the Haredi market that will change .
For now , its 15,000 subscribers are mostly secular and modern Orthodox .
Self control Miriam , a teacher living in Jerusalem , is one of many Haredi Jews who do not have home web access .
An Orthodox Jewish life for men is one devoted to studying the scriptures
She expresses concern over the amount of time people devote to surfing the net , wasting time they could spend learning Torah or doing good deeds .
Her main worry , however , is over the lack of control over content .
" There are many things on the internet that are not appropriate for me as a Haredi woman , things I would prefer that my family and I did n't see or hear , like violence , pornography and inappropriate sexual relations , " she says .
For Haredis , " inappropriate " means any physical contact between a man and a woman who are not married .
But Avi , who says he needs the internet for his work in the tourist industry , has unfiltered online access .
" I 'm not afraid of the negative aspects because I grew up with internet and I feel I can control myself not to use the bad features , " he says .
" But do I trust my children ? " he wonders aloud .
" When they are old enough to use it I will definitely have to re-evaluate .
I think then I might put filters on or use Rimon , or maybe then I 'll even disconnect internet from the house altogether .
It 's just not worth the risk . "

The Chrysler Warren Truck Assembly plant is seen in Warren , Michigan October 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - U.S. automakers Chrysler LLC and General Motors Corp are pushing for a quick merger deal ahead of the U.S. presidential election as sales continue to plummet and they cannot gain access to credit , a Detroit newspaper reported on Saturday .
According to The Detroit News , senior executives at GM and private equity group Cerberus Capital Management -- which bought an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler from Daimler AG for $ 7.2 billion in August 2007 -- are keen to wrap up talks before both automakers are weakened further by a sluggish U.S. economy .
Both companies have been losing money .
Analysts have estimated that GM is burning through at least $ 1 billion per month .
The credit crunch and the economy have made major banks reluctant to lend to the industry .
A Chrysler spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the newspaper report .
GM officials did not respond to a request for comment .
Both parties are racing to conclude a deal before the election , which is 17 days away on November 4 .
There has been speculation within the industry and among analysts that if Detroit ’s automakers face failure , they may seek a bailout from the U.S. government along the lines of the recent $ 700 billion package for the financial sector .
It is unclear whether the government would support such a rescue package , but both presidential candidates -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona -- may be more likely to promise help for the industry before Americans head to the polls .
The U.S. auto industry accounts for thousands of jobs in Michigan and Ohio , and the latter remains a key battleground state in the upcoming election .
The newspaper report said under one possible scenario , GM would absorb Chrysler to get hold of its cash stockpile -- $ 11.7 billion on June 30 -- then shut down some of its brands and car dealerships in order to cut costs dramatically .
Google 's rival to the iPhone and Blackberry phones goes on sale in the UK today .
The G1 - the subject of the latest high - profile launch last month - is designed around improving the speed and quality of using the internet on mobile handsets .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It will go head to head with Apple 's iPhone , the Blackberry and other smartphones from makers including Nokia when it is released exclusively by T - Mobile today , and will be available for free on price plans from £ 40 a month .
The gadget uses Google 's Android software and is being touted as a phone with the capability of a hand - held computer .
It provides access to Android Market , which lets third party companies offer applications to users .
Other manufacturers are expected to produce their own Android - powered phones over the next 12 months .
The phone makes use of Google Maps , instant messaging through Google Talk as well as high - speed internet browsing and a 3 - megapixel camera .
Analysts have said the gadget could potentially transform the mobile telephone market by providing service supported by advertising instead of subscription fees .
Queueing to be the first to purchase the new phone in the UK began at 5 AM at T - Mobile 's Oxford Street store in central London .
Andy Burgess , a software programmer from Farringdon , London , was the first to emerge from with a T - Mobile G1 .
“ Being the first person in the UK to own this mobile phone is amazing " , he said .
" I ’m going to be popular at work !
I ’ve been waiting for this phone for months and I knew I had to be the first to own it . ”
The phone will be in direct competition with Apple 's iPhone in the run-up to the lucrative Christmas period .
Ernest Doku , from mobile phone comparison website Omio.com , said : " Despite the popularity of the Google brand , the G1's design lacks the inherent ' cool ' factor that made the iPhone 3G such a mass market success for Apple .
" The launch of the G1 is important not only because it 's Google 's first foray into the mobile market but because it's also the launch of an entirely new mobile phone operating system .
" Android is the equivalent of releasing an alternative to Microsoft 's Windows - and equally as risky . "
T- Mobile UK managing director Jim Hyde said : " It 's set to revolutionise the way we use the internet on our mobiles .
" It 's uniquely built for effortless online communication whether you want to email , text or blog , and with access to some groundbreaking applications on Android Market , the possibilities really are endless . "
Chances are , tonight 's 30 - minute Barack Obama infomercial will have minimal effect on the final outcome of the 2008 presidential election .
Those leaning against the freshman Illinois senator were unlikely to be swayed by it ( or even watch it ) .
The ranks of the truly undecided , meanwhile , have shrunk in most polls .
And how many of those bothered to tune in to the first program - length ad by a presidential candidate since Ross Perot flipped budget charts in 1992 ?
That said , the Democrat and his message makers certainly gave it their best shot to appeal to those open to conversion but lacking a comfort level with the prospect of a President Obama .
( A complete text of the infomercial 's script and the full 27 - minute video is available by clicking here . )
Wondering about his patriotism and his commitment to defending the nation ?
The extended commercial opened with an image of amber waves of grain .
And , as its recorded portion neared an end , retired Army Brig .
Gen. John Adams testified to the " courage and the judgment " he believes Obama would bring to the job of commander in chief .
The ad ended with a perfectly timed cut to Obama appearing live before an audience in Florida for a final few sound bites .
" America , the time for change has come , " he declared , sounding a theme that has driven his candidacy from its start in early 2007 .
And in urging voters to " choose hope over fear , unity over division , " he summarized what , for many of his supporters , has been his most powerful appeal .
In between , the expertly photographed , poignantly told stories of " average " Americans that gave the ad its pace and served to set up Obama 's domestic policy prescriptions touched key demographic bases .
The first , for instance , spotlighted a white , middle - class woman in the swing state of Missouri whose family is struggling to make ends meet .

The conventional wisdom , which I share , is that Barack Obama will win this election , perhaps by a healthy margin .
But Democrats are nervous wrecks ; they 're having nightmares that defeat will be snatched from the jaws of victory .
To add to their misery ( and guard against complacency ) , here 's how that horror film could play out :
In the end , the problem was the LIVs .
That 's short for " low - information voters " , the three - fifths of the electorate that shows up once every four years to vote for president but mostly hates politics .
These are the 75 million folks who did n't vote in the primaries .
They do n't read news magazines or newspapers , do n't watch any cable news and do n't cast their ballots early .
Their allegiance to a candidate is as easily shed as a T - shirt .
I entered the CIA 42 years ago , and I think that the world is as complex and in a real way more dangerous than at any time since then
Robert Gates , interviewed by Newsweek
Newsweek : ' That was amateur night ' Several million moved to Obama through September and October ; they 'd heard he handled himself well in the debates .
Then , in the last week , the LIVs swung back to the default choice : John McCain .
Some had good reasons other than the colour of Obama 's skin to desert him ; many more did not .
In October , a study by the Associated Press estimated that Obama 's race would cost him 6 % .
The percentage was smaller , but still enough to give the presidency to McCain .
Obama 's field organisation was superb , so it was no surprise that most of the 18 million Hillary Clinton voters came home to the Democrats ; the person - to - person voter contact ( and significant resentment about the selection of Sarah Palin ) made a big difference .
But the huge swathe of more than 30 million independents broke heavily for McCain .
By piling up overwhelming margins in big blue states like California , New York and Illinois , Obama carried the popular vote , but he ended up like Al Gore in 2000 - denied admission to the Electoral College .
Swinging states
The first ominous sign was largely missed amid the Democratic euphoria after Obama outclassed McCain on the financial crisis .
While most of the country moved toward the Democratic nominee in early October , Ohio did not .
Obama could never close the sale there .
In a repeat of the Democratic primary , his big totals coming out of Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) were n't enough to offset larger - than - expected losses in the suburbs around Cincinnati and Columbus .

Who will win the electoral college ?
Florida had looked promising for Obama for a time , but his weakness among seniors caught up with him .
One national poll from early October should have been a warning : it showed him up by 7 % overall , but down 14 % among those older than 65 .
And Sarah Silverman's " Great Schlep " fell short .
Obama easily carried the Jewish vote , but not with the 75 % won by Gore and John Kerry .
As it turned out , the real problem was n't south Florida , where Hispanics came in surprisingly well for Obama .
It was erosion in the critical I - 4 corridor near Tampa and in the Panhandle , where the astonishing Republican margins among whites could be attributed only to race .
Obama shifted New Mexico , Iowa and Nevada from red to blue .
But there was a reason Virginia had n't gone Democratic since 1964 .
The transformation of the northern part of the state could n't overcome a huge McCain margin among whites farther south .
They were n't the racists of their parents ' generation , but they were n't quite ready to vote for the unthinkable , either .
As McCain closed the gap in the last week with his message on taxes and fear of another terrorist attack , the race came down to New Hampshire ( which went for Kerry in 2004 ) and Colorado ( which went for President Bush ) .
Obama needed one of them to get to 270 electoral votes .
New Hampshire 's fabled independents had long had a soft spot for McCain in GOP primaries , and they delivered for him again .
Colorado , after flirting with Obama , simply reverted to form , with Palin 's frontier image helping a bit .
Robo - call alienation Obama had wired every college campus in the country , and he enjoyed great enthusiasm among politically engaged young people .
But less - engaged students told reporters the day after the election that they had meant to vote for Obama but were " too busy " .
History held : young people once again voted in lower percentages than their elders .
Waiting for them turned out to be like waiting for Godot .
John McCain will make a fine president , but Republicans are subdued ...
The Obama margin among young voters was underestimated a little in some polls because so many 18 - to 24 - year - olds use only cell phones .
But the deeper failure of the polling came from methodology that could not properly account for the nine in 10 voters who wo n't answer a polltaker 's questions .
With ceaseless robo-calls and as many as 15 live calls from campaigns to each household in a swing state , even fewer people than normal took time in the last two weeks to respond .
Who were the voters slamming down the phone ?
Disproportionately for McCain .
In rebuffing pollsters , they skewed the sample toward Obama , inflating his " support " .
At the start of the campaign season NEWSWEEK asked , " Is America Ready " for a black president ?
The answer : only if Obama proved close to a flawless candidate , and even then , we wo n't know for sure until Election Day .
That does n't mean Obama lost because all , or even most , McCain voters allowed race to be a factor .
But enough did to change the outcome .
Democrats are despairing over the results , fearing they might never view their country in the same light again .
Even many Republicans are subdued at the news of McCain 's victory .
Having expected him to lose , they know the GOP has now completed a sorry transition from the party of Lincoln to the party of cynicism .
McCain , they 're reasoning , might prove a fine president , but it should n't have happened like this ... ...
It probably wo n't .
Millions of people in the rest of the world assume that Barack Obama cannot be elected because he is black .
They assume that the original sin of American history - enshrined in our Constitution - cannot be transcended .
I go into next week 's election with a different assumption - that the common sense and decency of the American people will prove the sceptics wrong .

n the first hours of dawn , Nader Elayan was woken by a call from a neighbor warning him to hurry to the house he had almost finished building .
By the time he arrived , it was too late : a bulldozer was tearing down the walls .
More than 100 Israeli security guards held back local residents .
The demolition , carried out four years ago , has left Mr Elayan , his wife , Fidaa , who is now pregnant , and their two young children with nowhere to live but a single room in his brother ’s cramped home .
It is the only land he owns and he had invested all his savings in building the now destroyed house .
Over the past few years , the Elayans ’ fate has been shared by two dozen other families in the Palestinian village of Anata , on the outskirts of East Jerusalem .
Hundreds more families have demolition orders hanging over their homes .
" Not one person in my neighborhood has a [ building ] permit , " Mr Elayan , 37 , said .
The problem of house demolitions affects Palestinians throughout the occupied territories .
But according to Hatem Abdelkader , an adviser to Salam Fayyad , the Palestinian prime minister , the situation is particularly acute in the East Jerusalem area .
He noted that Israel ’s policy of refusing building permits to many of the 250,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem has resulted in the classification of 20,000 city homes as illegal since the occupation began in 1967 .
Last year alone , the Jerusalem municipality issued more than 1,000 demolition orders for " illegal dwellings . "
It is believed that three out of every four Palestinian homes in the city are now built without a permit .
" Illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying Palestinian families ’ homes and lives , " said Jeff Halper , head of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions ( ICAHD ) .
" The demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of Palestinian communities in and around Jerusalem , freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by Israeli settlers , " Mr Halper said .
" The demolitions increase the pressure on Palestinians to move into the West Bank , so that they will lose their residency rights in the city . "
In an act of defiance , Mr Halper ’s organization and 40 international volunteers helped the Elayans to rebuild their home this week in an attempt to highlight what the committee calls the " quiet ethnic cleansing " of East Jerusalem .
The work was carried out during a two - week summer camp funded by the Spanish government .
Madrid also paid for 18 Spanish volunteers to participate .
" This is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an ‘ illegal ’ Palestinian home demolished by the Israeli authorities , " Mr Halper said .
The issue of house demolitions is back in the spotlight now after two separate incidents in July in which Palestinians , both of whom were residents of Jerusalem , rampaged through the city in bulldozers , killing three Israelis and injuring many more .
Although the two Palestinians were shot dead at the scene , Israeli officials , including Ehud Barak , the defense minister , are calling for their homes to be destroyed , making their families homeless , to deter others from following in their path .
Such punitive destruction of homes was stopped in 2005 , under the threat of legal challenge , but not before some 270 homes were razed on security grounds in the first years of the intifada .
According to Mr Halper , however , the use of demolitions against Palestinians accused of illegal building is a far more significant problem .
" We estimate that there have been at least 18,000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation . "
In fact , Mr Halper said , he believes the true number of demolitions is likely to be double the official figure .
Many razings are unrecorded , carried out by Palestinians themselves fearing a heavy fine if the Israeli army enforces the demolition order .
" Most demolitions are of multistory buildings that are home to several families , meaning that well in excess of 100,000 Palestinians may have been made homeless by Israeli administrative policies , " he said .
Since its founding a decade ago , the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions has rebuilt 150 Palestinian homes as part of its campaign to bring the issue of demolitions to the attention of Israeli Jews and the international community .
It has been an uphill struggle , Mr Halper said .
The European Union , which recently upgraded its relations with Israel , announced this month that it was withdrawing ICAHD ’s funding .
But this year ’s work camp may make the continuing demolition of homes in Anata a little harder , Mr Halper said .
" It ’s one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a Palestinian , but another to destroy one built with money provided by the Spanish government . "
Mr Halper also believes that , by exposing such groups as the summer camp volunteers to the Palestinians ’ plight , public perceptions may begin to change .
Alonso Santos , a 21 - year - old architecture student from Madrid , said he learnt much from seeing at close hand Palestinian life under occupation .
" It was an eye - opener to realize that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the Israelis , but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended .
The planning rules here are designed not to improve the Palestinians ’ lives but to make them more miserable . "
The volunteers were hosted at a peace center in Anata erected on the site of Salim Shawamreh ’s home , which was demolished four times by Israeli authorities .
Known as Arabiya House , after Mr Shawamreh ’s wife , the building is decorated on one side with a mural depicting the death of Rachel Corrie , a US peace activist , by an Israeli bulldozer that had been demolishing homes in Gaza .
" Imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home , their whole world , has disappeared while they were gone , " Mr Shawamreh said .
" It ’s happened to my children four times .
It ’s cruelty beyond words . "
Mr Shawamreh , whose family were refugees from the northern Negev in 1948 , said he and ICAHD established the peace center to highlight the plight of the Palestinians in Anata .
Today the house is overlooked by an Israeli police station across the valley , part of the advance growth of a large Jewish settlement , Maale Adumim , that Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups believe is cutting the West Bank in two .
The peace center is also close both to the snaking route of Israel ’s separation wall and to a new bypass road  part of what critics call an apartheid road system  being built to ensure that Jewish settlers can drive separately from Palestinians across the West Bank .
Arabiya
House is under a temporary reprieve from demolition while Israeli courts determine its status .
Mr Halper said the judges have been reluctant to confirm the destruction order because his group has threatened to take the case to the International Court of Justice if the ruling goes against it .

What in the world could cause an entire city to be abandoned ?
Some become unlivable due to environmental disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis to nuclear meltdowns ( as with Pripyat , shown below ) .
Others become the center of military activity and remain contested and uninhabited as a result – or are simply left as memorials to the terrible events that took place in them .
Still others are simply deserted when they outlive their usefulness as trade outposts or mining towns .
This Halloween , forget the plastic cape and cheesy costume .
Why not find and explore the real relics and strange structures of an actual ghost town or abandoned city instead ?

In the final weeks of the 2008 presidential campaign , Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin have accused Senator Barack Obama of being a socialist bent on taking money from hard - working folks to finance hand - outs to others .
At the last presidential debate , McCain declared , “ the whole premise behind Senator Obama ’s plans are class warfare — let ’s spread the wealth around . ”
This line of attack has been the centerpiece of McCain ’s closing blast against Obama : because Obama wants to tax the well - to - do to pay for middle - class tax relief , he ’s an untrustworthy , divisive , redistributionist who cares more about controlling wealth than creating it .
He ’s an enemy of the American dream .
But eight years ago , in January and February 2000 , McCain was on the receiving end of similar criticism , as conservatives and Republicans accused him of engaging in class warfare by opposing tax breaks for the rich while advocating tax cuts for middle - and low - income Americans .
That is , McCain was denounced in much the same way as he is now denouncing Obama .
Back then , McCain was locked in a fierce fight with George W. Bush for the GOP presidential nomination .
Bush had proposed a massive tax - cuts package .
At the time , McCain said , “ Sixty percent of the benefits from [ Bush ’s ] tax cuts go to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans–and that ’s not the kind of tax relief that Americans need … .
I do n’t believe the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans should get 60 percent of the tax breaks .
I think the lowest 10 percent should get the breaks ….
I ’m not giving tax cuts for the rich . ”
On Meet the Press , he maintained , “ There ’s a growing gap between rich and poor in America … .
I think that the people who need [ tax cuts ] most and need the relief most are working middle - income Americans . ”
At a campaign rally in February 2000 , he declared , “ I do n’t think Bill Gates needs a tax cut .
I think your parents do . ”
The New York Times described McCain ’s tax plan as “ apportioning the spoils of the nation ’s current prosperity . ”
For taking this stance , McCain was walloped by Republicans .
* On Hardball , former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said , “ John McCain is waging class warfare , and he should stop it . ”
* On Meet the Press , Representative David Dreier , a California Republican supporting Bush , said of McCain ’s stance , “ The idea of engaging in class warfare is not a pro-California thing . ”
* On CNN ’s Crossfire , co-host Mary Matalin huffed , “ John McCain has been running on …class warfare . ”
* Texas Republican party head Susan Weddington excoriated McCain for engaging in a “ shameless kind of class warfare . ”
* The conservative Washington Times newspaper editorialized , “ McCain has aggressively adopted the class - warfare tactics and rhetoric that Democrats have relentlessly used since 1980 to pillory tax - cuts plans of the sort proposed by President Reagan and Gov. Bush . ”
* In a letter sent to hundreds of former Reagan administration officials , James Miller III and Lou Cordia , who both served in Ronald Reagan ’s White House , argued that the Reagan mantle belonged to Bush partly because “ McCain is using the class warfare rhetoric of the Democrats . ”
* On Fox News , host Sean Hannity exclaimed , “ John McCain has adopted the language of Clinton and Gore as it relates to class warfare . ”
At a Republican presidential debate , McCain tried to fend off this criticism .
“ I ’m deeply concerned about a kind of class warfare that ’s going on right now , ” he said .
“ It ’s unfortunate .
There ’s a growing gap between the haves and have - nots in America … .
And it ’s unfortunately divided up along ethnic lines . ”
But the class warfare accusations hurled against McCain were part of a blistering anti-McCain crusade ( waged by pro-Bush conservatives and Republicans ) that worked .
And after Bush won the election , McCain continued to oppose Bush ’s tax - cuts package , noting on the Senate floor that it granted “ generous tax relief to the wealthiest individuals of our country at the expense of lower - and middle - income American taxpayers . ”
Before voting against the Bush tax cuts in May 2001 , McCain declared , “ I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us , at the expense of middle - class Americans who most need tax relief . ”
That was then .
These days , McCain has adopted the tactics of his onetime enemies .
Obama decries McCain ’s proposed tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations , while advocating a tax hike for the wealthiest to finance tax relief for middle - and low - income Americans — and McCain slams him for engaging in class warfare .
If the polls are any indicator , this strategy is not working for McCain as well as it did for Bush in 2000 .
But by throwing the class - warfare mud this time , McCain has not only engaged in a fundamental policy flip - flop ; he has demonstrated that he ’s become the sort of politician he once condemned .
In an age that celebrated industrial heroes , Ford was a true giant .
In 1922 , he considered running for the presidency and polls reflected his widespread support .
Despite his public aspirations , historian Keith Sward described Ford as “ inaccessible as the Grand Lama ” and an anti-democrat .
One of the few individuals Ford trusted was his personal secretary , Ernest Liebold , whom historian Leo Ribuffo calls “ an ambitious martinet ” who took advantage of Fords dislike of paperwork and refusal to read his mail to control access to the great man .
Ford would later blame Liebold for his Jewish woes .
Henry Ford , the industrial genius who perfected the mass production of motorcars before World War I and thereby revolutionized the way we live , was a reclusive man who brooked no opposition or criticism .
Fords attempt to prevent unionism at his plants produced strikes and violence , mostly provoked by Fords own strikebreakers .
He opposed various symbols of social and cultural change around him , including Hollywood movies , out - of - home childcare , government regulation of business , Eastern European immigration and new styles in dress and music .
His anti-Semitism reduced him in 1927 , for one of the few times in his life , to the position of acknowledging error and asking publicly for forgiveness .
Ford wanted to assert that there was a Jewish conspiracy to control the world .
He blamed Jewish financiers for fomenting World War I so that they could profit from supplying both sides .
He accused Jewish automobile dealers of conspiring to undermine Ford Company sales policies .
Ford wanted to make his bizarre beliefs public in the pages of the Dearborn Independent .
For a year , editor Pipp resisted running anti-Jewish articles , and resigned rather than publish them .
Cameron took over the editorship and , in May 1920 , printed the first of a series of articles titled “ The International Jew : The Worlds Problem . ”
In the period from 1910 to 1918 , Ford became increasingly anti-immigrant , anti-labor , anti-liquor and anti-Semitic .
In 1919 , he purchased a newspaper , the Dearborn Independent .
He installed Charles Pipp as editor and hired a journalist , William J. Cameron , to listen to his ideas and write a weekly column , “ Mr. Fords Page , ” to expound his views .
In 1924 , David Meckler published an exposé of Ford in Yiddish called The Truth About Henry Ford , which included on its cover a hooded Ku Klux Klansman with his arm casually and familiarly draped over Henry Ford 's shoulder , suggesting a friendly relationship between two men sharing common anti-Semitic , nativist , and racist beliefs .

Library of Congress Hebraic Section
For the next 18 months , Cameron ran the “ International Jew ” as a series , and later collected the articles and published them as a book .
Fords aide Liebold hired former military intelligence investigators to assist Cameron in gathering so - called “ evidence ” that “ proved ” Jewish control of world finance ; Jewish organization of radical political movements ; and Jewish manipulation of diplomacy to cause wars in which Christians died to enrich Jews .
The investigators dredged up rumors that president Woodrow Wilson took secret orders over the phone from Justice Brandeis and that a Jewish member of the Federal Reserve Board personally thwarted Fords plan to purchase nitrate mines from the Federal government .
A few months after the series began , Fords operatives introduced him to a Russian émigré , Paquita de Shishmareff .
She showed Ford a copy of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , now well - known as a malicious forgery created by the Russian czars secret service at the turn of the century that purportedly recorded a series of lectures by a Jewish elder outlining a conspiracy to overthrow European governments .
Ford passed the Protocols to Cameron , and the Independent turned its attention to bringing this “ blueprint ” for world domination to the public .
The Independent charged that the national debt was Jewish - inspired to enslave Americans , and that German Jewish financier Paul Warburg had emigrated to America “ for the express purpose of changing our financial system ” by creating the Federal Reserve .
The paper labeled Jews an “ international nation ” with had an unfair advantage in business over Christians , who relied on individualism to get ahead .
The paper even described American Jewish aid for oppressed Jews overseas as part of the conspiracy .
For seven years , the Independent continued to run anti-Semitic articles until the target of one series , California farm cooperative organizer Aaron Sapiro , sued Ford for libel .
Sapiro was the third Jew to sue Ford for libel , and the first to get to trial .
Ford refused to testify , and apparently staged an automobile accident so he could hide in a hospital .
The judge finally declared a mistrial , but Ford decided to settle out of court .
Jewish leaders had called for a boycott of Ford motorcars , and his fear of slumping sales might have played a role in Fords decision to put the Sapiro case behind him .
Louis Marshall , chairman of the American Jewish Committee , negotiated an agreement whereby Ford publicly announced that “ articles reflecting on the Jews ” would never again appear in the Independent .
Ford claimed that he was “ mortified ” to learn the Protocols were forged , described himself as “ fully aware of the virtues of the Jewish people ” and offered them his “ future friendship and good will . ”
He claimed to have been too busy to read the pieces and implicitly blamed Liebold and Cameron for printing them .
Marshall described Fords statement as “ humiliating . ”
Ford closed the Independent in December 1927 .
He later claimed that his signature on the agreement with Marshall was forged .
He also claimed that Jewish bankers had caused World War II .
Ford died in 1947 , apparently unrepentant .

“ Joe the Plumber ” has been found after the debate last night , and he ’s not making things look any better for Barack Obama or John McCain .
The plumber the candidates were talking about in last night ’s debate turns out to be a man by the name of Joe Wurzelbacher .
At an Obama event in Ohio , Wurzelbacher told Obama that he ’s planning on buying a business that earns over $ 250,000 a year .
He then asked Obama , “ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more , is n’t it ? ”
Years before that question sparked much of the final presidential debate of 2008 , a relative of Wurzelbacher ’s was involved in a scandal with McCain .
The Gawker article says , “ Keating ’s son - in - law , Robert Wurzelbacher ( not a very common last name ) served a 40 - month prison sentence in 1993 in connection with Keating ’s Lincoln Savings and Loan collapse . ”
According to the article , McCain was investigated in the matter , but was let off with a slap on the wrist .
It ’s hard to believe that Joe the Plumber just happened to be connected to the Keating scandal , and Joe ’s already become somewhat of a talking head for republicans .
It ’s starting to look like this thing was - to some extent - set up by someone .
Wurzelbacher is n’t a very common last name .
There is a collection of articles and fast facts about the situation here .
This article is really , really long … and really , really important .
If you want to get a clear view from outside America on what the current Wall Street collapse means for the rest of the world – and what Bush ’s catastrophic presidency has done to our standing in the eyes of the rest of the world — then you really need to read this .
Have n’t read anything as good anywhere else yet .

The banking crisis is upending American dominance of the financial markets and world politics .
The industrialized countries are sliding into recession , the era of turbo - capitalism is coming to an end and US military might is ebbing .
Still , this is no time to gloat .
There are days when all it takes is a single speech to illustrate the decline of a world power .
A face can speak volumes , as can the speaker ’s tone of voice , the speech itself or the audience ’s reaction .
Kings and queens have clung to the past before and humiliated themselves in public , but this time it was merely a United States president .
Or what is left of him .
George W. Bush has grown old , erratic and rosy in the eight years of his presidency .
Little remains of his combativeness or his enthusiasm for physical fitness .
On this sunny Tuesday morning in New York , even his hair seemed messy and unkempt , his blue suit a little baggy around the shoulders , as Bush stepped onto the stage , for the eighth time , at the United Nations General Assembly .
He talked about terrorism and terrorist regimes , and about governments that allegedly support terror .
He failed to notice that the delegates sitting in front of and below him were shaking their heads , smiling and whispering , or if he did notice , he was no longer capable of reacting .
The US president gave a speech similar to the ones he gave in 2004 and 2007 , mentioning the word “ terror ” 32 times in 22 minutes .
At the 63rd General Assembly of the United Nations , George W. Bush was the only one still talking about terror and not about the topic that currently has the rest of the world ’s attention .
“ Absurd , absurd , absurd , ” said one German diplomat .
A French woman called him “ yesterday ’s man ” over coffee on the East River .
There is another way to put it , too : Bush was a laughing stock in the gray corridors of the UN .
The American president has always had enemies in these hallways and offices at the UN building on First Avenue in Manhattan .
The Iranians and Syrians despise the eternal American - Israeli coalition , while many others are tired of Bush ’s Americans telling the world about the blessings of deregulated markets and establishing rules “ that only apply to others , ” says the diplomat from Berlin .
But the ridicule was a new thing .
It marked the end of respect .
“ Well , ” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio “ Lula ” da Silva began , standing outside the General Assembly Hall .
Then he looked out the window and said : “ He decided to talk about terrorism , but the issue that has the world concerned is the economic crisis . ”
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , the president of Argentina , said that the schoolmasters from Washington had dubbed the 1994 Mexican crisis the “ tequila effect ” and Brazil ’s 1999 crisis the “ Caipirinha effect . ”
Are we now experiencing the “ whiskey effect ? ”
But President Kirchner was gracious and , with a smile , called it the “ jazz effect . ”
Is it only President George W. Bush , the lame duck president , whom the rest of the world is no longer taking seriously , or are the remaining 191 UN member states already setting their sights on the United States , the giant brought to its knees ?
UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon referred to a “ new reality ” and “ new centers of power and leadership in Asia , Latin America and across the newly developed world . ”
Are they surprised , in these new centers , at the fall of America , of the system of the Western - style market economy ?
Even America ’s closest allies are distancing themselves — first and foremost the German chancellor .
When push came to shove in the past , Angela Merkel had always come down on the side of the United States .
As a candidate for the Chancellery for the conservative Christian Democrats , she helped Bush in the Iraq war , and as chancellor she supported tougher sanctions on Iran and campaigned in Europe for an embargo against Cuba .
“ The partnership with the United States , ” the chancellor insisted again and again , “ has a very special meaning for us Germans . ”
There was no mention of loyalty and friendship last Monday .
Merkel stood in the glass - roofed entrance hall of one of the German parliament ’s office buildings in Berlin and prepared her audience of roughly 1,000 businesspeople from all across Germany for the foreseeable consequences of the financial crisis .
It was a speech filled with concealed accusations and dark warnings .
Merkel talked about a “ distribution of risk at everyone ’s expense ” and the consequences for the “ economic situation in the coming months and possibly even years . ”
Most of all , she made it clear who she considers the true culprit behind the current plight .
“ The German government pointed out the problems early on , ” said the chancellor , whose proposals to impose tighter international market controls failed repeatedly because of US opposition .
“ Some things can be done at the national level , ” she said , “ but most things have to be handled internationally . ”
Merkel had never publicly criticized the United States this harshly and unapologetically .
In this regard , she enjoys the wholehearted support of her coalition government partner , the center - left Social Democrats ( SPD ) .
In a speech before Germany ’s parliament , the Bundestag , Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück of the SPD spoke of the end of the United States as a “ superpower of the global financial system . ”
The banking crisis in the United States has shaken many things in recent days , not just the chancellor ’s affection for America and the respect the rest of the world once had for the US as an economic and political superpower .
Since the US investment bank Lehman Brothers plummeted into bankruptcy two weeks ago , the financial crisis has developed a destructive force of almost unimaginable strength .
The proud US investment banks with globally recognized names like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have all gone bankrupt , been bought up or restructured .
The American real estate market has essentially been nationalized .
And the country ’s biggest savings and loan , Washington Mutual , has failed and been sold at a loss .
In light of the almost daily reports of losses in the financial sector , it seemed almost secondary to note that the disaster had also turned into one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is already investigating 26 large financial corporations as well as 1,400 smaller companies and private citizens for possible fraud .
Economists now characterize what began two years ago with falling prices in the American real estate market as the biggest economic disaster since the world economic crisis of the 1930s .
No one knows whether and how the meltdown of global financial markets , which would have grave consequences for the world economy , can still be prevented .
And now , of all times , the world is faced with a preeminent power that no longer seems capable of leading and a US president who is not even able to unite his divided country in an hour of need .
For weeks , Bush ignored the crisis , insisting on the strength of the market and telling Americans : “ Everything will be fine . ”
In a televised address to the nation last Wednesday , Bush gave his oath of disclosure .
He warned Americans that they could face a “ long and painful recession ” and that “ millions of Americans could lose their jobs ” unless swift action is taken .
But nothing happened swiftly , at least not at first .
The crisis is happening while the United States is in a political vacuum .
Bush lacks the power needed for decisive leadership , and his potential successors , John McCain and Barack Obama , seem more concerned about making a strong impression on voters .
Ironically , it is in the country of unfettered capitalism that the government now plans to intervene in the economy on a scale not seen since the Great Depression , and , with hundreds of billions of dollars , attempt to save the financial sector from failure — out of fear of something even worse : an economic collapse with declining prices and widespread unemployment .
This is no longer the muscular and arrogant United States the world knows , the superpower that sets the rules for everyone else and that considers its way of thinking and doing business to be the only road to success .
A new America is on display , a country that no longer trusts its old values and its elites even less : the politicians , who failed to see the problems on the horizon , and the economic leaders , who tried to sell a fictitious world of prosperity to Americans .
Also on display is the end of arrogance .
The Americans are now paying the price for their pride .
Gone are the days when the US could go into debt with abandon , without considering who would end up footing the bill .
And gone are the days when it could impose its economic rules of engagement on the rest of the world , rules that emphasized profit above all else — without ever considering that such returns cannot be achieved by doing business in a respectable way .
With its rule of three of cheap money , free markets and double - digit profit margins , American turbo - capitalism has set economic standards worldwide for the past quarter century .
Now it is proving to be nothing but a giant snowball system , upsetting the US ’s global political status as it comes crashing down .
Every bank that US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is currently forced to bail out with American government funds damages America ’s reputation around the world .
Of course , it is not solely the result of undesirable economic developments that the United States is in the process of forfeiting its unique position in the world and that the world is moving toward what Fareed Zakaria , editor of Newsweek International , calls a “ post - American age . ”
Washington has also lost much of its political ability to impose its will on other countries .
Bush ’s Failed Leadership
The failed leadership of President Bush , whose departure most of his counterparts from other countries are now looking forward to more and more openly , is not solely to blame .
Nor are his two risky wars : the one in Iraq , which he launched frivolously in the vain hope of converting the entire region to the American way of life , and the other in Afghanistan , in which Bush now risks the world ’s most powerful defense alliance , NATO , suffering its first defeat .
But it ’s hard to forget how this president ’s mentors celebrated the power to shape world affairs the United States acquired in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the East - West conflict .
There was talk of a “ unipolar moment , ” of “ America ’s moment , ” even of an “ end of history , ” now that all other countries apparently had no other choice but to become smaller versions of America : liberal , democratic and buoyed by an unshakeable confidence in the free market economy .
The Bush administration wanted to cement forever this unique moment in history , in which the United States was undoubtedly the strongest power on earth .
It wanted to use it to clean house in chronic crisis zones around the world , especially the Middle East .
Far from relying on the classic , cumbersome and often unsuccessful tools of multilateral diplomacy , the Bush warriors were always quick to threaten military intervention — just as quick as they were to make good on this threat .
The strategists of this immoderately self - confident administration formulated these principles in the “ Bush doctrine ” and claimed , for themselves and their actions , the right to “ preemptive ” military intervention — with little concern for the rules of alliances or international organizations .
The superpower even claimed privileges over its allies , even offending some of its best friends during Bush ’s first term .
Bush withdrew the American signature from a treaty to establish the International Criminal Court , he refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change and he withdrew from an agreement with the Russians to limit the number of missile defense systems .
Washington sought to divide the world into good and evil — and did so as it saw fit .
Now , in the wake of the crash on Wall Street , the debate in the UN reveals that the long - humiliated have lost their fear of the giant in world politics .
Even a political dwarf like Bolivian President Evo Morales is now talking big .
“ There is an uprising against an economic model , a capitalistic system that is the worst enemy of humanity , ” Morales told the UN General Assembly .
The financial crisis has uncovered the world power ’s true weakness .
The more the highly indebted United States has to spend to stabilize its own economic system , the more trouble it has performing its self - imposed duties as the world ’s policeman .
The new US president will only have been in office for a short time when a document titled “ Global Trends 2025 ” appears on his desk .
The report is being prepared by analysts at the National Intelligence Council .
Its chairman , Thomas Fingar , has already released a preview , and reading it will not exactly be enjoyable for proud American .
“ Although the United States will remain the most important power , American dominance will be sharply reduced , ” says Fingar .
According to the preview of the report , the erosion of American supremacy will “ accelerate in the areas of politics and economics , and possibly culture . ”
The century that just began is unlikely to be declared the American century again .
Instead , “ Asia will shape the fate of the world , with or without the United States , ” says Parag Khanna , a young Indian - American political scientist whose book “ The Second World : Empires and Influence in the New Global Order ” has attracted a great deal of attention in the United States .
There is much to be said for Khanna ’s assertion .
Beijing is already funding a large share of the gigantic American trade deficit , while at the same time selling many consumer goods to the United States .
In other words , it benefits from the US ’s weakness in two ways .
And politically speaking , the newly self - confident Chinese will no longer allow themselves to be domineered by the West .
Reacting to worldwide criticism of political oppression in Tibet , the Chinese encouraged their nationalist youth to assault Western institutions and refused to allow themselves to be lectured on human rights .
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel has acknowledged that the “ world ’s largest debtor nation ” cannot simultaneously shape the course of the world .
The challenges America faces have multiplied , especially in recent times .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union and a decade of weakness , resource - rich Russia now expects to be treated as an equal to its former Cold War rival .
The invasion of Georgia by Russian troops showed NATO where Moscow sees the limits of expansion of the Western military alliance .
Indeed , some time ago , Russian bombers resumed patrolling the borders of the Western defense alliance .
Iran has also been unimpressed by Washington ’s approach to force it to terminate its uranium - enrichment process by threatening to use military force .
The expansion of the nuclear facility at Natanz is progressing at a brisk pace , as expected , and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad now considers his adversary , Bush , to be finished .
“ The American empire in the world is reaching the end of its road , ” he said in his speech to the UN General Assembly , “ and its next rulers must limit their interference to their own borders . ”
Even before the financial crisis , there was lively debate in the United States over whether the world ’s largest economy could become overtaxed in the long run as a result of its international obligations and the global deployment of its armed forces .
The war in Iraq costs the country $ 3 billion a week .
And it is already clear that Bush ’s successor will find his powers in the White House further limited by the enormous mountain of debt he inherits .
And then there are the costs of the financial crisis — and the recession that will inevitably follow .
Most Americans are opposed to Treasury Secretary Paulson ’s plan to buy the banks ’ bad loans for $ 700 billion ( €483 billion ) .
A rare coalition of the left and right reject this one - time bailout package as “ un- American ” and as a completely excessive act of government intervention that , in fact , rewards those responsible for the debacle : the key players in New York ’s financial industry .
The government and large parts of the establishment disagree .
They fear that if the program fails , it could drag the American financial markets and then the global economy into the abyss .
With only five weeks to go before the presidential election , the emergency Wall Street bailout has turned into a high - stakes political drama .
Last Tuesday ’s hearing before the US Senate , which lasted several hours and included Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , Christopher Cox , was reminiscent of a show trial , with the government and the Federal Reserve playing the role of prosecutor .
The administration struck back the next day , when Bush gave his dramatic televised address to the nation .
But then the Republican Party base revolted .
For many Republicans , the idea of giving away $ 700 billion in tax money to Wall Street banks is tantamount to the introduction of socialism on American soil .
They believe that Bush and Paulson are betraying the ideals of their party , and their fears were confirmed elsewhere on Thursday .
The mood did not improve when , without further ado , the government seized one of the country ’s largest savings & loan institutions and sold it to JP Morgan Chase .
Many experts are also skeptical .
Allan Meltzer , an advisor to former President Ronald Reagan , is critical of what he calls “ intimidation tactics ” designed to serve “ private , not public interests . ”
“ We are applying cold compresses to the fever patient instead of fighting the actual infection , ” says Christopher Mayer of Columbia University in New York .
According to Mayer , the billions would be better spent reducing mortgage interest .
This would reduce the number of foreclosures and attract buyers back to the market .
But as divided as Washington is , doing nothing would still be the worst alternative .
“ There is no other option now than to move the plan forward , ” says Ed Yardeni , the former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank , who now heads his own research firm outside New York .
“ The US treasury secretary and chairman of the Federal Reserve predicted a financial Armageddon , ” says Yardeni .
“ Unless action is taken now , it ’ll get really ugly on the markets . ”
At the end of last week , investors ’ loss of confidence worldwide led to the credit markets becoming essentially frozen once again .
This could cause the flow of money in the broader economic environment to run dry , as happened once before in the world economic crisis .
This explains why Paulson , Bush and Bernanke are so nervous .
The bailout plan they unveiled at the end of last week was arrogant and incomplete .
The Democrats , in particular , fought for some key changes .
They want to give Congress more control over the treasury secretary and the ability to monitor his spending on an ongoing basis .
Instead of approving $ 700 billion in one fell swoop , the Democrats want the funds to be disbursed in portions .
Banks wishing to take advantage of the government bailout would also have to impose limits on executive compensation .
Finally , the Democrats want taxpayers to get something in return for their sacrifice :
The government would buy the financial institutions ’ toxic mortgage securities at a preferred price .
In return , it would receive bank shares that it could later sell , if and when prices recovered .
Overall , the hope was that this would reestablish relatively normal market conditions .
Banks would be able to unload their junk securities for a clear price , their balance sheets would no longer be adversely affected by virtually worthless mortgage - backed securities , and transparency and confidence would be restored .
Wall Street ’s Central Values : Avarice and Greed
It is an optimistic scenario , but with no guarantee of success .
Still , what ’s the alternative ?
“ Maybe we can let Wall Street implode , ” writes Princeton economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times , “ and Main Street would escape largely unscathed . ”
But , he continues , “ that ’s not a chance we want to take . ”
The effects of the financial crisis are already serious , both for the American taxpayer , who will end up footing the bill no matter what , and for the relationship between the government and the economy .
An era of American economic policy is coming to a close .
Ironically , and surprisingly to many , the last few months of the Bush administration will mark the end of the so - called “ Reagan revolution . ”
Since the early 1980s , the United States has radically emphasized deregulation , which has meant lowering taxes , eliminating regulations and generally leaving the markets to their own devices .
Ronald Reagan began his presidency in 1981 with this program , and it was following by a prolonged economic upturn .
It was driven in part by an aggressive policy of cheap money , for which a second icon of the American boom was responsible : former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan .
During the 18 years of his tenure , whenever there was trouble brewing in the stock market and financial markets , Greenspan would drown the crises in a flood of fresh money .
Whether it was the 1997 market crash in the Asian tiger countries , the selloff of Russian government bonds a year later , the collapse of the LTCM hedge fund or , finally , the bursting of the New Economy bubble at the beginning of the new millennium , Greenspan ’s rescue operations could be counted on to return growth to the world ’s markets .
But there was one thing Greenspan overlooked :
By repeatedly printing money , he also laid the foundation for the next financial bubble , and its destructive energy grew from one intervention to the next .
Over the last 15 years , Greenspan was opposed to oversight and control over those companies that used the ready cash made available by his policies to introduce a wave of so - called financial innovations .
As long as he was in office , he blocked all attempts to impose government collateral requirements on the credit , stock and financial markets .
In Greenspan ’s view , it would only hamper “ necessary flexibility . ”
His policies were borne out by the successes of two decades .
Fed by cheap money and freed of most regulations , the American financial industry experienced an unprecedented boom .
The industry ’s excessive growth was reflected in exorbitant salaries and ostentatious skyscrapers but also in the withdrawal of a large share of American value creation .
In 2007 , at the beginning of the crisis , the American financial and lending sector was responsible for 14 percent of economic performance , while collecting 33 percent of all corporate profits .
The financial boom also set the turbo - charger in motion that would lend a new face to worldwide capital from then on .
Avarice and greed have always been the central values on Wall Street , but now they had become a benchmark for the real global economy .
The American banking industry paid for globalization and the Internet revolution , the Asian upswing and the boom in the commodities markets .
“ We need a 25 - percent return , ” or else his bank would not be “ competitive internationally , ” Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann said , thereby establishing a benchmark that would soon apply not just to banks but also to automobile makers , machine builders and steel companies .
But , as is often the case with recipes for success , at some point the healthy dose is exceeded and soon the risks and side effects begin to accumulate .
The result :
The supposed medicine instead becomes a pathogen instead .
In the United States , this process began after the collapse of the New Economy .
Once again , Greenspan flooded the economy with money and , yet again , Wall Street started looking for a new market for its growth machine .
This time it discovered the American homeowner , convincing him to take out mortgages at favorable terms , even when there was practically no collateral .
The total value of all outstanding mortgage loans in the United States — $ 11 trillion ( €7.6 trillion ) — is almost as large as the country ’s gross domestic product .
At the same time , with the help of Wall Street ’s financial engineers , the Americans managed to sell a portion of the risk to other parts of the world , reasoning that if the risk was out of sight it would be out of mind .
But the fact that risks do not disappear when they are distributed around the world became clear at the beginning of last year .
Interest rates rose across the board and house prices came down , triggering a chain reaction with collateral damage that was bringing down ever - growing segments of the financial sector from one week to the next .
Today , 18 million single - family homes and condominiums in the United States are empty .
More and more Americans can no longer afford the high interest rates they are being charged .
Many consumers have even been forced to bid farewell to their beloved credit cards because the banks are no longer willing to extend credit to them .
To make matters worse , because a large share of the mortgage loans are now distributed all over the world , the crisis is spreading halfway around the globe like an infectious disease .
In recent years , many of the industrialized countries deregulated their financial markets based on the American model .
This has led to a relatively unimpeded flow of capital around the world today .
The financial assets that economies hold abroad have grown more than sevenfold in the past three decades .
By late 2007 , the market volume for derivatives , which are used to bet on interest rate , stock and credit risks worldwide , had reached a previously unthinkable level of $ 596 trillion ( €411 trillion ) .
At the same time , the number of players has multiplied .
The banks stopped being the only ones in control of the industry some time ago .
Nowadays , hedge funds bet on falling stock prices and mortgage rates , private equity companies buy up failed banks and bad loans , and wealthy pension funds keep the fund managers afloat .
The “ greater complexity of linkages within and between the financial systems ” now has one man worried , a man whose profession ought to provide him with a better idea of what ’s going on : Jean - Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank .
In a recent speech at New York University , Europe ’s highest - ranking central banker complained about the “ obscurity of and interactions among many financial instruments , ” often combined with a “ high level of borrowing . ”
The inventors of these complex securities hoped that they could be used to distribute risk more broadly around the globe .
But instead of making financial transactions more secure , they achieved the opposite effect , increasing the risks .
Today the notion of using “ many shoulders for support , ” the constant mantra of the gurus of financial alchemy , has proved to be one of the catalysts of the crash .
American economist Raghuram Rajan , whom ECB President Trichet is frequently quoting these days , had a premonition of the current disaster three years ago .
The total integration of the markets “ exposes the system to large systemic shocks , ” Rajan wrote then in a study .
Although the economy had survived many crises before , like the bursting of the Internet bubble , “ this should not lead us to be too optimistic . ”
“ Can we be confident that the shocks were large enough and in the right places to fully test the system ? ” Rajan asked .
“ A shock to equity markets , though large , ” he continued , “ may have less effect than a shock to credit markets . ”
There was certainly no shortage of warnings , and there were many voices of caution .
As long ago as 1936 , John Maynard Keynes recognized the risk that “ speculation may win the upper hand ” in the markets .
Its influence in New York , the British economist wrote , was “ enormous , ” and the situation would become serious “ when the capital development of a country becomes the by - product of the activities of a casino . ”
Irrational Exuberance
US economist Robert Shiller , who predicted the bursting of the dot - com bubble at the turn of the century , was one of the first to notice that the value of houses and condominiums in the United States was rising at a suspiciously fast rate .
In Shiller ’s view , this was another case of irrational exuberance .
In December 2004 , Stephen Roach , the former chief economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley , cautioned against the “ grimmest of all financial bubbles . ”
New York economist Nouriel Roubini presented the most accurate scenario of a crash , from the bursting of the real estate bubble to the domino - like demise of major banks .
Roubini , known as a notorious alarmist , now predicts a prolonged recession in the United States that will drag down the entire global economy with it .
“ The US consumer has consumed himself to death , ” says Roubini .
Paul Samuelson , the doyen of the world ’s economists , predicted this bitter outcome three years ago .
“ America ’s position is under pressure because we have become a society that hardly saves , ” Samuelson , 90 at the time , said in an interview with SPIEGEL .
“ We do n’t think of others or of tomorrow . ”
And now the global conflagration is a reality , triggered by cleverly packaged US subprime mortgages sold around the world , even to bankers in the provincial eastern German state of Saxony .
So - called credit derivatives , which banks and investment funds used to hedge against the failure of commercial loans , could soon add new fuel to the fire .
In the wake of the subprime crisis , could credit derivatives be the next bad thing ?
Is the world facing a wave of bankruptcies that could soon bring the financial world crashing down through the mechanism of credit derivatives ?
US market guru Warren Buffett calls derivatives ” weapons of mass destruction . ”
They are the creations of inventive financial alchemists , concoctions that blend classic forms of investment , like stocks , bonds and commodities .
In fact , within this discipline , derivatives used to hedge against credit risk are among the most dangerous gambles and , as one would expect within the global financial casino , they have experienced dizzying growth .
In the last five years , the volume of credit derivatives has grown thirtyfold to about $ 55 trillion ( €38 trillion ) , or about 20 times the gross national product of Germany .
The world is encased in a tightly woven network of reciprocal payment obligations .
“ The core problem is that it is no longer possible to know where the risks have ultimately landed , ” warns Thomas Heidorn , a professor at Frankfurt ’s Institute for Law and Finance .
This is because traders pass on credit risks an infinite number of times , which explains the dizzying market volume .
Where the risks end up is anyone ’s guess .
Nevertheless , only a handful of firms set the tone in this high - stakes game of bingo in which trillions are on the line .
According to a survey by Fitch Ratings , an international credit rating agency , about four - fifths of all credit derivatives bought and sold worldwide in 2004 was on the books of only 15 banks and major dealers .
Lehman Brothers was one of the Top 10 players in the business , and its bankruptcy has torn giant holes in the fragile network of credit insurance .
“ Not saving Lehman was a huge mistake , ” says a banking executive in Frankfurt , who notes that the shock waves will be extremely difficult to control .
Germany , where banks have had to write off about € 40 billion ( $ 58 billion ) , has managed to come away relatively unscathed until now .
Experts believe that that number will be increased by significantly more than € 10 billion ( $ 14.5 billion ) .
German banks are now concerned that they will be at a competitive disadvantage if their US competitors are permitted to unload their bad debt with the government in the future , thereby improving their credit ratings .
The Germans are demanding equal treatment .
Last Thursday , leading representatives of the industry informed Finance Minister Steinbrück of their wishes — and were rebuffed .
The financial storm has even been felt in the most unexpected of places , such as the offices of German town halls .
At the turn of the millennium , hard - up German cities like Bochum , Recklinghausen and Wuppertal , used complex agreements , to sell large shares of the municipal family silver to US investors — and then turned around to re-lease it .
In many cases these so - called Cross - Border Leases ( CBL ) — in which entire sewage systems or municipal transport operations were sold off — were insured by the US insurance giant AIG , which was recently nationalized to avoid bankruptcy .
Naturally , the small print of the CBL agreements contains an explosive clause .
It stipulates that if the guarantor loses its top- rated AAA credit rating , additional collateral must be provided .
Despite government intervention , AIG was downgraded .
Under their CBL agreements , the affected city councils have only a few weeks to come up with a solution .
By contrast , their counterparts in the cities of Münster , Troisdorf , Munich and Frankfurt can only wait and hope .
They invested portions of their tax revenues with the Frankfurt subsidiary of now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers .
By offering generous terms and citing a deposit insurance fund , the Americans managed to drum up urgently needed liquidity in Germany shortly before their bankruptcy .
The funds that German cities coughed up to help the Wall Street gamblers survive are not likely to be repaid anytime soon .
BaFin , Germany ’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority , has imposed a moratorium on the German subsidiary , freezing all transactions until further notice .
On August 15 , when the US investment bank was already on shaky ground , Helga Bickeböller , a member of Münster ’s city council , transferred € 15 million ( $ 22 million ) to Frankfurt in two tranches .
“ The offer was 0.004 percent higher than the next - best offer , ” Bickeböller says in justifying the transaction .
The credit crunch is tearing holes in the balance sheets of municipalities , companies and private households across the world .
Banks hardly lend each other money anymore , consumer confidence is evaporating , and investors are questioning whether new sales will help them recoup money already spent on new equipment .
In Germany , Arcandor — a major holding company in the mail order , retail and tourism industries that reported € 21 billion in 2007 sales — threatens to become the first victim of tighter credit terms .
As the bad news accumulates — in recent days , especially in the United States — the mood around the world is growing increasingly dire .
In August , sales of new homes in the United States dropped to their lowest level in 17 years .
In comparison to last year , which was already a bad year , new home sales have dropped by more than 34 percent .
At the same time , more and more US citizens have applied for unemployment benefits .
And the manufacturing industry is reporting significant declines in order volume .
“ The United States can not avoid an 18 - month - long , severe recession and a deep - seated financial crisis , ” warns Roubini , the New York economist .
He would consider it a success if the country manages not to plunge into years of stagnation , as Japan did in the 1990s .
The consequences of the economic downturn in the United States are being felt around the world , especially in Germany , which is currently the world ’s leading exporter .
Hans - Werner Sinn , president of the Munich - based Ifo Institute for Economic Research , calls it an “ extremely worrisome situation . ”
According to an analysis by the German Economics Ministry , the economy is exposed to “ external shocks ” and a “ noticeably worsened external economic environment . ”
The report even mentions the dreaded word “ recession , ” although it adds that that recession is “ not a foregone conclusion . ”
This is all the more vexing for the German government because it was the one that warned against the current malaise some time ago .
During the G - 8 economic summit in Heiligendamm more than a year ago , for example , Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to convince her state guests of the need for tighter controls on the financial markets .
But President Bush and then British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave the chancellor the cold shoulder .
‘ One Can See that We Are on a more Solid Base ’
For far too long , the Americans and the British made fun of the Germans for their risk - averse , savings - oriented mentality , says Bernd Pfaffenbach , Merkel ’s chief negotiator on foreign trade issues .
But now the relative conservatism that Germans have shown in financial matters is paying off .
“ One can see that we are on a more solid base , ” says Pfaffenbach , who refers to the crisis as a “ purifying storm . ”
Pfaffenbach is n’t the only one to see the problem in this light .
The American bank crash has prompted economists and politicians worldwide to prepare for the end of an era of turbo - capitalism driven by the financial markets .
The financial industry — especially in the United States — will shrink considerably , while the significance of the real economy will increase .
Once again , the government will have to base its supervisory function on the old banker ’s principle : security first .
This is especially true when it comes to monetary policy .
For years , central bankers “ paid attention almost exclusively to developments in consumer prices , ” complains Thomas Meyer , chief European economist at Deutsche Bank .
If consumer prices were going up by 2 percent or 3 percent , the risk of inflation was thought to have been averted .
The fact that the prices of stocks , bonds and real estate were often rising at double - digit rates was usually ignored until the financial bubbles burst with a loud bang .
Some economists recommend that central bankers should also consider asset inflation when reaching future decisions .
At the same time , Europe ’s finance ministers are calling for tighter supervision of the credit and securities markets , as a group of experts from the G - 8 countries recently recommended .
Their plan calls for requiring banks to maintain larger capital reserves for specific risks .
In addition , they have recommended that hidden financial risks that banks have assumed be made more transparent and that better guidelines be developed for the valuation of financial instruments .
Most of all , the G - 8 council of experts stresses the need to reform the risk classification of securities .
The major international rating agencies , such Moody ’s and Standard & Poor ’s , have deeply embarrassed themselves in the current crisis .
In many cases , they gave their highest ratings to what were really junk securities .
The G - 8 experts have proposed that these institutions be made subject to a code of conduct .
At the same time , the experts also warn against intervening too much in the financial markets .
As was illustrated by Germany ’s public sector Landesbanken , hard hit by the subprime crisis , as well as state - owned lender KfW — which transfered €350 million to Lehman Brothers the day it filed for bankruptcy protection — the government is usually not up to the task of owning and operating banks .
Simply banning certain financial market operations also makes little sense , they believe , as such prohibitions are often easily circumvented .
If the G - 8 experts prevail , there will be major consequences .
For now , it would spell the end of ever - rising returns with constantly changing securities .
At the same time , the market position of Anglo - Saxon banks would be significantly restricted , which would benefit the up - and - coming financial institutions of the emerging Asian and Eastern European economies .
A new chapter in economic history has begun , one in which the United States will no longer play its former dominant role .
A process of redistributing money and power around the world — away from America and toward the resource - rich countries and rising industrialized nations in Asia — has been underway for years .
The financial crisis will only accelerate the process .
The wealthy state - owned funds of China , Singapore , Dubai and Kuwait control assets of almost $ 4 trillion ( €2.76 trillion ) , and they are now in a position to buy their way onto Wall Street in a big way .
But they have remained reserved until now , partly as a result of poor experiences in the past .
The China Investment Corp. , for example , invested in the initial public offering of the Blackstone Group , a private equity firm , and invested $ 5 billion ( €3.45 billion ) in Morgan Stanley .
In both cases , it lost a lot of money .
But time is on the side of the Chinese .
American stocks are becoming cheaper and cheaper .
And the longer the crisis lasts , the weaker American objections to buyers from the Far East will become .
In fact , it is quite possible that they will soon be celebrated as saviors .
The Chinese are interested in keeping the situation in the United States from spinning out of control .
In a telephone conversation last Monday , Chinese President Hu Jintao told President Bush that he hoped that the measures to stabilize US financial markets would “ achieve quick results and improve the economic and financial situation . ”
Bush had called his Chinese counterpart to inform him about his government ’s bailout program .
Once again , the conversation symbolized just how great the mutual dependence between the two countries has become .
No Time to Gloat
Both in Asia and the United States , expressing schadenfreude over the decline of the United States as a superpower is out of place .
The risk is too great that if America goes into a tailspin , it will drag the rest of the world down with it .
Despite the anger felt toward Bush , there is little enthusiasm in Europe ’s capitals for the political consequences .
The financial crisis will reinvigorate America ’s tendency toward isolationism , which never quite disappeared .
The triumphalism of the Bush years could easily be followed by the “ I ’ll - sit - this - one - out ” years of an Obama administration committed to a strict policy of belt - tightening .
If that happens , both old and new Europe will have to demonstrate whether the European Union can rightfully claim to be on an equal footing with the United States .
In the past , the US government ’s solo efforts provided the Europeans with an all - too - comfortable excuse for simply doing nothing .
But that excuse is no longer valid .

Too lazy to find a food cart and not quite adventurous enough for a themed restaurant ?
Occasional vegetarianism – flexitarianism – is a great way to do something green for the planet .
Vegetarian meals are delicious , healthy for you , and many of them are very easy to make .
Best of all , they ’re really , really cheap and easy to cook in your own kitchen .
Before you call the pizza guy or hit the drive - through for a burger , consider doing something good for the earth , and your health , by putting together a vegetarian dish .
These recipes are filling , foolproof and they are really tasty , too .
3 - Minute Healthy Nachos
( Image via tacoslamexicana )
Buy organic or blue corn chips and skip all the greasy hamburger meat and refried beans to make these healthy , yummy nachos in just tres minutos .
Layer your chips with canned slice olives , canned kidney beans , canned sliced jalapenos and grate a little organic cheddar over everything .
( Buy organic when you can afford it .
It ’s better for the planet . )
Use any veggies you like , really .
Pop in the microwave for around a minute , and garnish with salsa .
Easy Southwest Bean Salad
( Image via americanfeast )
You know those frozen veggie blends in the freezer case at the grocery store ?
Buy the Southwest variety ( it might go by some other cheesy “ fiesta ” type name ) .
This usually is a mix of bell peppers , corn , black beans and broccoli .
Thaw overnight and drain , then keep in a container in the fridge so you can use at any time .
When you ’re craving a flavorful meal , mix your thawed , drained batch of Southwest veggies with a handful of diced jalapenos ( you can buy these pre-diced for about $ 2 ) or a few tablespoons of whatever salsa you have on hand , and a few tablespoons of organic cottage cheese .
The total cost of the meal is under $ 4 , and it ’s low - fat , vegetarian , and very filling .
Add a can of kidney beans and you ’ll be as stuffed as a chile relleno .
You can use any sort of veggie blend you like , too .
High Protein Mac ‘n Cheese
( Image via freedigitalphotos )
Slice up one package of superfirm , high - protein tofu ( the organic runs about $ 3 – how ’s that for cheap protein ? ) .
Spread thick french - fry - sized cut tofu slices evenly over a foil - covered baking dish .
Drizzle with a few teaspoons of olive oil , and sprinkle coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper generously .
Spread 1 cup of grated cheddar or mozzarella , or just 1 / 2 cup if you ’re using parmesan , over the slices .
Garnish with a little rosemary if you like .
Bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes , or until the cheese begins to crisp and brown .
The chewiness of extra firm tofu makes this dish taste very similar to Mac ‘n Cheese , but it ’s far lower in empty carbs and much higher in protein .
Savory Apples ‘n Onions
( Image via much0mas )
This was once a pioneer favorite .
Take 2 large apples ( they are in season right now and are very cheap ) , wash and chop into cubes .
Do likewise for a large sweet onion ( also inexpensive ) .
Double the amounts if you are having a guest .
Saute in a pan over medium heat – adding occasional small dashes of salt , cumin , balsamic vinegar and the tiniest pat of butter ( vegans can use olive oil ) .
When the onions are clear , you ’re done .
Yes , it sounds weird , but it ’s delicious .
You ’ll want to have something to go with this that has some protein , like a garden burger or a brown rice packet , both of which you can microwave .
Apples ‘n onions only takes about 10 minutes , a few dollars and it ’s delicious as a topping for rice or even by itself for a light snack .
Lazy Man ’s Rich ‘n Creamy Tomato Soup
( Image via dietrecipesblog )
Forget the Campbell’s .
Make your own decadent soup in 5 minutes with some leftovers .
Here ’s how : use one 6 oz .
can of tomato paste , 12 oz .
water ( you can run the water into the tomato paste can first to get the leftover paste ) , 1 dollop of sour cream or a 1 / 4 cup of half ‘n half or milk – whatever you have on hand – and a generous splash of just - past - drinking red wine ( a few days old ) .
Add to a standard size soup pot and cook over medium heat .
Chop up a handful or two of any over ripe tomatoes , like those little grape tomatoes you always forget to eat .
Add in a generous pinch of salt , black pepper , and either thyme or sage .
If you have some chopped garlic add a teaspoon or so , but it ’s not necessary .
Cook until hot , mashing the tomatoes a little with your cooking spoon , and serve .
For extra rich flavor , sprinkle with a few chile flakes .
Pita Tacos
( Image via thechefdujour )
Get your fiber intake with whole wheat pita “ tacos ” .
You can fill these with anything and it requires no cooking .
A little grated cheese or crumbled feta , some sliced olives and tomatoes , crisp lettuce , pepperoncinis , mushrooms , avocados , leftover grilled onions and peppers , fresh sliced bell peppers … you get the idea .
Pita tacos are a great way to use random veggies in your fridge like cucumbers or onions , and they only take a minute to make and enjoy .
Cheap , tasty , fast !
PB & Fruit Sandwich
( Image via myspace )
Skip the sugary , processed jelly and make a whole - grain PB and fruit sandwich .
Sliced bananas work well , but so do thinly sliced green apples , peaches , nectarines , or kiwis .
Get creative .
Be sure you choose whole - grain for a healthy sandwich .
You should also go for natural peanut butter so you are n’t eating heavily processed trans fat or sugar .
Avocado Saver
( Image via Allison Newhouse )
Avocados are pricey enough that it ’s a shame to let them go to waste .
That ’s why buying a big sack of avocados on sale is n’t a great idea unless you know what to do .
Use up a large supply and feel satisfied until lunch by mashing a whole cubed avocado gently and using it for your omelet filling .
Drizzle omelet with balsamic vinegar and you wo n’t need cheese or any other fillings .
( The secret to a good omelet : whisk for one minute before pouring eggs into pan ; use plenty of olive oil ; make sure pan is thoroughly heated but not super hot . )
Caprese Salad
( Image via askville )
This is one of those meals that looks really fancy but actually requires no brainpower .
You need three things : fresh basil leaves , fresh tomatoes , and fresh ( soft ) mozzarella cheese .
Slice the tomatoes and cheese and stack ( tomatoes first , cheese on top ) with one or two basil leaves .
Arrange like patties on a plate ( 3 or 4 per person ) and sprinkle with a little olive oil , balsamic vinegar , salt and pepper .
Delicious .
Fast .
Cheap .
Quesadilla
( Image via Channel4 )
Who does n’t love a quesadilla ?
If you do n’t know how to make this , you ’re a rare bird .
Simply grease a hot pan lightly with any oil , toss on a tortilla , cover the tortilla with grated cheese of your choice , add in any small chopped leftover veggies if you like , cover with another tortilla , and grill until the tortilla begins to brown and the cheese gets melty ( about 1 minute , depending on heat ) .
Flip .
Remove from heat .
Serve with salsa or guacamole .
Enjoy !
ALT Sandwich
( Image via gliving )
Slices of avocado , lettuce , tomato and toasted whole - grain bread are all you need .
This sandwich is simple , and it ’s delicious with dijon or honey mustard .
Add a little cheese if you want more protein .
Eggs and Peas
( Image via riverglenfarm )
This is one of those very basic , humble dishes that still tastes wonderful .
Simply fry up peas in a little olive oil and salt .
When they ’re starting to pucker and brown , scrape them to the side of the pan and fry 2 eggs over medium .
The yolk blends with the peas nicely , and it ’s a lot faster than making hashbrowns .
Scrambled is great if you do n’t like fried eggs .
( Frozen peas work great , and they ’re cheap ! )
Very filling , easy dish .
Cool Cucumber Wrap
( Image via inforochester )
This is so easy , it ’s embarrassing .
Slice a cucumber thinly .
No need to peel ( just wash it really well ) .
Spread a tablespoon or two of cream cheese ( vegan or organic dairy are both fine ) on a whole - wheat or spinach tortilla .
Place a row of 5 - 8 cucumber slices down the center .
Add sliced black olives and lots of crunchy iceberg if you have it , but this is great just with cucumbers .
Give it a few squirts of hot sauce .
Roll . Eat. Repeat .
Lazy Bean Salad

Opinion
Son of a Preacher Man / How John Ashcroft 's religion shapes his public service
Of all the Bible stories John Ashcroft knows by heart , none mirrors his own life like the Old Testament melodrama of Daniel .
As a Hebrew captive exiled to Babylon , Daniel worked his way into the palace and was promoted to a high - ranking administrative position .
The powers - that - be saw him as smart and politically ambitious , but also as a sanctimonious prig .
His religious rectitude invited ridicule , as when he refused to " defile " himself by partaking of the rich food and wine of royalty because his God favored a vegetable - and - water diet .
So his critics set him up , persuading King Darius to outlaw worship of anyone else but the king .
Daniel kept praying .
They dropped him into a den of lions .
This was a lesson that John David Ashcroft absorbed as a Pentecostal minister 's son reared in an Assemblies of God congregation in Springfield , Mo .
The moral was clear :
Never waver , never doubt , never permit skepticism and mockery to deter you from the course you believe is right .
Today Ashcroft -- the Bush administration 's front man in its war on terrorism -- is expanding his power as attorney general with a stunning degree of moral certitude .
Never one to see issues in shades of gray , he believes America 's campaign against terror is as black and white as it gets .
Supporters cheer him as a moral avenger .
Foes consider him a pharisaical vigilante whose willingness to trample civil liberties is scary .
One thing is clear :
While other politicians pick up religion as a fashion accessory , Ashcroft exudes it from his core .
Says Franklin Zimring , law professor at UC Berkeley and a law school classmate of Ashcroft : " You 'd learn a heck of a lot more about John Ashcroft researching his church than you would turning the University of Chicago Law School upside down .
What 's problematic about his career as attorney general is not his technical legal training .
It 's his values . "
It 's impossible to understand Ashcroft 's view of the world without understanding his view of God , whom he says he " invites " into all his daily activities .
And it 's impossible to overestimate how deeply Pentecostal biblical training permeates his view of right and wrong -- and stiffens his spine against criticism .
History is written by the winners , and they may or may not get it right , Ashcroft is fond of saying .
" I do n't particularly care if I do what 's right in the sight of men .
The important thing is for me to do right in God 's sight .
. .
.
The verdict of history is inconsequential ; the verdict of eternity is what counts . "
That unblinking certainty bothers some people .
" There is a rigidity there that is very troubling , " said Ralph Neas , head of the liberal People for the American Way , who maintains Ashcroft is suited to direct the Moral Majority , not the Justice Department .
" He is so confident of his world view that he does n't have to seek any advice that would challenge his opinion . . . or interfere with his bending the law his way by executive fiat .
" John Ashcroft thinks John Ashcroft knows what 's best . "
Ashcroft may be in worldly Washington , but he clearly is not of it .
A bemused national press has made much fun of the fact that he is an attorney general who does n't drink , smoke , dance , sleep around , swear or otherwise defile himself .
Even activist Phyllis Schlafly was taken aback when he balked at buying a raffle ticket for a Rush Limbaugh book at a right - wing fund - raiser because that would be gambling .
Yet to catalog his abstinences is to but scratch the surface of his makeup .
His rectitude has made him the Bush administration 's heat shield for controversy .
It has kept the attorney general from flinching in the face of concerns that he too blithely puts the Constitution " on hold " under the guise of pursuing potential terrorists , an investigation that to date has yielded few tangible results .
( Of some 1,200 " material witnesses " initially detained domestically after 9/11 , none has been charged with terrorism . )
And it unquestionably has made him the favored son of his much - maligned Assemblies of God , whose practice of charismatic " spiritual gifts " such as healing and speaking in tongues historically prompted some other denominations to regard it as a hillbilly " Holy Roller church . "
Many people mistakenly assume that Ashcroft is a fundamentalist .
Actually , fundamentalists tend to take a dim view of Pentecostalism .
( Bob Jones Sr. , founder of ultraconservative Bob Jones University , once referred to it as " Satanic doctrine " -- so when Ashcroft infamously accepted an honorary degree at the college and declared , " We have no king but Christ , " he was actually bridging a historic gulf . )
Ashcroft , a fervent lifelong member of the Assemblies of God , has brought the denomination more mainstream recognition than any of its earlier conspicuous congregants , including Aimee Semple McPherson , Elvis Presley , Jimmy Swaggart , Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and former Reagan administration Interior Secretary James Watt .
" We joked among ourselves that John must have felt like he was in the lion 's den during his Senate confirmation hearings , but being attorney general he 's continued to endure a tremendous amount of pressure and criticism and attack , " said Wayne Warner , director of the Pentecostal Heritage Foundation .
" Fortunately , he was raised in a family with a long tradition of standing strong in the faith -- whether the world understood or not . "
Trace the legacy back to Ashcroft 's Irish - immigrant grandfather , who packed his family under the oilcloth canopy of a Chevrolet bearing the handmade signs " Where Will You Spend Eternity ? " and " Jesus is Coming Soon ! " and set out to save lost souls all up and down the Atlantic seaboard .
" Evangelist Ashcroft " would regale revival meetings with his testimony about how an exploding gasoline can turned him into a human torch -- until God gave him a " miraculous healing . "
" We were gypsies almost , traveling in that car .
Sometimes we slept in the car , " Ashcroft 's father , the late J. Robert Ashcroft , told a church historian .
He recalled the flat tires , the meals of nothing but cereal for weeks at a time , how much he missed going to school -- and how he developed an obliviousness to public scorn .
" At street meetings , they would ( sometimes ) throw stones and eggs and tomatoes at us . . .
But I do n't know -- it never embarrassed me or gave me fear or anything . "
John Ashcroft admired his father 's " ability to take the tough road , to put off pleasure for something else , ( that ) was my dad 's north star of navigation . "
He said his father was a " chair gripper " -- a dental patient who opted to get teeth drilled without Novocaine .
J. Robert Ashcroft exhibited his own public - opinion - be - darned attitude , although his rebellion came against the Assemblies of God 's habit of shunning education .
Among Pentecostals of his generation , " worldly schools provoked suspicion at best , hostility at worst , " wrote Duke University religion Professor Grant Wacker .
There seemed little need for education when Pentecostals assumed the second coming of Christ and the end of the world were imminent .
But when J. Robert Ashcroft 's application to be a chaplain in World War II was rejected over his lack of education , it inspired him to pursue a doctorate in psychology at New York University .
He completed everything but a dissertation .
He then helped persuade the wary Assemblies of God -- inclined to see higher education as the source of social woes -- to establish their own liberal arts colleges , and he became president of a few .
Now the largest predominantly white Pentecostal denomination in the country ,
the Assemblies claim 2.5 million adherents nationwide , outnumbering Episcopalians .
The church 's global headquarters are in Ashcroft 's lifelong home , which in the local vernacular sounds like " Sprangfield Mizzourah . "
It 's an overwhelmingly white , country - music - loving city in the Ozarks along old Route 66 .
Brad Pitt grew up here -- although he 's long since gone .
Now , tourists use it as a pit-stop on the way to Branson , a place Bart Simpson aptly described as Las Vegas designed by Ned Flanders .
Branson 's strip boasts " the biggest names in show biz today , like Andy Williams , Tony Orlando and the Lennon Sisters " -- stars many people outside that orbit might assume are dead .
This territory continues to be Ashcroft 's lodestar -- up until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , he was making weekend pilgrimages back to attend his church and relax on his 155 - acre farm .
As he puts it , " It 's comfortable , and I like comfortable . "
The town has n't changed much since he was an Eagle Scout and a star high school quarterback who earned extra money working at the local Dairy Queen .
J. Robert exposed his three boys to Wordsworth and Shakespeare , to Ralph Ellison and Mahalia Jackson , but he also instilled what John Ashcroft remembers as a " razor sharp focus on the eternal . "
They were forbidden to ride bikes on the Sabbath and barred from the movie theater : Paying 15 cents for a picture show means 7 cents would " go to support a Hollywood lifestyle we disagree with . "
He recalls awakening each morning not to the smell of brewing coffee or fried bacon but to the loud exhortations of his father on his knees in prayer : " a magisterial wake - up call . "
J. Robert Ashcroft was n't praying that his sons find happiness or achieve great things --
John remembers instead that his father prayed for them to have noble aspirations , believing the rest would fall into place .
John Ashcroft no longer speaks publicly about his own " baptism of the spirit " or speaking in tongues .
Although the church considers speaking in tongues a sign of higher spiritual attainment , only about half of Assemblies of God members actually do so , according to Assemblies of God seminary professor Gary McGee .
In the New Testament Book of Acts , the " Day of Pentecost " relates how , after Jesus ' resurrection and return to heaven , God sent down his Holy Spirit to his disciples .
Recipients are described as speaking in tongues , which mainline Christian denominations once regarded as a temporary miracle that allowed them to evangelize people who did n't speak their language .
Over time , the practice faded from Christian churches .
But at a revival in Topeka , Kan. , in 1901 , Bible college students suddenly began to babble in unknown " languages " and a fervor spread for this new Pentecostalism , whose flamboyant evangelists cut across racial and gender lines .
They railed against dance - hall frequenters , dope - peddlers and other sinners , often staging spectacular shows .
McPherson 's sermon " Throw Out the Life Line " featured a dozen nightgowned maidens clinging to the Rock of Ages amid lightning and thunder before being pulled to safety by the " sailors of the Lord . "
It was in this milieu that the Assemblies of God was established .
While adhering to the beliefs of the denomination , J. Robert Ashcroft frowned upon evangelists who began sermons by having themselves wheeled onstage in coffins , or those who used what he called " crude " syntax and boasted they had no need for education .
He was always dignified , clad in the white shirt he considered the " mark of a civilized man . "
Today , some Pentecostal churches still feature services where congregants are " struck by the spirit " and lapse into trances , writhing on the floor or shaking uncontrollably .
Many , however , do not .
At the Ashcrofts ' home congregation , 3,000 - seat Central Assembly Church in downtown Springfield , services are less theatrical , although someone speaks in tongues , on average , a couple of times a month .
Some people raised in a Pentecostal church were quick to shed its precepts as they gained a more worldly education .
Not John Ashcroft .
From the day he left for Yale in 1960 , Ashcroft was a self - labeled " odd duck . "
He certainly knew no fellow Yalies who were Pentecostal .
His father wrote the freshman letters literally every day to tether him to his roots .
Fellow students from the University of Chicago Law School remember John as a churchgoer on the straight - and - narrow there too -- listening to fiery radio sermons and selling his plasma to help pay the bills .
Today , living in Washington , John and Janet Ashcroft attend an evangelical church that meets in Union Station , with a rock band and a young , ethnically diverse congregation .
Although he has been both governor and U.S. senator from Missouri , you could say he got where he is by being a loser .
He lost his first congressional race , his first run for statewide office , his bid to head the National Republican Committee and most notoriously , his last race : the 2000 Senate re- election bid he lost to Mel Carnahan , a Democrat who had died in a plane accident .
But Ashcroft 's faith again frames his view : " For every crucifixion , there is a resurrection , " he says .
Losses paved the way to his first office -- he was appointed state auditor of Missouri -- and his current office as well .
At tense confirmation hearings , his former Senate colleagues wondered whether the religious prism through which he views the world would distort his ability to execute the laws of the land .
Time and again , he said no .
" It 's against my religion to impose my religion on other people , " he repeated .
There were examples to prove the point .
For instance , despite his vociferous opposition to gambling , as Missouri governor he helped set up the required mechanism to run a lottery after voters approved one .
Still , his record gave critics doubts .
There was his gubernatorial veto of a bill to allow liquor sales on Sundays , and another veto on relaxing restrictions on candy containing alcohol -- he said he did n't care to make it easier for children to consume booze .
There was the time he warned : " A robed elite have taken the wall of separation built to protect the church and made it a wall of religious oppression . "
Potential nominees for judgeships recalled that Ashcroft questioned whether they were faithful to their spouses and whether they drank -- although those who reported only social drinking were not disqualified .
Missouri is no bastion of the right wing , but Ashcroft did n't succumb to the common political practice of commissioning polls and focus groups to shape his policies .
To the contrary , Chip Robertson , his first chief of staff and later a Missouri Supreme Court justice , told the St. Louis Post - Dispatch : " One of the things I loved about Ashcroft was that he'd see a poll and say , ' My negatives are n't high enough -- I need to take on some tough issues . ' "
Ashcroft 's record registers none of the usual tabloid scandal scars , unless you count the time his wife pulled strings to get the Missouri State Library opened on a Sunday so their youngest son could finish a homework project .
It 's easy to present his views in unflattering ways .
He once told a religious magazine , for example , " I think all we should legislate is morality .
"
In context , he goes on to draw a contrast between morality and spirituality , which he says can and must never be legislated .
Among his colleagues he was still a little strange -- a guy who had his father anoint him with cooking oil from the kitchen before taking office .
Cynics dubbed him " The Crisco Kid . "
And his voting record led the John Birch Society to rank him favorably , right alongside Sen. Jesse Helms .
Although Ashcroft won Senate confirmation to be attorney general , the vote was brutal : 52 - 48 -- the lowest margin of any Bush nominee .
At the Justice Department , his record has been a mixed bag .
Setting aside his personal religious beliefs , for example , Ashcroft has ordered federal marshals to protect doctors who perform abortions .
Despite his longtime defense of states ' rights , he unleashed federal action to block the wishes of Oregon voters who voted to legalize assisted suicide , and California voters who approved medical use of marijuana .
And his daily devoutness again became a novelty when he held voluntary office prayer meetings before work , and when aides draped the exposed breasts of partially disrobed statuary inside the Justice Department .
Some observers thought Ashcroft seemed almost bored with his new job .
But on Sept. 11 , on a flight to Milwaukee , he took a call over his secure phone , hung up and announced to aides : " Our world has changed forever . "
In the 11 months since , Ashcroft has applied his good - versus - evil paradigm to the war on terrorism .
He has become chief crusader in his own holy war -- not against Muslims , but against perceived terrorist threats .
" His religion teaches him there are concrete , clear - cut right and wrong answers to things , " said Julie Ingersoll , assistant professor of religious studies at the University of North Florida , who until recently taught in Springfield .
" Someone else might look at Christianity and Islam as two different constructs of reality .
Certainly he would n't . "
Ashcroft has no patience for introspective doubters who question the morality , constitutionality or even the wisdom of military tribunals , secret detentions , expanded wiretapping , blocking of Freedom of Information Act requests and eavesdropping on lawyers .
" Those who scare peace - loving people with phantoms of lost liberty , your tactics only aid terrorists , for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve , " he scolded the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Just days ago , the House stripped from the Homeland Security Bill the Ashcroft " TIPS " plan to recruit millions of amateur observers -- meter readers ,
mail carriers , cable installers and the like -- to keep their eyes peeled for " suspicious activities " and report on fellow Americans .
Lately , even some conservatives are fretting about Ashcroft 's zeal to infiltrate subversive groups -- they fear a future Democratic administration could turn the tactic against them .
To Ingersoll , the conflict simply reflects a paradox between two competing strains of Ashcroft 's Pentecostalism : a libertarian belief that the government should mind its own business and a fundamentalist faith in law and order .
" He 's had to appeal to the fundamentalists to build his political base , and he's now the nation 's top law enforcement officer , so that side is winning out in him . "
Now White House sources are beginning to grumble anonymously to reporters that Ashcroft is too overtly political , and tends to grab headlines instead of being a team player .
It 's doubtful any of this criticism is giving Ashcroft second thoughts about his mission .
Although he gives lip service to the value of " creative self - doubt , " there is n't much evidence he engages in it .
In his memoir he tries to demonstrate the value of self - doubt by relating a tale in which the press and an opponent once criticized him .
But the unintentionally comic moral he offers is not that he was wrong , but that he forgave them for being so wrong about him .
Is this sense of self - righteousness , this imperviousness to criticism , a virtue or a fatal flaw ?
Julian Bond , chairman of the NAACP , has observed that Ashcroft " knows something about the Taliban , coming as he does from that wing of American politics . "
Not surprisingly , the Christian magazine World has chosen Ashcroft its " Daniel of the Year " for withstanding " scorn and harassment . "

Send to everyone you know * URGENT ** Senate Bypassing House of Representatives , to vote on BAILOUT Wednesday , Stealthily Attached To Revenue Bill !!
CALL NOW : NO BAILOUT !
Please send this message out to EVERYONE , not only here but on your email list !
The Senate is ignoring the House of Representatives and will be voting today on passing the bill ...
The bailout package adds innocuous new provisions - including raising the FDIC insurance cap -- and includes a " Mental Health Parity " provision , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness .
Because the bill must originate in the House , the Senate is attaching the rescue plan to a bill that deals with renewable energy tax incentives .
This would allow the Senate to vote before the House .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama , flush with cash and ramping up his advertising in the final weeks before the November 4 election , is making U.S. political history by placing the first presidential campaign ads in online video games .

The Democratic Illinois senator is using the Internet ads , featured in 18 games through Microsoft Corp ’s Xbox Live service , to promote his online voter registration and early balloting drive in 10 battleground states , a campaign spokesman said on Wednesday .
Unprecedented in U.S. presidential politics , the video game buy is targeted mainly at young adult males who are difficult to reach through more traditional campaign advertising .
“ The 18 - to - 34 - year - old male is the mainstream demographic for the hard - core video gamer , ” said Van Baker , an analyst for Gartner Inc. , a technology market research firm in San Jose , California .
“ They ’re hard to get to because they do n’t watch much TV and they do n’t read a lot , so it ’s a good venue to get that segment . ”
The ads appear in games as banners or billboards with an image of Obama , the slogan “ Early voting has begun , ” and a reference to his VoteForChange.com
Web site .
The site allows users to register online to vote , obtain absentee voter information and find a polling location .
Polls consistently have given Obama , 47 , an edge over Republican rival John McCain , 72 , among younger voters .
Far from turning his back on more conventional media , however , Obama ’s campaign last week said he planned to make a prime - time pitch to voters October 29 in a 30 - minute ad slated to run on two broadcast networks , CBS and NBC .
A throwback to a campaign ad strategy fairly common in the 1950s and ‘ 60s , Obama ’s long - form ad will mark the first such paid political national telecast since Ross Perot ran a series of them during his independent bid for president in 1992 .
Perot ’s ads drew an average audience of 11.6 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research .
TARGETED AUDIENCE
Obama ’s video game ads are targeted at a more finely targeted group of potential voters .
The in - game ads are delivered to players through 18 games , ranging from “ Guitar Hero 3 ” and “ The Incredible Hulk ” to sports titles like “ NASCAR 09 , ” “ NBA Live 08 ” and “ NFL Tour . ”
Such ads can be directed to particular geographical areas through the Internet Protocol addresses registered with Internet service providers when players ’
Xbox 360 consoles go online , Baker said .
Obama ’s campaign said the game ads are targeted at 10 key states where early voting is available and relatively simple -- Ohio , Iowa , Indiana , Montana , Wisconsin , North Carolina , Nevada , New Mexico , Florida and Colorado .
“ These ads will help us expand the reach of VoteForChange.com , so that more people can use this easy tool to find their early vote location and make sure their voice is heard , ” campaign spokesman Nick Shapiro said .
Nearly 5 million people have visited the VoteForChange.com site since its launch August 25 , and more than 774,000 have downloaded a voter registration form using the site to date , his campaign said .
Earlier this month , the Obama campaign placed nationwide VoteForChange ads on users ’ home pages of the social networking site Facebook.com .
The novel use of interactive media by Obama is further evidence of his substantial funding advantage over McCain , whose own campaign is limited to the $ 84 million in public money he agreed to accept .
Obama raised a record $ 67 million in August and is expected to perhaps approach $ 100 million for September , according to the Washington Post , which reported that Obama has been running seven or eight times as many commercials as McCain in some states .
His 30 - minute ads on CBS and NBC are believed to have cost his campaign roughly $ 1 million each .
AMERICA'S Congress is not used to being second - guessed .
But as lawmakers wrestled in the Capitol , world stockmarkets have been giving real - time odds on the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion bail - out becoming law .
After the plan 's thrashing by the House of Representatives on September 29th , spurred on by voters ' loathing of “ casino capitalism ” , investors panicked .
Yet as The Economist went to press , they were optimistic that , after winning the Senate 's approval on October 1st , the plan would pass .
Even if it does , that should not be a cause for optimism .
Look beyond the stockmarkets , especially at the seized - up money markets , and there is little to see except bank failures , emergency rescues and high anxiety in the credit markets .
These forces are drawing the financial system closer to disaster and the rich world to the edge of a nasty recession ( see article ) .
The bail - out package should mitigate the problems , but it will not avert them .
The crisis is spreading in two directions — across the Atlantic to Europe , and out of the financial markets into the real economy .
Governments have been dealing with it disaster by disaster .
They have struggled to gain control not just because of the speed of contagion but also because policymakers , and the public they serve , have failed fully to grasp the breadth and depth of the crisis .
What 's the Icelandic for “ domino ” ?
Step forward , Peer Steinbrück , Germany 's finance minister , who rashly declared on September 25th that America was “ the source … and the focus of the crisis ” , before heralding the end of its role as the financial superpower .
Within days , the focus shifted and Mr Steinbrück and his officials were obliged to arrange a € 35 billion ( $ 51 billion ) loan from German banks and the German government to save Hypo Real Estate , the country 's second - biggest property lender .
The hapless Mr Steinbrück is not alone .
European banks were collapsing at a dizzying pace even as Christian Noyer , governor of the Bank of France , declared that “ there is no drama in front of us . ”
Hypo Real Estate was just one of five banks in seven European countries bailed out in three days .
Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands carved up Fortis , a big bancassurer ; Britain nationalised Bradford & Bingley ; Belgium , France and Luxembourg saved Dexia ; and Iceland rescued Glitnir .
Separately , Ireland took €400 billion of contingent liabilities onto the national balance sheet , when it stood behind the deposits and debts of its six large banks and building societies .
You have to wonder what Mr Noyer regards as dramatic .
By some measures , many European banks look more vulnerable than their American counterparts do — and that is saying quite something , given the past week 's forced sale of Washington Mutual , America 's biggest thrift , and Wachovia , its fourth - biggest commercial bank .
In America , outside Wall Street , the banks have lent 96 cents for each $ 1 of deposits .
Continental European banks have lent roughly € 1.40 for each € 1 of deposits .
They have to borrow the rest from money - market investors , who are not especially confident just now .
Some Europeans , including the British , Irish and Spanish banks , have housing busts of their own .
And they must contend with the toxic American securities they bought by the billion , as well as their own slowing economies .
Western Europe is not the limit of this : the panic has also struck banks in Hong Kong , Russia and now India .
And it is not just the geographical breadth of this crisis that is alarming , but also its economic depth .
Because it is rooted in the money markets ( see article and article ) , it will feed through to businesses and households in every economy it hits .
Take a deep breath
Most of the time nobody notices the credit flowing through the lungs of the economy , any more than people notice the air they breathe .
But everyone knows when credit stops circulating freely through markets to banks , businesses and consumers .
For almost a year the markets had worried about banks ' liquidity and solvency .
After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last month , amid confusion about whom the state would save and on what terms , they panicked .
The markets for three - , six - and 12 - month paper are shut , so banks must borrow even more money overnight than usual .
Banks used to borrow from each other at about 0.08 percentage points above official rates ; on September 30th they paid more than four percentage points more .
In one auction to get dollar funds overnight from the European Central Bank , banks were prepared to pay interest of 11 % , five times the pre-crisis rate .
Astonishingly , rates scaled these extremes even as the Federal Reserve promised $ 620 billion of extra funding .
Bankers have always earned their crust by committing money for long periods and financing that with short - term deposits and borrowing .
Today , that model has warped into self - parody : many of the banks ' assets are unsellable even as they have to return to the market each day to ask for lenders to vote on their survival .
No wonder they are hoarding cash .
This is why those politicians who set the interests of Main Street against those of Wall Street are so wrong .
Sooner or later the money markets affect every business .
Companies face higher interest charges and the fear that they may one day lose access to bank loans altogether .
So they , too , hoard cash , cancelling acquisitions and investments , in order to pay down debt .
Managers delay new products , leave factories unbuilt , pull the plug on loss - making divisions , and cut costs and jobs .
Carmakers and other manufacturers will no longer extend credit ( see article ) and loans will become elusive and expensive .
Consumers will suffer .
Unemployment will rise .
Even if the credit markets work well , the rich economies will slow as the asset - price bubble pops .
If credit is choked off , that slowdown could turn into a deep recession .
Financial markets need governments to set rules for them ; and when markets fail , governments are often best placed to get them going again .
That 's pragmatism , not socialism .
Helping bankers is not an end in itself .
If the government could save the credit markets without bailing out the bankers , it should do so .
But it cannot .
Main Street needs Wall Street ; and both need Washington .
Politicians — and President George Bush is the most culpable among them ( see article ) — have failed to explain this .
Governments need not just to communicate , but also to co-ordinate .
Past banking crises show that late , piecemeal rescues cost more and work less well .
Ad hoc mergers work for a while , but demands for help tend to recur .
Inconsistency sows uncertainty .
Cross - border banking can make one country 's policies awkward for the neighbours : the Irish government 's guarantee of all deposits threatens to suck in money from poorly protected British banks .
France 's suggestion on October 1st that Europe 's governments should work together was a good one ; Germany 's rejection of it was wrong .
Central banks have co-ordinated their liquidity operations .
Now that oil prices have plunged and worries about inflation are receding , interest - rate cuts are possible .
They would be more powerful if co-ordinated .
But it is not only central banks that need to combine .
Whatever America 's Congress does , governments should work together on principles to stabilise and recapitalise banks — not just to stem panic but also to save money .
Even if , as the Europeans claim , the crisis was made in America , it now belongs to everyone .
MSNBC just ran what we can only call an extraordinary interview with NBC News ’ Chuck Todd and Brian Williams .
They were discussing the interview NBC just did with John McCain and Sarah Palin .
We ’ll have the video shortly .
But what really stood out was the candidness of Todd ’s discussion of the wheels possibly coming off McCain ’s campaign , his willingness to discuss the tension between the two candidates and even to speculate that McCain may be starting to blame Palin for his campaign ’s collapse .
That ’s obviously speculation on Todd ’s part .
But …
Well , wait to see it yourself .
Motorola 's going upmarket with its latest phone Aura , a luxury model featuring what the company claims is the world 's first circular display on a mobile device .
The phone certainly has a ' Wow ' factor to it in terms of the quality of construction and the materials used .
The switch - blade design comes with an aluminum keypad , 2 megapixel camera , 2 GB memory , video capture and streaming capability and about 7.3 hours of talk time .
Its biggest selling point , though , is the circular LCD display , which is 16 million color and 300 dpi resolution .
The phone also has a 62 - carat sapphire crystal lens , which is among the most scratch - resistant materials , says Motorola .
" The hand - sculpted richness of Aura can literally be felt in its stainless steel housing , textures and patterns chemically etched into its surface , " says Motorola .
For once that may not be too much of an overstatement .
The front piece of the phone takes nearly two weeks to create , says the company .
" In that time , the stainless steel is sculpted , electro and hand polished , chemically etched and coated , " says Motorola .
All this luxury does n't come cheap .
At $ 2000 , the phone is super pricey and only available for pre-order through the Motorola online store .
The Aura is expected to be available worldwide in December but would you pay this much for a phone , especially in this economy ?
Are n't even the rich supposedly feeling the pain now ?

Critics of Barack Obama are throwing EVERYTHING at the wall right now , as polls show his lead holding steady with just over a week to go .
These down days do n't help McCain at all , in part because he 's tied to the current President , but also because every day where this story dominates the news is a day he can't slam Obama on Taxes , Bill Ayers , ACORN or whatever charge he and his supporters are trying to fling .
There 's another tactic though to try breaking through on days like this : tell voters that the market decline is related to Obama .
USNews ' James Pethokoukis spells out some of the arguments :
The decline HAS to be related to Obama , because investors could n't just be waking up to recession possibilities now , and so severely .
Obama would raise capital gains
Markets are freaking out not about Obama , per se , but Dems in control of Presidency and Congress .
Obama will raise taxes and we 'll see a repeat of 1929
The WSJ is the latest to pound on this drum just this morning : " Credit markets have started to thaw , yet stocks and the larger economy keep sliding .
What 's going on ?
Among the problems are the reality of recession and the uncertainty over Barack Obama 's policies . "
But would the market really feel better of McCain were leading in the polls .
He 's been scapegoating Wall Sreet throughout the campaign , and generally , he does n't seem to have much love for business .
And bey all accounts , Wall Street has turned on McCain , telling him they 're sick of his rhetoric .
In the end , we 'll go with our trusty Occam 's Razor .
We 've got AIG sucking billions of dollar into it , and a massive amount of uncertainty with the CDS market et. al .
Until we 've got more of a resolution on that stuff , it seems like we 've got plenty to explain the market crash .
Then again , we 're talking politics .
The time to talk rationally about the economic issues facing the country is after the election .

Less than 24 hours after the season premiere of Prison Break aired on Fox on Monday , it was downloaded close to one million times , according to TorrentFreak .
Prison Break fans did n't have to download the show illegally .
The show is readily available to stream legitimately on both Hulu and Fox.com , where viewers have to sit through a few commercial breaks , but they can still watch the entire episode legally .
[ Hulu wo n't disclose how many people viewed Prison Break on the site on Monday , but the show is one of the top 5 most - popular shows on
Hulu today , and it was the most - popular show yesterday .
There 's no way of knowing , though , whether the program was watched more on Hulu than it was downloaded illegally . ]
The fact that one million people downloaded the show within 24 hours – a little less than one - sixth of the 6.5 million people who watched Prison Break on TV on Monday night – proves , though , that P2P is n't going away just because there are legal alternatives now .
" This is a group of people who define themselves in part by the technology they use and the application of that technology , " says
Robert Rosenberg , president of Insight Research .
" Chances are that this is only happening in a defined age group .
You'd be hard - pressed to find 60 year - old guys passing this stuff off to their buddies . "
Even if file sharers make up a small slice of the population , the impact is not insignificant .
Could networks win these viewers back ?
The most common complaint about big media companies over the last decade is that they 've been slow to provide legal alternatives .
In this case , however , Fox has gone to great lengths to give viewers an option to watch programs legally online , but die - hard file sharers still are n't biting .
" I think a lot of the problem is that the content providers have typically been using business models that extend backwards in time .
They have not been able to adapt their intellectual property and business processes to the new reality – essentially that all types of information and media are going to find their way on to a network and will be widely distributed , " says Rosenberg .
" Look at the music industry .
They simply did n't have a formula for preventing file sharing until Apple taught them how to do it . "
Many legal alternatives could be improved , too , says Eric
Garland , CEO of Big Champagne , an online media measurement company .
Content providers have been slow to offer legal streaming options in many international markets , and there still are n't many networks that let users actually download files , which is a bummer for collectors , says Garland .
Also , the networks have n't necessarily improved upon the experience on pirated sites , so users do n't have much incentive to leave those sites .
" If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , " says Garland .
" Sites like
Mininova or Pirate Bay have been around long before there was Hulu , and why should they stop using a familiar option that works well ? "

NET Reflector has a special place in the pantheon of NET Development tools .
It was first written by Lutz Roeder when the .NET Framework was still in beta , and since then has developed alongside it .
So ubiquitous has it become that .
NET Developers use its ’ name as a verb , as in ‘ let ’s reflector it ’ .
What they mean is to browse and investigate the assemblies that comprise the code with a tool that is capable of showing what ’s there , and how classes , methods , or entire assemblies relate to each other , within the context of the application .
Why use .NET Reflector ?
NET Reflector gives you the means to inspect , analyze , and browse the contents of a .NET component , such as an assembly .
It will show you the metadata , IL instructions , resources and XML documentation .
This tool can disassemble the instructions into source code in a variety of .NET languages , and translates the other binary information into an intelligible form .
It does this through a process called ‘ reflection ’ , which retrieves information about the various classes , methods , and properties included in a particular assembly ( hence the name of the tool ) .
Most likely , you ’ll need .
NET Reflector to track down performance problems and bugs .
It is great for browsing classes , and maintaining , or becoming familiar with , code bases .
Some of its features include :
An Analyzer option , which can be used to find assembly dependencies , and even windows DLL dependencies .
A call tree and inheritance - browser , which will pick up documentation or comments , stored in the xml files that are used to drive Intellisense inside Visual Studio .
It will then display this information alongside the associated assemblies .
Ability to cross-navigate related documentation ( xmldoc ) , searching for specific types , members and references .
Ability to convert your source between languages , such as C# and VB !
All sorts of questions crop up during development that can be answered with .
NET Reflector :
What line of code is producing that error message ?
What uses a particular piece of code , and what code does it , in turn , use ?
How does a class , method , or entire assembly fit into your application ?
What are the differences between two versions of the same assembly ?
What features of the API of some legacy code can you use ?
How do the various parts of your system interact with each other ?
When you ’re working on a large team - based project , .NET Reflector is often the quickest way of getting a clear insight into how the application is working and where the bugs and weaknesses are .
There is a great difference between knowing the public interface of a module and actually seeing what the code does .
Once .NET
Reflector is combined with add -ins , it can become a tool to facilitate testing and make team - working more effective .
There have been many occasions when .NET Reflector has assisted in the recovery of source code after it has been lost .
What is in a .NET Assembly ?
Essentially , .NET
Reflector allows you to ‘ see ’ what is in a .NET assembly .
A .NET language compiler will produce binary CIL ( MSIL ) code , and any resources that are required , in a file called an ‘ assembly ’ .
The binary CIL code is written for a theoretical stack - based processor , to make it easy to run assemblies securely on different processors , in any environment supporting the .NET framework .
Then , a just - in - time ( JIT ) compiler will compile this abstracted , language - independent binary code , and optimise it into actual machine ‘ native ’ code for the target processor , and compile all the resources used .
The .NET Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) supplies at least one JIT compiler for every NET - supported computer architecture , so the same set of CIL can be JIT - compiled and run on different architectures .
The CIL includes instructions for loading , storing , initializing , and calling methods on objects , as well as instructions for arithmetic and logical operations , control flow , direct memory access , exception handling , and other operations .
It is designed to support polymorphism , inheritance , abstract types , and so on .
When a high level language , such as C# , compiles code , it converts it to CIL .
The process is reversible but because it is possible for two different high - level syntaxes to produce the same CIL , it may not be exactly the same as the original code .
As well as producing CIL , a .NET compiler will also produce metadata .
This will contain everything needed for runtime , sufficient for the code to describe itself during execution without needing type libraries or the Interface Definition Language ( IDL ) , and allowing JIT compilation , linking and introspection to work .
All the classes and class members that are defined in the assembly , as well as the external classes and class members called from the assembly , are described in the metadata , as are all the class methods .
This includes details of its parameters , the return type , and the assembly in which it belongs .
When the CLR executes CIL , it checks that the metadata of the called method matches that of the calling method .
This metadata is used by the process of reflection , and is read by ..NET Reflector .
As well as the metadata , the assembly will also contain any required resources such as attributes , custom attributes , images and strings , and will also contain security information .
You can browse this information from within reflector , as shown in Figure 1 :
The whole assembly is put in an extended version of the portable executable ( PE ) file , used for executables , object code , and DLLs , and which enables the operating system to recognize common language runtime images .
The PE file has only one import – mscoree.dll – which then loads the CLR Header and Data sections , and runs the assembly ’s just - in - time ( JIT ) compiler .
The PE header ’s data directory contains a .NET directory entry , which points to a new header in the file containing everything the operating system needs to run it .
. NET Reflector , ILASM and ILDASM
Microsoft supplies two tools for investigating assemblies :
ILASM , the Microsoft IL Assembler .
It will take an ASCIII assembly language source - code file , and produce binary IL ( MSIL ) code .
It adds in all the specified resources to create the assembly .
ILDASM , the .NET disassembler .
This is part of the .NET framework , and works the other way round .
It will produce an ‘ assembly ’ file from an IL file .
This assembly file is very much like a traditional Assembly source code file .
They are designed to be complementary , so that the output of one can go into the other to produce an identical file to the original .
The ILASM and ILDASM tools are useful , but not sufficient by themselves .
Unfortunately , ILDASM is best only with CLI assembly sections , whereas EXE files are in PE format , which ILDASM may not extract correctly .
The tool will show method signatures and member variables , but the code will be in .NET byte code .
To be able to extract everything you want from a NET assembly , in the language that was used originally to create the assembly , you will need .
NET Reflector .
This will also allow you to browse and inspect the other resources in the assembly , and even the XML documentation used by the IDE that created the assembly .
. NET Reflector , as we ’ve said , uses ‘ Reflection ’ to do its work .
Reflection is used to retrieve information about the various classes , methods , and properties included in a particular assembly .
Reflection has to determine the interface , structure , enumeration , or delegate of a type at runtime .
This process can be used to examine any .NET code , whether a single class or an entire assembly , and .NET Reflector uses this process to make sense of the contents of an assembly .
Reflector cannot view itself .
It needs to use reflection but , because .NET Reflector needs to work with all versions of the .NET Framework , it uses its own assembly loading infrastructure , which does not rely on the Reflection API .
This allows .
NET Reflector to load .
NET Framework 2.0 assemblies without having the .NET Framework 2.0 installed .
However , it also makes it difficult for anyone trying to explore how .
NET Reflector works !
Installing , Registering and Launching .NET Reflector
. NET Reflector was written by Lutz Roeder , and has evolved over the entire life of the .NET Framework .
It was first released in October 2000 running on .NET Framework 1.0 Beta .
It has been updated continuously to work with each new release of the framework and is now on Version 6 .
This current version supports query expressions and other concepts introduced in C# 3.5 but only if you select “ . NET 3.5 ” as the optimisation within the menu ( under View |Options | Disassembler | Optimization ) .
NET 4.0 is now supported but it does n’t yet decompile to C# 4.0 language features .
However , all the .NET 4 assemblies can be browsed .
The Open Cache dialog now shows you all the assemblies in .NET ’s Global Assembly Cache ( GAC ) .
Along the way , a number of additions have been made , on request , sometimes for very general requirements , but occasionally for supporting special uses , and the decompilation has been improved considerably .
Lutz provided licenses only to users who register their names and email addresses .
Registration was , and remains , free , but the software was never open - source or in the public domain .
Red Gate , will continue with this policy .
The application comes as a zipped package without an installer .
It consists of .NET Reflector , the configuration file , license file and readme file and the optional ‘ Reflector Pro ’ .
When the software first runs , it installs the Visual Studio Add- in that provides the facility to run Net Reflector within Visual Studio .
The user can , if he / she wants , purchase the additional functionality of debugging code in an assembly without you having to have the source code !
Reflector can be launched , unregistered , just by clicking on the file in Explorer .
However , there are many advantages to registering it with the Windows Shell .
You can register Reflector simply by issuing the following from the command line :
1 Reflector .
exe / register
Once Reflector is integrated into the Windows shell , you can simply right - click on any DLL to open and browse it using Reflector , as shown in figure 2 :
You can unregister Reflector by issuing :
1 Reflector .
exe / unregister
As discussed , once registered , you ’ll generally launch Reflector just by clicking on the file in Explorer .
However , if you are using reflector as a tool for several projects you may want to invoke it from the command line , using a particular configuration file ( more on this later ) for each project :
1 Reflector .
exe / configuration : < filename >
Or , to specify the assembly you wish to examine :
1 Reflector < assembly >
This syntax is used by the operating system to display assemblies on startup of .
NET Reflector once .
NET Reflector is registered .
A Quick Spin through .
NET Reflector
The following sections provide a simple example of the “ disassembling ” power of Reflector , followed by a brief tour of some of the useful features that are enabled once you register the tool with the operating system .
Disassembling Hello World
We can create the simplest possible program , and assemble it :
And , at the command - line , execute :
1 C : \ WINNT \ Microsoft .
NET \ Framework \ v2 . 0.50727 \ ilasm .
exe helloWorld .
il
Run the program :
1 HelloWorld .
exe
You can then do one of the following …
Drag and drop it into Reflector
Use ‘ File -> Open ’ in Reflector ( or Ctrl O )
Use the following URI ( from Notepad , for example ) :
code ://HelloWorld:1.0.0.1/< Module>/main ()
code ://HelloWorld:1.0.0.1/< Module>/main()
Pop the above URI in your browser ( if you ran Reflector . exe / register )
Run reflector from the command line
And this is what you ’d see …
Notice that the disassembly is not perfect , because some symbolic information is always lost in the original compilation .
Ever wondered how what the PowerShell ‘ Hello world ’ looks like ?
You can right - click any type or Assembly , or press Ctrl - R , to see what the class depends on , and what is exposed by , instantiated by , and assigned by the class .
Maintaining Assembly lists
When you launch Reflector for the first time , you can choose a default set of assemblies .
With .NET
Reflector , you can create the groups of assemblies that you are interested in , and open / browse them as a set .
The list of assemblies is stored in the Reflector configuration file , Reflector.cfg , and will be loaded next time you open the program .
Reflector allows you to create as many assembly lists as you want .
As discussed earlier , not only can you define and store an assembly set into a file , but you can also launch reflector .
exe with a particular assembly list file , via the command line .
Creating , selecting and deleting assembly lists in Reflector can be slightly confusing at first because it ’s not immediately obvious that the place to go to do it is the File | Open List dialog box .
You can create new lists from the box by clicking ‘ Add ’ to clone the current list .
You can also remove assembly lists from the same dialog box .
You can switch between assembly lists with the same dialog box , or from the command line .
To choose a different set of default assemblies for the current assembly list you should :
Remove all assemblies from the list , by selecting them and using the Delete key Invoke the Refresh command .
Add the assemblies to make up the set
This feature makes it easy to browse a variety of projects and frameworks , even if they have conflicting names
Sharing URIs
One of the great advantages of registering Reflector is that you can then , from within reflector , ‘ bookmark ’ any item within an assembly just by recording a custom URI for it ( i.e. putting the URI on the clipboard by pressing Ctrl - Alt - C ) .
Once a URI is clicked on , .NET Reflector displays the item .
The URI includes the version and hash value for the assembly .
The URI can be shared with fellow developers to provide a link to the item , since it only requires the other person to have Reflector and the same .dll / .exe to which you created a shortcut .
There is also a CodeShortcut add - in that allows you to save URIs on the desktop .
So , if you click on the following URI :
code://System.Xml:2.0.0.0:b77a5c561934e089/System.Xml.XmlConvert
You will see something similar to figure 7 :
Reflector Add-ins
A number of add-ins have been written for Reflector most , but not all , of which are open - source .
There are many different add -ins and it is best to get an up - to - date listing and description than to rely on an article like this that will soon get out - of - date .
An up - to - date listing is always kept at CodeProject :
http://www.codeplex.com/reflectoraddins
Some of the add-ins extend the language that Reflector disassembled to , such as PowerShell , Delphi , and MC ++.
Other add -ins will analyse assemblies in different ways , such as providing quality metrics , sequence diagrams , class diagrams , dependency structure matrices or dependency graphs .
It is possible to use add-ins to search text , save disassembled code to disk , export an assembly to XMI / UML , to do side - by - side comparisons of different versions of code , or to search code .
Add-ins are being added the whole time and include those that : allow the debugging of processes , Facilitate testing by creating stubs and wrappers and allow browsing assemblies in other .NET foundations , such as Silverlight , WWF , Biztalk , SQL Server , or windows Forms
There are also a range of utility add-ins , one of which allows .
NET Reflector to be used within Visual Studio , and another that allows you to save the URI shortcuts of an item onto the desktop .
Reflector Pro
The Reflector add - in for Visual Studio also includes .
NET Reflector Pro , which allows you to seamlessly debug into third - party code and assemblies using the visual studio debugger , even if you do n’t have source code for them .
You can now treat the decompiled assemblies much like your own code : you can step through the assemblies and use all the debugging techniques that you would use on your own code .
NET Reflector can decompile a whole assembly , and generate debug symbols for it .
From there , you can see the decompiled code in Visual Studio , and all the normal debugging features spring to life .
You can step in , set breakpoints , inspect and modify variables , and even use VS2010 ’s new IntelliTrace feature to time - travel through your debugging session .
This is instantly helpful when you are debugging a project for which you only have the source code for a part , as it allows you more freedom to check what is actually going on in other assemblies .
Conclusions
. NET Reflector has always been an essential tool for understanding NET assemblies .
There are many reasons for wanting to look at what is going on in an assembly .
Any developer will need to do so , even if it is just a tool to help with understanding performance issues .
With all the features that have been added over the years in response to requests by developers , and the add - in contributions , it has become a tool that it is impossible to be without when doing .NET software development .
We ’re very conscious that .NET Reflector is generally very easy to use , and in that sense does n’t need documentation , but some features , such as the use of URIs , are n’t intuitive !

Want to know how the current economic crisis is playing out in most people ’s lives right now ?
Well , for some , there is the disastrous loss of a home or a job , the need to move , increasing stress and the sense of crisis .
But for most of us , so far , instead of increased mobility , we have less .
Had you planned on moving ?
But the house wo n’t sell , so you are stuck .
Were you saving for a downpayment ?
But wait , you do n’t want to buy until the market bottoms out , right ?
Were you nearing retirement ?
But if your pension or 401K has tanked , you ca n’t retire .
Do you hate your job ?
But you need your seniority if you want to outlast any coming layoffs , and you ca n’t risk your benefits .
Were you thinking of going to college or back to school , or have you just graduated ?
Well , student loans are increasingly tough to get , and the job market is looking bad - back to Mom ’s we go .
The first effects of our tanking economy have been enormous pressures on most families and households to stay where they are - even if they might be better off somewhere else .
And the dual problem of increased and decreased mobility seems truly unlikely to do anything but accellerate - for the rising numbers of unemployed and those who lose their houses , the need will be to move somewhere , anywhere they can find work and housing .
For those lucky enough to keep their jobs and homes , the ability to move or change jobs is rapidly disappearing .
Now to some degree , and for some people , this may not be so very bad .
Those who would have liked to move for career reasons or for a bigger house , parents who might have downsized to a condo but now have room for the kids and grandkids to move back in may find themselves not so very discommoded .
For others , who dreamed of buying a farm , wish to be closer to aging parents or beloved family , those who invested in an area that may not be sustainable - this is a big and serious problem .
Being trapped is better than being unemployed , but it is n’t good .
So the question becomes - how do we get out of the trap ?
Is there any recourse for us now that credit and the old ways of getting things have dried up ?
And the answer is yes , but it will require a lot of something that most Americans do n’t have in their friends , neighbors and family - trust and cooperative energy .
What do I mean by that ?
Well , the truth is that you probably only need one 2000 square foot house between two 4 person households - so if you can trust each other enough , and find a way , you and your sister ( or your best friend or your neighbor ) who both have houses teetering on the edge of foreclosure can save one of those houses and move into it .
But that requires that one of you be willing to give up their home , that everyone sacrifice privacy , that the fears that the arrangement work out badly do n’t overwhelm the value of it .
What if you wanted to quit your job and start a business , building the local economy , but you ca n’t now ?
Or if you need to retrain ?
Well , one of the best possible tools for you might be the kind of collective funding that immigrant communities have brought to the US .
Everyone puts a certain amount of money into a kitty .
The money is loaned out to one of the members of the group , who is then required to repay it within a reasonable time .
Then , the money goes out to the next member .
This is scary stuff - someone might lose money , someone might fail and be unable to repay , everyone might get hurt a little by taking a risk .
On the other hand , everyone might gain , as well .
What if you were hoping to retire , and now you can’t , and it is increasingly hard for you to work ?
Well , do you have any friends in the same situation ?
Could you share housing , and make what ’s left of your retirement money go further ?
Could you let your grandkids or a your friend ’s daughter move in with you , in exchange for her keeping up minimal costs .
Perhaps you could take your new free time , and barter some childcare and your house for someone to take over earning most of the payments .
Maybe you can change your dream of what a retirement is - perhaps to owning outright a little house with another couple .
But this is much harder and scarier than relying primarily on your money to take care of you and help you out of trouble .
It is hard for the person who is aging , and it is hard for the younger family they will rely on .
In a crashing economy , family , community , friendship and social ties are what we have to compensate for a lack of money .
We turn to barter , to love , to friendship , to trust , to shared risk , to shared gain to make up what is missing in our lives .
We ’re stuck - but we get unstuck by risking ourselves with other people .
And sometimes , it wo n’t work .
Sometimes we ’ll lose , maybe even more than we can afford .
Odds are , however , mostly we wo n’t .
And if we do , the only thing we can do is remind ourselves that losing more than you can afford is n’t limited to direct human relations - it happens all the time in the industrial economy .

The U.S. economy is entering a recession .
With each day that passes and each indicator we see , that eventuality becomes more and more clear .
Even so , we can take some real comfort in knowing that we ’re likely going to avoid the “ bottomless pit ” of a Great Depression II .
A substantial recession with accompanying inflation – roughly along the lines of the downturns of 1974 and 1980 - 82 – seems the most likely scenario we face .
The last two U.S. recessions – the 1990 - 91 downturn touched off by Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent recession in 2001 – were both short and shallow , and perhaps even unnaturally so .
Gross domestic product ( GDP ) declined by about 1.5 % , peak - to - trough , in the first case , and a mere 0.5 % in the second .
In 1990 - 91 , the tax cuts and other structural changes made by President Ronald W. Reagan had increased the trend growth rate of the U.S. economy , so only the artificial drag of the savings - and - loan crisis brought a modest recession .
In 2001 , the U.S. Federal Reserve was expanding the money supply so rapidly , and dropping interest rates so far below the level of inflation , that what might have been a substantial downturn after the 1996 - 2000 stock market bubble was turned into renewed recovery led by the housing sector .
The Portrait of a Downturn
Thus , our experience of the last two decades , when recessions have been both shallow and short - lived , is not necessarily what we should expect going forward .
This time around , it is fairly clear the recession will be deeper than in 2001 , and perhaps even worse than its 1990 - 91 counterpart .
Retail sales were down 1.2 % in nominal terms in September and industrial production was down 2.6 % , while unemployment has already risen from 5 % to 6 % , with payrolls dropping more than 600,000 since the start of the year .
That suggests that an overall decline in output of considerably more than 1.0 % to 1.5 % is highly likely .
At the other extreme , and very thankfully indeed , we are highly unlikely to see The Great Depression – The Sequel .
Creating the first Great Depression required a horrific stock - market crash , followed by several major policy miscues .
Key among them :
A huge increase in tariffs ( The Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 ) at a time when world trade was already in a fragile state , and trade barriers were much higher than they had been before 1914 .
A 30 % decrease in the money supply caused by bank failures , which made prices drop 20 % , made real interest rates correspondingly high and was a major cause of real GDP dropping 25 % .
A major tax increase at the bottom of a deep recession , taking the top marginal rate of income tax from 25 % to 63 % .
This time around , we have already bailed out the banking system , are increasing the money supply at a rapid rate , and are fairly unlikely to enact a major tax increase in the trough of a recession .
And even if protectionism revives , we are unlikely to see a re-run of Smoot - Hawley ( in any case , world trade remains very robust , indeed ) .
All these differences are protections against Great Depression II , and they should be sufficient .
That ’s not to say we are n’t still looking at a nasty inflation problem , which is a separate question .
It ’s High , It ’s Deep – and It ’s Gone
To figure out how deep the recession might be , look at a few factors in the U.S. economy that have changed or need to change .
The housing decline has wiped out about $ 5 trillion of the nation ’s wealth , and the stock market fall has eradicated an additional $ 8 trillion ; taking a reasonably pessimistic view of both would suggest a total eventual wealth wipeout of about $ 20 trillion .
Past studies have suggested that there is a “ negative wealth effect ” in a market crash , with an annual consumption decline equal to about 3 % to 4 % of the wealth wiped out :
In other words , for each $ 100 a consumer loses , they will reduce their outlays by $ 3 to $ 4 .
That translates into a consumption drop of about $ 600 billion to $ 800 billion , which equates to about 4 % to 5 % of our current GDP .
To look at this another way , the U.S. payments deficit is now around $ 750 billion per annum , or 5 % of GDP , and will need to be eliminated – or nearly so – since foreigners wo n’t want to go on pouring that amount of money into the U.S. market .
That also suggests a re-balancing of U.S. trade by about 5 % of GDP .
This rebalancing will probably come partly from decreased consumption , which itself will reduce imports , and partly from a decline in the value of the dollar , which will increase exports .
Finally , the abysmal U.S. savings rate is currently around zero , or maybe 1 % of GDP , and has historically been around 5 % to 6 % of GDP .
This also suggests a switch from consumption into saving of about 5 % of GDP , although that ’s realistically probably a very long - term change .
Those factors all tend to suggest a GDP decline of around 4 % to 5 % , top to bottom .
That would be a little more than the recession of 1974 , or the “ double - dip ” recession of 1980 - 82 – each of which equated to about 3.5 % of GDP .
However , as occurred in 1980 - 82 , the anticipated decline is unlikely to happen in one leg , but will probably take a “ double - dip ” form .
That ’s because interest rates are currently very low , far below the rate of inflation .
Hence , inflation will probably accelerate , alleviating the housing problem ( because incomes will rise approximately in line with prices , making housing more affordable ) .
Once home prices have bottomed out , and the housing market has stabilized , banks will resume lending more aggressively and the economy will move into a full - fledged recovery mode .
Where Are You Paul Volcker ?
At that point , since interest rates will have been far below inflation for several years , inflation will have accelerated , and will be accelerating harder .
Hence , a change in U.S. Federal Reserve policy will be needed – probably one that pushes short - term interest rates far above the rate of inflation , as then - Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker did from 1979 to 1982 , a painful - but - effective assault on inflation , that sent pricing pressures packing for two decades .
That will inevitably cause a second “ dip ” in the economy , but by this stage the housing and financial sectors will have stabilized , and the second “ dip ” will be focused on corporate profits and the “ real ” economy .
Profits ’ share of GDP , which has been at an all - time high recently , will decline to more normal levels .
That is an unpleasant picture .
It is bad news for stock prices and it may take five years to work through , albeit with a likely mild “ bounce ” in the middle .
But it could have been much worse .
It ’s nowhere near as bad as the nightmarish Great Depression , or the long , drawn - out and relentless rolling Japanese recession of 1990 to 2003 , which led to that country ’s “ Lost Decade . ”
And for that we must be grateful .

McCain struggles to keep afloat in Bush states Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 25 , 2008
Print This Email This RENO , Nevada ( AFP )  Barack Obama and John McCain will fight a weekend duel over states won in 2004 by President George W. Bush , a sure sign of the Democrat 's edge heading into the last week of the White House race .
A heavy - hearted Obama arrived back on the US mainland in the early hours of Saturday after an emotional trip to Hawaii to visit the gravely ill grandmother who brought him up , possibly for the last time .
Madelyn Dunham , 85 , is suffering from a broken hip , osteoporosis and other undisclosed ailments .
She is the last elderly relative Obama , 47 , has left , after his mother died of cancer more than a decade ago and he has said she might not live the 10 days until the election .
Obama is due to campaign Saturday in Nevada and New Mexico -- two swing states where polls show he has an advantage -- before heading on to Colorado on Sunday .
McCain , 72 , was trying to shore up support in what is normally Republican territory , as polls show he needs a last minute boost in several swing states for any chance of pulling off a come - from - behind victory on November 4 .
McCain is scheduled to campaign all day Saturday in New Mexico , then fly to the midwestern state of Iowa , where he trails Obama badly in the polls .
McCain trails in most New Mexico polls , where five electoral college votes are in play .
In the last two elections the state has been won by a razor - thin margin , with Bush defeating Democrat John Kerry by 0.7 percent in 2004 .
However , the most recent New Mexico polls show McCain trailing Obama by an average of 8.4 percent , with one survey putting the Democratic candidate 's lead in double digits .
The McCain campaign however is refusing to cede defeat , confident that McCain 's familiarity in the region as a longtime Arizona senator will help him attrack votes .
" John McCain has been a 30 - year United States Senator from Arizona , a border state senator , he understands the issues that are at play there , he understands natural resource policy which is very important there , " campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds told MSNBC on Saturday .
For days McCain has tried to tar the Democratic presidential hopeful as a secret socialist .
Obama " believes in redistributing wealth , not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs , " McCain told a rally Friday in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
Obama " may say he 's trying to soak the rich , but it 's the middle class who are going to get put through the wringer , because a lot of his promised tax increase misses the target . "
At issue is Obama 's plan to let temporary tax cuts expire for the top five percent of Americans in order to give tax breaks to everyone else .
McCain said raising taxes in a bad economy will " kill jobs , " and warned that Democrats have already previewed their plans to " tax and spend . "
Obama 's campaign quickly snapped back .
" Senator McCain can continue to make these desperate and dishonest attacks , but the fact is that Senator Obama will cut taxes for 95 percent of working Americans while John McCain gives no relief at all to more than 100 million Americans , " Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said in a statement .
National tracking polls have Obama up anywhere from four to 14 percentage points , with a solid lead in most battleground states -- though McCain had made slight gains .
NBC News reported that Obama was now leading in enough states to put him over the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency .
The closely watched NBC estimate had the battleground states of Virginia and Colorado now leaning to Obama based on the latest surveys .

To me the ONLY question that needs answering is WHEN this election IS stolen just what the hell are we going to do about it ?
If the answer is small protest here and there and maybe a legal challenge after it is already too late then do n't waste your time just accept the fact that we now live in a full blown fascist police state that is headed into a massive depression , forget about ever voting again , just do away with voting all together stop pretending it exist and accept the fact we are ruled by Christofascist lunatics and this country no longer exist .
Just what are YOU going to do ?

Cincinnati's wingnut Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters ( who BTW has a nasty little money - grubbing scandal in his past AND is McCain 's SW Ohio campaign chair ) has subpoenaed voter records .
Let me rephrase that : John McCain 's Southwest Ohio Campaign Chairman has subpoenaed voter records .
Could n't help but think this morning when I saw that was that in 2006 Ohio elected an aggressive AG ... who lost that job in a S - E - X scandal earlier this year ...
The shitstorm that was unleashed on him was so over the top that even democrats were lining up to take a swing - never mind signs of a set up - and forced him out faster than you can say Elliot Spitzer .
At the time I was thinking , who'd he piss off ?
Wondering if that was n't a little short - sighted ...

Hmmm ... just brainstorming here ...
What about an official coupon with a bar code mailed to each registered voter that the voter hands in when they show up to vote .
One per voter , mailed out by the state to all registered voters .
No ticket , no vote .
If you did n't get your coupon by October 15 , you show up with your official stamped copy of your registration form ( that will be provided to all voters when they register , or they can request an official stamped copy or print - out from their Elections Directer ) and that is the only verification needed .
Would that stop some of this criminal monkey business and not be too cumbersome ?

Probably many or most all of these data base errors have originated with the voter registration office itself rather than being the fault of the voter registrant .
I am a deputized registrar in Hawaii .
When I was helping to register voters several weeks ago , I encountered a voter who wanted to fill out the voter registration form simply to try to correct for the umpteenth time an error the Registrar had in the spelling of that voter 's family name .
Repeated attempts to get it corrected by sending in the Registrar 's yellow change of address card failed to get the error corrected .
The voter , however , did not complain of being prevented from voting in the past , despite the error .
Fortunately , Hawaii is no Ohio .

We definitely need reform ... eligible citizens should not have to go through the gauntlet to vote !
Some of our eligible voters may be homeless or have moved and that should be taken into account too .
AND of course , GET RID OF MACHINES !
Educate people , the more that know of the danger of voting machines , can contact their congressmen to change election laws and do as our Canadian neighbors do .. paper ballots , pencil , and both parties oversight of counters .
They have the results of the election by midnight .
Oversight can be selected like jurors .

The Mars Science Laboratory , a souped - up Mars rover scheduled to launch next year might be delayed , scaled down or canceled due to technical problems and cost overruns .
The nuclear powered rover designed to search for microbial life on the Red Planet , has already cost $ 1.5 billion and if it reaches a 30 - percent cost overrun , it could be cancelled by Congress .
Aviation
Week reports that officials from the agency ’s Mars Exploration Program ( MEP ) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) will brief NASA Administrator Mike Griffin and Science Associate Administrator Ed Weiler this Friday and attempt to work out a potential solution .
Delaying the rover ’s mission until 2011 would be costly , but Weiler has said that JPL is so stretched trying to make the 2009 launch window that the result could be “ a nuclear crater on Mars . ”
Nearly the size of a small car , the proposed MSL will be three times as heavy and twice the width of the Mars Exploration Rovers ( MERs ) that landed in 2004 , and will be able to travel twice as far .
It will carry ten advanced scientific instruments and cameras .
It will make the first precise landing and a predetermined site , using a guided entry system and a soft - landing system called the Sky Crane .
But assembly and testing of critical components and instruments are behind schedule because of technical problems .
Since there ’s not much extra cash anywhere in NASA and JPL ’s pot , any cost overruns from technical issues or delays would have to be taken from other missions .
To keep MSL , NASA could be forced to cancel the $ 485 million 2013 atmospheric Scout mission MAVEN that was recently announced , or a future rover mission tentatively set for 2016 .
A slip to the 2011 launch window will add another $ 300 million - $ 400 million to the price tag , but it could be better than trying to launch in 2009 with a rover and team that is potentially unready to fly .
Doug McCuistion , the MEP manager said his program is stretched to its limits , with no funding for technology development and “ next to nothing ” for education and public outreach .
NASA has been sending a mission to Mars approximately every two years to determine if the planet ever was capable of supporting life .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - The Bank of Canada unexpectedly cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.50 percent on Wednesday in a coordinated effort with other central banks to help calm ailing financial markets .
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney leaves his office for a news conference upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report in Ottawa July 17 , 2008 .

In a statement that left the door open to further rate cuts , the bank said the intensification of the global financial crisis was impacting all countries and that conditions in global financial markets have worsened considerably .
“ In recent weeks conditions in global financial markets have deteriorated sharply , the U.S. economy has weakened further , and commodity prices have fallen abruptly , ” the Bank of Canada said in a statement .
“ As a result of these developments , credit conditions in Canada have tightened significantly , despite the relative health of our financial institutions . ”
The decision to lower its key rate ahead of its scheduled interest rate announcement on October 21 came along with rate cuts from central banks across the world , including the U.S. Federal Reserve , European Central Bank and Bank of England .
China also lowered benchmark rates .
The Bank of Canada said weaker growth in the United States and other key trading partners will increase the drag on the domestic economy coming from net exports .
It also said the recent easing of the Canadian dollar will help cushion the effects of the weaker global outlook on the domestic economy but will not completely offset them .
The rate cut , which marks the bank ’s biggest interest rate cut since back - to - back 50 - basis - points cuts in March and April , marks the first time since September 2001 that the Bank of Canada has moved on interest rates outside of its fixed announcement dates , which were implemented in 2000 .
The Bank of Canada also said it will continue to monitor economic and financial developments , along with the evolution of risks , to judge whether further action may be required to achieve its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term .
The coordinated central bank action follows several weeks of carnage on financial markets around the globe , including massive losses on stock markets in the past week .
“ I think the central banks will be watching to see if this does anything to stabilize confidence and improve the money markets , ” said Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets .
“ If not , I think they are probably going to be willing to cut again if needed . ”
The Canadian dollar rose immediately after the bank ’s rate announcement , climbing as high as C$ 1.0997 to the U.S. dollar , or 90.93 U.S. cents , from C$ 1.1110 to the U.S. dollar , or 90.01 U.S. cents .
The Bank of Canada said its decision to cut rates will provide “ timely and significant support ” to the Canadian economy but that it will continue to assess whether more rate cuts would be required .
Some market experts felt the latest easing may be enough .
“ Given our growth outlook that things will improve as we go forward we do n’t think there ’s any need for further ease depending on how well this is received , ” said Craig Wright , chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada .
“ One hopes this is well received given that most central banks are on the same page . ”

Some news audiences are more politically savvy than others , according to a new poll , with readers of The New Yorker and similar high - brow magazines being the most knowledgeable .
The survey , conducted between April 30 and June 1 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , measured the political knowledge of 3,612 U.S. adults .
Participants were asked to name the controlling party of the U.S. House of Representatives , the U.S. secretary of state and Great Britain 's prime minister .
Overall , just 18 percent of participants answered all three questions correctly .
More than 50 percent of Americans knew that the Democrats have a majority in the House , while 42 percent could identify the secretary of state ( Condoleezza Rice ) .
Less than 30 percent could name the prime minister of Great Britain ( Gordon Brown ) .
Perfect scores
The best - informed news audiences crossed the ideological spectrum .
Nearly half of regular readers of The New Yorker , The Atlantic and Harper 's Magazine answered all three political knowledge questions correctly .
A perfect score was obtained by 44 percent of regular listeners of National Public Radio ( NPR ) , 43 percent of regular viewers of MSNBC's " Hardball with Chris Matthews " and 42 percent of the Fox News Channel 's " Hannity & Colmes " audience .
Thirty - four percent of " The Colbert Report " audience and 30 percent of " The Daily Show " audience got all three questions correct .
While most news audiences knew that Democrats have a majority in the House , participants struggled to correctly name the current British prime minister .
Just four news audiences had a majority who correctly identified Brown , including regular readers of The New Yorker and similar magazines such as The Atlantic , regular NPR listeners , regular readers of political magazines , such as The Weekly Standard and The New Republic , and regular viewers of " Hardball . "
Just 44 percent of BBC viewers identified the prime minister correctly .
Here 's a detailed breakdown of the percentage of individuals answering each of the three questions correctly from the different news audiences :
The New Yorker / Atlantic : 71 percent ( correctly identified Democrats as the majority in the House ) , 71 percent ( correctly identified Condoleezza Rice ) , 59 percent ( correctly identified Gordon Brown )
NPR : 73 percent , 72 percent , 57percent
Hannity & Colmes : 84 percent , 73 percent , 49 percent
Rush Limbaugh : 83 percent , 71 percent , 41 percent
Colbert Report : 73 percent , 65 percent , 49 percent
Daily Show : 65 percent , 48 percent , 36 percent
NewsHour : 66 percent , 52 percent , 47 percent
O'Reilly Factor : 70 percent , 60 percent , 41 percent
C- SPAN : 63 percent , 59 percent , 35 percent
Letterman / Leno : 51 percent , 42 percent , 31 percent
CNN : 59 percent , 48 percent , 29 percent
National Enquirer : 44 percent , 32 percent , 22 percent
Education factor
In general , well - educated news audiences scored high on political knowledge .
For instance , 54 percent of the regular readers of publications such as The New Yorker , The Atlantic and Harper 's Magazine are college graduates , as are 54 percent of regular NPR listeners .
However , several news audiences with relatively low proportions of college graduates also scored well on the news quiz .
Just 31 percent of regular " Hannity & Colmes " viewers are college graduates .
Even still , 42 percent Hannity viewers got perfect scores on the political knowledge quiz , compared with 44 percent of NPR listeners .
Nearly 40 percent of the regular audience of the news parody " The Colbert Report " are college graduates , compared with 30 percent of " The Daily Show " viewers .
Both shows have younger audiences than other TV news sources , with less than a quarter of Colbert and Daily Show viewers over the age of 50 , compared with more than half of " Hardball " and " Hannity & Colmes " viewers being 50 and older .
DHAKA ( Reuters Life ! ) - Mohammad Raju ran away from his poor family in Bangladesh ’s southern Khulna district eight years ago , hoping for a better life in the capital , Dhaka .
Bangladeshi street children who have a valid source of income deposit money at the Children 's Development Bank in Dhaka April 9 , 2008 .
The bank , which is a Bangladesh - based lender that is owned by non-government organisation Aparajeyo - Bangladesh , is managed by street children .

Instead , his life got worse .
His tiny income from selling chocolates in the sprawling parliament compound in Dhaka left him hungry and homeless .
“ I used to earn up to 20 taka ( $ 0.30 ) in a day which was in no way enough to survive .
Sometimes policemen , who were on duty at the parliament compound , gave me their spare food .
Still I spent many days with little or no food , ” Raju told Reuters .
Raju ’s life changed after he discovered an unlikely profession for a street child : banking .
The 16 - year - old boy started working for the Children ’s Development Bank , a Bangladesh - based lender that is owned by a non-government organization and managed by street children .
He now earns 2,000 taka ( $ 30 ) a month and can save a portion of his income .
His workplace looks like any other Bangladesh bank , with counters and a cash and ledger book -- except for the fact that the bank clerks are unusually young .
Raju has been promoted to the post of program assistant at the bank and is now a paid employee , working under an adult supervisor .
But most of the children who work here are volunteers wanting to learn new skills and contribute to a system that allows them to save money and earn some interest on their savings .
Others simply deposit their money at the bank , which is open two hours a day , without becoming involved as volunteers .
NO PICK - POCKETS
“ Often they spoil the money earned through hard labor by taking drugs or watching movies .
Our bank keeps it safe for their future , ” said Basudeb Maitra , coordinator of the Children ’s Development Bank .
“ Street children who have a valid source of income and are not involved in pick - pocketing , begging , drug - selling , pilfering can bank with us , ” said Maitra .
Aparajeyo - Bangladesh , the organization that owns the bank , has received a tremendous response from working children aged 9 to 18 since opening the institution in late 2004 .
If the volunteers prove to be good at banking , the organization offers them vocational training .
“ They can open an account with Taka 10 ( $ 0.15 ) and can deposit the money whenever they wish , ” said Maitra , adding that bank now has 2,074 depositors in 11 branches in Dhaka and the port city Chittagong .
“ Since it is not a business at all , we deposited the entire money collected from the children , which is around taka 450,000 ( $ 65,600 ) , in a commercial bank . ”
“ Butterflies ” , an Indian organization , pioneered the concept of a bank for children , which has now been adopted by some other organizations in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Sri Lanka , Nepal and Bangladesh , officials said .
A recent survey by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies showed that nearly 445,000 children sleep on the street in Bangladesh , and 75 per cent of them live in Dhaka .
Many of these children work as porters , rag pickers , cart pushers or shoe shiners .
They help in shops and restaurants and on buses , and sell anything from newspapers to snacks .
Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) arrives at the U.S. District Court in Washington on October 20 , 2008 , where his trial on corruption charges moves into its closing stages .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 20 ( UPI ) --
The judge in the trial of U.S. Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , sent the jury home for the day Monday after the senator finished his testimony .
Monday was the senator 's third day in court of defending himself against charges he did n't reveal more than $ 250,000 in gifts and home renovations on Senate disclosure forms .

Defense and prosecutors said they had no more witnesses after Stevens , the longest - serving Republican in the Senate , and District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan scheduled closing arguments for Tuesday , Roll Call reported .
Federal prosecutor Brenda Morris sought to shake Stevens 's testimony that he was unaware of all the costs associated with the renovation of his home near Anchorage , Alaska , The Hill reported .
Stevens 's defense team says the 84 - year - old Republican believed all of the bills related to the renovation had been paid and that his wife , Catherine , took the lead in the project .
Stevens sought a speedy trial after his indictment this summer , saying he wanted the trial to be decided before the general election Nov. 4 .
He is seeking his seventh full term .
Islamic sharia courts in Britain are now ' legally binding '
Islamic sharia law courts in Britain are exploiting a little - known legal clause to make their verdicts officially binding under UK law in cases including divorce , financial disputes and even domestic violence .
A new network of courts in five major cities is hearing cases where Muslims involved agree to be bound by traditional sharia law , and under the 1996 Arbitration
Act the court 's decisions can then be enforced by the county courts or the High Court .
Officials behind the new system claim to have dealt with more than 100 cases since last summer , including six involving domestic violence which is a criminal rather than civil offence , and said they hoped to take over growing numbers of ' smaller ' criminal cases in future .
Women are likely to suffer more if sharia law , which does treat women equally to men , becomes an accepted legal avenue
The revelations sparked uproar yesterday , with warnings that the fundamental principle of equal treatment for all - the bedrock of British justice - was being gravely undermined .
Critics fear Britain's Islamic hard - liners will now try to make sharia law the dominant legal system in Muslim neighbourhoods , and warn that women often receive less favourable treatment at the hands of the traditional Islamic courts .
The Archbishop of Canterbury sparked controversy when suggesting recognition of sharia seemed ' unavoidable '
The issue erupted into a major controversy earlier this year after the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams claimed publicly that formal recognition of sharia law ' seemed unavoidable ' , and Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips gave his backing to the use of Islamic courts to deal with family , marital and financial disputes .
Sharia courts have operated unofficially for years among Britain 's Muslim communities but until now their rulings could not be enforced , relying instead on parties agreeing voluntarily .
The Muslim Arbitration Tribunal panels , set up by lawyer Sheikh Faiz - ul - Aqtab Siddiqi , are now operating in London , Bradford , Manchester , Birmingham and Nuneaton , with more planned for Glasgow and Edinburgh .
Mr Siddiqi said : ' We realised that under the Arbitration Act we can make rulings which can be enforced by county and High Courts .
' The Act allows disputes to be resolved using alternatives like tribunals .
This method is called alternative dispute resolution , which for Muslims is what the sharia courts are .'
Cases handled by the courts so far include Muslim divorce and inheritance to nuisance neighbours , he said .
But as well as civil disputes they have also handled six cases of domestic violence .
In all six cases , he said , sharia judges ordered husbands to take anger management classes and mentoring from community elders , but issued no further punishment .
All the women subsequently withdrew their complaints to the police , who halted investigations .
Mr Siddiqi claimed the advantage was that marriages were saved and couples given a second chance .
But critics fear Muslim women victims will be pressured into accepting a sharia court settlement , and husbands will escape with lighter punishments than in a mainstream criminal court .
In one recent inheritance dispute in Nuneaton , a Muslim man 's estate was spit was between three daughters and two sons with each son receiving twice as much as each daughter - in keeping with sharia law .
In a mainstream court all siblings would have been treated equally .
Douglas Murray , the director of the Centre for Social Cohesion , condemned the latest development as ' appalling . '
' I do n’t think arbitration that is done by sharia should ever be endorsed or enforced by the British state . '
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' These tribunals have no place in passing binding decisions in divorce or criminal justice hearings .
' Far from handling more criminal cases .
They should be handling none at all .
' British law is absolute and must remain so . '
Muslim groups pointed out that Jewish Beth Din courts have handled civil legal cases for more than 100 years in Britain on a similar basis , and now operate under the 1996 Arbitration Act .
Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain , said : ' We support these tribunals .
If the Jewish courts are allowed to flourish , so must the sharia ones . '
The Ministry of Justice said : ' Sharia law is not part of the law of England and Wales , and the Government has no intention of making any change that would conflict with British laws and values .
' In all arbitrations , decisions will be enforceable by the English courts if the requirements of the 1996 Arbitration Act are satisfied .
If any decisions by these Tribunals were illegal or contrary to public policy under English law , they would not be enforceable . '
A recent survey by the Centre for Social Cohesion found 40 per cent of Britain 's Muslim students want the introduction of sharia law in the UK , while 33 per cent want a worldwide Islamic sharia - based government .

What is the State ?
The state refers to the legislature - parliamentary control - an the familiar state organs - the courts , the army , police , and the wide of administrative services .
Also included in the state is public education , policy - making organisations and such state organs that control the economy , such as the national banks .
According to Karl Marx , it is the " centralised State power , with its ubiquitous organs of standing army , police , bureaucracy , clergy , and judicature ...[ and ] parliamentary control .. the national power of capital over labour , a public forced organised for social enslavement " .
Peter Kropotkin claims , " The State .. includes the existence of a power situated above society , but also of a territorial concentration as well as the concentration in the hands of a few of many functions in the life of societies ..
A whole mechanism of legislation and of policing has to be developed in order to subject some classes to the domination of others " .
The power vested in it , places the state above and alienated from society , serving the interests of the upper class .
It is a structured hierarchy objectively at the service of the top layer of the bourgeoisie or upper class .
The state therefore serves two purposes .
One as it's role as an coercive and repressive institution .
Which , the police and military being the forefront of those operations .
The other role is the organising of bourgeois democracy : through the combination of certain institutions , laws and policies .
As a capitalist state , the state functions to repress worker 's power and pursue interests of the upper class and maintain social harmony .
As a racist state , the state functions to repress black power , black organisation and movements which can cause social upheaval to the detriment of the power elite , which is for the most part white male .
The state of black America , therefore ironically , is due to 400 year old battle ... The State vs Black America .
Legislature , Judiciary and the Prison Industrial Complex
Blacks represent 13 percent of the population , but comprised 35 percent of drug arrests , 55 percent of drug convictions , 74 percent of drug prisoners and 50 percent of those waiting on death row .
Prosecutors sought the death penalty 70 percent of the time when an African American killed a White person , but only 19 percent of the time when it was reversed .
Another telling statistic is the fact that blacks constitute 13 percent of the population , but were 67 percent of the juveniles in adult courts and 77 percent of the juveniles in adult prisons .
In the Jena 6 case , Mychal Bell was originally charged with attempted murder , which was later brought down to aggravated second degree battery , with the " dangerous weapon " used in the attack was argued to be his shoes .
After legal manoeuvring , rallies , appeals to have him free on bail , Bell was subsequently sent back to juvenile detention for " violating his probation " .
Under the infamous Rockefeller Drug Laws it was a 5 - year minimum sentence for possessing 500g of powdered cocaine , while the amount of crack needed for a five year sentence is only five grams , a 100:1 ratio .
Being that crack cocaine was a cheaper drug to produce and buy , it was popular in the urban ghetto .
Which in turn caused Blacks to represent 84 percent of crack cocaine convictions , causing further harm towards the state of Black America .
The Police and Military
The fact that Blacks comprised 17 percent of drivers on the state of Maryland highway , but 70 percent of drivers stopped by police is a powerful example of racial profiling and repressive tactics utilised by the Police on Black America , and Black males in particular .
Police brutality , is a term used to describe the excessive use of physical force , assault , verbal attacks , and threats by police officers and other law enforcement officers , and is a term well understood in Black America .
There exist numerous documented cases of the police 's function as a coercive and repressive institution through the usage of police brutality .
On Halloween ( 2007 ) Rayshawn Moreno and other teens hit an unmarked police car with an egg .
The Officer grabbed Rashaywn Moreno into the cop car , where he was taken to a secluded , remote area , stripped of his clothes , beaten by the officers and left for dead .
While , Sean Bell died in a hail of 50 bullets fired by undercover police officers after hitting an unmarked police car .
Likewise , Amadou Diallo , died from the 19 of 41 bullets fired at him because cops mistook his wallet for a gun .
In March 1991 , Rodney King was brutalised by 3 cops as 23 other officers watched as he was beaten with batons and shocked with stun guns .
Police brutality , in some cases , especially in regards to the urban riots of the 60's , have had to rely on the coercive and repressive functions of the military to quell social upheaval .
For example , a patrolman 's ' attack on Marquetet Frye in Los Angeles led to the Watts Riots .
The conflict resulted not only in 34 deaths and $ 40 million in damage , but also the National Guard being called to control the riots .
Conclusion
This was just a brief example of how a few apparatuses of the state are used in a coercive and repressive way against Black America .
It highlighted , legislation specifically targeting black men in the urban ghetto , in the form of Rockefeller Drug Laws .
Which resulted in a explosion of inmate population and added to the disproportionate number of African Americans incarcerated .
It showed many cases of recent police brutality and harassment centered in the Black Community , which has a psychological effect on it's residents .
It also , showed how when the police cannot contain urban unrest , the military ( our troops ? ) are ready to contain the rebellions .
There are many other state organs , such as policy forming organizations , that play a role in the repression of rights of Black America and it's continual exploitation .
More also can be said of public education and it's role of perpetuating the cycle of violence in poverty in the black community .
For example , 40 percent of African American males are illiterate and research indicates that illiteracy is the biggest predictor of crime , 90 percent of African - American male inmates are illiterate .
All in all , the evidence makes a compelling case that the state is not only against workers , but disproportionately against blacks more so than whites .
Thereby , drastically affecting the state of black america in the realms of politics , social , and economics .
Comment by our Legal Correspondent :
This article has been published following the recent brutal attack by Police during the arrest of a Ghanaian youth resident in Italy .
Police brutality and harassment of the black community has a psychological effect on us .
Some of our youth are so angry about the blatant discrimination , racism and disproportionate force used by Law Enforcement Agencies .
The police should treat everyone with dignity , courtesy and respect , regardless of their race , gender , religion , age or disability .

Make a solar cell in your kitchen
We found this article on http://www.scitoys.com/scitoys/scitoys/echem/echem2.html
It was super , super , super cool , so we thank them for allowing us to post it at TheSolarPlan.com !
This is nifty !
A solar cell is a device for converting energy from the sun into electricity .
The high - efficiency solar cells you can buy at Radio Shack and other stores are made from highly processed silicon , and require huge factories , high temperatures , vacuum equipment , and lots of money .
If we are willing to sacrifice efficiency for the ability to make our own solar cells in the kitchen out of materials from the neighborhood hardware store , we can demonstrate a working solar cell in about an hour .
Our solar cell is made from cuprous oxide instead of silicon .
Cuprous oxide is one of the first materials known to display the photoelectric effect , in which light causes electricity to flow in a material .
Thinking about how to explain the photoelectric effect is what led Albert Einstein to the Nobel prize for physics , and to the theory of relativity .
Materials you will need
The solar cell is made from these materials :
A sheet of copper flashing from the hardware store .
This normally costs about $ 5.00 per square foot .
We will need about half a square foot .
Two alligator clip leads .
A sensitive micro-ammeter that can read currents between 10 and 50 microamperes .
Radio
Shack sells small LCD multimeters that will do , but I used a small surplus meter with a needle .
An electric stove .
My kitchen stove is gas , so I bought a small one - burner electric hotplate for about $ 25 .
The little 700 watt burners probably wo n't work -- mine is 1100 watts , so the burner gets red hot .
A large clear plastic bottle off of which you can cut the top .
I used a 2 liter spring water bottle .
A large mouth glass jar will also work .
Table salt .
We will want a couple tablespoons of salt .
Tap water .
Sand paper or a wire brush on an electric drill .
Sheet metal shears for cutting the copper sheet .
How to build the solar cell
My burner looks like this :
The first step is to cut a piece of the copper sheeting that is about the size of the burner on the stove .
Wash your hands so they do n't have any grease or oil on them .
Then wash the copper sheet with soap or cleanser to get any oil or grease off of it .
Use the sandpaper or wire brush to thoroughly clean the copper sheeting , so that any sulphide or other light corrosion is removed .
Next , place the cleaned and dried copper sheet on the burner and turn the burner to its highest setting .
As the copper starts to heat up , you will see beautiful oxidation patterns begin to form .
Oranges , purples , and reds will cover the copper .
As the copper gets hotter , the colors are replaced with a black coating of cupric oxide .
This is not the oxide we want , but it will flake off later , showing the reds , oranges , pinks , and purples of the cuprous oxide layer underneath .
The last bits of color disappear as the burner starts to glow red .
When the burner is glowing red -hot , the sheet of copper will be coated with a black cupric oxide coat .
Let it cook for a half an hour , so the black coating will be thick .
This is important , since a thick coating will flake off nicely , while a thin coat will stay stuck to the copper .
After the half hour of cooking , turn off the burner .
Leave the hot copper on the burner to cool slowly .
If you cool it too quickly , the black oxide will stay stuck to the copper .
As the copper cools , it shrinks .
The black cupric oxide also shrinks .
But they shrink at different rates , which makes the black cupric oxide flake off .
The little black flakes pop off the copper with enough force to make them fly a few inches .
This means a little more cleaning effort around the stove , but it is fun to watch .
When the copper has cooled to room temperature ( this takes about 20 minutes ) , most of the black oxide will be gone .
A light scrubbing with your hands under running water will remove most of the small bits .
Resist the temptation to remove all of the black spots by hard scrubbing or by flexing the soft copper .
This might damage the delicate red cuprous oxide layer we need to make to solar cell work .
The rest of the assembly is very simple and quick .
Cut another sheet of copper about the same size as the first one .
Bend both pieces gently , so they will fit into the plastic bottle or jar without touching one another .
The cuprous oxide coating that was facing up on the burner is usually the best side to face outwards in the jar , because it has the smoothest , cleanest surface .
Attach the two alligator clip leads , one to the new copper plate , and one to the cuprous oxide coated plate .
Connect the lead from the clean copper plate to the positive terminal of the meter .
Connect the lead from the cuprous oxide plate to the negative terminal of the meter .
Now mix a couple tablespoons of salt into some hot tap water .
Stir the saltwater until all the salt is dissolved .
Then carefully pour the saltwater into the jar , being careful not to get the clip leads wet .
The saltwater should not completely cover the plates -- you should leave about an inch of plate above the water , so you can move the solar cell around without getting the clip leads wet .
The photo above shows the solar cell in my shadow as I took the picture .
Notice that the meter is reading about 6 microamps of current .
The solar cell is a battery , even in the dark , and will usually show a few microamps of current .
The above photo shows the solar cell in the sunshine .
Notice that the meter has jumped up to about 33 microamps of current .
Sometimes it will go over 50 microamps , swinging the needle all the way over to the right .
How does it do that ?
Cuprous oxide is a type of material called a semiconductor .
A semiconductor is in between a conductor , where electricity can flow freely , and an insulator , where electrons are bound tightly to their atoms and do not flow freely .
In a semiconductor , there is a gap , called a bandgap between the electrons that are bound tightly to the atom , and the electrons that are farther from the atom , which can move freely and conduct electricity .
Electrons cannot stay inside the bandgap .
An electron cannot gain just a little bit of energy and move away from the atom 's nucleus into the bandgap .
An electron must gain enough energy to move farther away from the nucleus , outside of the bandgap .
Similarly , an electron outside the bandgap cannot lose a little bit of energy and fall just a little bit closer to the nucleus .
It must lose enough energy to fall past the bandgap into the area where electrons are allowed .
When sunlight hits the electrons in the cuprous oxide , some of the electrons gain enough energy from the sunlight to jump past the bandgap and become free to conduct electricity .
The free electrons move into the saltwater , then into the clean copper plate , into the wire , through the meter , and back to the cuprous oxide plate .
As the electrons move through the meter , they perform the work needed to move the needle .
When a shadow falls on the solar cell , fewer electrons move through the meter , and the needle dips back down .
A note about power
The cell produces 50 microamps at 0.25 volts .
This is 0.0000125 watts ( 12.5 microwatts ) .
Do n't expect to light light bulbs or charge batteries with this device .
It can be used as a light detector or light meter , but it would take acres of them to power your house .
The 0.0000125 watts ( 12.5 microwatts ) is for a 0.01 square meter cell , or 1.25 milliwatts per square meter .
To light a 100 watt light bulb , it would take 80 square meters of cuprous oxide for the sunlit side , and 80 square meters of copper for the dark electrode .
To run a 1,000 watt stove , you would need 800 square meters of cuprous oxide , and another 800 square meters of plain copper , or 1,600 square meters all together .
If this were to form the roof of a home , each home would be 30 meters long and 30 meters wide , assuming all they needed electricity for was one stove .
There are 17,222 square feet in 1,600 square meters .
If copper sheeting costs $ 5 per square foot , the copper alone would cost $ 86,110.00 USD .
Making it one tenth the thickness can bring this down to $ 8,611.00 .
Since you are buying in bulk , you might get it for half that , or about $ 4,300.00 .
If you used silicon solar panels costing $ 4 per watt , you could run the same stove for $ 4,000.00 .
But the panels would only be about 10 square meters .
Or , for about a dollar , you can build a solar stove out of aluminum foil and cardboard .
For about $ 20 , you can build a very nice polished aluminum parabolic solar cooker .

[ Haskell - cafe ] getting more out of ghci [ longish ]
== intro no , i'm not talking about using a nice frontend to ghci , with added functionality , although the haskell modes for emacs and vim , and other such gui / ide / editor efforts , are well worth looking into !-) also , i'm not going to talk about the eagerly anticipated ghci debugger .
what i am going to talk about are some of the little things one can do to improve the ghci user experience , including features asked for in ghc 's ticket tracker , features known and cherished from hugs , and features that are not even available in hugs .
the keys to adding such useful features are : def , which allows us to define new ghci commands , and : redir , which allows us to capture the output of ghci commands for further processing .
and to save you the search : : def has been with us for a while ( it is in ghci 6.6.1 ) , and : redir is not among the pre-defined ghci commands , not even in ghc head .
the reason i started looking into adding commands to ghci were ( a ) the added functionality in ghci 6.7 , which will ( b ) soon require me to be able to capture ghci command output , for proper interfacing with my haskell mode plugins for vim .
originally , i thought that output capture would need to be hacked into the ghci sources ( i even drafted a patch : - ) .
it then became clear that we can implement : redir on top of the existing commands , even in ghci 6.6.1 !
all the commands we 're going to introduce are defined in the file dot - squashed . ghci , which can be found here :
http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~cr3/toolbox/haskell/dot-squashed.ghci
( there is a patch pending for ghc head that will let us spread definitions in ghci over multiple lines , but for now , we have to squash them into single lines .. ; i will take the liberty to violate this restriction in the explanations below ) , and work with ghci 6.6.1 , although there are more commands and information to play with in ghc 6.7 or later .
== command overview so what kind of commands are we going to define ?
here 's an overview : Prelude > : def s readFile Prelude > :s dot-squashed.ghci Prelude > : defs list :. < file > -- source commands from < file > : pwd -- print working directory :ls [ < path > ] -- list directory ( " . " by default ) : redir < var > < cmd > -- execute < cmd > , redirecting stdout to < var > : redirErr < var > < cmd > -- execute < cmd > , redirecting stderr to < var > : grep < pat > < cmd > -- filter lines matching < pat > from the output of < cmd > : find < id > -- call editor ( : set editor ) on definition of < id > :b [ < mod > ] -- : browse < mod > ( default : first loaded module ) :le [ < mod > ] -- try to : load < mod > ( default to : reload ) ; edit first error , if any : defs {list , undef} -- list or undefine user - defined commands == let 's go - simple things first : def is commonly used to abbreviate frequently entered commands : Prelude > : grep : def :? : def < cmd > < expr > define a command :< cmd > where the < expr > is of type ' String -> IO String ' , so it takes a command parameter ( actually , the rest of the command line after :< cmd > ) , does some I O , and returns a String , which is going to be interpreted as ghci input .
that 's why our ' : def s read File ' defined a :s command to source ghci input from a file , which we then used to source our new command definitions ( alternatively , we could have put those into our .ghci file ) .
ghci 6.7 and later also have a : cmd command , which takes an expression of type ' IO String ' - that expression is immediately executed , and its result String is interpreted as ghci input .
we 'll define our own version for ghci 6.6.1 : -- 6.6.1 does n't have this , omit this def for later ghci's : def cmd \l - > return $ unlines [ " : def cmdTmp \\_ -> " ++l , " : cmdTmp " , " : undef cmdTmp " ] we simply use the expression parameter to define a temporary command , which we execute immediately and undefine afterwards .
== being helpful and self - documenting ghci only keeps an internal record of commands added with : def , so we can neither get a list of them , nor will they appear in :? output .
we can be more helpful by wrapping each command with a line of help : -- make commands helpful let { cmdHelp cmd msg " - - help " = return $ " putStrLn " ++ show msg ; cmdHelp cmd msg other = cmd other } then we can define a few standard utilities , with help texts : : def .
cmdHelp readFile " :. < file > \t\t -- source commands from < file > " let pwd _ = return " System.Directory.getCurrentDirectory >>= putStrLn " : def pwd cmdHelp pwd " : pwd\t\t\t -- print working directory " let ls p = return $ " mapM_ putStrLn =<< System.Directory.getDirectoryContents " ++ show path where {path = if ( null p ) then " . " else p} : def ls cmdHelp ls " :ls [ < path > ] \t\t -- list directory ( \ " .\ " by default ) " sourcing commands saves key - strokes on a frequently used operation , while : pwd and :ls save me from having to recall whether i'm using ghci in windows or unix , by using haskell functions ;-) we 'll see later how we register our commands with : defs , but each of these commands responds to calls for -- help : Prelude > :. -- help :. < file > -- source commands from < file > so , once registered , we can let : defs give us -- help for all of them : Prelude > : grep :\.| : pwd|:ls : defs list :. < file > -- source commands from < file > : pwd -- print working directory :ls [ < path > ] -- list directory ( " . " by default ) == a hammer for many nails : capturing ghci command output now for the big tool : : def is fine , and there are several ghci commands that give useful information to the user , such as :? , : show modules , : browse , etc. if we could only get hold of that information , we could define much more interesting new ghci commands .
the plan is to redirect stdout to a temporary file , execute one of those helpful ghci commands , restore stdout to the terminal , and read the contents of the temporary file into a variable ( then clean away the temporary file ) .
unfortunately , there 's no portable redirection functionality in the standard libs , but in ghci , we 're ghc - dependent anyway , and ghc provides us with GHC .
Handle .
now , take a deep breath , ' cause here we go : let redir varcmd = case break Data .
Char.isSpace varcmd of { ( var , _:cmd ) -> return $ unlines [ " : set - fno- print - bind - result " , " tmp <- System.Directory.getTemporaryDirectory " , " ( f , h ) <- System.IO.openTempFile tmp \ " ghci\ " " , " sto <- GHC .
Handle .
hDuplicate System.IO.stdout " , " GHC.Handle.hDuplicateTo h System.IO.stdout " , " System . IO.hClose h " , cmd , " GHC.Handle.hDuplicateTo sto System.IO.stdout " , " let readFileNow f = read File f >>= \\t -> length t `seq` return t " , var + + " <- readFileNow f " , " System.Directory.removeFile f " ] ; _ -> return " putStrLn \" usage : : redir < var > < cmd >\ " " } : def redir cmdHelp redir " : redir < var > < cmd >\t -- execute < cmd > , redirecting stdout to < var > " okay , that was a handful , and it does n't look easier on a single line .
our : redir command takes two parameters : the name of a variable to bind the output to , and the name of a command to capture the output of .
so we split the command line into var and cmd , and we complain with usage info if that fails ( unchecked failure in ghci command definitions is generally a bad idea ) .
the rest is fairly straightforward , actually , but for the tedious inconvenience of keeping the different levels of interpretation and scopes in mind : we 're using the current scope to construct strings that represent commands which will be executed in the scope in which : redir will be called .
also , we need to fully qualify our variables , to be sure we can get the right ones , no matter what module is loaded when the command is executed ( strictly speaking , we should qualify the remaining functions as well , to avoid pathological cases like " import Prelude ( ) " -- please keep that in mind if you do redefine or hide any of those standard functions ) .
we do n't want output from our auxiliary variable bindings , so we : set - fno - print - bind - result ; then we get a temporary file f , with handle h , make a copy of stdout , then redirect stdout to h ; we insert the cmd we want to run ( note the lack of quotes ) ; afterwards , we restore stdout , read the temporary file and bind its contents to var ( note again the quoting ) , before we clear away the temporary file .
and what do we get for all that trouble ?
Prelude > : redir -- help : redir < var > < cmd > -- execute < cmd > , redirecting stdout to < var > Prelude > : redir x : type id Prelude > x " id :: a -> a
" Prelude > putStrLn x id :: a -> a not much , yet , but that is a very useful hammer !-) and if : redir is our hammer , the question becomes : what are our nails ?
== filtering command output we 've already seen several uses of : grep , so let 's deal with that next : let { merge [ ] = [ ] ; merge ( l:c:ls ) | i c >
i l = merge ( ( l++c ) :ls ) where {i l = length ( takeWhile Data.
Char.isSpace l)} ; merge ( l:ls ) = l:merge ls ; grep patcmd = case break Data .
Char.isSpace patcmd of { ( pat , _:cmd ) -> return $ unlines [ " : redir out " ++ cmd , " let ls = " ++ if " : browse " `Data.List.isPrefixOf` cmd then " merge ( lines out ) " else " lines out " , " let match pat = Data.Maybe.isJust .
Text.Regex.matchRegex ( Text.Regex.mkRegex pat ) " , " putStrLn $ unlines $ ( \ " \ " : ) $ filter ( match " ++ show pat + + " ) $ ls " ] ; _ -> return " putStrLn \" usage : : grep < pat > < cmd >\ " " } } : def grep cmdHelp grep " : grep < pat > < cmd >\t -- filter lines matching < pat > from the output of < cmd > " -- ( also merges pretty - printed lines if < cmd > is : browse ) another handful , but not all that much if we focus on the grep function : again , we split the commandline into pat and cmd ( note that this simple - minded approach does n't permit spaces in pat ) ; we then run the cmd , capturing its output in the variable out , and apply a simple filter to the lines in out , based on matching the regular expression pattern pat ; that 's it ( oh , and if cmd happens to be : browse , we undo the pretty - printer 's attempt to spread information over multiple lines , which would interfere with our line - based filtering ) .
now , this is more obviously useful , is n't it ?-) we can : grep for module - related commands in :?: Prelude > : grep mod :? : add < filename > ... add module (s ) to the current target set : browse [ *] < module > display the names defined by < module > : edit edit last module : load < filename > ... load module(s ) and their dependents : module [+/-] [*] < mod > ... set the context for expression evaluation : reload reload the current module set : show modules show the currently loaded modules or find out what folds there are in the Prelude ( this is similar to hugs ' : names command , btw ) : Prelude > : grep fold : browse Prelude foldr :: ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> [ a ] -> b foldl1 :: ( a -> a -> a ) -> [ a ] -> a foldr1 :: ( a -> a -> a ) -> [ a ] -> a foldl :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a or what monadic commands in the Prelude operate on lists ( this is no replacement for hoogle , but useful for finding simple matches ) : Prelude > : grep Monad .*\[.*\] : browse Prelude sequence_ :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m ( ) sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] mapM_ :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> m b ) -> [ a ] -> m () mapM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> m b ) -> [ a ] -> m [ b ] == for our next trick : more hugs commands for ghci === : find we 've already included the : names functionality , but my favourite hugs command must be : find < name > , which edits the module containing the definition of < name >.
this is even more useful as hugs comes with sources for Prelude and libs , so you can simply say ' : find span ' and see span 's standard definition .
but , let 's at least define a ghci : find for modules for which we do have the sources !
the plan is to capture the output of : info < name > , grep for those helpful comments " -- Defined at < file > :< line > :< col > : " , which tell us where to look , then call : edit with that information .
for that to work , we need an editor that can open a file at a specified line : -- if your editor does n't understand :e + line file -- ( jump to line in file ) , you 'll need to change -- functions find and loadEditErr below : set editor gvim now , for the find functionality : let find id = return $ unlines [ " : redir out : info " ++id , " let ls = filter ( Data.List.isInfixOf \"-- Defined\ " ) $ lines out " , " let match pat = Text.Regex.matchRegex ( Text.Regex.mkRegex pat ) " , " let m = match \"-- Defined at ( [ ^ < : ] * ) :( [ ^ : ]* ) :\ " $ head ls " , " : cmd return $ case ( ls , m ) of { ( _:_ , Just [ mod , line ] ) -> ( \ " :e +\ " ++ line ++\ " \ " ++mod ) ; _ -> \ " \ " } " ] : def find cmdHelp find " : find < id > \t\t -- call editor ( : set editor ) on definition of < id > " that 's fairly easy by now , is n't it ?-) we capture the output of : info , grab the definition location , if any , and call :e. the latter is a bit tricky because we need to compose the :e command with the information we have obtained from : info .
we achieve this by an extra level of interpretation , passing our constructed ' :e + line file ' command to : cmd .
note again that : find will work only where we have the sources .
for instance , we do n't have the sources for Prelude . span , so : find span would n't work - : info span does n't list a source file , only a module : Prelude > : info span span :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [ a ] ) -- Defined in GHC .
List but load a module of your own , then try ' : find main ' or something !-) === # 1468 : : browse should browse currently loaded module another thing that hugs does is default to browsing the current module , if : browse is called with no explicit module parameter .
this has been asked for in a ghci ticket .
by now , you 're probably ahead of me , looking for ghci commands to grab the current module from ?-) you 're looking for : show modules , and the implementation of :b is indeed straightforward : let { b browse " " = return $ unlines [ " : redir out : show modules " , " : cmd case lines out of { ( l: _ ) -> return ( " ++ show browse + + " ++ head ( words l ) ) ; _ -> return \ " \ " } " ] ; b browse m = return ( browse + +m ) } : def b cmdHelp ( b " : browse " ) " : b [ < mod > ] \t\t-- : browse < mod > ( default : first loaded module ) " i pass the browse command to use because my ghci has two versions ( also in that patch pending for ghc head ) , and you might want to protect that call to head .
but otherwise , no need to wait for someone to hack the ghci sources to fix that ticket !-) === # 95 : GHCi editor binding with " :e " the ghci ticket that asked for adding the hugs : edit command also asked for more of hugs : edit functionality : after failing to load a file , :e will edit the first error location .
can we do that without fixing ghci ?
yes , we can , but there is a slight obstacle to overcome .
we could make a variant of : redir that redirects stderr instead of stdout , but we want to apply it to commands like : load / : reload , to capture their error reports , if any .
unfortunately , those commands clear the bindings in scope , which means that our cleanup operation would fail to restore stderr to the terminal , not to mention reading the tempfile contents into a variable .
we need to be a bit more careful .
fortunately , :l/ :r do not clear the current commands , so if we manage to capture our handle and filename variables in a temporary command , we can execute that to finish processing after calling :l/:r. so , here we go : let redirErr varcmd = case break Data .
Char.isSpace varcmd of { ( var , _:cmd ) -> return $ unlines [ " : set - fno- print - bind - result " , " tmp <- System.Directory.getTemporaryDirectory " , " ( f , h ) <- System.IO.openTempFile tmp \ " ghci\ " " , " ste <- GHC.Handle.hDuplicate System.IO.stderr " , " GHC.Handle.hDuplicateTo h System.IO.stderr " , " System .
IO.hClose h " , " let readFileNow f = read File f >>= \\t -> length t `seq` return t " , " let afterCmd _ = do { GHC.
Handle.hDuplicateTo ste System .IO.stderr ; r <- readFileNow f ; System.Directory.removeFile f ; return $ \ " " ++var + + " <- return \ " ++ show r } " , " : def afterCmd afterCmd " , cmd , " :afterCmd " , " :undef afterCmd " ] ; _ -> return " putStrLn \" usage : : redirErr < var > < cmd >\ " " } : def redirErr cmdHelp redirErr " : redirErr < var > < cmd >\t -- execute < cmd > , redirecting stderr to < var > " if you compare redirErr with redir , you 'll notice that we 've only exchanged stderr for stdout , and moved the commands after cmd into a temporary : afterCmd , which slightly complicates the quoting .
otherwise , the plan is unchanged .
we 're now in a position to handle error location editing : let loadEditErr m = return $ unlines [ if null m then " : redirErr err : r " else " : redirErr err :l " ++ m , " let match pat = Text.Regex.matchRegex ( Text.Regex.mkRegex pat ) " , " let ms = Data.Maybe.catMaybes $ map ( match \ " ^ ( [ ^ : ] * ) :( [ ^ : ] * ) :( [ ^ : ]* ) :\ " ) $ lines err " , " : cmd return $ case ms of { ( [ mod , line , col ] : _ ) -> ( \ " :e +\ " ++ line ++\ " \ " ++mod ) ; _ -> \ " \ " } " ] : def le cmdHelp loadEditErr " :le [ < mod > ] \t\t -- try to : load < mod > ( default to : reload ) ; edit first error , if any " depending on whether we use :le with an explicit module to load or not , we use : load or : reload , capture the error output , filter it for error locations ( < file > : < line > : < col > : ) , and call the editor with that information for the first error , if any .
we could even make ghci wait for the editor to close , then loop until all errors have been handled .
but that kind of edit / compile loop is better handled inside your editor ( in vim , : help quickfix ) .
== wrapping up , keeping a list finally , let 's keep a record of the command we 've added , so that we can find out what they are and what they do : let { cmds = [ " . " , " pwd " , " ls " , " redir " , " redirErr " , " grep " , " find " , " b " , " le " , " defs " ] ; defs " list " = return $ unlines $ " putStrLn \ " \ " " : [ " :" ++cmd++ " -- help " | cmd <- cmds ] ++ [ " putStrLn \ " \ " " ] ; defs " undef " = return $ unlines [ " : undef " ++cmd | cmd <- cmds ] ; defs _ = return " putStrLn \" usage : : defs { list , undef}\ " " } : def defs cmdHelp defs " : defs {list , undef}\t -- list or undefine user - defined commands " we simply list the commands manually ( we could make them self - registering by keeping an IORef somewhere , but let 's keep things simple for now ) , and provide an administrative interface ( : defs ) to list ( call -- help for all ) or undefine ( useful if you edit your .ghci file and want to reload it ) all our commands .
that 's how we were able to type ' : defs list ' at the beginning of this session to get our overview of available user - defined commands .
i hope you enjoyed this little tour of ghci , and find the proposed commands and techniques useful .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans divide evenly in a recent Gallup Poll on whether the two major political parties are adequately representing the public , or whether a third party is needed .
That represents a shift from 2007 , when a majority said the Democrats and Republicans were doing " such a poor job that a third major party is needed . "
Gallup has asked this question since 2003 , and over that time , the public 's views on this matter have not been consistent .
The first time it was asked , in October 2003 , a majority opposed the idea of a third major party .
Two separate polls from last year showed most Americans in favor of another party .
This year 's results are similar to what Gallup found in September 2006 .
Not surprisingly , political independents are most likely to favor the emergence of a third major party , with 63 % holding this view .
In contrast , a majority of Democrats ( 56 % ) and Republicans ( 55 % ) think the two major parties are doing an adequate job and thus there is no need for another party that can compete with them .
The change in the balance of opinion since 2007 from favoring a third major party to dividing evenly on this question is largely because of a shift in Democrats ' attitudes .
Last September , Democrats favored a third party by 53 % to 43 % -- nearly the mirror image of this year 's result , which finds just 38 % in favor and 56 % opposed .
It is not clear why the shift has occurred , but throughout this presidential election year , Gallup polling has found Democrats highly engaged in the election and expressing heightened enthusiasm about voting .
Republicans ' attitudes are virtually unchanged from September of last year , when 57 % supported the current party structure and 40 % wanted a third option .
Independents are slightly less likely to favor a third party this year ( 63 % ) than they were last year ( 72 % ) .
Beyond the political differences seen by party affiliation in attitudes toward a third party , there are fairly consistent differences by political ideology that help reveal what sort of third party Americans would most like to see .
Gallup has typically found self - identified liberals to be the most likely ideological group to say a third party is needed .
Even in 2003 , when close to 6 in 10 Americans thought the Democratic and Republican Parties were doing an adequate job of representing Americans , a majority of liberals disagreed .
Liberal support for a third party climbed to 66 % in 2007 , ironically shortly after the Democratic Party had assumed control of Congress for the first time since 1994 .
This year , with Barack Obama heading the Democratic ticket , marks the low point in liberal support for a third party , at 51 % , but it is still above the majority level .
This year 's drop in liberal support for a third party may suggest that liberals ' penchant for favoring a third major party reflects a desire for a party that more closely reflects their political views , and perhaps they see Barack Obama as doing that better than Democratic leaders who have come before him .
Those who identify as political moderates , a disproportionate percentage of whom also are independent in their partisan orientation , have generally preferred that there be a third party to help represent the opinions of Americans .
Conservatives , who in general tend to favor the status quo , have usually expressed satisfaction with the two - party system .
Implications
Americans ' views on the need for a third political party have varied in recent years , and in this presidential election year the public is divided down the middle .
That could reflect general satisfaction with the major parties ' presidential candidates , both of whom enjoy favorable ratings near 60 % .
This question was not asked in 1992 , when independent candidate Ross Perot had the best showing for a third - party candidate in recent memory .
The lower desire for a major third party does not bode well for the third - party candidacies of Ralph Nader , Bob Barr , and Cynthia McKinney , who have registered only minimal support when included in presidential election polls this year , and who have struggled to attract campaign dollars that have flowed rather freely to Obama and McCain .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,007 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Sept. 8 - 11 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Summary of Findings
News organizations continued to focus a great deal of attention on the presidential campaign last week , but the public was more interested in news about the rising price of oil and the overall economy .
As the price of oil reached a new record , a solid majority ( 57 % ) followed news about rising oil prices very closely .
More than a third ( 35 % ) said they followed this story more closely than other news , making it the week ’s top story .
Interest in oil prices was greater than it was last fall , when the price first reached $ 100 a barrel ; last November , 44 % of the public tracked oil prices very closely .
In addition , interest in economic news reached a 15 - year high last week .
Amid news of plunging stocks , a mounting credit crisis as well as higher energy costs , 49 % of the public said they followed news about the economy very closely .
The economy was the most closely followed story of the week for 16 % of Americans .
News organizations devoted a substantial amount of coverage to oil prices and the economy , but the presidential campaign received far more coverage .
The campaign was the week ’s most heavily covered story , accounting for 27 % of all coverage , according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s ( PEJ ) News Coverage Index .
By contrast , news about oil prices and the U.S. economy accounted for 12 % of all news last week , ( oil prices 7 % , economy 5 % ) .
On the Campaign Trail : Media and Public Focused Mainly on Democrats
Public interest in the campaign , while significantly greater than it was a week earlier , still lagged behind interest in oil prices and the economy .
Four - in - ten ( 39 % ) followed news about the campaign very closely last week , up from 28 % the week before .
Coverage of the campaign focused heavily on the Democrats and their efforts to unite behind Barack Obama in November .
According to PEJ ’s Campaign Coverage Index , 58 % of the coverage focused on Obama and the Democratic Party , while 14 % focused on the Republicans .
Throughout most of the year , Democrats have followed the presidential campaign more closely than Republicans .
However , last week marked the largest partisan gap in campaign interest since the start of the presidential race in early 2007 .
Democrats were almost twice as likely as Republicans to say they followed the campaign very closely ( 52 % vs. 28 % ) .
More than four - in - ten Americans ( 43 % ) heard a lot about Barack Obama ’s joint appearance with Hillary Clinton at an event held in Unity , New Hampshire on June 27 .
According to PEJ ’s Campaign Coverage Index , about a quarter of the week ’s campaign stories ( 23 % ) focused on divisions between Democrats and the efforts to unite behind Obama .
Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to have heard a lot about the Obama - Clinton rally ( 55 % vs. 33 % ) .
Obama continued to overshadow John McCain , not only in terms of news coverage but also in public visibility .
The Illinois senator was featured prominently in 82 % of all campaign stories , more than double the number of stories mentioning McCain ( 40 % ) .
Consistent with the balance of coverage , the public reported hearing far more about Obama than about McCain in recent weeks .
Three - quarters of Americans said that Obama was the candidate they had heard most about in the news .
This compares with only 10 % who named McCain .
Obama was far more visible than McCain among Republicans ( 69 % vs. 17 % ) as well as Democrats ( 81 % vs. 8 % ) .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s agenda .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage was collected from June 23 - 29 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week was collected June 27 - 30 from a nationally representative sample of 1,004 adults .
In Other News …
About three - in - ten Americans ( 28 % ) paid very close attention to the Supreme Court ’s decision overturning a ban on the possession of handguns in Washington , D.C. One - in - ten ( 9 % ) listed this as their most closely followed story of the week .
Roughly equal proportions of Republicans , Democrats and Independents paid very close attention to this story .
Overall , 5 % of the national newshole was devoted to news about the Supreme Court ruling on handguns .
There was relatively little interest in Zimbabwe ’s disputed elections and related violence in that country .
Only 13 % followed this story very closely and just 3 % listed this as their top story of the week .
The story did receive substantial coverage , especially online , accounting for 7 % of all news last week .
Recent steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program attracted the very close attention of one - in - five Americans ( 19 % ) and 2 % listed this as the story they tracked most closely .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Sunday through Friday ) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

Many monumental errors and misjudgments contributed to the acute financial turmoil in which we now find ourselves .
Nevertheless , the vast accumulation of toxic mortgage debt that poisoned the global financial system was driven by the aggressive buying of subprime and Alt - A mortgages , and mortgage - backed securities , by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The poor choices of these two government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) -- and their sponsors in Washington -- are largely to blame for our current mess .
How did we get here ?
Let 's review : ...

" History teaches us that history teaches us nothing . " ~ Hegel
So far , Hegel seems to be right .
Cycles come and cycles go — especially in terms of economics and liberty .
Those who observe and remember , can discover , analyze , and predict the next cycle while the majority of the people remain in the dark , repeatedly surprised by avoidable calamities .
Jefferson killed a bank .
Jackson killed a bank .
Now it ’s our responsibility to untold generations to stand up and throw off the shackles of yet another criminal syndicate with the respectable sounding name : " Federal Reserve Bank . "
A BANK of the United States is in many respects convenient for the Government and useful to the people .
Entertaining this opinion , and deeply impressed with the belief that some of the powers and privileges possessed by the existing Bank are unauthorized by the Constitution , subversive of the rights of the States , and dangerous to the liberties of the people , I felt it my duty , at an early period of my administration , to call the attention of Congress to the practicability of organizing an institution combining all its advantages , and obviating these objections .
I sincerely regret that , in the act before me , I can perceive none of those modifications of the Bank charter which are necessary , in my opinion , to make it compatible with justice , with sound policy , or with the Constitution of our country .
~ Andrew Jackson , July 10 , 1832
Make no mistake .
If the bank Jackson killed was not compatible with " justice , with sound policy , or with the Constitution of our country , " we can be sure the Monster that returned in 1913 was much better prepared to entrench itself and eventually swallow every last vestige of liberty .
Jackson ’s words later in the same document read as though they could have been on the table while the conspirators were drafting the plan to sponsor the Federal Reserve Act :
Is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a Bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country ?
The president of the Bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance .
Should its influence become concentered , as it may under the operation of such an act as this , in the hands of a self - elected directory , whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders , will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace , and for the independence of our country in war .
Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it ; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years , on terms proposed by themselves , they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation .
But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers , or prevent a renewal of its privileges , it can not be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence .
So , it is obvious , that , in almost every respect the Federal Reserve was an " improved " version of the earlier attempts to place total economic control in the hands of a very small and inherently unaccountable cabal .
And the entire program can be said to have been sold as a " Bailout " by government .
Later we read about how much confidence Mr. Jackson would place in the Supreme Court to settle the matter :
It is maintained by the advocates of the Bank , that its constitutionality , in all its features , ought to be considered as settled by precedent , and by the decision of the Supreme Court .
To this conclusion I cannot assent .
Mere precedent is a dangerous source of authority , and should not be regarded as deciding questions of constitutional power , except where the acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered as well settled .
Will the People get Depressed or Mad as Hell this time around ?
What happens to the power of the State when the People increase their knowledge and competence of monetary science and the rule of law ?
Everyone knows the cliché " follow the money trail . "
But with just a little more education we can all display a level of prophetic genius with regard to economic affairs and the power of the State which are always intertwined .
Without the proper knowledge set we will not be sufficiently armed or motivated , nor will be willing to bear the burdens and hardships of the long hard road back to Liberty with Responsibility .
Whenever the power of the State increases , our economic autonomy and liberty must decrease .
Given enough power , the State will eventually devour all resources and crush all means of production .
The all - powerful State is insatiable because it combines all the hubris and criminality of all its operatives , dupes and parasites .
It is the antithesis of creativity and productivity .
I am reminded of a favorite Jefferson quote as it is related by Hamilton Abert Long in " The American Ideal " — a text we provide free at LEXREX.com
With money we will get men , said Caesar , and with men we will get money .
Nor should our assembly [ the Virginia Legislature ] be deluded by the integrity of their own purposes , and conclude that these unlimited powers will never be abused , because themselves are not disposed to abuse them .
They should look forward to a time , and that not a distant one , when a corruption in this , as in the country from which we derive our origin [ Great Britain ] , will have seized the heads of government , and be the voices of the people , and make them pay the price .
Human nature is the same on every side of the Atlantic , and will be alike influenced by the same causes .
The time to guard against corruption and tyranny , is before they shall have gotten hold on us .
It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold , than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he shall have entered .
~ [ from " Notes on the State of Virginia , ” 1782 ]
The wolves have already gathered to feast on the corpse of a dying Republic .
It is our task now to pull out their teeth and talons .
This means , among other things , that the Federal Reserve Banking System must be abolished along with every vestige of Corporate Fascism .
The separation of bank and state is what must occur if we are to gain from the most recent upheavals .
It would appear that more than enough suffering is imminent to make this point valid to the public .
Perhaps this time it will be sufficiently engraved on our consciousness .
But we need to keep focusing on the primary cause of the problem .
Sadly , the Media , the " government " and the " experts " are constantly mistaking effects for causes either inadvertently or deliberately .
During each crisis we need to step up our efforts to teach the liberty principles to others .
A tax by any other name
INFLATION is not something the Fed was created to combat .
Inflation is what the Fed Does !
And the more the Fed inflates the so - called money supply the closer we are to national financial ruin .
Ron Paul has accurately characterized this as the Inflation Tax .
Interestingly , the Wikipedia entry for " Inflation Tax " says it is " not a rigorous economic concept . "
Is Alan Greenspan writing for Wikipedia ?
As Liberty and the comprehensive knowledge of classical libertarian ideals increases around the world it is natural for the State to lose its grip — to atrophy .
One or the other must prevail .
The Ron Paul Revolution is just our local name for the transition that is under way .
The rest of the world is watching our financial debacle right now — and someone is learning from it you can be sure .
Do you think the Russians and the Chinese are completely ignorant regarding how the US is ignoring its own principles , laws , and Constitution in a Naked attempt to consolidate a Global Fascist Hegemony ?
They can read our Constitution ; compare it to our behavior , and realize the world can only become less safe and less secure if we continue to abandon our first principles .
No clairvoyance is required to recognize the fact that someone must do something — sooner or later — to curb the trend toward global domination .
For those who have slept through the Ron Paul campaign — the Federal Reserve Bank is not even part of the government of the United States and certainly has no lawful right to go on a buying spree with taxpayer funds on behalf of the government or the People .
The recent bailouts of major corporate entities are without precedent and without lawful authority altogether .
They constitute retroactive extortion .
As the control of the modern State on the minds of men becomes more and more tenuous we can expect desperate measures from those who are desperate to maintain control .
If they lose our minds they must try to use our bodies to regain control .
They have tipped their hand more frequently in recent years in regard to the fact that they will continually try to use fear to make us give up our liberty for security .
But the State is nothing more than a combination of mere men with a few vicious women thrown in to enhance the Velvet Glove effect .
It is a Fiction attempting to be a Non-fiction .
Whether mankind is capable of taking the next " small " step in the right direction remains to be seen .
We have all of the necessary data .
The contest is now an information race .
There is next to nothing that government can do better than some other entity or combination .
That is , nothing that needs to be done .
We do n’t need to be dominated , controlled surveilled or micro-managed .
We need only Liberty From the State .
The State is not the source of Liberty .
Good government is the absence , not the presence of certain things .
This principle rules out any usefulness for the present versions of our major two political parties .
They are both married to the all - powerful State and its Unlawful Banking system .
This makes them the enemies of liberty .
“ It is error alone which needs the support of government .
Truth can stand by itself . ”
~ Thomas Jefferson : Notes on Virginia Q.XVII , 1782 . ME 2:222
“ The bank , ” Jackson told Martin Van Buren , “ is trying to kill me , but I will kill it ! ” Jackson , in vetoing the recharter bill , charged the Bank with undue economic privilege .
[ Source = Whitehouse.gov ???
Does Dubya read his very own website ? ]
Will the bank kill the Republic or will the Republic kill the bank ?
Andrew Jackson ’s epitaph includes the words , " I Killed the Bank . "
What do you want on your Tombstone ?

Taking A Look At The Top Mobile Apps To Hit The Market In 2019
With people ’s dependence on mobile devices , mobile apps continue to sprout left and right .
The year 2019 was a testament to the influence of mobile apps .
Studies reveal that people spend 90 % of their mobile time on apps .
Behind this number and other key factors , analysts predict that mobile app downloads will reach 258 billion by 2022 .
But with so many apps to download on your iOS or Android device , you may wonder what were the top mobile apps in 2019 ?
Apart from the usual suspects like Facebook , Messenger , and Instagram , others also left a lasting impact on millions of mobile device users last year .
Let ’s take a look at some of the best mobile apps that people downloaded last year .
2019 App Industry at a Glance
Before we proceed with the list , let us first look at some key facts the helped shape the digital world in 2019 .
The number of smartphone users reached 2.7 billion across the world .
Furthermore , there were 1.35 billion tablet users worldwide .
As for the two leading app resources , the Apple App Store boasted of 2.2 million apps available for download .
On the other hand , rival Google Play Store carried 2.8 million apps for download .
Moreover , people used an average of 30 apps every month .
When it comes to the global app market , 98 % of users downloaded free apps .
Certain app categories also recorded the highest penetration rate among users .
Gaming apps dominated the App Store taking 24.86 % of share availability .
For Google Play Store , tools and communication apps recorded the highest penetration rates at 99 % .
Furthermore , the average American looks at their mobile phone every 12 minutes .
They also open an app an average of 11 times a day .
And mobile apps account for 57 % of all digital media usage .
Top Mobile Apps
With all the numbers above , there is no doubt that the mobile app industry is in for a bright future .
Now let ’s take a look at seven of the top mobile apps that people downloaded in 2019 in no particular order .
Tiktok
Originally launched in 2016 , it was only in 2019 when TikTok exploded .
TikTok is a social video app that allows users to dance or lip-sync to songs .
Other users can also watch other users singing or dancing .
In 2019 , some of TikTok ’s users ended up as viral sensations , adding to the app ’s popularity .
People downloaded the app over 600 million times in 2019 .
This helped TikTok reached a milestone by surpassing the 1.5 billion global download mark on Google Play and the App Store .
It also became the third most - downloaded non-gaming app of 2019 .
It trailed WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger .
Recorder
Though this app was only available on the Google Pixel 4 , it did n’t fail those who gave it a try .
As the name implies , it is a voice - recording app that transcribes speeches in a real - time manner .
This also covers music , background sounds , and even the audience ’s applause .
Moreover , the app can archive your recordings .
It can also make them searchable , allowing you to pull them up fast .
Another plus for the app is that you can use it even if you do not have data or Wi -Fi connection .
Disney Plus
This new platform from entertainment giant Disney is the biggest threat to Netflix .
Though it launched late in the year , Disney plus snagged 10 million subscribers in a single day .
Like Netflix , it also comes with a subscription fee ( $ 7 / month ) .
The app features over 500 movies under the Disney franchise .
It also comes with over 7,500 episodes of various TV shows .
If you are looking for a dose of Marvel , Pixar , Star Wars , the Simpsons , and some Disney Classics , this is the app for you .
Glitch Video Effects
This video editing app lets you take photos and videos and add over a hundred different filters in an instant .
Some of its most popular filters include the Xray , the Neon , the Shadow , and the Retro VHS filters .
Moreover , you can import videos from your gallery and add filters to them .
You can also use some of the best music from your playlist and attach them to your videos .
Of course , you can share your videos across various social media platforms .
These include Instagram , TikTok , Snapchat , and Facebook .
The app received over 10 million downloads .
It also earned Google ’s nod as the Play Users ’ Choice App of 2019 .
Spectre
i Phone users who love taking pictures experienced the wonders of the Spectre Camera .
This photography app uses artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology to take long - exposure shots sans a tripod or other camera equipment .
This allows you to create shots that feature impossible effects .
You can make people on a busy street disappear .
If you are an iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro user , you need to try this app .
After all , Apple did n’t hail it as its iPhone App of the Year for nothing .
Call of Duty : Mobile
Gamers loved 2019 for the mobile version of “ Call of Duty . ”
The game enjoyed the largest mobile game launch in history back in October last year .
During its first week of release , over 100 million users downloaded the game .
This beats erstwhile leaders “ PlayersUnknown ’s Battlegrounds ” and “ Fortnite . ”
The game is available on both iOS and Android for free .
Google Maps
Though Google Maps has been around since 2005 , it was only recently when people started to see its value on their mobile devices .
Whether you are looking for mechanical presses or a new restaurant , Google Maps will make sure you get to your destination .
Furthermore , the app introduced features like speed trap reporting , traffic incident reporting , Incognito mode , and a speedometer .
Adding these features became Google ’s attempt to keep Google Maps competitive with other navigational apps .
Keep Track of Technology
These top mobile apps of 2019 helped people in their tasks .
Others added entertainment value to their mobile devices .
But with 2020 already underway , we can expect to see new apps making waves in the coming months .
As a mobile phone user , you need to keep track of the latest tech offerings .
We invite you to regularly check our site .
We post some of the latest news and features on some of the hottest tech and gadgets .
Ganguly has suffered a slump in form Former India captain Sourav Ganguly is to retire after the upcoming Test series against Australia in India .
Ganguly , 36 , has played 109 Tests , 49 as captain , amassing 6,888 runs at an average of 41.74 , including 15 hundreds and 34 fifties .
The 21 matches won during his tenure as skipper is an Indian record .
India 's selectors picked Ganguly in a 15 - man squad for the first two Tests against Australia despite speculation beforehand that he would be dropped .
" This will be my last series , " Ganguly told reporters after a training session ahead of the first Test starting in Bangalore on Thursday .
" To be honest , I did n't expect to be picked for this series . "
" Before coming here , I spoke to my team - mates and hopefully I will go out with a winning knock . "
Ganguly 's announcement came at the end of what was expected to be routine media conference and gave further credence to suggestions the Indian cricket board had drawn up an exit plan for five senior players .
606 : DEBATE
And so it begins ...
One bloke goes , next Dravid , then Kumble and finally the big dog , Tendulkar
slowie A board official said last week that skipper Anil Kumble , Sachin Tendulkar , Ganguly , Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman had been told to plan their retirements by December .
However , Ganguly denied such a directive had been given : " As far as I am concerned and some of the senior players are concerned , we have not received any intimation from the board on anything . "
Ganguly staged a remarkable comeback after losing his captaincy and later his spot in the team following a public spat with then coach Greg Chappell .
He was recalled to the Test side in December 2006 and scored 1,571 runs at 50.67 up to and including the home series against South Africa earlier this year , including a maiden double - century .
However , Ganguly managed only 96 runs in six innings during India 's 2 - 1 series defeat in Sri Lanka this summer and was overlooked for a selection match between the Rest of India and Delhi .
Ganguly finished his one - day international career with 11,363 runs in 311 matches and is one of only seven batsmen to have passed 10,000 runs .

The Transformers star also complains Maxim magazine used an outdated picture of her
Megan
Fox is heating up the newsstands with two sultry cover poses – but only one of them comes with the stamp of approval from the Transformers star .
That ’s the tongue - across - the - teeth , barely - there - bikini picture gracing the October issue of GQ , in which Fox , 22 , makes no apologies about her movie roles .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ If I get stuck doing comic book lms for the rest of my life , I ’ll be really happy , ” she tells the magazine .
“ I love those types of movies .
And I do n’t mind being sexy – if it ’s a character with a back story and an arc and something progresses . ”
Of posing for the magazine , Fox says : I am very excited to be involved with GQ , as it is such a great magazine .
Fox , meanwhile , is also on the cover of Maxim , but her reps say the magazine proceeded without her cooperation , purchasing older photos that already have run in other magazines .
September 15th , 2008
Ubuntu recently included a patch that causes an End User License Agreement for Firefox to appear .
This has caused great concern on several topics .
One is the content of the agreement .
Another is the presentation .
A third is whether there ’s any reason for a license at all .
The most important thing here is to acknowledge that yes , the content of the license agreement is wrong .
The correct content is clear that the code is governed by FLOSS licenses , not the typical end user license agreement language that is in the current version .
We created a license that points to the FLOSS licenses , but we ’ve made a giant error in not getting this to Ubuntu , other distributors , and posted publicly for review .
We ’ll correct this asap .
Second , the way the license is presented to people also has issues .
I think the presentation might not be so bad if we had the correct content there , so that it said the software is governed by the FLOSS licenses that are so important to us .
But even then the presentation may have issues .
We ’re certainly trying to figure this out .
We ’ll do this with public input ; you ’ll see posts about this shortly as well .
There ’s a third question of services , and whether the FLOSS license for the code can include the services one accesses .
We think this is n’t true all the time , and the license will reflect that .
The code is governed by FLOSS licenses , and we should have been clear about that .
This leaves the question of whether it ever makes sense to show people the terms that relate to the software and services available to them .
I saw some comments asking why one ever needs any terms .
Again , if we had the correct content I think this would be less of an issue because then we would be telling people about FLOSS licenses .
We ( meaning Mozilla ) have shot ourselves in the foot here given the old , wrong content .
So I hope we can have a discussion on this point , but I doubt we ’ll have a good one until we fix the other problems .
We take this very seriously and are working hard to fix it .
Update : text of the revised license is online .
One of Meyer ’s ex-wives is citing his religious affiliation as the main reason an Indiana judge should restrict his visitation time to allow his three youngest daughters to attend Christian church .
A Fulton County judge could decide the case .
A hearing originally scheduled for Wednesday has been continued to next month .
Meyer ’s ex-wives say he also has turned their children ’s lives upside down since he joined the Church of Satan -- an organization that eschews spirituality and celebrates man ’s selfish desires .
ROCHESTER , Ind .
-- The T in Satan 's name inked on Jamie Meyer 's left leg is drawn to look like an upside - down cross .
The crucifix suspended above his bed hangs upside down too .
" My children are my legacy , " said Meyer , 30 , a factory worker .
" It is because of them that I am still here today .
I will always fight for my rights as a father . "
Across the nation , child - custody disputes involving religion are on the rise as the frequency of interfaith marriages and religious conversions increases and fathers become more active in their kids ’ upbringing .
Judges risk crossing the line between church and state , experts say , if they try to choose the religion in which a child should be raised .
" People continue to bring it up even though the judge tells them they wo n’t consider a belief system , " said Ronald Nelson , chairman of the American Bar Association ’s custody committee .
" Judges are people .
They are swayed by their emotions and biases just like everyone else ...
What better bias than religion ?
It ’s a visceral thing . "
Experts said the burden is on the ex-wife to show that the religion was harmful to the children .
Gaetano Ferro , immediate past president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , said the U.S. Constitution prevents judges from showing a religious preference .
But the burden of proof might be on Meyer to prove the Church of Satan is an authentic faith .
" If Satanism is treated as religion , that ’s strike one to her case , " Ferro said .
Indeed , the Internal Revenue Service defines the Church of Satan as a religion .
Furthermore , that ’s how it defines itself .
" Satanism is the world ’s first carnal religion , " said Peter Gilmore , high priest of the Manhattan - based organization founded four decades ago .
" Satanists are thus atheists — not devil worshipers — and we see Satan as being a symbol of pride , liberty and individualism , not a deity . "
Meyer embraced the Church of Satan when an ex-girlfriend introduced him to the " The Satanic Bible " shortly after his second divorce about two years ago .
The book , written by the Church of Satan ’s founder , Anton LaVey , spoke to Meyer more than any scripture ever had .
It proclaimed no God , no heaven and no hell .
It said Satanism had nothing to do with the devil .
" We take it on as a name because Satan means adversary or opposite , " Meyer said .
" We are the opposite of spiritual religions . "
The mother of Meyer ’s three youngest children , Kristie Meyer , said her ex-husband ’s public expression of satanic beliefs subjects the children to embarrassment .
Her lawyer , Pat Roberts , defended his client ’s right to shape the religious upbringing of the children .
He also questioned whether the Church of Satan qualifies as an authentic faith and whether Meyer really believes in it .
He said Meyer owes back child support .
Roberts wants the judge to order Meyer to drop off the children at his ex-wife ’s Christian church so that they can attend with her during his visitation time .
" Frankly , [ it ] can be emotionally damaging or confusing to children when they ’re faced with these two different forms of worship , " Roberts said .
" Let ’s call it worship rather than religion .
Religion is based upon a recognition of a supreme being ...
Allowing them to go to church for a couple hours on a Sunday morning is ... not unreasonable . "
Jamie Meyer ’s first ex-wife , Misty Hoff , said he already has alienated his oldest daughter by calling her a hypocrite for her Christian beliefs .
She considers his encounter with the Church of Satan nothing but a phase .
" This character is right now one of many that he has done , " she said .
" He pretty much destroyed the relationship with my daughter .
As her mother , my heart breaks for her .
He does this for shock value and tries to rattle everyone ’s chain .
Whether he believes in this or not — that ’s between him and God . "
What do you think ?
Should a judge restrict Meyer ’s visitation so his kids can attend their mother ’s Christian church ?

Hidden treasures in Oracle 's STATSPACK utility
By Steve Callan
Oracle 10 gs Automatic Workload Repository , as part of Oracles Intelligence Infrastructure , works hand in hand with the Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor to help you , the DBA , diagnose and remedy performance problems .
Under the Intelligent Infrastructure , we see the following components :
Automatic Workload Repository
Automatic Maintenance Tasks
Server - Generated Alerts
Advisor Framework
The AWR is most closely aligned with what STATSPACK is in terms of being a repository for collecting statistics .
Under automatic maintenance tasks , we have what Oracle does after dark : gather statistics .
For server - generated alerts , you have the ability to set warning and threshold values for numerous items of interest .
The Advisor Framework is where we find all of the advisors , such as the SQL Tuning Advisor , SQL Access Advisor .
So why re-visit STATSPACK when AWR , combined with ADDM , gets all the attention with respect to improving the manageability of a database ?
The main reasons why I feel it is noteworthy has to do time and money .
Ill start with the money aspect .
Case I - Money
As mentioned in past articles , use of the repository and any of the packs ( tuning and diagnostics , as in tuning pack and diagnostics pack ) must be licensed .
The packs serve as the main interface into the AWR , although information in the AWR can be accessed via supplied SQL scripts .
If your license metric is based on 300 named users , then your licensing of a feature has a matching cost basis .
In this example , you would essentially pay for 300 seats of the Tuning Pack , even though in reality , a small handful of users ( e.g. , DBAs ) would be the actual users .
This cost , no doubt , can be expensive , but some of the pain is reduced through volume .
The more you license , the better discount rate you get .
The initial price you pay is the one that cuts the deepest because you have to pay for two elements : the basic license and the 22 % maintenance fees .
Going forward , you then ( only ) have the annual maintenance and support fee , which is also what pays for your CSI number so you can access My Oracle Support ( the new name for MetaLink ) .
If you have questions about the licensing model , I assure you this is an accurate description of what takes place .
What it will actually cost you , however , is between you and your sales representative .
If you want to use AWR - like features but cannot pony up the tens of thousands of dollars it takes to get compliant , what are your options ( which presumably do not include using a third party tool such as Toad for Oracle , which now includes a warning message about using licensed features that Toad exposes on its interface ) ?
The first level down which comes close to AWR is STATSPACK .
Case II  Time
Im going to stretch the meaning of time for this case .
There is time related to your time on the job .
What if you started a few years ago and cut your teeth on 10g , but are now looking for a new job and the versions used in the new place include not only 10g , but something prehistoric such as 9i ?
Not very likely youll run into 9i , you think ?
Quite a few E - Business Suite databases in the 11i family run on 9.2.0.5 or 6 .
STATSPACK is your only choice for something like AWR .
Further , Oracle8i ( in the 8.1.7 era ) is still in use , albeit not as much as a few years ago , but its out there .
Time also refers to the evolution of enhanced manageability .
Im not saying you need to be a UTLBSTAT / UTLESTAT wizard to have an appreciation of what the AWR provides , but starting with STATSPACK is certainly not unreasonable .
If you can understand how to read and interpret ADDM reports ( again , based off of information from the AWR ) , then learning how to do the same with AWR - based reports becomes that much easier .
Installing STATSPACK
Plenty of other articles on the Internet , plus Oracles documentation , cover how to install STATSPACK and take snapshots , and I m not going to repeat that here ( except very briefly ) .
After STATSPACK is installed , what a lot of places miss is now what ?
What does the PERFSTAT schema look like ?
What are the tables it uses ?
What about customizing what STATSPACK collects ?
How do you manage the repository ?
These are the relevant questions going forward .
A schema named PERFSTAT is the owner of STATSPACK .
A common practice is to house the STATS $ whatever tables in a separate tablespace , and the tablespace is cleverly named PERFSTAT in pre-10g versions ( look for it in SYSAUX otherwise ) .
In ancient versions , the schema is created and configured after running two scripts as the SYS user : catdbsyn.sql and dbmspool.sql , both found in the $ ORACLE_HOME / rdbms / admin directory ( catdbsyn is obsoleted by the DBA role , and dbmspool is run during the next step ) .
The creation script proper is spcreate.sql .
This script will interview you to obtain location information , and will also generate log files .
You can also install in batch mode , but the interactive mode is the easiest to use .
STATSPACK has evolved across versions of the RDBMS .
In Oracle 8.1.7 , 28 tables are created .
In 10.2.0.1 , the PERFSTAT schema starts with 68 tables .
The PERFSTAT schema in 10g ( and later ) lives in the SYSAUX tablespace , and is one of the schemas which can vacate SYSAUX if you so chose .
You can confirm this by viewing the V$SYSAUX_OCCUPANTS view based on the OCCUPANT_NAME of STATSPACK .
Common to whichever version STATSPACK is being installed in , having the TIMED_STATISTICS parameter set to true will result in better data for performance analysis .
Configuring STATSPACK
The next step is to set ( or change ) the collection option , which consists of two components : the level and the threshold .
The 10g and later documentation is sparse on this  its hard to find there , but one of the  See Also notes directs you to Oracle9i documentation .
Something even older can be found here .
Once snapshots are ready to be taken , the next step is to create some jobs .
Three jobs will cover the automation we see in the AWR ( how often a snapshot is taken and managing the retention ) .
The jobs are : take a snapshot , purge snapshots , and perform customized reporting , such as reporting on segment growth .
To create a job which runs hourly :
BEGIN SYS.DBMS_JOB.REMOVE(3 ) ; COMMIT ; END ; / -- -- JOB3 ( Job ) -- DECLARE X NUMBER ; BEGIN SYS.DBMS_JOB .SUBMIT ( job => X , what => ' statspack.snap ;' , next_date => to_date ( '17/10/2008 17:00:00 ' , 'dd/mm/yyyy hh24:mi:ss ' ) , interval => ' trunc( SYSDATE+1/24 , '' H H '' ) ' , no_parse => FALSE , instance => 1 ) ; SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT .PUT_LINE ( ' Job Number is : ' || to_char( x ) ) ; COMMIT ; END ; /
To create a job which purges the repository :
BEGIN SYS.DBMS_JOB.REMOVE(4 ) ; COMMIT ; END ; / -- -- JOB4 ( Job ) -- DECLARE X NUMBER ; BEGIN SYS .DBMS_JOB .SUBMIT ( job => X , what => ' sppurpkg.purge ( 45 ) ; ' , next_date => to_date ( '18/10/2008 13:29:23 ' , 'dd/mm/yyyy hh24:mi:ss ' ) , interval => ' SYSDATE+1 ' , no_parse => FALSE ) ; SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT .PUT_LINE ( ' Job Number is : ' || to_char( x ) ) ; COMMIT ; END ; /
Finally , a job to monitor / collect segment growth information :
BEGIN SYS.DBMS_JOB.REMOVE( 21 ) ; COMMIT ; END ; / -- -- JOB21 ( Job ) -- DECLARE X NUMBER ; BEGIN SYS.DBMS_JOB .SUBMIT
( job => X , what => ' sp_growth ; ' , next_date => to_date ( '17/10/2008 18:31:49 ' , 'dd/mm/yyyy hh24:mi:ss ' ) , interval => ' sysdate+1 ' , no_parse => FALSE ) ; SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT .PUT_LINE ( ' Job Number is : ' || to_char( x ) ) ; COMMIT ; END ; /
Three notes about the jobs are in order .
The first is that job number is relative to your system ; the ones shown here are examples where the job IDs are 3 , 4 and 21 .
The second is the parameter used for the purge job ; this example uses a 45 - day purge threshold .
The third has to do with the interval on two of the jobs .
The intervals use sysdate +1 , so the odd next_date times you see are a result of a creeping start time .
You can set the interval to be more precise , such as on the hour at a specific hour .
The last job uses customized tables , views , and a procedure to monitor datafile and segment growth , but you are not limited in this regard .
Whatever you can query out of the data dictionary and from within the PERFSTAT schema , not involving anything to do with the AWR is fair game .
If you want to directly view the STATS $ < some_area > tables , a tool such as Toad or SQL Developer can provide a quick snapshot of a snapshot , so to speak .
Of course , the main way to use this data is in comparison across time as opposed to a single point in time .
Nonetheless , if you want to see if a certain metric has changed between snapshots , look at it directly instead of having to run a report .
In Summary
STATSPACK is still very much a viable option for monitoring and diagnosing performance .
With todays latest and greatest version of Oracle and its enhanced manageability features , it seems as if AWR and ADDM have voted to send STATSPACK to Exile Island .
Treasures and rewards can still be found in this place of exile , but its up to you to find them and make the most of whats available .
We know that Oracle is continuing support STATSPACK as evidenced by the increased number of PERFSTAT tables related to system and session events .
The number of tables in Release 11.1.0.6 has grown to 73 tables , almost triple than what it installed with in release 8.1.7.4 .

House intelligence committee chair Silvestre Reyes is also looking for answers from the National Security Agency ( NSA ) about its apparent violations of Americans ' privacy .
" The NSA let us know that your story may be coming down the pipeline , " a spokeswoman for Reyes told ABC News Thursday .
" We went ahead and made an inquiry and have been in contact with NSA We 're awaiting further information . "
Off of Capitol Hill , reaction was swift and sharp to the news that U.S. intelligence officials listened in to hundreds of private conversations , including pillow talk between U.S. military officers and their spouses .
" This outrageous episode is a reminder that government spying powers can be used to invade the most intimate thoughts of even the most trustworthy people , " noted Lisa Graves of the Center for National Security Studies , and a former Justice Department official .
" Today 's report is an indictment not only of the Bush administration , but of all of those political leaders , Democratic and Republican , who have been saying that the executive branch can be trusted with surveillance powers that are essentially unchecked , " charged Jameel Jaffer , director of the national security program at the American Civil Liberties Union .
" When they say trust us , we 're not listening in on Americans – this shows that they are , " said Jennifer Granick of the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
Her group is suing the federal government to stop warrantless eavesdropping programs and hold government officials accountable .
" This should be of concern to everybody . "

3D printers are a boon to industrial designers , many of whom have been happily using ultra-expensive real - life Star Trek replicators for years now .
Yeah , cool , good for them , but when the hell will I be able to print my own Army Men ?
Considering the recent announcement of Objet 's Alaris30 3D desktop printer , my miniature plastic battle royale may not be as far off as I thought .
The printer is no bigger than a regular printer / scanner combo , plugs into a regular power source , connects to any office network and ships with simple drivers and software that let your send CAD files to be produced from modeling plastic in dimensions up to 11.57 x 7.72 x 5.9 in .
No price has been announced yet , but if Objet want to go mainstream with this thing they should probably take aim at the $ 2400 DIY systems that are already floating around the tubes ( update :
Oh shucks , it 's going to be about $ 40,000 ) .
Full details are on Objet 's site , and you can see an example of the printer 's capabilities at BBG .

The Hashish Eater : the witchery of words by Erik Davis
When I was a strange young teen , I wrote ornate and old - fashioned poems haunted by images of demons , wizard scrolls , and implacable fortresses .
Matthew Greenfield , a sophisticated chap I knew at college who later became a professor of English , was guilty of a similar sin , which he called  Dungeons and Dragons poetry . 
Though I didnt play much D&D , I did read a lot of weird fantasy stuff from Robert E. Howard , Fritz Leiber , Michael Moorcock , and , of course , H.P. Lovecraft .
These purple prose monarchs , whose similes and descriptive passages shone with the fetid light of corpse - fed fireflies , lorded over my imaginal life for a few years , and infected the verse I wrote for creative writing classes and for my pleasure .
You , dear reader , are happy that I am loathe to disinter them from the sepulchral Office Depot containers moldering in the dank and fetid corners of my necromantic storage space .
They are , one might say , oer - wraught .
But not a smidgen as oer - wraught as the amazing poetry of Clark Ashton Smith , the California poet and fiction writer who , along with Howard and Lovecraft , wrote his weird stories for Weird Tales , mostly in the 1930s .
Because of the alienating purpleposity of much of his prose , Smith is an acquired taste , even for those of us who love the genre .
Though no match for Lovecraft , Smith 's deep weirdness outshines Howard 's Conan stories , and a small and devoted following has made sure that at least some of his work has remained in print over the decades .
Recent years have seen a small explosion in CAS studies and reissues , including a new Hippocampus edition of his greatest poem ,  The Hashish - Eater ,  which was published in Smiths 1922 volume , Ebony and Crystal .

Long before Smith started to crank out pulp tales , peppered with neomedieval landscapes and obscure locutions worthy of early Cormac McCarthy , Smith was a well - considered poet , at least in the hinterlands that was the California poetry scene in the early twentieth century .
His mentor was George Sterling , a handsome San Franciscan bohemian who wrote highly regarded poetry in a mannered and late romantic vein that makes it almost unreadable today .
Important exceptions must be made , however , for Sterling s fantasy verse , in which late romantic excess is a plus .

Important exceptions must be made , however , for Sterling s fantasy verse , in which late romantic excess is a plus .
His poem " A Wine of Wizardry , " which clearly inspired " The Hashish Eater , " is a classic visionary freakout , and more satanic than you might expect for a 1909 California revery .
" The Hashish Eater " is in an altogether different kettle of kraken .
Though Smith later experimented with drugs , the hashish in the title is simply an excuse to unleash the poets audacious visionary capacity .
 Bow down ,  goes the first line .
 I am the emperor of dreams . 
And dream he does , for nearly six hundred lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter , a procession of nightmarish , demonic and obscure imagery that is occasionally arresting and frequently opaque .
Smith 's images are powerful as much for the overwhelming claustrophobia and rate of attack as for their inventive details .
The poet is particularly powerful at communicating the metamorphic speed of horror - changéd dreams ,  as images rapidly flow , twist and transform , like the flowers that about me turn to hooded serpents , swayed / By flutes of devils in a hellish dance .
He also taps a genuinely cosmic vein that recalls the second half of William Hope Hodgson 's The House on the Borderland .
At the same time , the poem 's endless series of galactic cataclysms and Babylonian B-monsters and Cyclopean architectures , of spleenful pygmies  and  Uranian sapphires fast in frozen blood ,  can really tucker you out .
They do not let your forget that , a lot of the time anyway , our wildest visions are accompanied by nausea , fever , and existential wooze .

While  The Hashish Eater is clearly a document of visionary experience , the nature of that experience seems less druggy or hypnogogic than literary .
Language itself is hallucinating in Smith , a language that is used not to transparently evoke visual images or narrative scenes in the readers minds eye , but rather to overwhelm the poor reader with a dense and gaudy procession of arcane vocabulary and archaic syntax .
Early in the poem , for example , Smith sets us up for all the visions to come by establishing the expanded consciousness of the hashish eater :

Early in the poem , for example , Smith sets us up for all the visions to come by establishing the expanded consciousness of the hashish eater : Supreme
In culminant omniscience manifold ,
And served by senses multitudinous ,
Far - posted on the shifting walls of time ,
With eyes that roam the star - unwinnowed fields
Of utter night and chaos , I convoke
The Babel of their visions
The visions that come through the hash - man 's senses multitudinous  whatever those are exactly produce a Babel , or a babel , which is pretty much how I read a line like  In culminant omniscience manifold . 
This is not the brouhaha of meaningless syllables Kenneth Grants cult of barbarous names  but the obscurities and ancient flotsam of our own English tongue : specialist jargon , deeply obscure mythological references ( tragelaphus , anyone ? ) , and synonyms long ago left to die at the roadside .

Drawing from whatever dictionaries he could scare up in Auburn , the Sierra Nevada town he lived in most of his life , Smith wrote prose that was almost literally ornate so gobbed with oddities , adjectives , and polysyllabic sounds that the prose itself thickens into an encrusted ornament , like a verbal Gustave Moreau painting .
No wonder Smith is so drawn to the language of precious stones and colorings alabraundines ,  amaranthine ,  erubescence . 
His prose is bejeweled in a manner that most students of twentieth - century literature would find atrocious .

His prose is bejeweled in a manner that most students of twentieth - century literature would find atrocious .
But Smith is a frequently brilliant writer , although it is hard to say how intentional he was about some of the effects he was creating .
The effect that interests me in this poem is how its coruscating language , these clotted phonemes and obscure but tantalizing meanings , come to stand in for the visions themselves .
The alienating otherness of darkside visionary experience becomes the alienating otherness of this hermet autodidact 's verbal compulsions .
This is the poems ultimate decadence , its deepest anti-romantic irony : the very language of vision undermines the readers own imaginative capacity , sending him to a dictionary , or to the helpful glossary by the poet Donald Sidney - Fryer included in this edition .
Smith 's gaudiness , so apparently old school , is the precise point where he secretly shares in a lingo - haunted modernism marked with exhaustion .

Towards the end of the poem , a kind of clearing occurs .
The hashish eater finds himself on an empty desert , a broad black plane of adamant that leads towards a great cosmic cliff .
Here everything pours into a fathomless void beyond the ken of all gods and demons .
It is as if Smith wants to depict the nothingness that , in a literary horror vacui , haunts this overstuffed poem and actually motivates its verbosity , its much - too - muchness .
This is the great horror that Smith , along with Lovecraft , glimpsed : that there really was no ordering principle in the universe , no pivot of creation , but only a vast atheistic cosmos more horrible in its meaninglessness than any demonic scenario .

In the end , though , the hashish eater quivers on the brink .
Staring into the depths , he does not finally confront the naked void , that implacable interstellar maw that swallows all language , all images , all narratives .
Instead he sees a bright light , the light of a million moons , and behind that light a huge white eyeless Face . 
This is a repulsive image to be sure , but given how far Smith has come , it seems an almost humanist cop-out , like the mothers face returned , only wearing a monstrous mask .
Though Smith has brought us to the verge where visions finally exhaust themselves , he provides an image where images must finally decompose into meaningless noise , and blankness is all .

Intel 's open source Linux - based mobile platform initiative got a big boost this month from Linux distributors and new contributors that are joining to participate in the effort .
The project , which is called Moblin , aims to assemble a Linux stack that is optimized for mobile Internet devices , subnotebooks , and integrated car computing systems that are designed to use Intel 's Atom processor .
The latest organization to join the ranks of Moblin supporters is Taiwan 's Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , which will be working with Intel to establish a Moblin development facility .
Intel is also investing in VMAX , a mobile carrier in Taiwan that plans to roll out a WiMAX network .
Moblin is designed to provide fast boot times , finger - friendly user interfaces , low energy consumption , and a small memory footprint .
Although it was originally built on top of Ubuntu , the Moblin developers have since shifted towards the Fedora ecosystem and the platform now leverages an RPM - based package model .
Moblin is designed so that major Linux distributors can adopt the components and integrate them into their own software platforms .
Several commercial Linux companies have already committed to making Moblin - based distributions , including Novell , Mandriva , and Good OS , the company behind the web - oriented gOS distro .
Prominent figures in the Linux community view the emerging MID and netbook markets as a big opportunity for Linux .
When we talked to Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin earlier this year , he pointed out that the low licensing costs and high flexibility of the open source Linux operating system make it a strong contender for dominance in this space .
He also enthusiastically endorsed Moblin and said that he considers it to be one of the most open and community - friendly mobile Linux efforts .
Although there is a lot of potential for Linux growth on MIDs and netbooks , there are also a lot of challenges .
Hardware vendors are struggling with integration issues and are having difficulty putting together drivers and delivering adequate usability .
Intel 's Moblin effort could help address many of those challenges by bringing together Linux distributors and hardware vendors around a shared stack that provides working drivers for common hardware components and top - level user interface elements that are well - suited for mobile devices with small screens and touch input .
The Moblin laboratory that Intel is building with Taiwan 's MOEA will provide training and consulting services to hardware makers and software vendors who want to build products with or for the Moblin platform .
Intel believes that this will speed up Moblin adoption and help Taiwan 's hardware companies get their products to market faster .
Intel 's cooperation with VMAX and $ 11.5 million investment is another important part of the deal .
The WiMax rollout will provide a strong mobile network that will make it possible for consumers to get more out of MID products and other portable computing devices that rely on good connectivity .
Intel is putting a lot of resources into advancing mobile Linux adoption and making Moblin a solid platform for device makers .
If Moblin can resolve some of the problems that have afflicted Linux device makers and offer a more cohesive platform specifically for Atom - based devices , it could be a big win for the open source operating system .
One - time punk pin-up and sometime anarchist John Lydon has mellowed further into middle age by starring in a £ 5 m TV campaign for Country Life butter .
The campaign , available to watch exclusively at MediaGuardian.co.uk , marks the first time the 52 - year - old has appeared in a TV commercial .
" People know I only do things that I want to or that I believe in and I have to do it my way , " said Lydon on deciding to appear in the TV ad .
" I 've never done anything like this before and never thought I would , but this Country Life ad was made for me and I could n't resist the opportunity . "
It seems a far cry from 1977 , when the punk movement was riding a crest of popularity and Lydon and the Sex Pistols caused outrage by releasing God Save the Queen during the week of the Queen 's silver jubilee .
The anti-royal song was a hit but outraged traditionalists , so much so that Lydon was reportedly attacked in the street .
The Country Life advert cashes in on Lydon 's standing as a British icon , albeit of the nihilistic variety .
He is seen wearing a tweed suit and gallivanting around the countryside , suggesting reasons why he might prefer Country Life , before settling on the fact that the Dairy Crest - owned brand simply tastes better .
" It 's not about Great Britain , it 's about Great Butter , " runs the slogan .
The ad , created by WPP agency Grey London , appears on TV for the first time tonight on ITV during the Pride of Britain Awards .
In recent years Lydon has led a quiet life , gaining attention in 2006 by competing in I'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of Here ! , in which he was pecked by a group of ostriches before remaining true to his anarchist roots by walking out before the final .
By appearing in the advert Lydon might be courting a new controversy .
Dairy Crest has just announced that it is seeking job cuts and could close its Nottingham dairy .

NSA revelations to have lasting implications Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008

This ACLU considers revisiting lawsuit alleging spying on innocent citizens Following the ( actually - not - all - that - surprising ) bombshell that the National Security Agency has been eavesdropping on calls between innocent US citizens , activists are considering re-opening a lawsuit alleging the government 's infringement upon constitutional rights .
An appeals court last year dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the NSA , arguing the plaintiffs the ACLU represented could not prove they had been targets of warrantless surveillance the NSA had engaged in .
Now that ABC News has revealed evidence of NSA spooks listening to innocent Americans ' private phone calls , the civil liberties group may ask the court to reconsider .
" Everything is being discussed right now , " ACLU attorney Jameel Jaffer told RAW STORY this week .
Jaffer , who directs the ACLU 's National Security Project , said ABC 's report , based on a forthcoming book by NSA expert James Bamford , undercuts the Bush administration 's arguments that its so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program was narrowly targeted and did not intercept innocent communications .
He said the revelations that NSA operatives listened to members groups of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders bolster the ACLU 's legal challenges to the surveillance program on behalf of other aid organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , whose members also believe they were spied on .
" The response we got from the government ( to the lawsuits ) was , ' You 're crazy , these surveillance programs were directed at terrorists , ' " Jaffer said .
" But now we see they target those kinds of organizations are the kinds of organizations whose communications are being overheard . "
The ACLU filed a lawsuit in July on behalf of international aid organizations , journalists and lawyers seeking to scuttle a law updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which Bush flouted to authorize his warrantless surveillance programs .
Fears of an ' Abu Ghraib ' defense ABC's Brain Ross spoke to two military whistle blowers who worked at an NSA listening facility at Fort Gordon , Georgia .
Ross reported that " hundreds of US citizens overseas have been eavesdropped on as they called friends and family back home . "
The whistle blowers shared stories of transcribing and archiving completely innocent conversations , while they and their colleagues would pass around recordings of phone sex and other intimate conversations like they were intra-office e-mail forwards .
Jaffer said he fears the Bush administration will avoid accountability by blaming any surveillance abuses on the military personnel inside the monitoring center without scrutinizing those higher up the chain of command .
" They will use an Abu Ghraib defense , " he said , referring to the Iraqi prison camp where abuses by US soldiers were documented .
" They will blame low - level actors for policy decisions that were made at the top " Disclosures follow months of surveillance law wrangling After years of wrangling , Congress gave President Bush the expanded authority he wanted to conduct international surveillance .
Thursday 's report suggests lawmakers may have passed the FISA Amendments
Act without fully appreciating how the surveillance they were authorizing was being used .
" The likelihood is that these kinds of problems have only become more pervasive and more severe , " Jaffer said .
Key lawmakers say they had no idea that such abuses were taking place .
Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , the Intelligence Committee chairman who was widely criticized by civil libertarians for supporting the president 's FISA proposal , released a statement Thursday calling the new allegations " extremely disturbing " and promising an investigation .
" The Senate Intelligence Committee is examining this now and we have requested all relevant information from the Bush Administration .
Any time there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of Americans it is a very serious matter , " he said .
" The Congress has enacted tough laws  including the FISA reform bill passed this year - and there are strict procedures in place governing intelligence surveillance when it involves U.S. persons .
The Committee will take whatever action is necessary to ensure those rules are followed and any violations are addressed . "
Intelligence Committee members received access to internal Bush administration documents last fall concerning the warrantless wiretapping program .
The classified documents were believed to include orders signed by Bush every 45 days reauthorizing the warrantless surveillance program along with Justice Department memos outlining its legal justifications .
It 's unknown if the Intelligence Committee ever sought or received copies of progress reports or other information from the NSA itself on how the program was being used .
A committee spokeswoman did not return a call seeking comment Friday .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid voted against the FISA update because of a controversial provision it contained granting immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the warrantless surveillance .
Reid promised to revisit the FISA statutes when Congress considers renewing the Patriot Act next year .
Constitutional lawyer Glenn Greenwald blames Rockefeller and others in Congress for not investigating the Bush administration further before expanding its authority under FISA .
Even once
The New York Times finally told the country that the Bush administration was breaking the law  only after the Times concealed the story for a full year  the Senate Intelligence Committee never bothered to investigate what the Bush administration was doing with its secret , unlawful spying powers , whether those powers were abused , which Americans were spied upon , and how they were selected .
To this day , they have never bothered to investigate those questions .
The conservative Heritage Foundation takes a nothing - to - see - here - folks approach to the disclosures , arguing that no laws were broken because at least some of the conversations were made on satellite phones , which it says are not covered by FISA .
Furthermore , the government apparently believes it has unfettered right to listen in on its employees , according to ABC .
An intelligence official told the network that " all employees of the US government " should expect eavesdropping as a matter of national security protection .

What the heck ?
They have Obama at 248 and McCain at 160 ?
And North Carolina is “ almost leaning McCain ” because one poll shows him up 20 and another poll shows him up 4 ?
That is n’t enough to put it in the “ leaning ” column ?

There ’s definitely something seriously wrong with their count there .

Do n’t worry .
And the count is fairly accurate ...

If people continue to get “ sick ” of the obama ... I may have to agree with you .

Changeset 3726 adds two little methods to ActiveSupport : Enumerable #group_by and @ Array#in_groups_of@ .
Enumerable #group_by is for collecting an enumerable into sets , grouped by the result of a block .
Useful , for example , for grouping records by date .
latest_transcripts.group_by(&: day ) .each do |day , transcripts | p " #{day} -> #{transcripts.map( &: class ) * ' , ' } " end " 2006-03-01 -> Transcript " " 2006-02-28 -> Transcript " " 2006-02 -27 -> Transcript , Transcript " " 2006-02-26 -> Transcript , Transcript "

Clothing call dispute
RNC Chairman Mike Duncan throws back the blame for Sarah Palin 's wardrobe by telling MSNBC that the McCain campaign asked for the RNC to pay for the clothes , and it came as part of the coordinated campaign .
This comes after a McCain advisor had said that it was entirely the RNC 's call to purchase the clothes ( at around the 2:45 mark ) , and Palin blamed it on party bureaucracy .
Neither wants to be seen as responsible for the clothing blunder .

" It is hard to imagine that ' undecideds , ' like restless phantoms with unfinished business , still haunt these final hours , " said Kathleen Parker in The Washington Post .
Believe it or not , they 're still out there as this long campaign ends , waiting for " the perfect choice . "
But that does n't exist , of course , so " these zombies of the voting booth " are in for a tough call .
That 's good news for John McCain , said Dick Morris in The Hill .
Because Barack Obama 's " uniqueness , charisma , and assertive program have so dominated the dialogue , " this election is now a " referendum " on the freshman Democratic senator from Illinois .
Anyone who still is n't sold is likely to " break for McCain . "
Not if history is any guide , said David Kuhn in Politico .
" In the past eight presidential contests , voters who made up their minds during the last week of the campaign never went for either ticket by large margins of 3 - 2 or 2 - 1 , which potentially could tip the scales . "
A more even split , even if it leans in favor of McCain , wo n't be enough to erase Obama 's big lead in the polls .
No matter what you think you 've heard , TV commercials really do n't get louder than the programs they accompany .
Production tricks only make them sound like they do .
It 's called " inconsistent " or " perceived " loudness .
Perceived or not , the problem likely will get worse with digital television .
The annoyance is real enough that U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo is making a federal case of it .
Fed up to her ears at being blasted off the couch by commercials , the California Democrat introduced a bill in Congress called CALM -- the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act .
It would require the Federal Communications Commission to set standards to keep commercials from running at louder volume than the shows around them .
A similar rule in England takes effect next month .
" There 's been a shockingly lot of reaction , " said Eshoo aide Jason Mahler , who noted that the bill quickly picked up nine co-sponsors .
" It 's all been favorable . "
That 's no surprise .
The FCC puts " abrupt changes in volume during transition from regular programming to commercials " high on the list of complaints it gets from consumers .
" I particularly notice it on the Weather Channel , not only with commercials , but also during their ' Local on the 8s , ' which blasts the local forecast , " said Bonnie Kinkopf of Lyndhurst .
" Instead of making us pay closer attention , it 's an annoyance .
I never think to hit mute ; I just turn the volume down or change the channel . "
Ann Zakelj of Willoughby Hills was equally specific : " If there 's anything more annoying than pre-pubescent siblings hawking autos , " she said , " it 's pre-pubescent siblings hawking autos in decibel levels high enough to shatter a windshield . "
But solving the problem -- or identifying it -- is n't as simple as it might sound .
Eshoo 's bill tells the FCC to regulate a problem that does not technically exist -- but is an issue that engineers say could worsen when television goes fully digital in February .
" This is something that has gone on way too long , " said Frank Foti , whose Cleveland - based Telos Systems Group essentially sets the standard for audio - processing equipment in radio .
" People in Washington can do some bogus things , but in this case , they have a point , and it 's something we can fix .
The clock is ticking . "
Why the ads seem louder
Commercials really are n't louder than programs .
Because of limits imposed on TV signals , an ad can't be louder than the loudest part of the show with it .
But going from , for example , a drama with hushed dialogue to a shouted commercial pitch introduces what is called " perceived loudness . "
And perception can reflect manipulated reality .
" A TV program has a mix of audio levels , " Eshoo said .
" There are loud and soft parts .
Nuance is used to build the dramatic effect .
Most advertisers do n't want nuance .
They want to grab our attention , and to do this , they record every part of it as loud as possible . "
That involves audio compression , which shrinks the range of sound in a commercial .
Used frequently in radio , compression tends to boost softer sounds to the level of louder ones .
Measured on a meter , it means that a commercial can have a higher and louder average sound level than a program while not exceeding the show 's peak loudness .
The difference between the average level of a relatively uncompressed program and a highly " sweetened " commercial is noticeable .
Inconsistent loudness is typically more pronounced with local ads and when switching between cable channels , which have a wide disparity of volume levels .
High - definition television adds more variables
Brooke Spectorsky , general manager of WKYC Channel 3 , said there are also noticeable differences among digital , high - definition channels .
Digital television has a wider dynamic range , or loudness spectrum , than analog channels , and networks have n't agreed on a common setting for digital audio .
" When it 's done right , it 's phenomenal , " he said of digitally delivered sound .
" But the complexities are significant , and the technology needs to catch up with it . "
Channel 3 , the only local station broadcasting full 5.1 - channel surround - sound with HDTV , invested in volume - control equipment to normalize levels and deliver a more consistent signal .
Foti's Telos Systems Group is taking its first big step into television with loudness - control equipment .
The group 's Linear Acoustic Division already has installed it at a station reaching Eshoo 's district in Silicon Valley , which feared losing viewers and revenue over complaints about inconsistent loudness .
Foti hosted a demonstration for the Cleveland chapter of the Society of Broadcast Engineers this month during a discussion about the need for audio equalizing with digital television .
He said that properly equalized audio should keep viewers from straining out of their seats to hear whispered dialogue and being jolted out of them by sudden loud noise .
It also could keep the FCC from being told to regulate something it has so far avoided .
The commission only controls peak audio signal and recommends viewers contact broadcasters or advertisers with other complaints .
In Britain , new rules from the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice take effect July 7 .
They require broadcasters to bring the " maximum subjective loudness " of ads into line with program levels and say that " advertisements must not be excessively noisy or strident . "
Dan Jaffe , senior vice president of the Association of National Advertisers , said loud ads are " not high on the list of complaints " they receive , possibly because they do n't deal with local commercials .
But the group 's technical committee is reviewing Eshoo 's bill and the coming switch to digital .
" Clearly , advertisers are not trying to annoy their customers , " he said .
" They spend multibillions of dollars to try to effectively reach customers .
Consumers are well - armed to respond if they do n't -- to turn it off , turn the sound down or block ads completely . "

Sweet …Pirate My Book Please
Guest post : Dan Morrill , Program Director at City University of Seattle
BitTorrent needs to do things to survive the lawsuit roiled atmosphere that is happening world wide .
There is no argument ; there is a lot of stuff on BitTorrent that literally belongs to someone else .
BitTorrent however is part of the landscape ; it is something that we all have to deal with , both in terms of a legitimate and non legitimate content distribution channel .
With the permission of my publisher , and in talking to some of the best people in the world when it comes to helping people generate buzz , I uploaded my book into BitTorrent to see what would happen .
For me this is a marketing decision , and not something that I am overly worried about , because I am giving the eBook away for free anyways , this allows me to control the release and gather good stats on the process .
Mininova offers that opportunity , so my marketing person and my publisher both agreed that this would be a grand experiment to see how well BitTorrent equates to additional sales if any .
I am not worried about the sales , what I am interested in is how the data is distributed using BitTorrent as a CDN ( Content Distribution Network ) .
For bands , for new publishers , for eBooks , using BitTorrent as a CDN makes sense , especially if you have marketing goals in mind .
Does it matter if it generates additional sales ?
No not really .
Does it matter if you want to build buzz around your book , definitely .
If you own the copyright , Mininova ’s foray into using Bittorrent as a CDN can power a lot of good things .
The biggest one is helping generate buzz , most small bands , most small publishers who are doing eBooks or music do not have a global network to distribute their goods .
Access to the global network is going to be spotty ; you have the choice of ITunes that has cross border licensing issues or Google searches , which are not always going to be effective .
Here is how the data breaks out though :
The above picture is the global distribution channel for the book in the first 24 hours , with some 691 downloads .
What makes me particularly happy is the picture below .
The reason this makes me happy is that Africa is one of those places where knowing how to run an ecommerce shop , or even in alliance with a larger ecommerce site can help a person raise themselves out of poverty .
You can track all the stats on the book right here if you want to .
While the book is written in English , and aimed right at American business and business law , the basic principles apply universally .
Have something that someone wants , and price in a range that people can afford to buy at .
This works regardless of local or international borders , and seeing the book being downloaded in chronically economically depressed regions is very good to see .
The pie chart below also shows how the country distribution breaks out overall , while I am not surprised by the American stats , what is interesting to me is to see outside of the country .
The book is not distributed globally ; no one has global rights to the book outside of me .
Seeing the UK , Canada , and Australia downloads coming in at 18.2 % is also good .
The book can help them out as well .
India is the surprise at 5.2 % .
Overall , with the number of downloads , this has been amazingly successful as a way to generate marketing buzz , and the potential to reach an international audience .
The book is too pricy for people living on less than a dollar a day , but if sales should pick up internationally , or even locally that will be an interesting thing to see .
Sales in the last 24 hours have remained the same as they have been since the book came out .
It is at least a steady seller .
Overall I would have to rate my experience with Mininova over the last 24 hours as highly satisfying , and something that people who do not mind using BitTorrent to distribute their free eBook , or other digital good should check out .
While it has yet to equate to sales , what is has done is build buzz , as a marketing process , this can not be beat .
As a survival mechanism for Mininova , this can be their saving reasoning , because they are offering a valuable service , not everyone has access to a CDN .

“ I send my tormentor hurrying
hither and thither in the
service of my
suffering and desire . ”
– Mason Cooley ( d.2002 )
I have concluded that Americans , who pretend in public to be straitlaced , are in fact rabid masochists addicted to whips , black leather and the application of fists .
It turns out that large numbers of people throughout the world are accidentally asphyxiated every year because they need to be choked for maximum pleasure .
The diagnosis of national masochism is the only thing that can satisfactorily explain the poll numbers in the presidential race .
Let ’s get this straight .
The Republican Party came to Washington , DC , in 2000 with a solid majority in both houses of Congress and on the Supreme Court , allowing them to steal the presidency , as well .
If you wanted to know what a pure Republican - Party government unhindered by the Democrats , Libertarians , Greens or Socialists might look like , this was the moment .
So they came to power when there was a budget surplus bequeathed by a Democratic president .
They immediately ran up a big deficit every year since , doubling the national debt from $ 5 trillion to $ 10 trillion .
You do n’t run big deficits of $ 300 and $ 400 billion a year in good times according to Keynes .
You save the the deficit spending for a recession , when the economy needs a jolt .
If you ’re already racking up a big deficit every year in a good economy , you have no way of making a difference during a significant downturn except by then going for a truly mega - deficit , which risks destroying the value of your currency abroad .
In a service economy like that of the US , a dollar with a declining value might not even help the economy via exports very much , since the manufactured goods are being made down in Mexico now , anyway .
Note that Clinton had been talking about using the surplus to pay down the debt or to fix the looming crisis in social security .
With the government encumbered with $ 5 trillion in new debt before September , and now with another trillion and a half ( probably when it is all said and done with ) , how exactly will social security be fixed ?
( Hint : Republican leaders such as Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich hated social security , because the people are grateful to the Democrats for it .
Bush tried to privatize it and McCain would have helped him ; you wonder if they are trying deliberately to destroy it .
Social security is the main reason for which the elderly are not now , as they were in the 1930s , the poorest and most miserable section of society . )
Then many of the Republicans came to Washington with a crooked plan to use fraudulent methods to ensure that campaign financing went almost exclusively to them through super - lobbyists like Jack Abramoff .
Grover Norquist ’s K - Street Project aimed at guaranteeing big corporate dollars for the Republicans in exchange for their granting the corporations the right to write the legislation affecting their industry .
Thus , laws governing pharmaceuticals were written by the pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and just signed off on by the Republicans .
This scam goes beyond Marx ’s fear that government in a business society was just a “ managing committee ” for the business classes .
Tom Delay , from 2002 the Republican Party majority leader in the House , was too lazy even to be the managing committee !
The K - Street crowd just let the business classes run the legislature directly , themselves , having the regulatory laws written to suit them .
So Abramoff , Delay , the K - Street crowd are busted .
Once upon a time such a thing would have been a huge political scandal and would have haunted the party that produced it .
But because US Big Media is mostly Republican - owned , it just quietly subsided as a story .
It is not just that the rap sheet against the Class of 2000 , 2002 , and 2004 among the Republican politicians is longer than a trans -Atlantic cable , it is that so much of the corruption took the form of a conspiracy .
All parties have people in them looking to get rich on the side .
But the K Street Project and various other such scams were n’t just about individual aggrandizement .
They were about fixing the whole American system permanently to kow - tow to the super - rich without so much as a whimper , and to positively punish the middle classes .
After the 2002 mid-terms , even George W. Bush wanted to do a tax cut for the middle classes .
But Cheney over - ruled him , insisting on another deep tax cut for the very wealthy .
We won the mid-terms , Cheney said .
This is our due .
Deficits do n’t matter .
“ Our ” due ?
Cheney is saying that the Republican Party is the party of the super - rich , of the 3 million at the top of American society who own 45 % of the privately held wealth ( as though we were Brazil ) , and they are the ones that will be exclusively benefited by Republican rule .
Of course , there were many other conspiracies by the pirouetting pirates of plunder .
There was the Iraq War , one of the great criminal conspiracies of modern times .
Barton Gellman has how related the story of how Dick Cheney lied to Dick Armey before the vote on the war , telling him that Saddam ’s family was all al - Qaeda and that Saddam ’s evil scientists had made a suitcase nuclear bomb that he would certainly turn over to Bin Laden , and such rank horse manure as that .
Dick Armey weeps , says he deserved better than to be bullshitted by the vice president of the United States .
They took us to war against a country that had not attacked the United States ; they killed or maimed 33,000 Americans , and turned a whole Arab Muslim country into a burned - out hulk , displacing millions and continuously bombing the very cities that they had conquered and occupied , killing and disfiguring .
They propagandized us with implausible lies about mobile biological weapons labs and Baathist al - Qaeda , and our journalists and their corporate bosses bought them hook line and sinker , as did the public .
Cable and satellite television “ news ” tells us nothing of elections in India or constitutional crisis in Thailand , and barely mentions a major workers strike at Boeing .
Dozens of car bombs go off in Iraq and we are told it is “ calm ” now .
It is a vast electromagnetic form of bread and circuses , wherein hapless celebrities and philandering politicians are fed to the lions before millions of cheering plebes , by corporate moguls desperately hoping that the marks will not notice the legion of pickpockets in the arena , relieving them of their purses .
This crew in Washington thought nothing of assiduously attempting to induce the press to out a covert CIA operative working against Iranian nuclear proliferation , Valerie Plame .
Their culture of lies is such that they attempt to divert attention from all the phone calls to journalists by Irv Lewis Libby and Karl Rove trying to get the press to print her name by saying that those two did not succeed .
As if the attempt were not dastardly !
Why is trying to inform the Iranians of the identity of a CIA field officer assigned to spy on Iran not an act of treason ?
After all , you ca n’t inform the world without also informing the Iranians .
Is n’t the punishment for treason hanging ?
The Republican Party conducted a vast illegal spying operation on Americans and on foreign diplomats .
We still do n’t know why exactly , and that the operation had domestic political motivations cannot be ruled out .
They imposed on us this so - called PATRIOT act that gutted the Constitution .
The peaceful protesters in St. Paul at the RNC were actually charged with being terrorists , in this Brave New World .
By their incompetence and cupidity the Republican politicians deeply damaged the relief effort for one of America ’s great cities , New Orleans , which will never see the $ 33 billion pledged for its reconstruction .
Not to mention that levies and bridges are breaking and falling down all around us because Cheney did not want to tax his billionaire friends to pay for the country ’s infrastructural upkeep .
And then they so radically deregulated and removed any oversight from the banking system that they came within hours of presiding over a 1929 - style absolute meltdown of the entire financial and securities system .
To cover the criminal activities of their cronies , they are now proposing to impose a fine of one trillion dollars on the middle class , to ensure that their partners in crime will receive their $ 25 million Christmas bonuses and be held harmless for their misdeeds .
And in the wake of the greatest and most sustained act of systematic plunder since the Mongol hordes appropriated to themselves the riches of everyplace in Asia from Beijing to Isfahan , the reaction of the supine and slave - like American voting public is to scratch their heads and have a hard time deciding if they would like more of the same .
Despite his aristocratic prerogatives and connections in high society , even the Marquis de Sade himself was brought down by a lowly maid , who complained to the police of his cutting her while having his way with her , leading to his arrest .
In contrast to that plucky domestic servant , the American public appears to enjoy being lacerated while being badly used , moaning with delight at each new act of abuse and abasement , while , blue - lipped , gasping for air .
One worries for our children , threatened with the fate of the homeless street children so common in the sort of third world country into which we are being turned by our managing committee .
But , well , if you are determined to bend over on November 4 , at least I hope you enjoy pain .
In that case , you are going to be ecstatic .
For the past week , it feels like I 've been running a Lego sweat shop .
Hour after hour , my kids and I worked our way through 5,922 ( very small ) pieces to complete the Lego Taj Mahal – Lego 's biggest kit , piece - wise , to date .
It took us more than 19 hours to finish the model , which is 20 inches square and about 16 inches tall .
We had a blast building it , hunting for all the pieces and putting them together .
Each step of the way , I took a photo and put together a short video of the build – step - by - step .
Once again , Lego really knocked one out of the park .
I 've really become a big fan of their monument series - the Statue of Liberty , the Eiffel Tower ... and now the Taj Mahal .
Unlike some of the large scale Star Wars models , the monument kits are far more sturdy and less nerve - wracking to build .
The model was a great opportunity for education , too .
All during our construction , we talked about where the Taj Mahal is located , how it 's really a mausoleum , and some history about why it 's so famous .

Every night for six weeks after the diagnosis , I woke up with a start at 2 or 3 a.m. and became hysterical for an hour or two .
I woke my husband , Glenn .
" What 's wrong ? " he asked .
" It 'll be fine , " he said .
In the end , my doc and I decided I was suffering side effects from the sleeping drug zolpidem ( Ambien ) .
I also experienced nighttime
sleepwalking , during which I ate half a pumpkin pie , a carton of ice cream , and a big chunk of good cheese .
I had no memory of these picnics , I just saw the added pounds .
So I gradually got off the zolpidem .
Putting aside the creepiness of a top McCain adviser having to reassure the nation that McCain , at 72 years of age with four bouts of cancer , wo n’t die in office , what Charlie Black said today was particularly damning of McCain ’s VP choice , Sarah Palin :
Mr. McCain ’s advisers said Friday that Mr. McCain was well aware that Ms. Palin would be criticized for her lack of foreign policy experience , but that he viewed her as exceptionally talented and intelligent and that he felt she would be able to be educated quickly .
“ She ’s going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years , and most doctors think that he ’ll be around at least that long , ” said Charlie Black , one of Mr. McCain ’s top advisers , making light of concerns about Mr. McCain ’s health , which Mr. McCain ’s doctors reported as excellent in May .
So Black , the guy who said another 9/11 - style attack on America would help McCain ‘s campaign , is saying that McCain ’s VP does n’t know a thing about national security , but she can learn on the job over the next four years , you know , like night school .
We ’re at war .
And they ’re admitting that Palin may be our next commander in chief on day one , if McCain were to die or fall ill in office , yet she knows nothing about national security , and has never met a world leader .
I , a blogger , have met more world leaders than McCain ’s VP .*
Chew on that .
(* We had the two hour lunch with Bill Clinton two years ago , and when I worked on the Hill I attended a private sit down meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin in the early 90s .
At the Rabin meeting , were only 8 or so of us in the room , and not enough chairs , so I was standing up against a wall , Rabin saw me , scooched over , and made me share the chair with him .
I was mortified , and very impressed . )
Sexual Violence in World War II New German Study Looks at Rape Trauma 60 Years On
A new German film explores the fate of one of the many women who were raped by Red Army soldiers at the end of World War II .
A research project launched the same week is hoping to find some of the victims more than six decades later .

Government agents should not have the right to stop and question Americans anywhere without suspicion within 100 miles of the border , the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday , pointing attention to the little known power of the federal government to set up immigration checkpoints far from the nation 's border lines .
The government has long been able to search people entering and exiting the country without need to say why , which is known as the border search exception of the Fourth Amendment .
After 9/11 , Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security the right to use some of its powers deeper within the country , and now DHS has set up at least 33 internal checkpoints where they stop people , question them and ask them to prove citizenship , according to the ACLU .
" It is a classic example of law enforcement powers expanding far beyond their proper boundaries – in this case , literally , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , who heads the ACLU 's Washington , D.C. , Legislative Office .
The ACLU says it has scores of complaints from citizens and wants Congress to investigate and roll back the buffer zone .
According to a map the rights group released Wednesday , some 190 million citizens live within what the ACLU dubs the " Constitution - free Zone . "
DHS spokesman Jason Ciliberti says the ACLU 's description of the zone as " Constitution - Free " could n't be further from the truth and that the check points follow rules set by Supreme Court rulings .
" We do n't have the abilitty to just set up checkpoints willy - nilly , " Ciliberti said .
" The Supreme Court has determined that brief investigative encontuers do not constitute a serach or seizure . "
When citizens or visa holders encounter a checkpoint , most are waived on after showing identification , but if an agent suspects the person is not lawfully in the country , the agent can detain the person until the agent 's investigation is satisfied .
The government has long had the power to set up such check points , but has recently expanded the number of permanent and ' tactical ' check points and deployed them in areas they had n't before – such as near the Canadian border .
The courts , however , are not on the ACLU 's side — and have regularly ruled that the Fourth Amendment 's protections do n't extend to the border area , airport screening or even to laptops at the border .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOuj-WzAoAIn a video shown to reporters at a national press conference event Wednesday , retired San Diego social worker Vince Peppard complained that he and his wife were stopped at a checkpoint on a road east of San Diego on I - 94 , many miles after crossing back into the United States with tiles he'd bought in Mexico .
When he refused to let the Customs and Border Protection officer search his car , the officer led him to a bench , called in the contraband dog and then " ransacked " his car .
" I did n't feel like I was inside the U.S. , " Peppard said , calling the search on the side of the road embarrassing .
" I felt like I was in a B - movie with Nazis asking for my papers . "
ACLU attorney Chris Calabrese is certain there are more people who have been negatively affected than have complained .
As an example , he cited Seattle 's domestic ferries , where DHS agents ask passengers for ID to check their citizenship and use license plate readers .
" The people who live on these islands are undergoing this extra scrutiny just when they are going to get their groceries , " Calabrese said .
Customs and Border Protection Cilberti's says he did not specifically look into Peppard 's case , but said that refusing a search does not create probable cause for a search and that if a CBP agent searched his car , it 's because their experience and training made them believe they had probable cause .
The ACLU hopes that Congress will include changes to the border zone in traveler privacy protection bills that focus on prohibiting suspicion - less searches and seizures of laptops at the border .
Congress is currently out of session and would not move on any legislation until sometime in 2009 at the earliest .

With 137 applications to look at , I 'm quite sure I may have missed one of your favorites .
There were several applications geared to developers that I think deserve notice , but not being a coder could n't decide which ones would be most beneficial for people that do code .
There were also a lot of food oriented applications .
Apparently Rails developers are a hungry bunch .
Of all of the food applications , I thought WantNom had the most accessible interface and concept .
Also , there were a fair share of odd applications .
One of these is Ostraka , an application that lets you ostracize people you think are evil around the world .
I am not sure if I like this one or not as it seems like it could breed negativity , and I think there is already plenty of that to go around these days .
There were also applications for students , readers , note takers and more .
Regardless of which you pick , all 137 are worthy of taking a look and placing your vote .
If you have a favorite application you think I missed , let us know in the comments so we can check it out .
Aide : " Impossible to know " if McCain will be in DC for bailout vote
Aide : " Impossible to know " if McCain will be in DC for bailout vote
Amie Parnes just reported this jaw - dropper .
John McCain 's top economic adviser reiterated his conceptual support for the bailout to reporters -- but a spokesman told Politico he's not sure the Arizona senator will actually be on hand for the vote , which now seems likely to come Wednesday :
On a conference call with reporters on Sunday , [ economic adviser ]
Douglas Holtz - Eakin said Sunday that McCain staff members are “ looking at the proposal . ”
“ We have every expectation that the House will be able to move quickly , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
“ The senator ’s goal all along was to put in place a process that would address the problem and respect the American taxpayers ’ dollars . ”
Asked if McCain would return to Washington for the vote , “ It ’s impossible to know until the vote has been announced , ” Tucker Bounds , a McCain spokesman , told Politico .
( CNN ) --
A growing number of Americans believe John McCain has attacked Barack Obama unfairly , a negative perception of the Arizona senator that could cost him at the polls on Election Day .
Americans say Barack Obama would be a stronger leader but John McCain has the edge in experience .
According to a new survey from CNN and the Opinion Research Corp. , nearly six in 10 Americans believe McCain has unfairly gone negative in his bid for the White House .
That percentage is significantly higher than it was in September , when just 42 percent thought the Republican presidential nominee was running an overly negative campaign .
It also is higher than the 39 percent of Americans who believe Obama has gone unfairly negative on McCain .
Obama also has a slight lead over McCain when it comes to who is considered a stronger leader , an advantage that McCain had long held over the Illinois senator and one that has been a chief talking point of his campaign .
In recent weeks , both campaigns have stepped up spending on negative television ads and launched attacks at each other 's record .
But comments from both McCain and running mate Gov. Sarah Palin questioning Obama 's relationship with former 1960s radical William Ayers have drawn particular scrutiny .
The GOP ticket 's recent suggestion Obama will seek to carry out " socialist " policies has also garnered negative reactions .
Obama 's image may also be benefiting from his huge financial advantage and the number of ads he is able to air compared with McCain .
Obama can afford to produce positive and negative ads that could serve to soften his own image while hurting McCain's , Campaign Media Analysis Group 's Evan Tracey , CNN 's consultant on ad spending said .
" McCain ca n't afford the positive ads Obama can , " Tracey said .
" It 's not likely McCain can raise his own positives with only a couple weeks left , but he can hope to raise Obama 's negatives . "
But the clear perception that the Arizona senator has run a more negative campaign than Obama may hurt the Republican presidential nominee 's chances of a comeback as the end of the race draws near .
" In previous elections , both candidates have been viewed as attacking the other unfairly , so the penalty for doing so has tended to cancel out in past years , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" But this year McCain faces that problem all by himself , so any blowback affects only him while Obama seems above the fray . "
In what could be more bad news for McCain , the new CNN / ORC poll indicated that 47 percent deem Obama the stronger leader while 44 percent give the nod to McCain .
That 's a striking departure from a similar poll in early September showing close to 60 percent viewed McCain as the candidate with better leadership qualities .
" It 's unclear what has changed the numbers on leadership , " Holland said .
" It 's possible the cumulative effect of the debates had something to do with it .
Debate audiences ranked Obama as the stronger leader after all three debates , and by increasing numbers as the debate season progressed . "
Obama is also seen as having a clearer plan for solving the country 's problems , and more voters say they would be more proud to call Obama president than McCain , 49 percent to 37 percent .
The Illinois senator is also viewed more favorably than his White House rival : 63 percent have a positive view of Obama while 56 percent view McCain favorably .
But the Arizona senator continues to enjoy an advantage on the issue of Iraq and terrorism , and poll respondents believe by a 13 - point margin that he has better experience to be president than Obama .
But on the most pressing issue , the nation 's economic woes , Obama continues to hold nearly a 20 - point advantage over McCain -- a chief reason for the Illinois senator maintaining a 5 - point lead on his rival overall .
That 5 - point lead , however , is down from an 8 - point edge in a poll conducted October 3 - 5 .
The new poll shows a significant enthusiasm gap between members of each party .
Even after the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice presidential candidate -- a move that appeared to energize her party 's base -- only about a quarter of GOP voters say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting this year .
That 's about half the amount of Democrats who say they feel that way .
The poll was based on interviews with 1,058 adult Americans -- 983 of them registered voters and 746 of them " likely " voters -- conducted by telephone Friday through Sunday .
Each question had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points , except on the question of enthusiasm , for which the sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points because it was split between Democrats and Republicans .

The Bureau of Meteorology says a cold front has caused unusually late snow falls west of Sydney and in south - east New South Wales .
It says it has had reports of half a centimetre of snow at Blackheath in the Blue Mountains , west of Sydney .
There have also been reports of light snow falls at Cooma , Berridale and Bombala , in the state 's south - east .
About 7:30 am ( AEDT ) , Blue Mountains resident Pablo said it was snowing heavily in the area and the temperature was only about two degrees .
" We 've had a bizarre morning , " he said .
We 've had hail , which settled a bit , and then we had a thunderstorm and now it 's been snowing for the last 20 minutes . "
A local resident in the village of Delegate , in south - east NSW , has described the scene where she lives as " absolutely beautiful " .
" There 's snow on the ground and all the trees are covered .
It 's a beautiful picture , " Gloria said .

Ex -Official : Palin Lied , Threw Me Under Bus Fired by Palin , Walt Monegan says he wants to clear his good name .
October 14 , 2008  --
The man at the center of the Sarah Palin " Troopergate " scandal says the Alaska governor lied about him , and he wants his reputation back .
Last month , Palin called her former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan " insubordinate " and accused him of having had a " rogue mentality " while he was part of her administration .
She leveled those charges in a filing to the state Personnel Board , justifying her dismissal of Monegan .
Now Monegan has formally complained about those accusations to the same panel , and is asking its members to hold a fact - finding hearing " to clear his good name , remove the stigma he has suffered , and redress his reputational interests . "
The board is investigating the Troopergate affair , in which Palin is accused of firing Monegan for his refusal to take action against Mike Wooten , a state trooper once married to Palin 's sister , whom the Palins long accused of misbehavior .
Last Friday the state Legislature completed its own review of the matter , finding that Palin violated state ethics laws by allowing her husband to use her office to bring pressure on state employees regarding her long - running animosity towards her sister 's trooper ex-husband .
It also concluded that Monegan 's refusal to fire Wooten " was not the sole reason " but was " likely a contributing factor " to his firing .
Monegan called Palin 's charges against him " absurdly baseless , " filled with " disturbing inaccuracies " and " distortions of the record " in filings to the board submitted Monday .
The accusations , his lawyer wrote , were part of an " unwarranted , unfair , and very personal attack on a man who has served the people of Alaska with distinction for almost 35 years . "
" [ T ] hrowing Mr. Monegan under the bus apparently was deemed a suitable , if wholly dishonorable , strategy to try to stem the questions and pressure building in what became known as ' Troopergate , ' " wrote attorney Jeff Feldman .
The filing counts four different explanations from Palin for why she fired Monegan , and rebuts each .
It also slights Palin aide Randy Ruaro for accusing Monegan of " going off the reservation . "
That was both unsubstantiated as well as a " clumsy " choice of words , wrote Feldman , noting Monegan 's Tlingit Native heritage , and the state 's large Native American population .
" All that Gov. Palin and her spokespeople have done have been to answer the questions he 's raised , " McCain - Palin spokesman Taylor Griffin said when asked about Monegan 's accusations .
Palin 's initial explanation for firing Monegan – that she wanted " to move in a new direction " – was a convenient , face - saving measure , given " so as not to embarrass " Monegan with the insubordination accusations , said Griffin .
He said Palin leveled her charges of insubordination only after Monegan publicly raised the possibility he was fired over trooper Wooten .
" I guess that would be explanation number five " for Monegan 's firing , retorted Feldman .
Asked whether his personnel board filing was an overture to a civil suit against Gov. Palin , Feldman said , " Mr. Monegan seeks only that which was wrongly taken away from him , and that is his good name . "

Joseph Stiglitz shared the Nobel Prize in 2001 partly on the basis of an important paper of his ( with Greenwald ) : " Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets . "
In that paper he says : " There exist government interventions ( e.g. , taxes and subsidies ) that can make everyone better off . "
Stiglitz is a prolific , outspoken , and outstanding spokesman for the pro-government school .
Stiglitz sees market imperfections that are remediable by government everywhere he looks ; and this paper is supposed to provide the intellectual and analytical foundation for government intervention .
I will argue that this important and oft - cited paper completely fails to prove the potential worth of government interventions .
Murray Rothbard 's views directly oppose those of Stiglitz .
In his paper " Toward a Reconstruction of Utility Theory and Welfare Economics , " Rothbard writes : " We conclude therefore that no government interference with exchanges can ever increase social utility , " ( his emphasis ) .
Whose view is correct is tremendously important as it touches upon the entire realm of political organization .
If Stiglitz 's pro-state view is correct , it provides justification for the interventionist state .
If Rothbard 's anti-state view is correct , then it removes the justification for all government activities , including those supposedly justified by externalities .
Since the set of externalities can be made almost indefinitely large by liberal interpretation , it is important to assess Stiglitz 's arguments that the state should or can raise social utility by operating on externalities .
I will examine Stiglitz 's views primarily on his home ground , that is , with reference to his theorizing or his model .
This shall be done in a way that does not burden the reader with his mathematics yet is completely faithful to his equations .
At the end of the argument , the reader will understand exactly why we can reject his conclusion .
The Stiglitz Model
The Stiglitz model has no mathematical errors in it that I know of .
The equations follow one another correctly .
The implications are correctly deduced from the premises .
The problems with the model are deeper than mathematical .
The fundamental problems with the model involve its treatment of government and the treatment of externalities .
Stiglitz grafts these onto the standard neoclassical model of exchange and production .
The grafts , however , are ad hoc , incomplete , and inconsistent with what they are grafted onto .
The resulting theory provides no support for government .
Stiglitz starts with a standard timeless neoclassical model of general equilibrium under certainty , and part of the paper extends it to uncertainty .
The paper 's innovations include ( 1 ) a simple method by which to tell whether in the model there is a set of taxes , subsidies , and lump - sum transfers that indicate a positive net " government " revenue while leaving household utilities unchanged , and ( 2 ) applications of the model to several situations that had previously been treated in disparate fashion .
These innovations , which I do not criticize , are responsible for the paper 's fame .
Model Basics
There are two sectors in the basic model , households and firms .
In standard neoclassical fashion , the households maximize utility and the firms maximize profits .
Firms are " black boxes " that process inputs into outputs according to some fixed technology , so they do nothing interesting in the model .
The paper 's purpose is to explore the effects of externalities on the Pareto optimality of household and firm optimizations .
The paper extends the neoclassical model .
We could dismiss the whole exercise as flawed because of its neoclassical unreality , but , as I have said , I propose to entertain the neoclassical model core and show that even if we accept it , Stiglitz 's extensions are unacceptable .
Stiglitz ( and other neoclassical economists ) model utility as depending on two sorts of items .
One is goods that are produced , traded , and have prices .
( Later in the model , the " government " will be alleged to do particular things regarding these goods such as tax them . )
The second is items ( called externalities ) that are not traded and do not have prices in the model .
They do not appear in the budget constraints of the households ( or firms ) as costing anything , but the household utilities are affected by them .
Because they do not appear in budgets and cannot be traded but do affect utility , household optimizations leave possible utility gains on the table .
The equilibrium is therefore not Pareto optimal when these externalities are present .
Government in the model is an entity that leaves each household 's utility unchanged while maximizing its excess of tax revenues over lump sum transfers to households .
This is its behavior function .
The only way that it can have such an excess is when there are externalities .
When such an excess occurs , it amounts to money or utility left on the table by households and firms .
Such sub-optimization has to occur by the assumption that neither is able to trade certain goods that affect profits and utility .
The implications follow implacably from the assumptions .
Four Main Criticisms
Now , what are the fundamental criticisms of this model ?
There are four big questions .
In the model , the households and the firms optimize , yet somehow they are still not as well off as they can be .
They leave gains on the table that are sopped up by government .
Why do n't households and firms fully optimize , that is , take into account the externalities ?
In the model , why is government able to recognize the externalities and compensate for them by a series of taxes , subsidies , and transfers while households and firms cannot and do not ?
In the model , what sort of entity is this government and how does it relate to the entities that it is taxing ?
What does the entity called government have to know in order to effect the taxes , subsidies , and transfers ?
I consider each of these questions in turn .
Why do n't households and firms optimize fully ?
Stiglitz posits that they optimize utility , which is standard neoclassical economic theorizing .
Assume that there are externalities .
A genuine theory would explain how the externalities arise even while households and firms optimize .
It would introduce a theory of costs or some other factors that cause externalities .
This is essential if it is to be argued that government can recognize and overcome these externalities .
Stiglitz provides no such theory .
He simply inserts the externalities into utility and production functions without prices and then allows households and firms to optimize .
This procedure can be done mathematically , which is what Stiglitz does , but it is entirely ad hoc .
It lacks theoretical justification because the externalities in the model do not themselves arise in the context of other optimizing actions of the economic actors .
I do not say that there should never be ad hoc theorizing .
There is a cost and benefit to it , and there will be times when it is worth doing .
But in a case where the central message is to promote government and downplay markets , it just will not do to introduce the reason for government in an ad hoc manner .
There is a further problem with introducing externalities in an ad hoc fashion , namely , model inconsistency .
The Stiglitz model is an equilibrium model , which means that everyone has already done the best they can possibly do .
From that perspective , private parties already have done the best they can do in order to internalize the externalities ( create contracts , exchanges , and prices for them ) .
It is then inconsistent with the spirit of optimizing models and equilibrium models to introduce ad hoc externalities .
Where do they come from , and why are n't they already priced out ?
The Stiglitz model contains at its core an ad hoc element that drives all the results and that is inconsistent with the optimizing and equilibrium assumptions of the model .
It assumes that actors who otherwise are absolutely punctilious about optimizing utility and profits ignore the potentialities of taking externalities into account .
The model has inconsistent assumptions .
Why is government capable of optimally rectifying externalities ?
Households and firms ignore the externalities , but the optimizing government does not .
Why is government so perspicacious ?
In fact , to Stiglitz his key equation " provides a simple set of necessary conditions characterizing the optimal level of taxes in the presence of externalities . "
It is true that this equation makes sense within the model — once one grants the existence of externalities and the existence of an entity called government with the properties that the model endows it with .
It says that the government should push the tax to the point where its marginal cost ( in terms of consumption and utility losses ) equals its marginal gain ( in terms of lowering a negative externality . )
But why does the government optimize a measure of profits by taking into account the externalities and the other sectors do not ?
The theory provides no explanation .
Stiglitz introduces this optimization as a mathematical convenience , employing it as a simple way to test for Pareto optimality .
But he also regards government as a separate entity that interacts with households and firms which are the other entities of the model .
If government is a real entity as he supposes , how and why does it have an optimizing capability that households and firms lack ?
Stiglitz never tells us .
He places another basic inconsistency at the heart of the model .
What actually is government in the model ?
This issue is very important because there is absolutely no doubt that Stiglitz considers the government in his model to be a basis for government policies and government interventions to improve upon market economies , not only in this paper but in many subsequent writings of his .
Logically , within the model 's confines , the government is either a creature of the other economic actors ( households and firms ) or it is not .
If it is an institution created and run by the household and firm sectors to rationalize externalities , then ( assuming that it can and will do this and that it is the optimal means of doing this ) , we actually are not dealing with government at all in the usual sense of the word .
We are dealing with a voluntary means of negotiating exchanges , a kind of a market , and we are not dealing with coerced taxes .
There is in this case no warrant whatever for speaking of the model 's government as representative of the state .
Real government is not an ongoing type of firm created and managed by the private sector to iron out certain problems .
If it were , it would not be marked by the extensive power that it has to impose measures .
It would not be marked by life and death debates over its every action .
It would not be marked by divisions between one part of it and another and between it and society .
It would not be marked by what seems to be its creation of conflicts and externalities that rive society .
It would hardly be the destroyer of money or of wealth or the inefficient manager of every activity that it touches .
On the other hand , if the government is the coercive institution in the model that we know it to be in reality , then how is this to be explained ?
What actors in the model create the government ?
What actors run the government ?
What are their optimizing behaviors in running it ?
What are their costs and how are they spread over the other actors ?
The fact is that Stiglitz never describes what this government is or how it comes about .
He never even describes its basic properties .
Government in the model is basically ad hoc .
It is motivated to produce taxes , subsidies and transfers to achieve optimality in a manner that is nowhere described .
It simply does it .
There is no warrant for making this assumption and there is no warrant for taking it to be characteristic of actual government .
Stiglitz cannot sensibly talk about what government should or should not do without a theory of government .
What does government have to know in the model in order to accomplish its task ?
The list is staggering :
For each and every household , the marginal effect that a tax has on each and every good that that household consumes ;
The rate of change of each firm 's profits with a change in each externality ( holding all else constant ) and the rate of change of each firm externality with a change in tax , all else held constant ;
The rate of change of each household 's spending with a change in each externality ( all else constant ) and the rate of change of each household externality with a change in tax ( all else constant ) .
If we again stay within the confines of the model itself , there is nothing in it that tells us how the actors who govern are supposed to acquire this information or what the acquisition costs are .
If we think of the model as being re-optimized as time passes , then there is variation in the parameters and the governing actors would have to acquire even more information .
In or out of the model , the information requirements present an impossible task .
Where does the knowledge of the required rates of change reside ?
Preferences and production technologies are not self - evident .
They are internal to human beings .
It is not clear that humans either know them or can communicate them , certainly not in the detail required by a social planner .
They possibly learn them over time and they surely alter over time .
Under these conditions , the economic actors affected can surely not rely on a set of social planners or engineers to tell them what they , the actors , prefer or how they plan to produce a good , or even what goods they plan to produce .
If a government is introduced into the model as a device to tax , subsidize , and make transfers , it is entirely an ad hoc device .
There is no economic theory of how it can accomplish these tasks optimally , or how the actors expect it to do so , or empower it to do so .
In sum , in terms of real economic theory the Stiglitz model is about as empty on the issue of externalities and government as it can possibly be .
It is simply a mathematical representation of ad hoc assumptions .
Not only that , these assumptions conflict with the optimizing and equilibrating that goes on in the rest of the model .
Other Problems
I will now mention a few other serious problems that the Stiglitz model ignores , although my intent is not to provide a complete list .
There is not in reality a fixed set of goods or production technologies .
The problem faced by a Stiglitz government is a dynamic one .
But it can't even identify the sets of items that the household and firm sectors are optimizing over at an instant in time .
In or out of the model , it is not at all clear that government , however constituted , is somehow better suited to handling externalities than free markets .
The real economic questions concerning externalities are why they arise , how they relate to property rights , what to do about them , or when it pays for interested parties to do something about them .
In a sense , they are no different than any other kind of inefficiency .
Therefore , the presumption is that free exchanges can address the perceived costs and benefits associated with them whereas government is ill - suited to the task .
Stiglitz , by introducing externalities in an ad hoc way , simply assumes that free markets have already failed .
This is why the Stiglitz government appears as the promoter of economic efficiency .
In the Stiglitz world , some goods are taxed , others subsidized , everyone adjusts , and then some find themselves better off as a consequence , and no one is worse off .
This is done continuously as the economy evolves .
As prices alter , the pertinent taxes and subsidies alter too .
If it is not done continuously , quite possibly an imposed tax will lower welfare when tastes , conditions , and prices shift .
So , logically , to assure betterment , it will have to be done continuously .
This means an infinite cost of transacting .
Hans -Hermann
Hoppe has correctly pointed out that so - called public goods can change their character and become private goods ( and vice versa ) depending on the state of mind of the actor .
This adds to the burden of the government 's already - impossible information requirements .
The model ignores the fact that future opportunities are altered when the government intervenes .
With government in the picture preempting action , no private sector actor has an incentive to overcome the reasons for the initial inefficiency by internalizing the externalities .
The means have been pre-chosen as the tax , subsidy , and transfer schemes .
Therefore innovation is stifled .
If a lower cost or superior method could have been found , it will not be if the solution is government .
In an economy with Stiglitz government interference , whenever any new product is invented , there is uncertainty about its relations with other products and processes .
The producer has no way of telling what externalities the government will deem important enough to intervene in the markets .
The presence of the state will chill many markets and potential markets .
The chances are that future production , trade , and original appropriation will all be deterred .
Of course , Stiglitz entirely ignores any malicious acts by government .
He ignores any power dynamics .
If government is capable of intervening in markets across the entire economy on the basis of externalities , the chances of gains in power are greatly increased .
Stiglitz ignores any error - correction mechanism when government makes mistakes in its assessments , that is , government failure .
If government were to be the institution to handle externalities , we can be quite sure that its incentive structure would make it inferior to free markets in correcting mistakes .
Conclusion
Stiglitz believes that his theory ( model ) demonstrates an economic role for government in principle .
Upon this basis he has for years promoted government solutions and denigrated free markets .
Stiglitz believes only in mathematical neoclassical models .
Even if we grant him his preference , he has still completely and entirely failed to prove his point that government has a potential role in alleviating externality losses .
He has given us an inadequate and incomplete theory with inconsistent and ad hoc assumptions .
His equations contain no theory of government whatever and for that reason alone they cannot possibly provide us with real - world prescriptions .
We can have no confidence that the Stiglitz model captures the essential aspects of real world economizing that it purports to .
We therefore can have no confidence in any belief that rests upon this or similar theories that government has a proper role to play in increasing economic efficiency or social welfare by use of taxes , subsidies , and transfer payments .
