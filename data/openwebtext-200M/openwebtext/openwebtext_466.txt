As everyone knows , Democrats have struggled for generations with the perception that they 're out of touch elitists .
Barack Obama is no exception .
He lives in Hyde Park , Chicago and ever since his book became a best - seller he 's made a whole bunch of money .
As a part - time professor at the University of Chicago he came to be acquainted with various pointy - headed professor types and he even ordered an orange juice at breakfast once which is the exact same kind of juice they serve at breakfast at the Aspen Ideas Festival .
By contrast , John McCain is an all - American regular guy who , like most people , earns his keep by marrying an heiress .
Like average , everyday folks the McCain 's rely on credit cards to make ends meet month - to - month " Cindy McCain charged as much as $ 500,000 in a single month on one American Express card and $ 250,000 on another , while one of their two dependent children had an AmEx card with a monthly balance as large as $ 50,000 . "
Yes it 's true , one of McCain 's dependent children spent approximately the median annual household income of the United States in a single month and that 's how McCain knows how to connect with regular people .
Similarly , Mrs. McCain " favors suits made by the German designer Escada , which typically retail for around $ 3,000 a pop " so she understands that most Americans welcome Wal - Mart 's discount prices .
And like many Americans , the McCains are very effected by developments in the real estate market , since " trusts and corporations controlled by her and her children spent nearly $ 11 million between the summer of 2004 and February 2008 on three condominiums in Phoenix and a pair outside San Diego . "
The McCains understand that these days many young people graduate from college saddled with debt and need a helping hand , that 's why they spent " $ 700,000 for a 1,900 - square foot , three - bedroom loft condo for her then - 22 - year - old daughter Meghan McCain " after she graduated from Columbia .
Similarly , they know all about problems with inflation since they " increased their budget for household employees from $ 184,000 in 2006 to $ 273,000 in 2007 , according to John McCain ’s tax returns . "

James Tramel went from convicted murderer to priest while in prison , a transformation that the Episcopal Church used to successfully lobby for his parole and celebrate him before politicians and the press .
But the church is now grappling with the sexual abuse of a parishioner under his care .
Tramel has been suspended for sexual misconduct , temporarily stripped of his priestly authority and left searching for a new job .
The San Francisco - based Episcopal Diocese of California now faces questions of whether , in its haste to proclaim Tramel 's story , it redeemed and promoted him too quickly .
Convicted of second - degree murder in a 1985 slaying , Tramel went to seminary and was ordained a priest while incarcerated in a state prison in Solano County .
After he was paroled early in 2006 , at the urging of the Episcopal bishop of California , Tramel was quickly placed at the helm of the historic Trinity Episcopal Church in San Francisco .
It 's there that the victim said Tramel , who is married and has a young child , took advantage of her during counseling sessions .
" They did n't give an honest depiction of this man , " said the victim , a 36 - year - old San Francisco resident .
The Chronicle does not identify victims of sexual abuse .
The diocese acknowledges that Tramel abused his power and committed sexual misconduct , according to diocesan spokesman Sean McConnell , as well as a letter from diocesan Chancellor William Orrick and other documents .
Tramel has been suspended for two years , but he can apply for reinstatement after the suspension is served .
Tramel did not return calls .
The victim has asked for $ 265,000 for therapy and to move from her rent - controlled apartment , which is near the Bush Street church , where the relationship started .
She also asked that Tramel be prohibited from resuming priestly duties .
The diocese countered with an offer for " spiritual support " - an offer the victim said infuriated her because it would replicate the situation in which she was taken advantage of .
But the diocese is adamant about its stand .
" That 's the only thing the diocese felt - and feels - it owed to her , " said Lawrence Lossing , the diocese 's outside counsel .
The victim said she wanted to go to church because she was a struggling alcoholic .
God or " a higher power " plays a key role in 12 - step recovery programs , but she says she did n't understand the concept .
She thought going to church would help .
She chose Trinity , the oldest Episcopal church on the West Coast .
When she started attending Trinity in 2007 , Tramel encouraged her to come to him for counseling , and they began having sex , she says and the church acknowledges .
Sex between a priest and a parishioner he or she counsels is against church laws , with no exceptions .
The victim says she feels like Tramel manipulated her into the situation .
The victim said the diocese and its current bishop , the Rt. Rev. Marc Andrus , failed to supervise him adequately .
" I feel like the reason they rushed him was because he was such a compelling story , " said the woman .
Andrus declined to comment .
He is in England at the once - a- decade gathering of bishops in the Anglican Communion , the 77 million - member global body that is represented in the United States by the Episcopal Church .
The Telegraph , an English newspaper , named him this week as one of the 20 most influential Anglicans in the world .
When Tramel was placed at Trinity , Andrus approved the decision .
Yet Lossing said Andrus had no power in the situation involving Tramel .
" Obviously , Andrus is nothing but the representative , the titular head of the diocese , " Lossing said .
" He does n't have any individual legal investment here . "
But the victim said Andrus should have taken more action to supervise a priest with a murder rap .
" If Andrus had taken his responsibility more seriously , this would n't have happened , " she said .
Tramel 's story was once told as a triumph over past history .
Tramel was 17 and a student at a Santa Barbara prep school in 1985 when he and a classmate , David Kurtzman , sought to retaliate against gang members who had harassed a group of friends , according to trial transcripts .
Instead , they found 29 - year - old Michael Stephenson .
Kurtzman stabbed Stephenson to death .
Police described it as a " thrill kill . "
Tramel , who did nothing to help the victim , according to transcripts , was deemed a ringleader and sentenced to 15 years to life .
He admitted his role in the killing , according to parole hearing transcripts .
While in prison , Tramel earned a business degree and a master 's degree in theology from the Church Divinity of the Pacific in Berkeley , the Episcopal seminary .
He was ordained by then - Bishop William Swing in 2005 .
He became a member of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Berkeley and as a clergyman gave sermons via telephone there every few months .
Swing used his 2005 Easter sermon to call Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger a " 90 - pound moral weakling " for refusing to parole Tramel earlier .
And when Tramel was released , Swing referred to Tramel 's transformation as proof of the resurrecting power of Jesus Christ .
Tramel 's parole in March 2006 was bitterly fought by Edward Stephenson , 79 , the father of the murder victim .
He 's not surprised that Tramel is accused of taking advantage of a vulnerable parishioner after being paroled .
" He 's a manipulator , " Stephenson said .
" The church wanted to show that he was a real good guy , " Stephenson said .
" You 've got a lot of people behind him with a lot of power . "
WASHINGTON --
The Food and Drug Administration is withholding a list of Chinese heparin suppliers requested by congressional investigators looking into problems with tainted supplies of the blood thinner , saying confidentiality agreements prevent release of the companies ' names .
Members of Congress also are concerned that Chinese heparin manufacturers and their raw - material suppliers did n't fully cooperate with an FDA inspection team in February , after the heparin crisis erupted internationally , and barred the FDA from complete access to some workshops , records and workers .
An FDA compliance official testified to a congressional subcommittee April 29 that the FDA could try to revisit facilities in China , but said , " I can not say whether they will admit us or not , or whether they will allow us to do a full inspection . "
Tensions between congressional Democrats and the FDA over the agency 's handling of the heparin problem and its willingness to disclose information have escalated in recent weeks .
" The FDA thinks they have it under control , but they really don't , " said the congressman leading the investigation , Rep. Bart Stupak ( D. , Mich . ) .
The FDA 's reluctance to release the Chinese companies ' names is a red flag , he said .
" If I was the FDA director , I 'd shut down every drug coming in from China " until they were deemed safe , he said .
KOLKATA , India ( Reuters ) -
An Indian man who took an impersonator to court to get a divorce faces legal action after his real wife found out , lawyers said Friday .
Sanjib Saha presented a woman as his wife in a lower court in the eastern city of Kolkata this month .
Both said they sought a mutual divorce , something the court granted immediately .
Saha ’s real wife was then asked to leave the marital home .
She has since appealed the ruling at a higher court , charged her husband with cheating and the original divorce was suspended .
“ The case exposed the legal loopholes in our system , ” Kaushik Chanda , lawyer of Saha ’s real wife , said .

Most people just create amusing videos to fit their favorite songs , but James Houston went one step further and synchronized a bunch of obsolete gadget noises to recreate Radiohead 's " Nude . "
A Sinclair ZX Spectrum 8 - bit PC was used for rhythm and lead guitars , an HP Scanjet 3c was used for bass guitar , an Epson LX - 81 Dot Matrix Printer was used for drums , and an array of hard drives were used as bad speakers to distort and reproduce vocals and effects .

This song came about as a call for remixes by Radiohead for " Nude . "
Houston notes that most of the entries were lame , and he wanted to do something a little different that fit in the theme / alternate song title offered ( Bad Ideas : Do n't Get Any ) .
And he also came up with this video , which has an awesome retro , Daft Punk-ish Human After All vibe .
It 's entirely possible this was all made on a computer or keyboard , but I 'll take it in good faith it was made as the creator claims .
And I 'd say this is n't just a little different , it 's way different and damn spectacular .

The vortices are made more visible in this image by subtracting off everything but the vortices .
These vortices are responsible for stopping the motion of the atoms .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
Most of us would agree that 32°F , the temperature at which water freezes , is a pretty cold day , but what about - 320 °F , the boiling point of nitrogen … or - 452 °F , the boiling point of helium ?
These temperatures are incredibly hot compared to the atom gases I work with as a graduate student in Professor Brian DeMarco 's lab at the University of Illinois .
We do experiments with atom gases cooled to only 10 billionths of a degree above absolute zero ( - 459.67 °F ) .
Atoms at room temperature move at about 500 feet per second , but after we cool them they move at mere tenths of an inch a second , about 10 times slower than the top speed of a common garden snail .
How do we accomplish this feat ?
The key is a combination of laser and evaporative cooling .
Refrigeration using lasers might seem odd , since lasers can be used to cut and mark stainless steel , like the back of an iPod .
The laser light in our experiment , which consists of billions of billions of tiny packets of energy called photons that fly past the atoms each second , is special because it only scatters off the atoms moving towards the laser light , causing them to slow down .
You can imagine this process as similar to slowing down a car using a stream of many tennis balls traveling in the opposite direction .
Trapping atoms
Laser cooling is limited to refrigerating the atom gas to temperatures near a millionth of a degree above absolute zero .
So , just like your body sweats to regulate its temperature , we use evaporative cooling to reach the lowest temperature possible in our experiment .
After laser cooling , we turn off all of the light and the atoms are trapped using magnets .
We force the highest energy atoms to leave , and the atoms left behind become colder .
We do n't need to worry about getting frostbite since all of this happens inside an insulating vacuum container .
We cool these atoms to such low temperatures so that their behavior is dominated by quantum effects .
Quantum mechanics may seem exotic , but it affects every aspect of your life , from the chemical basis of your metabolism , to the forces that prevent your feet from falling through the floor .
The quantum behavior of many particles together is the foundation for much of modern technology .
For example , materials like the semiconductors inside computer chips , which consist of electrons traveling through crystals formed by ions , use the quantum behavior of those electrons to make transistors .
Some quantum effects in materials are not well understood , such as what happens inside " high - temperature " superconductors that can operate at temperatures higher than the boiling point of nitrogen .
In a superconductor , the resistance to flow of electrons through the material vanishes below a certain temperature .
Superconductors , already common in MRI machines in hospitals throughout the country , could be used for much more ( such as saving energy in transmitting electricity from a power station to your house ) if they would operate at even higher temperatures .
Physicists do n't know how to accomplish this , because we do n’t understand much about how high - temperature superconductors work .
We can't even use our most powerful supercomputers to simulate these materials — right now we can only calculate the behavior of about 10 electrons , compared to the millions of billions of billions of electrons in a superconducting wire .
Every 10 years , advancements in the speed of computers let us add only one electron to a computer simulation .
We 're trying to shed light on these materials in our lab using a very different approach called quantum simulation .
We have built a system which replaces the electrons with ultra-cold atoms and the ionic crystal with a crystal of light .
The result is what we call a quantum simulator , because we have replaced the system we wish to understand with something we can easily measure and manipulate .
Actual materials require sensitive probes to look at the electrons and special and time - consuming techniques to change the material properties .
With our simulator we can directly image the atoms and change the nature of the " material " just by changing knobs in the lab .
The idea of using one quantum system to simulate another was first imagined by Richard Feynman in 1981 , a physicist awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 , and who assisted in understanding how O-ring failure led to the Challenger disaster in 1986 .
What grad students do
Being a graduate student on a project like this entails many responsibilities .
First , we had to build our simulator , which is one of the most complex experiments that can be done in a lab about the size of a large bedroom .
The equipment is spread over two steel tables that weigh 1000 pounds each and are floated by air pistons to reduce vibrations .
The experiment uses more than 10 different lasers and hundreds of mirrors and lenses .
We have shelves of electronic components and several computers to run the whole thing .
Fortunately , we only had to set everything up once .
My role as a graduate student primarily involves running the experiment and making measurements .
Sometimes we run the experiment with a certain result in mind .
However , like all science , usually a bit of luck is involved .
Every once in a while we get a result that we cannot understand at first .
These are the most exciting because they add to our knowledge by challenging what we already know .
Our recent discovery involved a set of experiments looking at the atoms moving through the crystal of light .
We discovered that quantum vortices ( similar to the whirlpools in your bathtub ) play a role in slowing down the atoms .
To understand this result we had to talk with researchers at Illinois who work with superconducting wires and sheets .
They told us that vortices had been observed to interrupt the flow of electrons in tiny superconducting wires , but that process is not completely understood , so our measurements may help to better understand these materials .
As a graduate student this was a good opportunity to observe how different areas of physics can work together and understand that discovery is rarely the result of an individual working in isolation .
Right now we are trying to invent other ways that we can simulate materials .
For example , we are working on adding disorder to our crystal of light to understand how impurities in materials affect superconductivity .
We can't wait to find out what new science we will discover next !

Abstract
Massively multiplayer online role - playing games ( MMORPGs ) are one of the most interesting innovations in the area of online computer gaming .
Given the relative lack of research in the area , the main aims of the study were to examine ( a ) the impact of online gaming ( e.g. , typical playing behavior ) in the lives of online gamers , ( b ) the effect of online socializing in the lives of gamers , and ( c ) why people engage in gender swapping .
A self - selecting sample of 119 online gamers ranging from 18 to 69 years of age ( M = 28.5 years ) completed a questionnaire .
The results showed that just over one in five gamers ( 21 % ) said they preferred socializing online to offline .
Significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they found it easier to converse online than offline .
It was also found that 57 % of gamers had engaged in gender swapping , and it is suggested that the online female persona has a number of positive social attributes in a male - oriented environment .
Interest Rates Will Rise Regardless of the Fed ( June 10 , 2008 )
A very well - informed correspondent recently asked why interest rates have barely budged despite the Federal Reserve dropping the Fed Funds rate from over 5 % to 2 % .
I asked frequent contributor Harun I. to help explain the relationship , but let 's start with standard explanations : The Federal Funds Rate and How It Works : Although banks would like to loan out every dollar they can , the Federal Reserve mandates that they keep a certain amount of cash , or reserve balance , on deposit at their local Federal Reserve branch office at all times .
The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserve balances .
Each month the Fed , through its Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , targets a specific level for the federal funds rate .
This rate directly influences other short - term interest rates , such as deposits , bank loans , credit card interest rates , and adjustable - rate mortgages .
Longer - term interest rates are indirectly influenced .
Usually , investors want a higher rate for a longer - term Treasury note or bond .
In other words , the Fed sets targets and pulls some monentary levers , but the price of money is still set by the market .
What The Fed Funds Rate Drop Means For You : The Fed Funds rate doesnt directly affect mortgage rates .
In simple terms , mortgage rates dropped because investors were pleased at the Feds decision to lower the Fed Funds rate ; when investors are happy and confident in the US Economy , mortgage rates will generally go down .
The Fed Funds rate is only a target interest rate ; in other words , the Fed doesnt just come out of its meeting and say , " Let the Fed Funds rate be 4.75 % , " and it just happens .
The Federal Funds Rate is the rate at which banks lend money to each other , usually overnight , in order to ensure each is meeting the cash reserves its required to maintain .
If one bank has more than it needs , it lends money to a bank that doesnt have enough ; the rate these banks charge each other is called the Federal Funds Rate .
To drive the Fed Funds rate down , the Federal Reserve , in a roundabout way , pumps cash into the banking system .
If banks have more cash , there is less demand for interbank borrowing , which leads to a drop in the Fed Funds rate .
Ideally , the cash the Fed pumps into the banking system will be just enough to keep the economy balanced .
If the Fed pumps too much money in , banks find themselves with a bit of a surplus , which finds its way into the pockets of you and me .
If everyone has more money , they spend more , which means higher demand for products and services , which leads to higher prices for products and services , which is called inflation .
So the Federal Reserve has a real balancing act to play in the US economy .
If inflation starts to increase , mortgage rates will rise again simply because investors will demand a higher rate of return to counter inflation .
So , while the Interest rate drop will spur the economy in the short term , what happens in the long term is anyones guess .
Now let 's take a look at actual interest and yield rates : current money rates ( forecasts.org ) Prime Rate : 5.00
30 Year T - Bond : 4.75
10 Year T - Note : 4.06
91 Day T - Bill : 1.85
Fed Funds : 1.98
LIBOR 3 Month : 2.70
Mortgage Rate 30 Year : 6.09
What the above explanations hint at but do not address is the role of risk in setting interest rates .
For more on that , let 's turn to Harun 's comments and a chart he graciously provided :
The disconnect between long - term rates and the Fed funds rate is the so - called " conundrum " of the Fed : " Hey , we are pulling the levers but nothing is happening " .
The Fed has lowered rates at the velocity of light and banks still will not lend to on another .
To me this says in no uncertain terms that banks do not like the risk / reward scenario , i.e. the compensation they would receive ( interest ) was , and still is , not worth the risk .
Rates should rise until banks feel they are being adequately compensated for the risk to which they are exposed .
The Bond / Gold ratio chart can be thought of as a spread chart .
It essentially indicates performance based on a condition of being long one asset , in this case bonds and short another , gold .
If the line is going up that means the spread is narrowing and that you have a successful trade .
If the line is going down the spread is widening and you are in a losing trade .
Historically there has been a coupling or gearing where bond prices moved in tandem with the RS ( relative strength ) line , or maintained a relationship with the price of gold ( and commodities ) , this represents value .
Since 2003 an unprecedented decoupling in this relationship has occurred ( the spread has widened beyond anything in my data set ) which indicates that either gold is severely overvalued or bond prices are overvalued and therefore the risk is undervalued .
The common reasons seem to be that since 2003 money and credit have been expanded exponentially to unprecedented levels thereby creating unprecedented liquidity which in turn created distorted ( inflated ) prices .
That the Fed is currently printing money with reckless abandon is refuted by data that we have seen coming from sites like Mish , which indicates that the Fed is destroying capital as rapidly as it is creating it .
But this a recent phenomenon and only creates stasis .
What the Fed has been fighting is a delaying action ; it has created a situation where losses can still be hidden but the previous excess of liquidity created by previous monetary policy still exists .
Interest rates as indicated by relative performance to gold should be much higher or the price of gold should be much lower ; the chart is clear and irrefutable .
There are also simpler reasons .
Investors are flocking to bonds in a flight to safety driving the prices up and yields down .
This is exacerbated by technical buying that is triggered by price movement but ignores value .
The empirical evidence ( the current ongoing calamity in debt markets ) suggests that interest rates should indeed be higher .
The RS charts are quietly and dispassionately indicating fraud , whether consequential or intentional I will leave for others to decide .
If the Fed were not accepting junk as collateral and an asset 's risk of holding had to be assessed by free market forces , I believe this condition would have corrected by now or at least the process would be well underway .
Here is what I do know :
At some point the relationship will normalize .
This may happen slowly or swiftly and it can happen in several ways :
Gold can fall in price while bonds stay the same or rise .
Bonds can fall in price while gold either stays the same or rises .
Gold can fall in price and bonds can fall in price but do so at a greater rate than gold .
Bonds and gold can rise in price but with bonds doing so at a greater rate relative to gold .
There are probably are more permutations but you get the idea .
Regardless of the why , which may not be fully understood for some time , we know that :
1 . There is an unprecedented mispricing of assets .
2. Normalization will occur , catastrophically or gradually .
3 . We have our charts to see when this is occurring and can position to take advantage .
To clarify my understanding , I asked Harun to explain the relationship between bond prices and yields : A bond 's coupon yield , or nominal yield , is set at issuance and printed on the face of the bond .
The nominal yield is a fixed percentage of the bond 's par value .
A coupon of say 6 % , indicates a bondholder is paid $ 60 in interest annually until the bond matures .
Current yield ( CY ) measures a bond 's coupon payment relative to its market price ( Coupon payment / Market price = Current Yield ) .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions : as bond prices rise , yields decline and vise versa .
When a bond trades at a discount , its current yield increases ; when it trades at premium , it current yield decreases .
Example : A 6 % coupon bond trading at $ 750 has a current yield of 8 % ( $ 60 / $ 750 = 8 % ) .
Conversely , the current yield of a bond bought at a premium is lower than its nominal yield .
If you bought a 6 % bond for $ 1,200 you receive a 5 % current yield ( $ 60 / $ 1,200 = 5 % ) .
So when interest rates shot up in the early 1980s , the yields on newly issued bonds was high ( 15 % ) and as a consequence the market value of old bonds yielding 6 % was essentially destroyed ( dropped to mere pennies on the dollar ) .
What could cause the interest - rate repricing Harun suggested is inevitable ?
Here are some fundamental issues that come to mind : 1 . The risk of loaning money backed by declining real estate is finally priced in .
Once the government guarantees against default or price deflation are exposed as worthless , then what will the price of mortgage money be ?
How about 12 % ?
That was the " average " " typical " cost in the mid-1980s and by no means " impossible . "
2 . The global " savings glut " which supposedly created the global real estate bubble vanishes .
Asset destruction / deflation and recession will remove trillions of dollars from the global system , and like anything which has become scarce , money will become dearer .
3 . Peak oil / stubbornly high oil prices / demand will spur investment in alternative energy even as they drain money from global savings .
If you have to spend twice as much on oil and goods which depend on oil for transportation and manufacture ( i.e. everything ) , then you have less to save .
And if everyone has less to save , then the pool of capital available for investment shrinks .
With virtually every major government borrowing hundreds of billions in deficit spending , reduced global savings and asset deflation , we have increased demand for borrowing as the pool of available capital is shrinking .
That supply / demand imbalance guarantees rising prices for money -- higher interest rates .
Based on the above , I would hazard a guess that interest rates could very easily double and then triple : mortgages will shoot from 6 % to 12 % , and the interest on government debt will skyrocket , diverting tax revenues away from other government spending .
Interestingly ( at least to me ) , Harun 's chart and commentary point to the same possibility .

An Australian woman who was wrongly detained in the United States for three weeks is back home in Adelaide .
Texan authorities arrested 21 - year - old Laura McKenzie over a visa mix - up last month .
She says she spent time in various detention centres and was forced to sleep on a concrete floor and wear dirty underwear and clothes .
Ms McKenzie says she had no idea how long she would be held until a US judge dismissed her case because mistakes had been made .
" They kept telling me it was just a couple more days and I 'd be out and everyone said ' Oh you 'll be out really quickly and yet I was still being kept day after day , " she said .
" It 's so scary because you would think there 's all these other people that have been in there for months and it's like ' What if that happens to me ? ' . "
Steve Schmidt is taking over the day - to - day operation of John McCain ’s campaign , according to multiple campaign sources .
At a staff meeting in the campaign 's Arlington , Va. , headquarters this morning , campaign manager Rick Davis made the announcement about Schmidt 's new role .
Schmidt , a bald and barrel - chested operative known for his aggressive brand of political combat , responded by exhorting campaign aides with a speech that one staffer likened to a locker room pep talk out of the football movie " Rudy . "
After the meeting , on a regularly scheduled conference call with McCain 's 11 regional campaign managers , senior staff briefed the field aides about the move , explaining Davis would focus more on long - range tasks while Schmidt was taking an enhanced daily role , said a person on the call .
McCain sources say Schmidt , who ran Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's reelection campaign and was a top communications aide in Bush - Cheney ' 04 , will coordinate the campaign 's daily pro-McCain and anti-Obama message but also will have an increased role in shaping most every facet of the organization including scheduling , policy , coalitions and surrogates .
Davis will focus more on big - picture issues such as general strategy , helping to plan the convention , picking a vice president and tending to the needs of major donors .
Schmidt has been serving as a senior McCain adviser for months and had recently returned to headquarters to help bolster the Republican nominee 's message operation .
The move comes a year to the day after McCain laid off dozens of staffers as part of a cost - cutting measure that what would ultimately spur a major overhaul of his campaign .
Now , accounts diverge on the exact nature of the new chain of command .
One top McCain source said that Schmidt " assumed full operational control of the campaign today " and described Davis as " a general manager . "
But Charlie Black , another top adviser , said Davis was still in charge .
" Steve is going to function under Rick as a [ chief operating officer ] , " Black said .
" Rick still has authority over all things .
Steve works for Rick . "
But Black made sure to not diminish Schmidt 's elevated role in the campaign .
" He 'll be the maestro who conducts the symphony , " Black said of Schmidt 's position in driving McCain 's message .
Yet McCain sources say Schmidt 's imprint will be felt beyond a campaign message that , until recently , had not been clearly defined .
A handful of his fellow Bushworld veterans are also taking on more high - profile roles .
Mike DuHaime , the former Rudy Giuliani campaign manager and RNC political director who had been split between the RNC and McCain , is likely to take an enhanced role in the campaign .
Further , there is likely to be more structure brought to a political operation that has largely been delegated to the Regional Campaign Managers .
The campaign currently has no political or field director .
Helping Schmidt drive the new daily message will be Matt McDonald , also a veteran of the Schwarzenegger campaign and Bush - Cheney reelection effort , who just started at the campaign a few weeks ago .
McDonald is working with McCain 's press shop in trying to get on offense , sharpening attacks on Obama and pushing a more consistent narrative against the Democrat .
Also coming on board is Taylor Griffin , a former White House and Treasury spokesman , to work closely with reporters and push the campaign 's economic message .
Perhaps most important for the campaign 's image is the addition of Greg Jenkins , a veteran advance man who ran presidential advance in the Bush White House .
Jenkins , also an aide on Bush 's 2000 campaign , is working to ensure better stagecraft of McCain 's events and to avoid a reprisal of the much - mocked green background behind McCain at a high - profile speech last month .
One source familiar with the inner workings of McCain 's campaign said that the move came after a sluggish ramp - up to the general and number of unforced errors had left the candidate , senior staff and elected officials unhappy with the state of the campaign .
" This will help reassure the chattering class in D.C. , " said the source .

Confused how two groups of church - goers can have such conflicting views about whether it 's OK to be gay ?
Both sides of the debate about homosexuality in the church , which threatens to split the worldwide Anglican church , hold their views sincerely and after much study .
So how can their views be so contradictory ?
The Bible makes very few mentions of homosexuality - lesbianism is n't mentioned at all in the Old Testament - and as the examples below show , interpretations of the verses that do exist differ hugely .
Following each of the verses below is a brief illustration of what a hardline pro- and anti-gay position might be .
( Most Christians hold views somewhere in between these two stances . )
An illustration of the division can be seen by what either side might say about the friendship in the Old Testament between David and Jonathan .
One verse reads : " I grieve for you , Jonathan my brother ; dear and delightful you were to me ; your love for me was wonderful , surpassing the love of women . "
PRO - GAY
A pro-gay position might be that this is a clear indication that King David had a gay relationship , and to pretend otherwise is naive .
ANTI - GAY
An anti-gay opinion might be that the friendship between the two men was exactly that - a very close and loyal allegiance .
Similarly , the tale of Sodom is often debated .
In it , Lot has two angels staying in his house .
The men of Sodom surrounded the house .
" They called to Lot and asked him where the men were who had entered his house that night .
' Bring them out , ' they shouted , ' so that we might have intercourse with them . ' "
To protect his visitors from an act which Lot describes as " wicked " , he offers the crowd his two virgin daughters instead .
The crowd are not satisfied and break the door down - the angels then make the intruders blind and Sodom is eventually destroyed by " fire and brimstone " .
ANTI - GAY
An anti-gay argument might say this story demonstrates the immorality of homosexuality , as has been accepted for generations , hence the term sodomy .
Elsewhere in Genesis , God says of the men : " Their sin is very grave . "
It 's an example of behaviour degenerating .
PRO - GAY
Of course the men's behaviour was wicked , but it was wicked because it 's a tale of sexual assault and rape .
When Jesus mentions Sodom , hundreds of years later , it appears to be in a context of a discussion of hospitality , rather than one of sexual morality .
There are several verses in the Bible which are similarly contested - there are however a much smaller number of seemingly clear statements .
The most famous of them is probably from Leviticus : " You shall not lie with a man as with a woman ; that is an abomination . "
ANTI - GAY
An anti-gay position would be that this line is unambiguous .
It is also repeated elsewhere in the book .
The speaker of the words is God , so this is an explicit indication that homosexuality is wrong in God 's eyes .
It was one of the sins that justified God in giving the land of Canaan to the Israelites PRO - GAY
A pro-gay argument might say that other verses in the same book forbid a wide range of sexual activities , including having sex with a woman who is having her period .
This is an indication that the passage embodies specific cultural values rather than God 's law .
There is some debate about how relevant rules in the Old Testament are to Christians .
Some would say they are binding , since Jesus said he did not come to abolish the old laws .
Others would say that Jesus set Christians free from the old laws , highlighting instead that people should love God and their neighbour .
Jesus himself says nothing explicitly about homosexuality .
There are though two statements by him which have been interpreted as having a bearing on the subject .
" [ A ] man shall leave his father and mother , and be made one with his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh . "
ANTI - GAY
This indicates Jesus saw heterosexual relations as the proper way of behaving .
PRO - GAY
Jesus is actually talking about the sanctity of heterosexual marriage Later in the same conversation , after Jesus has spoken about divorce , the disciples say to him it is better not to marry at all .
Jesus says : " That is something which not everyone can accept , but only those for whom God has appointed it .
For while some are incapable of marriage because they were born so , or made so by men , there are others who have themselves renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven .
Let those accept it who can . "
PRO - GAY
This shows that Jesus is more concerned with people looking after their own relationship with God , than with enforcement of rules .
The reference to being " born so " indicates that heterosexual marriage is fine for those who are heterosexual , but it 's OK to be different .
Again and again Jesus reaches out to those on the margins of society , like prostitutes and tax collectors , to include them .
ANTI - GAY
Jesus here is actually talking about people who were born incapable of having children , or people who were castrated - not about gays .
He is actually saying that marriage and chastity are both within God 's purpose .
Jesus does appeal to the sinners , but once he has called them , he tells them to go and sin no more .
The letters of St Paul provide the other traditional support for the position that homosexuality is sinful .
He writes : " God has given [ people who worship false gods ] up to shameful passions .
Their women have exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural , and their men in turn , giving up natural relations with women burn with lust for one another ; males behave indecently with males and paid in their own persons the fitting wage of such perversion . "
Paul later writes : " Make no mistake : no fornicator or idolator , none who are guilty either of adultery or of homosexual perversion , no thieves or grabbers of drunkards of slanderers or swindlers , will possess the kingdom of God . "
PRO - GAY
A pro-gay position might be that the word Paul uses for homosexual here could alternatively be translated as " male prostitute " .
In any case , Paul 's writings are clearly of his time , and there are plenty of other verses which people have no difficulty in ignoring - for instance : " a woman brings shame on her head if she prays or prophesies bare - headed ; it is as bad as if her head were shaved . "
This should be viewed like that .
ANTI - GAY
Anti-gay argument might say this line is crystal clear in establishing that Christianity and homosexuality are incompatible .
Paul is actually quite clearly referring to homosexual behaviour , and includes lesbianism .
You can't just pretend that St Paul , who did so much to influence our understanding of Jesus , did n't know what he was talking about .
He 's clear that homosexuality is an offence against God and against people 's own bodies .
Part of the reason the views diverge so much is because Christians think of the Bible differently .
Some see it as literally the word of God , divine inspiration which humans should not question .
Others see it rather as a book which is a witness to God 's message , but one which was written by humans and thus has flaws .
Trying to find common ground between the two positions is no simple matter - one of the reasons that Dr Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , is having such a tricky job keeping everyone on board .
Quotations are taken from the New English Bible .

It is clear from the pro-gay viewpoints that they will twist and turn every Bible verse they want to say what they want it to say , or otherwise just brush over it and say that we are apparently a more enlightened society in the 21st Century .
The Bible is God 's word and should be the only guide in a Christian 's life .

All academic really ; we will outgrow religion as we 've outgrown our belief in goblins and dragons .
One day we will just accept our mortality , and get on with the business of living .
Nathan , UK
This whole article demonstrates one of the many fundamental problems with the Bible : its ambiguity .
It is so vague and self - contradictory on so many issues that it is useless as a moral compass .
By the careful selection of passages taken out of context , the Bible can be represented as supporting any and every cause or standpoint you can care to name .
Jim , UK
Christians should neither be pro-gay nor anti-gay , because although God hates sin , He still loves the sinners .
Alex Wong , UK
Phew , it 's all clear to me now .
It is obvious that never the twain shall meet on this one .
They should split their church now & stop clogging up valuable news time , time which should be spent on relevant subjects to modern life .
So , a section of a dwindling church does not agree with homosexuality ?
-
Fair enough , but society at large has accepted it has a normal human condition .
Let 's move on & leave them to it .
Roger , England
Jesus ' words have been distorted through time .
Through translations and interpretations no true copy of the Bible exists today .
Mo Murad , UK
It 's good to see some unbiased representation of both views - thanks !
One thing to add : Paul 's own history as an ultra-orthodox Jew may have left something ingrained in his own attitudes .
Before converting to Christianity , he was one of its greatest persecutors , owing to his religious background , and it 's debatable as to whether his views are those which have developed since his conversion ( which I find hard to believe ) , or if he kept them from his strict Jewish background .
Chris , Scotland
" Pro-gay " against " anti-gay " is misleading , as is missing out the wider Biblical picture .
Sex is so good and strong and powerful ( just read the Song of Solomon ) : it 's what puts life into a marriage , and lives into the world .
But used outside of marriage it ultimately perpetuates confusion , difficulty and hurt , even though , naturally enough , something in it seems so ' right ' for a while .
Gavin , England
This is a sensitive issue , but the Bible does not treat homosexual relationships any differently to heterosexual relationships .
The Bible clearly states that any sexual relationships outside marriage are sins against God .
Thus the only sexual relationships which are endorsed by the Bible are those that take place between a husband and wife in marriage .
Brian , London , UK
I think that the main point of this entire argument has been missed .
I believe one of the commandmants was " love thy neighbour " .
Not " love thy neighbour as long as he is not black , gay , has blonde hair ... " .
Surely this statement condemns the actions of many clergyman as their actions of late towrds the homosexual community has been anything but loving .

The question the whole church must ask is simple : What Would Jesus Do ?
Sean , UK
It is always difficult to select verses from the Bible and hold them up as the true word of God if you are going to ignore other opinions which are now considered old fashioned or incorrect .
Slavery is justified in the Bible , yet the modern world sees this as unacceptable .
Surely the point is whether you are a good Christian , not who you choose to sleep with .
Kate Harrison , England
Being anti-gay based on what the bible says is being irrational .
If ' GOD ' rejects homosexuality , why would n't ( couldn't ) he write a less ambiguous text so he can save us the trouble ?
The bible is not a reliable book .
It is full of contradictions , inconsistencies and mistakes .
O Almalik , Netherlands
The church is so obsessed with sex , when it should be more concerned about love .
Jesus said ' love one another as I have loved you ' , not judge one another .
Marie , UK
I 'm 37 years old , an evangelical Christian ( the kind who that believe you can " know " God personally / for real ) , and a struggling celibate .
I knew for sure I was gay at 13 .
Unmistakable gay feelings etc when still a pre-pubescent junior .
I became a Christian at uni , and then two very real worlds collided .
No doubts about the person or reality of God .
Nor of his love for me .
Nor of my sexuality .
My spirit ( and mind ) has always leaned towards my staying celibate - but my heart and emotions want what most do , a settled , loving relationship .
I read the Bible several times - all of it , and as a student too - none of the points raised are new to me .
Following that collision c20 yrs ago , daily I try to work through the reality of my own personal ' collateral damage ' .
Sam , Brit abroad
It is clear that Christians like the Islamic extremists will always quote biblical scriptures that suit their purposes for what ever selfish reasons .
The rate at which the so called " liberals " are going , they will soon be calling for a new Bible .
Niyi Olaloku , Nigeria
The Bible in no ways contradicts itself .
It is self explanatory and we do not need the human corrupt mind to interpret it .
Homosexuality is an abomination to God and is SIN in clear terms .
Let those clergy who are trying to defend it know that the judgment of God is upon them , because the Bible warns us against adding or subtracting the Word of God .
Tabby , Kenya
I think as humans we tend to use religion to explain the unexplainable and to justify why we do what we do .
Life is thus made simpler really , we behave the way we behave because the Bible says so , the problem though is that the Bible is open to different interpretations depending on individual circumstance and what we really want to achieve .
Phumlani , South Africa
This argument is just as touchy as evolution .
There is no real right or wrong answer , one can only interperet it as well as it can be and hope that it is the right one .
Follow the obvious and fill in the rest .
Wyatt Bordewyk , US Being gay is not a sin .
People will see what they want to see or interpret from the Bible .
Jesus died for everybody .
We might remember the Ten commandments about love .

New legislation has been proposed in Iran that could make blogging a crime punishable by death .
Cyrus Farivar has a story on today 's edition of the PRI radio show The World : Iran considers harsh penalty for some bloggers ( 3:30 ) .
Over at Global Voices , Hamid Tehrani writes :
On Wednesday , Iranian members of parliament voted to discuss a draft bill that seeks to " toughen punishment for disturbing mental security in society . "
The text of the bill would add , " establishing websites and weblogs promoting corruption , prostitution and apostasy , " to the list of crimes punishable by death .
In recent years , some Iranian bloggers have been sent to jail and many have had their sites filtered .
If the Iranian parliament approves this draft bill , bloggers fear they could be legally executed as criminals .
No one has defined what it means to " disturb mental security in society " .
Such discussion concerning blogs has not been unique to Iran .
It shows that many authorities do not only wish to filter blogs , but also to eliminate bloggers !

People in a Tennessee church were killed and wounded because they support women 's rights and gay rights .
Where is the outrage from pro-life social conservatives ?
A man walks into a church and starts shooting because of the church ’s liberal views on women ’s rights and gay rights , according to the Associated Press .
Out of work and frustrated , Jim Adkisson turned a children ’s performance of Annie in front of 200 congregants at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church , into a nightmare yesterday , killing two and wounding several others .
Today , his motivation became clear .
The church had liberal views .
Most Unitarian Universalist " congregations retain a deep commitment to social justice , which
has led them to embrace liberal positions over the years .
Unitarians
were among the first to ordain women , support the civil rights movement
and back gay rights , " reported the AP .
The notion that women and gay people should have rights — as hard as it is to believe that these issues remain debatable in the 21st Century , let alone how they offer motivation for murder — moved this man to kill people in church .

Where is the outrage from the far right ?
Where is the understanding that their demagoguery of social issues leads to more division than healing , and ultimately to this sort of violent behavior ?
Where is the realization that the policies that created Adkisson ’s unemployment and financial frustration — shared by millions of Americans absent his murderous rage — have been implemented by politicians who have used hot button social issues just to get far - right votes ?
They have made little to no progress on the social issues the far - right cares about , while running the economy into the ground to the point where it moves a frustrated man to take a gun to a church to kill .
He killed people sympathetic to his economic plight , people who would have likely helped him , but then again , they are " liberal " in their compassion , ability to love , and see the divine in everyone .
Forgiveness is an amazing lesson , and here , the victims have an opportunity to demonstrate it as the powerful skillfully plan to divide and conquer once again .
Rev. Debra Haffner , a UU minister , writes on her blog :
And I feel sick … and disgusted … and PERSONALLY affected , even though
I do n’t believe I know anyone at this particular church .
According to a
news story online , it ’s the fourth shooting in a church in America this
year .
The Yahoo story was illustrated by a pair of hands
holding a large cross and a rosary .
I found that perhaps insignficantly
infuriating as well ( and there did n’t seem to be any place to let the
editors know how incorrect that image was . )
What in God ’s name
will it take to outlaw handguns in this country ?
How many school
shootings , church shootings , home shootings , domestic violence shoots ,
drive by shootings until lawmakers do something ?
I ’ve thought for the
past twenty five years that if I was n’t so committed to my work in
sexual justice , handgun control would be the area I would spend my life
working on .
And now , it ’s happened one step closer … and I know
if could happen even closer still .
" Thou shall not kill " has to be
backed up by legislation so that people do n’t have the resources to do
it .
It was n’t a suggestion ; it was a commandment .
Again , I ask , where is the far - right outrage ?
Has n’t the politicization of faith , pretending it belongs only to those who adhere to one narrow interpretation , gone on long enough ?
Has n’t the demonizing of the left purely for political gain been played out ?
Can the far - right really win again by revving up their base — even those who do n’t own guns — to support policies that create the economic frustrations that keep them down ?
Can they still call it " pro-life " when people are shot for believing women have rights ?
Update : Firedoglake has a great observation on this as well , linking to the always self - righteous Michelle Malkin when a shooter was n’t killing liberals .

The deposed king of Nepal , Gyanendra , has moved out of the palace in the capital Kathmandu where his family lived for more than a century .
Mr Shah , as he is now known , and his wife Komal swept out of the compound in the back of a black Mercedes as scores of riot police guarded the main gate .
Earlier , he said he had returned his crown but would not go into exile and would work for the republic 's benefit .
Last month , Nepal 's Maoist - led assembly voted to abolish the monarchy .
The palace in the centre of Kathmandu is to become a museum .
Gyanendra and his wife are moving to a new , temporary residence outside the city .
' The people 's verdict ' A police and army escort followed the ex-monarch 's car as he left for Nagarjun , in the north - western suburbs of Kathmandu .
FALL OF THE MONARCHY November 1991 : King Birendra becomes constitutional monarch and reintroduces multiparty democracy June 2001 : Crown Prince Dipendra shoots nine members of the royal family before killing himself .
Gyanendra succeeds to the throne February 2005 : Gyanendra sacks government and assumes full executive powers April 2006 : Mass protests force reinstatement of parliament and king is stripped of most powers April 2008 : Maoists win most seats in elections to constituent assembly May 2008 : Nepal declared a republic , ending 240 years of monarchy June 2008 : Gyanendra leaves his palace in Kathmandu , home of his family for more than a century
In pictures : End of an era Profile : Ex-king Gyanendra
What do monarchs do next ?
The couple will live in a large , comfortable but ordinary - looking house there .
A few loyalist onlookers called for Gyanendra to stay on as his car left but many in the crowd near the palace seemed happy to see him go , correspondents say .
" This marks the beginning of a new Nepal and the end of a dynasty that has done nothing but harm this country , " Devendra Maharjan , a farmer who had come to Kathmandu to see the king leave the palace , told The Associated Press .
" If it had not been for the kings , Nepal would probably not have remained a poor nation . "
Giving an unprecedented news conference at the palace earlier , the former monarch said he had given his priceless crown to the Nepalese government for its protection .
" I have no intention or thoughts to leave the country , " Gyanendra said .
" I have assisted in and respected the verdict of the people . "
He strongly rebuffed the suspicions of many Nepalis that he had engineered the palace massacre of 2001 which brought him to the throne .
He pointed out that his wife had had several bullets lodged in her body in the attack , in which Crown Prince Dipendra shot dead King Birendra and eight other members of the royal family before killing himself .
Gyanendra said he had taken over power in 2005 hoping it would bring harmony and peace , but he admitted things had not worked out as he had planned .
His stepmother and his grandfather 's mistress will live on in their homes within the compound of the palace in central Kathmandu , in a fenced - off area .
Bitter ending
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu says that the former monarch 's departure is a major symbolic moment in the fall of the Shah dynasty , which unified Nepal in the 1760s .
A supporter of the monarchy tried to stop Gyanendra 's car leaving The Maoists , who urged Gyanendra to bow out gracefully or be put on trial , welcomed the news that he was going quietly .
But the ending of the monarchy has generally been a bitter affair , our correspondent says .
It was engendered by the 2001 massacre and Gyanendra 's attempts to be politically active in quelling the Maoist insurgency , he adds .
The deposed king is reported to be reluctant to allow a committee to audit his saleable assets .
He has made clear that he will leave behind most of the furniture in the palace , along with gifts he received in his capacity as the country 's head of state .
Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said details of which possessions he keeps and which ones he leaves behind would be publicised after his departure from the palace .

Scientists discover ' world 's first bird ' that lived 235 million years ago
Palaeontologists have unveiled an extraordinary prehistoric ' flying ' reptile which lived 235 million years ago .
The kuehneosaurs glided through the subtropical forests of Europe using scaly ' wings ' that could carry it distances of more than 30ft .
Experts say the lizard - like reptile , which grew up to 2ft long , used extensions of their ribs to form large gliding surfaces on the sides of their body .
The scientific community is united in the belief that birds descended from reptiles 50 million years later making the kuehneosaurs the world 's first ' bird ' .
The kuehneosaurs glided through forests 385 million years ago
The long - extinct species was first unearthed in the Britain by Archaeologists in the 1950s , but until now their aerodynamic capability had not been studied .
Their rudimentary ' wings ' were always assumed to be some form of flying adaption , but scientists at the time lacked the necessary technology to test the theory .
But earlier this year , experts from Bristol University investigated both types of kuehneosaurs found in the UK - kuehneosuchus and kuehneosaurus - for the first time .
The team built lifesize models of the creatures and used techniques usually employed to test prototype aircraft - including a wind tunnel - to discover their amazing flying ability .
Their pioneering findings , published this week by the Paleontological Association , have turned the history of winged flight on its head .
Today German palaeobiologist Koen Stein , who led the study , said : ' We did n't think kuehneosaurs would have been very efficient in the air .
But all the work up to now had been speculation .
' So we decided to build models and test them in the wind tunnel in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Bristol University .
' Surprisingly , we found that kuehneosuchus was aerodynamically very stable .
Jumping from a tree , it could easily have crossed 9 m ( 29 ft ) before landing on the ground . '
The species , which inhabited the warm late Triassic period from 235 to 200 million years ago , was first discovered in the UK inside an ancient cave system near Bristol .
Both types of kuehneosaurs lived 80 million years before the largest dinosaurs of the Jurassic period , and 50 million years before the earliest known bird , archaeopteryx , which lived in what is now southern Germany .
Mr Stein and his colleagues used a number of different materials to reconstruct the creatures ' scaly wings , which they then tested using specialist aerodynamic equipment .
Aerospace engineers suspended the models in a wind tunnel and passed a jet of hot air over the models ' bodies .
This gave experts a detailed idea about the air flow over their wings , and the distance they would have glided from tree - top to tree - top in search of food and to escape larger predators .
But Mr Stein admitted the task was n't always straightforward .
He added : ' We also built webbed hands and feet , and had an extra skin membrane between the legs on the models , but these made the flight of the animals unstable , suggesting they probably did not have such features . '
Mr Stein , who now works at the prestigious Institute of Palaeontology at Bonn in Germany , carried out the research with Colin Palmer , Pamela Gill and Michael Benton from Bristol University 's Department of Earth Sciences .
Department head Professor Michael Benton said : ' Palaeontologists are keen to understand how all the amazing animals of the past operated , and by collaborating with aerospace engineers we can be sure that model - making and calculations are more realistic . '
Sullivan , Ill . - Steve Jenne 's half - eaten sandwich is a story that seems like it will never go away .
Of course , it is no ordinary sandwich .
In 1960 , Jenne was a 14 - year - old boy given a big responsibility .
The Sullivan High School student was a member of the Boy Scouts and was one of the guards around the picnic table of then - Vice President Richard Nixon as he ate lunch in Wyman Park .
The mere fact that a vice president and presidential candidate would come to a town the size of Sullivan seemed impossible to Jenne .
The local politicians invited both presidential candidates , John Kennedy and Richard Nixon , to come to Sullivan for a debate .
Much to Jenne 's surprise , Nixon accepted the offer .
" What chance did Sullivan have of getting Kennedy and Nixon here ? " Wyman said .
In honor of the arrival of a distinguished politician to Sullivan , some bison bred just outside of town were slaughtered so buffalo sandwiches could be served .
On the day of Nixon 's arrival , Sept. 22 , 1960 , Sullivan was overwhelmed by 17,000 people who came to see Nixon speak at Wyman park .
Before his speech at the baseball diamond , Nixon sat down at a picnic bench to eat his buffalo sandwich , with Jenne standing directly behind him , serving in his role of lunchtime guard .
Nixon ate about half the sandwich and made comments about how much he liked it before getting up to give his speech .
When Nixon went to the ball diamond to speak , the entire crowd followed after him , except Jenne .
" Being the good Boy Scout that I was , I stood there and guarded that sandwich , " Jenne said .
As he prepared to leave a little later , Jenne just picked up the paper plate Nixon 's sandwich was served on , with the sandwich still on it , and brought it home with him .
Jenne 's mother agreed to store the sandwich in the freezer , first wrapping it in cellophane and putting it in an applesauce jar .
" He was our vice president .
I thought it might be worth saving , " Jenne said .
Now , 47 years later , Jenne still has the sandwich and he knows for a fact it was worth saving .
Jenne was a guest speaker last fall at American history classes at Sullivan High School , a school he has not returned to since he graduated in 1964 .
Bringing along the paper plate on which the sandwich sat , along with a tote bag full of newspaper articles written about him over the years , Jenne got a chance to tell a new generation of Sullivan High Schoolers his sandwich story .
The sandwich itself did not make it with Jenne from Springfield , as he said its last two trips to California have taken a toll on it .
After hearing Jenne speak , junior Caitlin Howard was amazed Jenne was able to get so close to Nixon , especially now that security around politicians can be so tight .
" The fact that a Boy Scout troop was protecting the president that is so cool , " Howard said .
Although he could n't possibly imagine it at 14 years old , Jenne has received a considerable amount of attention over the years due to the half - eaten buffalo sandwich .
Each time Jenne thinks he will no longer get requests for interviews or television appearances , his phone will start ringing again .
" This is a story that just wo n't die , " Jenne said .
Jenne had a few stories written about him and the sandwich in his early years of ownership , then , in 1988 , a local newspaper reporter came across an old story about the sandwich and called him up to see if he still had it .
He did , and the story made the news wire services .

' We Are Workers , Not Criminals '
For most , there are no jobs to return to in the countries from which they 've come .
In the big immigrant marches that swept the country on May Day in 2006 and 2007 , one sign said it all : " We are Workers , not Criminals ! "
Often it was held in the calloused hands of men and women who looked as though they 'd just come from work in a factory , cleaning an office building , or picking grapes .
The sign stated an obvious truth .
Millions of people have come to this country to work , not to break its laws .
Some have come with visas , and others without them .
But they are all contributors to the society they 've found here , not people who mean it harm .
Again this May Day , immigrant workers filled the streets , making the same point .
Yet today the federal government is taking actions that make holding a job a criminal act .
Some states and local communities , seeing a green light from the Department of Homeland Security , are passing measures that go even further .
These actions need a reality check .
Last summer , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff proposed a rule requiring employers to fire any worker who could n't correct a mismatch between the Social Security number they 'd provided their employer , and the S.S.A. database .
The regulation assumes those workers have no valid immigration visa , and therefore no valid Social Security number .
With 12 million people living in the United States without legal immigration status , the regulation would lead to massive firings , bringing many industries and businesses to a halt .
Citizens and legal visa holders would be swept up as well , since the Social Security database is often inaccurate .
Under Chertoff the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement has conducted sweeping workplace raids , arresting and deporting thousands of workers .
Many have been charged with an additional crime — identity theft — because they used a Social Security number belonging to someone else to get a job .
Yet workers using another number actually deposit money into that holder 's social security account , and these immigrants will never collect benefits their contributions paid for .
The Arizona legislature has passed a law requiring employers to verify the immigration status of every worker through a federal database called E - Verify , which is even more incomplete and full of errors than Social Security .
They must fire workers whose names get flagged .
And Mississippi passed a bill making it a felony for an undocumented worker to hold a job , with jail time of 1 - 10 years , fines of up to $ 10,000 , and no bail for anyone arrested .
Employers get immunity .
Congress is now debating two bills , the SAVE Act and the New Employee Verification Act that would require similar use of the E - Verify database .
In 1986 the Immigration Reform and Control Act made it a crime , for the first time in our history , to hire people without papers .
Defenders argued that if people could not legally work they would leave .
Life was not so simple .
Undocumented people are part of the communities they live in .
They will not simply go , nor should they .
They seek the same goals of equality and opportunity that everyone else in our country believes in .
For most , there are no jobs to return to in the countries from which they 've come .
Rufino Dominguez , a Oaxacan community leader in Fresno , says , " The North American Free Trade Agreement made the price of corn so low that it's not economically possible to plant a crop anymore .
We come to the United States to work because there 's no alternative . "
When Congress passed NAFTA , six million displaced people came to the United States as a result .
If Congress stops passing new free trade agreements , and instead faces the damage NAFTA and other pro-corporate measures did in Mexico , the poverty and desperation that fuel migration can eventually be reversed .
Trying to push people out of the United States who 've come here for survival simply wo n't work .
The price of trying is that the vulnerability of undocumented workers will increase .
Unscrupulous employers use that vulnerability to deny overtime , minimum wage , or fire workers when they protest or organize .
Increased vulnerability ultimately results in cheaper labor and fewer rights for everyone .
Children live in fear that their parents will be picked up in raids .
After deporting over 1,000 workers at Swift meatpacking plants , Chertoff called for linking " effective interior enforcement and a temporary - worker program . "
The government is really after giving cheap labor to large employers .
Deportations , firings , and guest - worker programs all make labor cheaper and union organizing harder .
They contribute to a climate of fear and insecurity for everyone .
Instead of making work a crime and treating immigrants as criminals , we need equality , economic security , jobs , and rights for everyone .

Bill Clinton : ' Paranoid ' hecklers ' come and scream at me everywhere ' David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008

Print This Email This Campaigning for his wife in Erie , Pennsylvania , Bill Clinton returned fire at a heckler who began shouting about the former president 's attendance at a 1991 invitation - only conference of wealthy powerbrokers -- " 1991 Bilderberg " -- implying that discussion there led to unfair trade policy such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
As the audience booed , Clinton replied :  Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait This is the deal folks .
All these folks that are paranoid at the world folks , come and scream at me everywhere .
You said you would go if I answered the question , right ?
You said you would go if I answered the question " " All right , heres the answer .
I happened to be in Europe then on my way to Russia I was invited to go to Bilderberg by Vernon Jordan , a friend of mine and a genuine hero of the civil rights movement .
And to the best of my knowledge NAFTA was not discussed by anybody in my presence .
I happened to be on my way to Europe where people do not give a rip about NAFTA .
" Number two , okay .
Number two .
I tried to get labor and environmental standards in the agreement but I couldnt because it was all negotiated when I got there .
" Number three .
When I was president , we enforced our trade laws five times as much as the Bush Administration did Family incomes went up $ 7,500 a year when I was president , they re down $ 1,000 now .
So I was not I had a very good time talking to those Europeans about European affairs and what was going to happen to Russia but I was not somehow polluted by it into sacrificing Americas economic interests .
America did a lot better when I was president than they did in this decade .
And that s the truth .
Now .
Goodbye .
Thank you . "

WASHINGTON 
When the Supreme Court ruled last week that the death penalty for raping a child was unconstitutional , the majority noted that a child rapist could face the ultimate penalty in only six states  not in any of the 30 other states that have the death penalty , and not under the jurisdiction of the federal government either .
This inventory of jurisdictions was a central part of the court ’s analysis , the foundation for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s conclusion in his majority opinion that capital punishment for child rape was contrary to the “ evolving standards of decency ” by which the court judges how the death penalty is applied .
It turns out that Justice Kennedy ’s confident assertion about the absence of federal law was wrong .
A military law blog pointed out over the weekend that Congress , in fact , revised the sex crimes section of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 2006 to add child rape to the military death penalty .
The revisions were in the National Defense Authorization Act that year .
President Bush signed that bill into law and then , last September , carried the changes forward by issuing Executive Order 13447 , which put the provisions into the 2008 edition of the Manual for Courts - Martial .
Anyone in the federal government  or anywhere else , for that matter  who knew about these developments did not tell the court .
Not one of the 10 briefs filed in the case , Kennedy v. Louisiana , mentioned it .
The Office of the Solicitor General , which represents the federal government in the Supreme Court , did not even file a brief , evidently having concluded that the federal government had no stake in whether Louisiana ’s death penalty for child rape was constitutional .
Qwest CEO who snubbed NSA headed back to court
A federal appeals court said on Wednesday it will reconsider its decision overturning the insider trading conviction of former Qwest Communications International Inc Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio .
In appealing his 2007 conviction on insider trading charges , Nacchio argued that the government had retaliated against him by withdrawing lucrative contracts after he refused to participate in a National Security Agency program he believed was illegal .
It 's unclear precisely what NSA programs were discussed in a February 2001 conversation between Nacchio and representatives of the ultra - secret spy agency .
Nine judges on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from prosecutors for all of them to rehear Nacchio 's appeal , which a three - judge panel of the court had decided 2 - 1 in Nacchio 's favor on March 17 .
The nine judges gave no reason for their decision .
Nacchio's April 2007 conviction on 19 counts of insider trading had been hailed as a major victory in the government 's attempt to crack down on corporate titans who profited while their companies suffered serious financial setbacks .
The telecom ex-CEO was convicted of illegally selling $ 52 million worth of stock in 2001 after , prosecutors alleged , company insiders warned him Qwest could not meet its financial targets .
The two judges who overturned the conviction concluded Nacchio did not get a fair trial because the trial judge improperly barred testimony from an expert witness the defense considered key to its case .
Prosecutors , in asking the higher court to reconsider , contended the March 17 decision improperly restricted a judge 's discretion to exclude " unsupported expert opinions and unnecessary economic commentary . "
The Denver - based appeals court said it would hear oral arguments on September 24 .
The judges told Nacchio 's attorneys and prosecutors to submit within 30 days written briefs addressing four issues about the exclusion of the testimony of the expert witness .
Nacchio's attorneys said they were confident the full panel would concur with the decision by the three - judge panel .
" The trial court excluded evidence that would have established Mr. Nacchio's innocence , " attorney Maureen Mahoney said in a statement .
" The panel concluded that the trial was unfair and we expect the en banc court to agree . "
Troy Eid , U.S. Attorney for Colorado , said in a statement that prosecutors , " will keep working to ensure that justice is done . "
With wire reports
When John McCain , 71 , wanted Barack Obama , 46 , to join him at a series of town hall meetings , he dispatched a messenger to hand - deliver the invitation .
" You know , you could have just e-mailed this , " Obama press secretary Bill Burton told the messenger .
" It 's the difference between a horse and buggy and a NASA space ship , " said Phil Noble , a veteran of Democratic campaigns and the founder of the nonpartisan political news site PoliticsOnline , comparing the campaigns ’ respective approaches to technology .
" Obama has given people the tools to create and run their own campaigns , " Noble continued .
" McCain is still a command - and - control , top - down candidate .
Part of it is the difference in age . "
" Every time Obama had seven seconds when we spent the day together in South Carolina , he whipped out his Blackberry , " recalled Noble .
Contrast that to McCain 's response when Politico 's Mike Allen asked him whether he used a Mac or a PC : " Neither .
I 'm an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance I can get . "
" There is a gap between people who are digital natives and people who are digital immigrants .
Obama clearly has an advantage over McCain in that he is a more comfortable user of these tools , " said Micah Sifry , founder of TechPresident.com , a blog that covers how the 2008 presidential candidates use the Web .
And in the ways they use the Web , " campaigns are a reflection of the candidate , " he added .
Much of the difference between the candidates is philosophical .
" In terms of the usage of new media , there 's definitely a dramatic difference between how McCain and Obama are operating , " said Ian Rowe , vice president for strategic partnerships and public affairs at MTV , who worked in the Bush White House .
" Within barackobama.com he has the same set of tools you use in Facebook or MySpace or YouTube .
The age gap inherently creates more of an affinity with the younger generation [ for Obama ] .
But Obama 's general approach is in tune with reaching young people where they are . "
Obama has also significantly outspent McCain in online advertising , according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission numbers by Politico 's Ken Vogel .
While Obama has reported spending $ 6.8 million on Web ads ( including ads on Politico.com ) since beginning his campaign , McCain has reported spending $ 1.9 million on " Web service " — a category that likely includes advertising , among other things .
This year 's record - shredding spike in gasoline prices has finally ended , with prices throughout the country falling by more than a penny per day .
And American drivers can thank themselves for the drop .
Shocked by prices that reached $ 4.11 per gallon nationwide and $ 4.61 in California , drivers stopped buying as much fuel .
That cut the demand for gasoline 's raw material , crude oil .
Crude prices dropped as a result , taking gasoline prices with them .
Now the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gas is $ 3.96 , 11 cents less than a week ago , according to the AAA auto club .
California 's average remains substantially higher , at $ 4.32 , but it fell 12 cents in the last week .

" Consumers have definitely sent a message , " said AAA spokeswoman Cynthia Harris .
At a time of year when Americans typically hit the highway on vacation , many are staying home or taking shorter trips .
A survey by AAA found 1.3 percent fewer Americans traveled during the July Fourth weekend compared with a year ago .
" This is the first time in a decade we 've seen less travel on major holiday weekends , " Harris said .
" People are saying , ' Instead of taking two major road trips this summer , we 'll take one . ' "
Gasoline is still not cheap .
Even though prices are falling , the national average for a gallon of regular remains $ 1.06 higher than a year ago .
California 's average is $ 1.24 higher .
That helps explain why famously car - loving Americans finally started driving fewer miles .
The country used 3.2 percent less gasoline in the last four weeks than during the same period last year , according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
That followed months of similar decreases .
Energy traders , who had been caught up in a historic bull market for crude oil , finally took notice .
" Prices got excessively valued and there was too much bullish enthusiasm , " said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service .
" It was long overdue for a respite . "
Crude oil this spring shattered price records that , when adjusted for inflation , had stood for decades .
Oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange peaked July 3 at $ 145.29 per barrel , more than twice what it sold for a year earlier .
Then traders began to focus on weak demand and ominous economic news .
The price started to slide .
It closed Monday at $ 124.73 , down 14 percent from the peak .
Kloza warned , however , that the bulls may start running again .
Some of the investors who poured money into oil this spring , using it as a hedge against inflation , may jump in again if the stock market tumbles .
And worldwide demand for oil remains strong , even if the United States is using less .
He predicts the nationwide average price for regular gasoline will fall to $ 3.80 , while California 's average will slide below $ 4 .
" This is a nice little midsummer interlude , " Kloza said .
The oil market remains prone to wild price swings , many driven by momentum and fear .
A hurricane roaring through the Gulf of Mexico and shutting offshore oil wells could easily push prices back up , analysts say .
So could increased tensions with Iran .
And if oil starts rising again , gasoline will follow .
Lester Lave , an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University , says he can picture oil swinging anywhere between $ 50 per barrel and $ 250 - $ 50 in case of a global recession , $ 250 if the United States goes to war with Iran .
If gas and oil prices keep falling , they have a long way to go before all Americans would benefit .
Lave noted that while upper - income Americans find $ 4 gas a nuisance , lower - and middle - class Americans have trouble paying to keep the tank full .
Even with a substantial drop , many Americans would still have to rein in their driving , Lave said .
" If gasoline prices go back down to $ 3.50 , we 're going to find there are still people who can't afford to pay for it , " he said .

Many cities have sought to remake their image when hosting global events like the Olympics .
Beijing is polishing off one of the world ’s most expensive makeovers with a whitewash .
Along the historic central axis of the city that runs from the Yongdingmen Gate due north to the Drum Tower , the authorities are doing their best to give the old city a new face .
Beijing has spent $ 130 million to restore buildings , many of them temples along the five - mile axis , according to the city ’s cultural relics bureau .
The Olympic Stadium was built on a northern extension of the traditional axis  a nod to the event ’s historic importance .
On the wide boulevards leading up to the stadium , roadblocks have been set up and flowers , grass and trees planted .

The southern part of the axis has proved more difficult to beautify .
It cuts through densely populated neighborhoods south of Tiananmen Square that are home to many of the city ’s migrants and working poor .
To hide neighborhoods leveled for redevelopment in recent years or anything else the government considers unsightly , officials have put up walls .
Mr. Song and his wife and 8 - year - old daughter now live behind one .
They have lived here since 1994 , Mr. Song said , renting out his shops to families from the provinces .
They live in close quarters .
The Songs ’ room is barely big enough for a double bed on which the couple and daughter sleep .
Two pet birds live in metal cages by the door .
The birds , brown starlings with dark feathers and orange beaks , can parrot human speech .
Mr. Song taught the birds one of the most famous poems of the Tang Dynasty .
Every few minutes , it squawks lines from the poem : “ The white sun falls over the mountains ” or “ The Yellow River flows into the sea . ”
Behind the room is a moonscape of weeds and rubble that used to be a slum .
Mr. Song ’s place survived while the city razed the poor Tianqiao neighborhood and transformed it with shopping malls , wider streets and subdivisions .
Mr. Song ’s predicament is familiar in the churn of this changing city .
The developers want him to go , but he is holding out for more money .
JOHANNESBURG , South Africa ( CNN ) -- A Chinese ship loaded with arms and ammunition sailed away from a South African waters and is on its way to Luanda , Angola to unload its cargo bound for Zimbabwe .
South Africa 's High Court ruled Friday the cargo could be offloaded in the Durban port , but it could not pass over South Africa roads to get to Zimbabwe , a country in crisis because of an election stalemate .
Durban 's dockworkers also said they would not handle the cargo , fearing the arms would be used by the Zimbabwean government against its own people .
A South African government source told CNN the China - flagged An Yue Jiang had sailed away from Durban Friday evening before the High Court 's order could be served to the ship 's captain .
The ship was headed to the port of Luanda , Angola , according to the South African Department of Transport .
Zimbabwe is in turmoil after elections last month that saw the opposition Movement for Change party win a majority of seats in the parliament , although Mugabe 's ZANU - PF party has contested 16 seats , claiming the MDC cheated .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission began a recount of 23 of those districts Saturday morning .
The presidential election , however , has sparked much more concern .
The government of President Robert Mugabe , who has been in power since Zimbabwe won its independence in 1980 , has refused to release results of that vote before a recount .
The MDC says its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , won the election , but ZANU - PF has claimed the MDC engaged in election tampering .
The delay in releasing the vote sparked violence and a government crackdown on opposition members .
" This union has a proud history of taking action against regimes which it disapproves of in the past , but this is certainly the first time it has gotten involved in an African regime like Zimbabwe , " David Cockroft , general secretary of the International Transport Workers Federation , said .
" I do n't think there 's much doubt that the ( dock ) workers ... are very strongly against the Mugabe regime , " he said .
Do n't Miss Zimbabwe recount underway
Cockroft said that arms had almost certainly been shipped to Zimbabwe through Durban in the past , but the size of this shipment -- " more than a million pounds " and 3.5 million rounds of rifles , small arms , mortar shells and rocket - propelled grenades -- made it more noteworthy .
Earlier , South African Revenue Service spokesman Adrian Lackay told CNN " that it is commonplace for landlocked neighboring states in southern Africa to use South African ports of entry for the transshipment of goods . "
Lackay indicated that the ship had complied with South African regulations requiring it to disclose the contents of the cargo it is carrying .
A government spokesman , Thembo Maseko , told CNN , " There were arms on the ship . "
The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement in a fax to the Reuters news agency saying that China and Zimbabwe have normal trade relations , that the Chinese government takes a " prudent and responsible " position on arms deals and that it does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries .

They stare out from the screen : brazen , menacing , occasionally risible , but always brandishing a serious weapon .
These young people armed with guns , knives and machetes make little or no attempt to disguise themselves .
Their images were all found during just one morning 's trawl across social networking sites such as Bebo .
Together they present an army of reasons why the Government is struggling to tackle violent youth crime .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , is about to announce new tactics – which will include taking young men and women convicted of carrying knives to the A&E department of their local hospital to see what stab wounds are really like .
They will also meet the families of those who have been maimed or killed to see the grief and pain such attacks can cause .
Last week was the worst so far this year for knife crime .
Nine people died , eight of them on Thursday or Friday .
Some of their names were released yesterday .
Melvin Bryan was knifed in the neck and chest at a bedsit in Edmonton , north London .
He was 18 years old .
Not far away , in a squat on Tottenham High Road , 42 - year - old Gennar Jaronis was found dead .
Adnan Patel died after being chased and knifed by a gang in Leyton , east London .
He was 20 .
The police continue to make arrests : yesterday Sarah Anderson , of Bellenden Road , Peckham , was remanded in custody at Greenwich Magistrates ' Court , charged with the murder of Dee Wills outside a supermarket in Peckham on 1 July .

The lengthening list of victims has provoked the Government into promising new and more dramatic intervention .
But Professor Ellis Cashmore , an expert on consumer culture , believes these measures may be in vain .
The problem is rooted , he says , not in policing but in the new status of knives as " bling " for those who can't afford gold chains and fast cars .
" The knife has almost been stripped of its instrumental purpose , which is to cut things , and instead people are posing with them because it suggests to others they have status and it is as important as having a new pair of trainers or jewellery , " he said .
Websites are crucial to this .
" They can't walk down the street carrying them , so the internet provides a theatrical setting to display their weapons .
It is also saying to others , ' I 'm a person to respect , a person of honour in my sub-set . ' "
Professor Cashmore , of Staffordshire University , said the knife - crime epidemic was being fed by the media 's reporting of it .
" The copycat effect is very powerful .
There is a buzz and awareness of what is going on , " he said .
" The reason the posing spills into violence is because it becomes a badge of honour within the tribe or group if you have stabbed someone and the others have not .
Everyone has to earn their stripes .
There are some problems for which there are no practical solutions .
I do n't think tougher sentences are a practical solution to the problem , no matter what Jacqui Smith says . "
The selection of pictures on Bebo yesterday showed this culture at its worst .
One showed two teenagers under the heading " Snub Blaxk Ea5t5ide Grove Boy " brandishing a shotgun , while another , under " Tommy Solly " , showed a young man with a 2ft machete .
David Wilson , a professor of criminology at Birmingham City University , said one cause of the problem was distrust between young people and adults .
" They feel they have been dismissed by adult society as chavs , hoodies and feral youth , and they are responding to that by taking matters into their own hands , " he said .
" Some people are carrying knives because they are scared , but a smaller group is carrying them for symbolic reasons .
It is about being a man , gaining respect and saying I am an adult and I can take care of myself . "
One of the youngest victims to lose his life so far is David Idowu , 14 .
He died on Monday , three weeks after being stabbed in south London .
An argument on a football pitch in Borough escalated into murder when David was chased and then stabbed .
One theory is that the argument began because of rivalry between pupils at Walworth Academy in Southwark , where David studied , and another school .
Friends and family of the murdered teenager will march through London in a protest against knives on Saturday 19 July , at midday , starting at the spot where the stabbing took place in Great Dover Street .
Those who knew David described him as deeply religious and a model pupil .
His parents , Tim and Grace Idowu , believe their son is now with God. Odunayo Otti , a church elder at the Christ Apostolic Church in Bermondsey , where the Idowu family worships , said the Government had let knife crime get out of control .
" They ignored it because they thought it was a black - on - black thing when they should have been doing something about it before it got out of hand , " he said .

" If you look at this in a Christian way , maybe a demon has got hold of the youth .
The community needs to turn to God . "
He supported much tougher sentences for carrying a knife , he said .
" Young people and parents need to take responsibility for themselves .
A single life lost from knives is too much to bear – let alone four in one day , as we saw on Thursday . "

Over the course of the campaign against Hillary Clinton and now McCain , Obama has elaborated more and more the ideas that would undergird his foreign policy as president .
What emerges is a world view that is far from that of a typical liberal , much closer to that of a traditional realist .
It is interesting to note that , at least in terms of the historical schools of foreign policy , Obama seems to be the cool conservative and McCain the exuberant idealist .
The rap on Barack Obama , at least in the realm of foreign policy , has been that he is a softheaded idealist who thinks that he can charm America 's enemies .
John McCain and his campaign , conservative columnists and right - wing bloggers all paint a picture of a liberal dreamer who wishes away the world 's dangers .
Even President Bush stepped into the fray earlier this year to condemn the Illinois senator 's willingness to meet with tyrants as naive .
Some commentators have acted as if Obama , touring the Middle East and Europe this week on his first trip abroad since effectively wrapping up the nomination , is in for a rude awakening .
No candidate for the presidency ever claims to have a doctrinal world view .
Richard Nixon never said he loved realpolitik .
Jimmy Carter never claimed to be a Wilsonian .
There 's no advantage to getting pigeonholed , and most politicians and even policy folk are clever enough to argue that they want to combine the best of all traditions .
So John McCain says he 's a " realistic idealist . "
Former national - security adviser Anthony Lake , who now counsels Obama , calls himself a " pragmatic neo- Wilsonian . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice describes herself as an " American realist . "
Against that backdrop , Obama has been strikingly honest about his inclinations and inspirations .
True , he begins by praising Harry Truman 's administration , which in the foreign - policy world is a little like saying you admire George Washington .
( Bill Clinton , George W. Bush and John McCain have all cited Truman as a model . )
But then Obama takes an unusual step , for a Democrat , and praises the administration of George H.W. Bush , one that is often seen as the most hardheaded or coldblooded ( depending on your point of view ) in recent memory .
Obama has done this more than once , most recently in a conversation with me last week on CNN .
And he is explicit about what he means .
" It 's an argument between ideology and foreign - policy realism .
I have enormous sympathy for the foreign policy of George H.W. Bush , " he told The New York Times 's David Brooks in May .
Obama rarely speaks in the moralistic tones of the current Bush administration .
He does n't divide the world into good and evil even when speaking about terrorism .
He sees countries and even extremist groups as complex , motivated by power , greed and fear as much as by pure ideology .
His interest in diplomacy seems motivated by the sense that one can probe , learn and possibly divide and influence countries and movements precisely because they are not monoliths .
When speaking to me about Islamic extremism , for example , he repeatedly emphasized the diversity within the Islamic world , speaking of Arabs , Persians , Africans , Southeast Asians , Shiites and Sunnis , all of whom have their own interests and agendas .
Obama never uses the soaring language of Bush 's freedom agenda , preferring instead to talk about enhancing people 's economic prospects , civil society and —his key word — " dignity . "
He rejects Bush 's obsession with elections and political rights , and argues that people 's aspirations are broader and more basic — including food , shelter , jobs .
" Once these aspirations are met , " he told The New York Times 's James Traub , " it opens up space for the kind of democratic regimes we want . "
This is a view of democratic development that is slow , organic and incremental , usually held by conservatives .
Obama talks admiringly of men like Dean Acheson , George Kennan and Reinhold Niebuhr , all of whom were imbued with a sense of the limits of idealism and American power to transform the world .
" In his view of history , in his respect for tradition , in his skepticism that the world can be changed any way but very , very slowly , Obama is deeply conservative , " wrote Larissa MacFarquhar in her profile of him for The New Yorker .
" There are moments when he sounds almost Burkean .
He distrusts abstractions , generalizations , extrapolations , projections .
It 's not just that he thinks revolutions are unlikely : he values continuity and stability for their own sake , sometimes even more than he values change for the good . "
As important as what Obama says is what he passes up -- a series of obvious cheap shots against Bush .
He could bash him for coddling China 's dictatorship , urge him to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics or criticize his inaction in Darfur .
In fact , Obama has been circumspect on all these issues , neither grandstanding nor overpromising .
( This is , alas , not true on trade policy , where he has done both . )
Perhaps the most telling area where Obama has stuck to a focused conception of U.S. national interests is Iraq .
Despite the progress in Iraq , despite the possibility of establishing a democracy in the heart of the Arab world , Obama 's position is steely -- Iraq is a distraction , and the sooner America can reduce its exposure there , the better .
I actually wish he were somewhat more sympathetic to the notion that a democratic Iraq would play a positive role in the struggle against Islamic extremism .
But his view is certainly focused on America 's core security interests and is recognizably realist .
Walter Lippmann and George Kennan made similar arguments about Vietnam from the mid-1960s onward .
Ironically , the Republicans now seem to be the foreign - policy idealists , labeling countries as either good or evil , refusing to deal with nasty regimes , fixating on spreading democracy throughout the world and refusing to think in more historical and complex ways .
" I do n't do nuance , " George W. Bush told many visitors to the White House in the years after 9/11 .
John McCain has had his differences with Bush , but not on this broad thrust of policy .
Indeed it is McCain , the Republican , who has put forward some fanciful plans , arguing that America should establish a " League of Democracies , " expel Russia from the Group of Eight industrialized countries and exclude China from both groups as well .
Obama 's response to McCain 's proposals on Russia and China could have been drafted by Henry Kissinger or Brent Scowcroft .
We need to cooperate with both countries in order to solve significant global problems , he told me last week , citing nuclear - proliferation issues with Russia and economic ones with China .
The distinction between Obama and McCain on this point is important .
The single largest strategic challenge facing the United States in the decades ahead is to draw in the world 's new rising powers and make them stakeholders in the global economic and political order .
Russia and China will be the hardest because they are large and have different political systems and ideological approaches to the world .
Yet the benefits of having them inside the tent are obvious .
Without some degree of great - power cooperation , global peace and stability becomes a far more fragile prospect .
Obama and McCain are obviously mixtures of both realism and idealism .
American statesmen have always sought to combine the two in some fashion , and they are right to do so .
A foreign policy that is impractical will fail and one that lacks ideals is unworthy of the United States .
But the balance that each leader establishes is always different , and my main point is that Obama seems -- unusually for a modern - day Democrat -- highly respectful of the realist tradition .
And McCain , to an extent unusual for a traditional Republican , sees the world in moralistic terms .
In the end , the difference between Obama and McCain might come down to something beyond ideology -- temperament .
McCain is a pessimist about the world , seeing it as a dark , dangerous place where , without the constant and vigorous application of American force , evil will triumph .
Obama sees a world that is in many ways going our way .
As nations develop , they become more modern and enmeshed in the international economic and political system .
To him , countries like Iran and North Korea are holdouts against the tide of history .
America 's job is to push these progressive forces forward , using soft power more than hard , and to try to get the world 's major powers to solve the world 's major problems .
Call him an Optimistic Realist , or a Realistic Optimist .
But do n't call him naive .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Poland rejected as insufficient on Friday a U.S. offer to boost its air defences in return for basing a “ missile shield ” on its territory but said it remained open to further talks with Washington .
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk speaks to the media at the Prime Ministers Chancellery in Warsaw July 4 , 2008 .
Poland has rejected a U.S. offer to boost its air defenses in return for basing a " missile shield " on Polish soil but remains open for further talks with Washington , Tusk said on Friday .
REUTERS / Peter Andrews
The decision by Poland , a staunchly pro-American NATO ally , is a setback for the Bush administration ’s plans for global missile defence , which is intended to counter possible threats from what Washington calls “ rogue states ” , particularly Iran .
“ We have not reached a satisfactory result on the issue of increasing the level of Polish security , ” Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference after studying the final U.S. proposal .
“ The aim of the negotiations , in my view , is to enhance the security of our country .
We still agree that it is fundamental for us to maintain our alignment with the United States , which has been , is and will continue to be our strategic ally . ”
In Washington , a White House spokesman said the United States would continue its talks with Poland .
“ Discussions will continue , ” Gordon Johndroe told Reuters in an e-mail message .
The details of the U.S. offer have not been made public , though Tusk said it included a proposal to site Patriot ground - to - air missiles on Polish soil for one year .
In the months - long negotiations , Tusk ’s centre - right government had sought billions of dollars worth of U.S. investment to upgrade Polish air defences in return for hosting 10 missile interceptors .
“ We are ready to accept proposals or corrections from the American side which would include our proposal to increase ( our ) security .
We can do this in a day , a week , a month , ” Tusk said .
The Czech Republic has agreed to host a tracking radar under the project .
Its parliament has still to ratify the deal .
Russia has condemned the missile defence plan as a threat to its own security and has said it will target missiles at Poland and the Czech Republic -- its communist - era satellite states -- if the deployment goes ahead .
THREAT
“ If the threat related to the shield indeed increases , then we need elements such as Patriots on Polish territory , and not just for one year , ” Tusk said , adding that the problem was not a question of money .
Political analysts said Tusk ’s rebuff to Washington demonstrated a new Polish self - confidence on the global stage .
Warsaw is one of Washington ’s firmest allies in the region and has troops serving alongside its ally in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ This is the first time that Poland has said ‘ no ’ to the U.S. ...
It certainly sends a signal to Washington that Poland ’s support should not be taken for granted in any circumstances , ” said Pawel Swieboda , head of demosEuropa , a Warsaw think - tank .
“ But it is also the case that the government greatly raised expectations and that these were never very realistic .
Poland does need some compensation ( for hosting the interceptors ) but they went too far in demanding Patriots . ”
Polish President Lech Kaczynski , a right - wing opponent of the Tusk government and a strong supporter of the shield plan , is now likely to step up his attacks on the government .
But analysts said the domestic political fallout would be limited as Polish voters are largely hostile to the project .
Washington has said it wants
Poland to host the interceptors but that it would look elsewhere if Warsaw declines to take part .
The Baltic republic of Lithuania , northeast of Poland , has been mooted as an alternative site for the interceptors .

As you undoubtedly know by now , your son Johnny or your daughter , Jane , has a job .
You know this all too well because you are the one stuck behind the wheel of the car at ungodly hours of the morning like 5 AM or 6 AM , dropping off said kid .
I apologize , but operational needs being what they are , someone 's gotta stock shelves , flip hash browns and make coffee for me to drink .
Now as a parent , you believe you have all sorts of rights that you can enforce upon me , the manager .
Let me clear this issue up right now :
You do n't .
Here is my short list of things that bug me ( and probably 99 % of all managers everywhere ) :- Calling in sick for your kid .
If at 14 one is old enough to work in this province , then one is old enough to call in sick .
Unless your kid is in a coma , you are not doing your kid any favours .
It actually is insulting to us , the management , and to the kid .
Now I realize that you have heard all sorts of stories about how big of a prick I am to those calling in sick .
Let me assure you those are gross exaggerations .
I 'm very understanding - unless you 're calling in for your kid .
Then not so much .-
Getting mad when I call your house early in the morning to find out where Johnny / Jane is .
Tell your kid to invest in an alarm clock , cell phone and act more responsible .
I have a job to do too , and calling early in the morning is n't my favourite part of it .
So a little understanding here okay ?-
When your kid forgets to book off the family holiday , do n't get mad at me .
I am not a psychic or God .
If the family holiday is " last minute " , then there is not a very good chance that it can be accommodated .
If you see the look on your kid's face as he / she tells me that you sprung this last minute , you would never be so inconsiderate again in your life . -
Do n't threaten me by claiming that you know the owner of the company .
If you want to threaten me , pull a knife , a gun or a heck , even a pen .
I have n't actually met the owner of the company more than a couple times ( and I 've been employed there a lot longer than your kid ) .
The chances of you knowing the owner are not that good anyhow .
So that threat frightens me as much as a litter of newly born kittens . -
Asking your kid to ask for better shifts - eg not early morning or late night shifts on the weekends - because you only have two days off and you want to sleep in .
Sorry , I forget what weekends are like - I hear they are great though .
I also hear that misery loves company .
We try to have fair rotation .
Sometimes that means some weekends your kid gets the short end of the stick .
It ca n't be helped . -
Lastly , do n't come in and try to fight your child 's battles .
It 's embarrassing for your kid and you .
I know the fruit of your loins are completely great and awesome , but having a job is about being responsible .
If I am standing my ground , it 's not because I dislike your kid or you or life or eggplant - it 's because if I do n't , then I 'll have 39 other people trying to run the show their own way .
And that gets old pretty fast .
So in summation : Parents , I am not a glorified babysitter - do n't treat me that way .
Your kid has this job to make up for that allowance that you unceremoniously yanked from under them when they turned 13 .
You said , " Go get a job . "
You too have to live with the consequences .
None of which are really my problem .
Sincerely , The Manager

Being inactive increases the risk of developing depression or dementia , according to studies presented at a conference of the British Nutrition Foundation .
According to Nannette Mutrie of the University of Strathclyde , researchers are coming to understand how important physical activity is for psychological health .
She said that recent research suggests that exercise can be successfully used to treat depression .
Conversely , people who do live inactive lifestyles are twice as likely to become depressed .
" It 's only recently that people have begun to see the link between physical activity and mental health , " Mutrie said .
" It 's important for increasing people 's self esteem , general mood , coping with stress and even sleeping better .
And we now have very strong evidence that physical activity can prevent depression .
" Also presented were the results of a study conducted by researchers from the University of Bristol .
Researchers analyzed 17 prior studies that had examined the connection between physical activity and the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease or other forms of dementia .
The researchers concluded that people who were physically active had a 30 to 40 percent lower risk of developing dementia than people who were inactive .
This effect was seen in both women and men .
Professor Judy Buttriss , director general of the British Nutrition Foundation , said that the studies reinforced the importance of exercise as well as diet in remaining healthy over the long term .
" There has already , justifiably , been a lot of emphasis on good nutrition , " Buttriss said , " but we must also find ways of helping people to be more physically active to ensure that they maintain health and quality of life in later years .
" The U.K.'s Department of Health recommends that adults spend at least 30 minutes engaging in moderate exercise five days per week , and that children have one hour of moderate exercise each day .
However , more than 50 percent of adults , along with 40 percent of girls and 30 percent of boys , fail to reach these benchmarks .

This is the best plan ever
Tags : 4 chan , monster , girlfriend
Some of you do n’t like the fact that I do n’t like credit cards .
One of my regular readers criticized me for putting too much blame on credit cards .
He thinks that the lack of personal responsibility is what causes people to misuse credit cards , not the credit card itself .
I agree that personal responsibility is the key to sound money management , but credit cards are a horrible financial product .
The universal default provision , which many of you are familiar with , is the best reason why it is such a horrible product .
What is the universal default provision ?
It is a clause in many credit card agreements which states that if you are late on ANY credit payments , the credit card company reserves the right to increase your interest rate at any time without notice .
Not only will it kick in if you are late on a different credit card , it also applies if you are late on a utility , mortgage , or car loan payment .
Your “ fixed ” interest rate of 9 % could increase to 29 % in one day if your credit card contains this provision .
Is It Fair ?
This is a matter of opinion .
On one hand , when you sign on the dotted line to receive a credit card , you are agreeing to all of the terms and conditions of the card .
On the other hand , does anyone ever read all of that fine print ?
Plus , it ’s seen as shady and opportunistic on the part of the credit card company .
Although , it does make a little sense on the part of the credit card company .
You may have had a great credit score in 2005 that allowed you to receive a great interest rate , but now your credit score is 100 points lower for late payments .
Should n’t the credit card company have the right to charge you more interest since you are a higher risk to them ?
Congress and Legislation
Since 2003 , Congress has attempted to pass several bills to completely eliminate the use of the universal default provision in credit card terms .
Congress views it as a predatory lending practice .
So far , Citi Bank and JP Morgan are the only credit card issuing institution to remove their universal default provision .
United States Senator , Carl Levin , has given the credit card issuers an ultimatum , either they remove it themselves , or Congress will do it for them .
So Far , Bank of America , Discover Card , and Capital One are still defending the provision .
There is a lot of money to be lost for the credit card companies if they lose the battle .
I ’m not a fan of credit cards for many reasons , and this is one of them .
They cause you to spend more money , they tempt you to spend when you should n’t spend , and they will take any angle to make more money off of you when possible .
If credit card companies ever create policies that benefit the consumer , I ’ll consider using them .
I know there are many of you out there that make a couple hundred dollars a year by paying for everything on a cash - back rewards program card , but it only takes one wrong move or one personal disaster to allow the credit card company to make their money back from you .
Think about it , and feel free to post your thoughts in the comment section .
Muqtada al Sadr .
The Mahdi Army suffered a significant blow during fighting against Iraqi and Coalition forces this year , according to an Iraq intelligence report .
The heavy casualties suffered by the Mahdi Army have forced Muqtada al Sadr , the leader of the Mahdi Army and the Sadrist political movement , to change his tactics and disband the Mahdi Army in favor of a small , secretive fighting force .
“ More than 2,000 cadres from the Mahdi Army leaders were killed recently , ” an Iraqi intelligence official told Gulf News .
“ This led to the almost complete collapse of the army , ” the official said .
An estimated 1,300 Mahdi Army fighters “ escaped to safe houses in Iran . ” Muqtada al Sadr currently resides in Qom , Iran , under the protection of Iran ’s Qods Force .
The Mahdi Army took heavy casualties while opposing the Iraqi security forces in Basrah and the South and against US and Iraqi forces in Sadr City during operations to secure the areas in March , April , and May .
More than 1,000 Mahdi Army fighters were killed in Sadr City alone , according to a Mahdi Army commander in Baghdad .
Another 415 were killed in Basrah .
More than 400 were killed during fighting in the southern cities of Najaf , Karbala , Hillah , Diwaniyah , Amarah , Samawah , and Nasiriyah in late March and early April , according to numbers compiled by The Long War Journal .
Thousands more have been wounded our captured .
The setbacks in Baghdad , Basrah , and the South have forced Sadr to turn the Mahdi Army into “ a secret military organization , ” the Iraqi report stated .
“ The number of members does n’t exceed 150 - 200 , hugely down from the total estimated number of 50,000 in the past two years . ”
Iraqi intelligence believes the Mahdi Army , which is funded and supported by Iran , “ will be somewhat [ similar ] to Al Qaida and some of the other Sunni armed groups and will have to carry out quality operations against US forces and assassinate some of the important Iraqi figures [ to prove itself ] . ”
The Iraqi report counters the current narrative on the Mahdi Army ’s strategy .
Analysts have stated the Mahdi Army cleverly melted away to avoid confrontation with the Iraqi military and wait out the US military until it withdraws .
The intelligence report suggests Sadr was forced to change strategy and retreat in the face of heavy casualties and dwindling support from the Shia population .
Sadr ordered the Mahdi Army to disband and created the small cadre of secretive fighters on June 13 .
Two days later he ordered the Sadrist block to withdraw from the provincial elections , and instead said the movement would infiltrate candidates into independent blocs .
The US military began targeting the senior leadership of the Mahdi Army in late 2006 , and targeted the Iranian - backed elements in earnest during “ the surge ” in the spring , summer , and fall of 2007 .
Operations against the Mahdi Army continue
Iraqi and US forces have not rested after successful operations against the Mahdi Army in Baghdad , Basrah , and the wider South from March to June .
A large operation is under way in Maysan province , once a stronghold for the Mahdi Army and the Sadrist movement .
Iraqi security forces have detained 174 “ wanted persons ” in and around Amarah , the provincial capital , since operations began two weeks ago .
The mayor of Amarah , several provincial council members , and several Mahdi Army commanders have been arrested during the operation .
Iraqi and US forces have conducted multiple raids against the Mahdi Army in Baghdad and Hillah over the past week , detaining more than 100 Mahdi Army fighters and several senior leaders .
Iraqi and US forces detained three senior - level Mahdi Army commanders during raids in Baghdad and Hillah on June 20 and 21 .
One of the commanders was responsible for the southeastern district in Baghdad , another was assigned to promote Mahdi Army leaders in Baghdad and has close connection to the Sadrist movement in Najaf , and the third was a senior leader in Hillah .
In a June 22 raid in Baghdad , Iraqi soldiers captured “ an Iranian surrogate , reportedly in charge of more than 100 individuals ” behind improvised explosive device and explosively formed penetrator attacks and a “ key financier . ”
Iraqi soldiers also captured a leader of a Mahdi Army “ criminal network who is suspected of being a financier who directs , coordinates and funds operations in the surrounding cities , including trafficking weapons and providing safe havens for criminals ” in Zubadiyah south of Baghdad .
An IED cell leader was captured by US troops in Baghdad on June 24 .
On June 21 , Iraqi forces detained Sayyid Tahseen , a senior member of Muqtada al Sadr ’s political movement , in Al Kut in Wasit province .
Iraqi police described Tahseen as “ one of the most important individual wanted by security forces ” who is “ wanted for more than 45 cases , including armed operations against security forces , in addition to killing and abduction of innocent people . ”
On June 26 , Coalition forces captured a senior “ Special Groups ” leader and three associates late during an operation in Ash Shumali near Hillah .
The Mahdi Army leader has “ ties to some of the highest levels of the Iranian - sponsored organization . ”
Scores of lower - level Mahdi Army fighters have been captured over the past week .
Iraqi Special Operations Forces captured three Mahdi Army fighters in the Shula neighborhood in Baghdad on June 20 .
US troops captured a Mahdi Army fighter in the Rashid district of southern Baghdad on June 21 and killed six Mahdi Army fighters as they planted IEDs in New Baghdad on June 22 .
Over the weekend , Iraqi security forces detained 65 Mahdi Army fighters and seized weapons caches during operations north of the city of Nasiriyah in Dhi Qhar province .
Iraqi security forces detained 37 Mahdi Army fighters during separate raids in Hillah on June 23 .
US troops also found a vehicle with nine of the Mahdi Army - built improvised rocket - assisted mortars , otherwise know as “ flying IEDs , ” in the Kadamiyah district in Baghdad .
The Mahdi Army has fought back , killing three US soldiers and two US civilians in Baghdad .
Two US soldiers , two US civilians , and six Iraqis were killed June 24 in a bombing at a government center in Sadr City .
The US military said a Special Groups operative was behind the attack .
On June 25 , a US soldier was killed in an EFP attack in Baghdad .

BBC News , Halberstadt , Germany
John Cage did not say how slow his piece should be played
A note from a piece by a US composer is to be played this weekend in a German town in what has been called the world 's slowest and longest concert .
The church organ in Halberstadt will play the next - sixth - chord of John Cage 's As Slow As Possible work .
The performance began in 2000 and is scheduled to last a total of 639 years .
The idea of taking so long to get through the composer 's piece is to find a musical way of countering the hustle and bustle of modern life .
' Testing patience '
When Cage wrote his famous work in 1985 , there was one tiny detail the late avant - garde composer chose to omit - exactly how slow the piece should be played .
Its maiden performance lasted a rather normal 29 minutes .
A subsequent version took 71 minutes .
But at the medieval church in Halberstadt , they are really testing the patience of the audience .
Every so often - although not too often , you understand - a chord change is made on the church organ and the piece of music edges a tiny bit closer to the end .
This weekend , weights holding down the organ pedals will be shifted and the sixth chord change will occur , to much celebration in the town centre .
If only Halberstadt could find a way of countering growing old - at least then I might stand a chance of hearing the final note being played in the year 2639 .
The bad dream of DRM continues .
Yahoo e-mailed its Yahoo !
Music
Store customers yesterday , telling them it will be closing for good — and the company will take its DRM license key servers offline on September 30 , 2008 .
Sure , it 's bad news and yet another example of the sheer lobotomized brain - deadness that has characterized music DRM , but the reaction of most music fans will be : " Yahoo had an online music store ? "
If you think this sounds familiar , it 's because this happened earlier this year with MSN Music , although Microsoft has since relented and will keep the DRM authorization servers up and running through 2011 .
Once the Yahoo store goes down and the key servers go offline , existing tracks cannot be authorized to play on new computers .
Instead ,
Yahoo recommends the old , lame , and lossy workaround of burning the files to CD , then reripping them onto the computer .
Sure , you 'll lose a bunch of blank CDs , sound quality , and all the metadata , but that 's a small price to pay for the privilege of being able to listen to that music you lawfully acquired .
Good thing you did n't download it illegally or just buy it on CD !
No , you were one of the digital pioneers , and in this brave new frontier world , a few people are just going to get malaria .
Fact of life .
And someone will step in a bear trap , and then it 's time for the bite rag , the alcohol , and the saw .
Just the price of progress .
And yes , some poor group will get trapped in snowfall when crossing the pass , and cannibalism may or may not be involved by the time they stumble barefoot from the mountains next spring .
No one can prevent such tragedies .
Well , except for everyone who saw this coming .
Ars has been one of only many groups banging the anti-DRM drum for years .
We 're not pro-piracy , we 're just not dumb as rocks .
DRM makes things harder for legal users ; it creates hassles that illegal users wo n't deal with ; it ( often ) prevents cross- platform compatibility and movement between devices .
In what possible world was that a good strategy for building up the nascent digital download market ?
The only possible rationales could be 1 ) to control piracy ( which , obviously , it has had no effect on , thanks to the CD and the fact that most DRM is broken ) or 2 ) to nickel - and - dime consumers into accepting a new pay - for - use regime that sees moving tracks from CD to computer to MP3 player as a " privilege " to be monetized .
What we really need to do is just — you know what ?
Why bother .
We 've been down this road so many times before that everyone knows their lines by heart .
No , it 's not the end of the world ; yes , we have bigger problems .
But the Yahoo news is just another depressing reminder of all the wasted time and energy put into these schemes designed to create roadblocks for legal users .
At least the music business has gotten the message , and all four major labels and most indies now sell DRM - free online .

Advertisement Musicians may soon be able to play instruments using just the power of the mind .
Researchers at Goldsmiths , University of London have developed technology to translate thoughts into musical notes .
The Brain Computer Interface for Music requires electrodes to be attached to the head .
They pick up electrical impulses from the brain which are passed through an electroencephalography ( EEG ) machine and analysed .
The man behind the project , Dr Mick Grierson , demonstrated the system to BBC News .
The brain monitoring device requires electrodes to be attached to the head through a cap .
When musical notes flash the scientist stares at the display while thinking of a note he wants to play .
When the same note appears it unconsciously triggers a change in his brain activity - a change registered by the computer he was plugged into .
" After a while it will make a decision about which note I am thinking about and it tries to play it , " he said .
Dr Grierson has run trials in which 6 out of 8 notes played were the same as those being thought of .
The project is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and aims to find a way for people who have difficulty using their hands to play music .
" There are many composers who are struck down with multiple sclerosis and other physical disabilities who still want to continue making music " , said Dr Grierson .
Brain game A number of research projects around the world are looking into using brain controlled interaction with computers to improve the lives of people with disabilities .
Tokyo's Keio University has demonstrated robotic hands being controlled through thought processes .
The research is also leading to commercial products .
US and Australian firm Emotiv hopes to have a headset video game costing $ 299 on the market by the end of the year .
It enables players to vanquish villains through thoughts and emotions without ever touching a controller .

Mr Fukuda has come under fire for his handling of domestic issues
Japan 's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has suffered a fresh blow as parliament 's opposition - controlled upper house has passed a censure motion against him .
The censure , which carries no legal force , is the first to pass against a prime minister under Japan 's post - war constitution .
Mr Fukuda 's popularity has plummeted in recent months , and the opposition want him to call a snap election .
But a spokesman for the prime minister said that this was not an option .
" The prime minister is n't thinking of dissolving parliament or resigning .
We are not in such a situation , " top government spokesman Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference .
" The Fukuda cabinet 's duty is to pursue its various policies , " he said .
Election calls
Mr Fukuda took office in September 2007 after predecessor Shinzo
Abe resigned following disastrous upper house polls that left the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in control of the chamber .
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party still has a sizeable majority in the more powerful lower house .
But the DPJ has used its upper house domination to block a series of key government proposals , throwing the country into unprecedented political deadlock .
At the same time , Mr Fukuda 's approval rating has fallen dramatically amid rows over lost pension records and a new compulsory health insurance scheme for the elderly .
The censure motion criticised the prime minister 's handling of domestic issues and called on him to resign or call snap polls .
" What we want to do through this censure motion is to have a general election , " opposition lawmaker Azuma Koshiishi told the chamber .
But Mr Fukuda is not required to call an election until September 2009 .
And the lower house is set to hit back by passing a motion of confidence in the government later this week , media reports say .
A lot of hysteria and technical confusion surround the current war of words and sabre rattling between the U.S. , Israel , and Iran .
Much of the media , which does not understand the military issues involved and exaggerates the dangers in the Israel - Iran confrontation , bear much of the blame .
So some clarification :
-- Missiles .
Iran announced its Shahab - III missile is ready to retaliate against any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities .
This missile is not long - ranged , as media claims , but a medium - ranged missile .
Iran says it can deliver a two ton conventional warhead over 1,200 miles .
But Israeli and US sources say its maximum range is only 800-900 miles , putting part of Israel out of range .
To fly further , it would need to reduce the weight of the warhead - the same technique used by Iraq in its longer - ranged Scud missiles .
The obsolescent , unreliable Shahab - III missile is highly inaccurate , particularly at maximum range .
The current version is liquid fueled , meaning it is very vulnerable while being set up on its mobile launcher .
Israel has developed tactics using aircraft , drones and missiles to attack enemy missiles being readied for launch .
Iran has an estimated 24 Shabab - III's .
The other Iranian missiles fired this week were short ranged models of little strategic value .
Tehran was caught - red handed doctoring films of the missile firings to cover up the unsuccessful launch of a short - ranged missile .
This embarrassing incident reinforced the view that Iran 's missile theatrics were bluff designed to mask its overall military weakness .
Israel , by contrast , has an estimated 50 Jericho - II nuclear - armed missiles with a range from 900 - 2,700 miles , putting every Mideast capital and parts of Russia , Pakistan , and Europe within range .
Each Jericho - II carries a warhead that can destroy a major city .
-- Warheads - Medium - ranged missiles are almost useless without nuclear warheads .
Iran has no nuclear weapons , and even if it did manage to develop them , it would be many years before a compact warhead could be developed that could be carried atop a missiles and withstand heavy G - forces .
Until Iran has nuclear warheads , Iran 's Shabab's will be for show rather than military utility and , barring a lucky shot , not much more effective than Saddam Hussein 's ineffective Scud missiles or medieval war machines .
-- Other systems - Israel has an indestructible nuclear triad .
In addition to the Jerichos , which are housed in caves and carried by mobile launchers , Israel has one of the world 's top air forces with long - ranged F - 15I 's ( Israeli version of the USAF F model ) and extended range F - 16's , supported by air refilling aircraft , capable of delivering nuclear weapons to Iran .
Germany also supplied Israel with three Dolphin - class submarines that are said to carry nuclear armed cruise missiles .
At least one sub is always on station off Iran 's coast .
In addition , Israel 's new Ofek - 3 military satellite provides full coverage of Iran and the surrounding region .
Israel is also the only nation that can access US satellite and other sensor data in real time , even allowing it to follow President Ahmadinejad 's car as it drives around Tehran .
-- Air Forces - Israel has probably the world 's second or third most potent air force , with around 400 state - of - the art , US - supplied combat aircraft and among the world 's most skilled pilots .
The IAF is supported by a galaxy of electronic warfare systems , drones , and long - range recon systems with integrated command and control .
Israel 's Arrow is the world 's most advanced operational anti-ballistic missiles system said to be able to destroy 85 % of any incoming missiles .
Land and sea - based US anti-missile systems also protect Israel .
Iran 's Air Force is decrepit : it has only about 165 serviceable combat aircraft , mostly of from the 60's and 70's era .
The only aircraft Iran has capable of striking Israel are 18 - 20 Soviet - era SU - 24's and a handful of dangerously deteriorated 40 - year old US - supplied F - 4 Phantoms and F - 14's .
The few can still fly would be sitting ducks for Israel 's Air Force .
-- Capability .
Thanks to US support , Israel remains two full military generations - or even more - ahead of its Arab and Iranian rivals who must increasingly rely on Chinese and meager amounts of Russian arms .
Israel is three generations ahead in all - important electronic warfare and command and control .
Israel 's raid on Syria last year showed it could easily neutralize Syria 's air defenses , which are more modern than Iran's .
-- Destruction Factor .
Israel 's partisans keep hearing that one nuclear weapon would destroy the Jewish state .
This is true .
But this also applies to Egypt , where a single nuke on the Aswan Dam would inundate the nation and kill millions .
This is also true of Syria , Lebanon , the Gulf Emirates , Jordan , and Iraq .
Only Saudi Arabia and Iran have strategic space .
One nuclear strike on Tehran would put Iran out of business for years .
Any nuclear strike in the Mideast would raise huge storms of radioactive dust that would blanket the area and US troops in Iraq .
An Israeli or US attack on Iranian nuclear sites would release substantial amounts of radiation .
Thanks to its strategic triad , Israel 's nuclear forces are indestructible , hence capable of devastating retaliation against any enemy nuclear strike .
The Bush administration has vowed nuclear retaliation against any nation that attacks Israel with nuclear weapons .
So long as it has nuclear weapons , Israel cannot hope to prevent its neighbors from one day acquiring similar rms .
Israel will have to learn to live with this threat , as does the United States every day , until there is comprehensive Mideast nuclear disarmament .
So the old Cold War system of mutual assured destruction may remain the foundation of Mideast nuclear peace .

What makes great graffiti into geek graffiti ?
It can be the approach , using nifty computer equipment to generate graffiti ( for example ) .
It can also be the content , as in the case of pixelated , projected or or even “ physically hyperlinked ” street art .
The following examples span the spectrum but share elements only a geek can fully appreciate .
And see more under 100 + Works of Creative and Geeky Art and Graffiti .
Hektor “ is a portable spray - paint output device for laptop computers . ”
In essence , it is a machine that packs into a suitcase but that can be rapidly deployed to plot out digitally created graffiti on urban surfaces or at art shows .
This geeky graffiti art project is even open source , with the technology made available to anyone who wants to use it .
The low - tech nature of production results in interesting ambiguities that inform the finished works and make even repeat pieces varied and original .
Graffiti Taxonomy starts with finding tags in a given area ( e.g. the Lower East Side ) and distilled into font - like digital representations .
They are then sorted by letter to compare the differences from one tagger ’s work to the next .
Finally , they are printed out as collections and pasted on public surfaces , a kind of geeky intellectual meta - graffiti .
Grafedia is an interactive process of ‘ linking ’ the real world and in the internet ( yes , double - meaning intended ) .
People submit media files ( images , text or video ) to the Grafedia website then scrawl email addresses on real world walls that , if emailed , will return that media file to the emailer – a “ real - life hyperlink with urban surfaces as webpages . ”
Bikes Against Bush was part interactive protest and part performance art set in the streets of New York City .
“ Internet enabled bicycle outfitted with a custom - designed printing device , the Bikes Against Bush bicycle can print text messages sent from web users directly onto the streets of Manhattan in water - soluble chalk . ”
A few years back , the Bikes Against Bush project encountered legal trouble but the charges were dismissed .
The SMS Guerilla Projector “ is a high powered , home made projection device that can be used to project SMS messages on to buildings , signs or any other surface . ”
A mobile phone , camera lense and slide projector are combined to create this light graffiti device that can be used to broadcast visual messages many times the size of the device itself and on prominent urban surfaces .
The TXTualHealing mobile projection idea would work great with the guerilla projecter above .
Messages are texted to laptops attached to projects and broadcast in realtime at set locations all the way from Munich , Germany to Toronto , Canada high up on buildings in crowded places .
The short film above demonstrates this strange street art in action .
For more , here is a great illustrated guide to graffiti around the world as well as related articles on architectural light graffiti and 3D street art .

A coded letter sent last year to the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois has the lab , and outside coders stumped .
The letter was sent anonymously last March in a hand - addressed envelope via regular mail to the physics lab 's public affairs office .
After sitting on the letter for more than a year , the lab posted it on a physics blog in May , hoping to get help cracking it .
Thousands of sleuths have taken a stab at it so far and have succeeded to crack two parts of the letter .
An engineer at the Canadian Space Center used a variation of the base - 3 system to uncover a line that reads " Frank Shoemaker would call this noise , " which refers to an 86 - year - old retired Princeton University physicist who helped design the magnets used with the lab 's first particle accelerator , known as the Main Ring .
Another line in the letter has been cracked to read , " Employee number basse sixteen . "
A Chicago Tribune story about the letter offers some possible explanations behind the two sentences and what appears to be a typo in the second sentence .
But , like the famous CIA Kryptos sculpture ( which also has a typo ) , one final section of the letter ( pictured above ) remains unsolved .
The lab is hoping outsiders will help them unravel the clues .
You can see the entire letter on the physics blog where it was posted .
An undated update to the blog post indicates that they suspect they now know who may have sent the letter .
Coders post your solutions in the comments section below or send them directly to me ( you 'll find my e-mail address in this blog 's righthand column ) with an explanation about how you cracked it .

On Friday night I was sitting in my new favorite café , ' Snice , on 8th Ave. in the West Village .
I love this place for its strong coffee , and its big communal tables just made for showdowns between Mac and PC users ( on the night in question , Macs outnumbered PCs 2 - to - 1 ) .
I was sitting , tapping away on my laptop , secretly glad that the wireless was n't working because maybe I 'd actually get some work done without the distraction of the Internet , and rocking out a little to my favorite playlist , when I noticed that the trendy guys at the table behind me had a view of my iTunes window .
In its lower left hand corner was the album artwork for the song I was listening to at that moment , by one of my favorite country singers , Carrie Underwood .
They looked at me .
I looked at them .
They looked at Carrie .
They looked at each other , disgust written on their faces .
Then they held up a cross and a clove of garlic , and threw Holy Water on me .
Okay , not quite .
But they did look truly mortified that they were being forced to share a space with me and Ms. Underwood , and as I turned back to my computer , the looks on their faces betrayed the kind of disdain , mingled with pity , that made me remember why I usually keep my penchant for country music to myself : people here are music snobs .
I do n't say this to trash my adopted home of the last three years , and I certainly do n't mean to insist that everyone love Tim McGraw the way I do .
But I did notice , upon arriving at college and doing some old - fashioned Facebook stalking , that a lot of people seemed to describe their music tastes as " anything but country . "
In my freshman year , I happened to make friends with some of the few country fans on campus , and they introduced me to their much - reviled collections of twang .
I started as a social listener , but before I knew it , I had a playlist - a - day country habit .
I kept my addiction to myself , because on the East Coast of the U.S. , country music is about as popular and desirable as an STD .
Do n't believe me ?
Let me tell you about my friend Maria .
Maria , a molecular biology major , did her thesis research on the herpes virus .
When she used to reveal this to people , Maria told me , their attempts to hide their disgust for the topic made Jessica Simpson look like an Oscar winner , and the ensuing discussions always seemed to be an attempt for them to reassure themselves that Maria 's interest in herpes was purely scientific , and she had n't actually had to experience the virus to be able to study it .
I like country enough to have spent this whole year studying it for my junior thesis .
When I told people about my research topic , their reactions were much the same as the ones Maria experienced : " So , uh , do you actually have to , like , listen to it , and stuff ? "
This was usually accompanied by shuddering and grimacing .
Yes , I had to , like , listen to it .
So , there 's my confession — no , not confession , a loud , proud , proclamation : I like country music .
I like twang and Southern accents and ridiculous , self pitying narrative songs about heartbroken husbands and cheating wives .
I like funny song titles like " Jesus Loves You , I Don't " and " Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off " and I love a man in a Stetson hat .
But I realize that my music taste places me in a cultural minority in the Northeast , and especially here in New York City , so I guess I should n't have been surprised at the reactions of those guys at the table behind me .
I left ' Snice feeling dejected .
Was there no one in this town who shared my love for Sugarland and Keith Urban ?
Was I really alone in thinking that despite being a native East - Coaster , Bon Jovi has never been sexier than during his recent foray into country ?
Having recently discovered that one of the city 's best vintage stores , Cherry , was only a few blocks from my house , I stopped in on my way home , and found the comfort I had been seeking .
Waiting for me at the top of a stack of old t- shirts , as though the country gods had heard my plea , was a 1975 Hank Williams Jr. tour shirt , with " Bocephus " emblazoned across the front .
I sighed in delight and asked the salesgirl how she expected to sell a shirt like this in New York City .
" Oh I know , " she replied , " people are n't really country fans around here , but we 'll find someone who'll want it . "
She was right : I took it off the pile and tried it on .
Unfortunately , while it catered to my music preferences , the shirt did n't do the same for my budget , and I was struck by the irony of a very old t- shirt , made for fans of a genre that espouses living simply and without pretension , being sold some 20 years later in a New York City boutique at five times its original price .
While I was trying it on , the salesgirl told me that she and her boss , who was from the South , were both country fans , and we talked for a while about our favorite artists .
We talked about the Dixie Chicks and Tennessee , and what it is that makes country a genre unlike any other , and while I did n't buy the Hank Williams Jr. t- shirt , I did walk out knowing that I had found one place in Manhattan where my music choices were not reviled , but embraced .
I might be a private school girl from the suburbs of Sydney , and I might be living in the " anything but country " capital of America , but I left that store with my head held high .
Then I turned up my iPod as loud as it would go , and walked defiantly home , “ Redneck Woman ” blaring all the way .

Locals knew about Machu Picchu before Western explorers found it A team of historians says the lost city of the Incas , Machu Picchu , in Peru was discovered more than 40 years earlier than previously thought and ransacked .
Machu Picchu , now Peru 's biggest tourist attraction , was famously believed to have been discovered in 1911 by US explorer Hiram Bingham .
The ruins are the crown jewel of Peru 's archaeological sites in Peru and draw thousands of tourists every day .
Machu Pichu carries symbolic value for Peru 's indigenous people .
It was built by one of the last Inca emperors , Pachacutec , in around 1450 and kept secret from the Spanish conquerors who invaded about 100 years later .
Now the story about its discovery by the western world has been shaken up by a team of historians who say a German businessman looted its treasures more than 40 years before .
They say the adventurer , Augusto Berns , who traded in Peru 's wood and gold , raided the citadel 's tombs in 1867 apparently with the blessing of the Peruvian government .
He had set up a sawmill at the foot of the forested mountain on which Machu Picchu stands and systematically robbed precious artefacts which he sold to European galleries and museums .
Only when one of the historians found a map in Peru 's national museum were his activities traced .
Until now it has been believed that Hiram Bingham , an American academic from Yale University , brought the Inca city to the attention of the world in 1911 , although local people clearly already knew of its presence .
Mr Berns had a far less noble objective and researchers are now trying to find out how many artefacts he spirited out of the country at a time when there were no known archaeological expeditions in Peru .
Sadly more than a century later , Peruvian archaeological treasures are still being looted by grave robbers and sold on the international black market .

Turley : ' Pathetic ' if Monica Goodling takes fall for Bush officials David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This
While a recent report on illegal politicization of the Justice Department is a good first step in introducing accountability to the Bush administration , it would be " pathetic " if culpability stops with midlevel aides like Monica Goodling , a constitutional expert says .
Monday 's report from the Justice Department 's Inspector General and Office of Professional responsibility concluded that Goodling and Kyle Sampson , former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales 's chief of staff , acted illegally in eliminating applicants for career department jobs on the basis of political affiliation or sexual orientation .
Calling the Goodling / Sampson efforts " like the Voldemort department of human resources , " constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley tells MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann that the report offers " a glimpse at just how unhinged the Bush Justice Department became . "
Turley says the 146 - page report ( available here ) provides some information that had not previously been disclosed in congressional investigations of the firing of nine federal prosecutors , which is believed to have been politically motivated .
But he says more investigation is needed to determine whose idea it was to staff the department almost exclusively with Republican loyalists .
" That would be rather pathetic , would n't it , if Monica Goodling was the only one who went off to club fed , " Turley said , speculating about the possibility of Goodling being convicted of a federal crime .
Even that possibility , though is a long shot , at least for the next several months .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey , a Bush appointee , has refused to pursue contempt of Congress charges against administration figures who have flouted subpoenas demanding testimony , so there 's little chance he would pursue perjury or other charges against a former administration official like Goodling .
The White House 's silence on the Justice Department report should indicate , perhaps , at least a tacit endorsement of Goodling 's tactics , Turley says .
" The question really is why is n't the president coming forward and saying there 's a shame factor here at what occurred at the Justice Department , " he said .
" Alberto Gonzales picked this person , not because of the merits -- she lacked anything on the merits .
She was picked because she was an extremist , and this is the result . "

The climate of early Earth was no day at the beach , with stinging acid rains and an intensely warm surface , a new study suggests .
These harsh conditions could explain why geologists today have found no rocks more than 4 billion years old :
They were all weathered away .
The fate of all those rocks from the first 500 million years after Earth formed has been a longstanding question in geology .
Scientists have floated various explanations for the missing rocks , including destruction by barrages of meteorites and the possibility that the early Earth was a sea of red - hot magma in which no rocks could form .
The analysis in the new study suggests a different scenario .
Clues from oldest crystals Geologists from the University of Wisconsin - Madison examined zircon crystals , the oldest known materials on Earth , to shed light on the fate of rocks from the early Earth .
Zircons , which are smaller than a speck of sand , can offer a window back in time to about 4.4 billion years ago , when the Earth was a mere 150 million years old because they are extremely resistant to chemical changes .
The research team analyzed the ratios of different isotopes of lithium ( which have different atomic weights and number of neutrons per atom ) in zircons from the Jack Hills in Western Australia .
They compared the lithium fingerprints of those zircons to those from continental crust and rocks similar to those found in Earth 's mantle , the molten layer sandwiched between the crust and core .
The results of the analysis , detailed in a recent online issue of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters , provide evidence that the young Earth already had the beginnings of continents , relatively cool temperatures and liquid water by the time the Australian zircons formed .
But the lithium signatures also hold signs of rock exposure on Earth 's surface and breakdown by weather and water , suggesting that early rocks were destroyed by intense weathering .
" Extensive weathering earlier than 4 billion years ago actually makes a lot of sense , " said study team member John Valley .
" People have suspected this , but there 's never been any direct evidence . "
Acid rain and greenhouse effect
The early Earth is thought to have had extremely high levels of carbon dioxide — perhaps 10,000 times as much as today .
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can combine with water to create acid rain .
" At [ those levels of carbon dioxide ] , you would have had vicious acid rain and intense greenhouse [ effects ] .
That is a condition that will dissolve rocks , " Valley said .
" If granites were on the surface of the Earth , they would have been destroyed almost immediately — geologically speaking — and the only remnants that we could recognize as ancient would be these zircons . "

One of the Commissioners , Prof Jeremy Holder , told The Telegraph : " The provocation laws have been a constant source of problems for the courts .

Mr. McCain ’s battle of Lexington is part of a struggle he is engaged in every day .
A politician who has thrived in the give - and - take settings of campaign buses , late - night TV couches and town meetings , he now is trying to meet the more formal speaking demands of a general election campaign .
By his own admission , Mr. McCain is not a great orator .
He is ill - suited to lecterns , which often dwarf his small stature , and he tends to sound as if he is reading his lines , not speaking them .
His shortcomings have been accentuated in a two - man race , particularly because the other man  Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee  can often dazzle on stage .
Mr. McCain and his advisers know that Mr. Obama ’s ability to excite huge crowds will make for an inevitable podium mismatch for the older , softer - spoken Republican .
“ We ’re going up against a guy who is off the charts , ” said Mark Salter , Mr. McCain ’s longtime Senate chief of staff and campaign adviser .
To better compete , Mr. McCain is undergoing a subtle but marked transition as a political performer , said aides and people who have watched him .
As part of a staff shakeup that was announced Tuesday , he brought in a new adviser  Greg Jenkins , a former White House official and Fox News producer  who will oversee the producing and staging of Mr. McCain ’s events .
Mr. Jenkins is considered an expert at political stagecraft , oversaw many of President Bush ’s appearances and served as executive director of the 2004 inaugural committee .
Mr. McCain is working closely with aides like Brett O’Donnell , a former debate consultant for Mr. Bush , to improve his speech and performance .
He is working to limit his verbal tangents and nonverbal tics .
He is speaking less out of the sides of his mouth , which can produce a wiseguy twang reminiscent of the Penguin from the Batman stories , and he is relying less on his favorite semantic crutch  the phrase “ my friends ”  which he used repeatedly in his campaign appearances .
He also appears to be trying to exercise restraint , advisers and campaign observers say , when speaking off the cuff , wisecracking in town meetings and criticizing his opponent .
In recent weeks , for example , Mr. McCain seems to have reined in the sarcasm he has directed at Mr. Obama .
( In May , for example , he said of his opponent , “ With his very , very great lack of experience and knowledge of the issues , he ’s been very successful . ” )

Check out John McCain trying to wiggle his way out of the fact that he voted against MLK day back in 1983 .
John McCain was born in 1936 .
He was how old , how old --- hmmmm --- let 's see ... maybe 47 years old I think .
He was almost 50 years old and he voted against MLK day !
You see he needed just a few more years to figure out the impact MLK had on our society .
He certainly can't say in this statement that he was young and inexperienced .
Nope , he has to give the impression that he was young and inexperienced since it was his first year in Congress --- so he studied and learned and studied and learned until it dawned on him .
And then he suddenly realized he made a big mistake .
Click here to see the video .
McCain : I voted in my first , I think it was my first year in congress against then ...
I began to learn and I studied and people talked to me and I not supported it but I fought very hard in my home state of Arizona for recognition against a Governor who was against my own party .
And what else did he say ?
“ I had not been involved in the issue .
I had come from being in the military to running for Congress in a state that did not have a very large African American population and it had not been in issue .
It just simply had not been . ”
In a February 2000 interview with ABC News , McCain said his initial opposition to a holiday was based on his belief that “ it was not necessary to have another federal holiday , that it cost too much money , that other presidents were not recognized . ”
He did n't follow teh Blacks all that much because they did n't really exist in Arizona .
The not usually very good Jack Tapper makes the same points on McCain and MLK day .
Arab League ministers said the ICC move could destabilise Sudan Arab foreign ministers say they have agreed a plan of action to defuse the crisis between Sudan and the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
They met in Cairo after the ICC 's chief prosecutor said he would seek to indict Sudan 's president on charges of war crimes and genocide in Darfur .
Ministers said the ICC move had set a dangerous precedent .
Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League , said he would travel to Sudan on Sunday to discuss their plan .
However , he declined to reveal its details at the end of Saturday 's emergency meeting .
Fragile peace Mr Moussa said that Arabs had to work closely with the African Union and the UN to protect the fragile peace process in Sudan .
In a joint resolution issued at the end of the meeting , foreign ministers of the 22 - nation Arab League said the ICC move was not acceptable and undermined Sudan 's sovereignty .
" The council decides solidarity with the Republic of Sudan in confronting schemes that undermine its sovereignty , unity and stability and their non-acceptance of the unbalanced , not objective position of the prosecutor general of the Internal Criminal Court , " the resolution said .
Amr Moussa , Secretary - General of the Arab League , will visit Sudan Earlier , Algeria had called on other Arab nations to press the UN Security Council to stop the ICC from issuing the arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir .
" What the prosecutor of the court has done is a dangerous precedent , " Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told the meeting .
" We have [ to take ] ... a strong stance in solidarity with our brothers in Sudan and move effectively with regional and international organisations and the ... states in the Security Council to immediately reconsider this demand by the prosecutor . "
Sudan has asked China and Russia , as well as the Arab League and the African Union , to help it pursue a UN Security Council resolution suspending a warrant for Mr Bashir for 12 months .
Speaking after Saturday 's meeting , Sudan 's Minister for Foreign Affairs , Al Sammani al - Wasila , told the AP news agency : " We reject all the charges old and new . "
Troubled region
But he added that " the position expressed by our brothers is fair and balanced " .
ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo has asked the court for a warrant for Mr Bashir on suspicion of masterminding crimes against humanity in the troubled Darfur region .
Mr Moreno - Ocampo accused Mr Bashir of running a campaign of genocide that killed 35,000 people outright , at least another 100,000 through a " slow death " and forced 2.5 million to flee their homes in Darfur .

Differentiating regions
( An alternative title for this post is , what is the type of differentiation ?
Hint : it ’s not quite ( ℝ→ℝ ) →( ℝ→ℝ ) , because how would you make sure the input function is differentiable ? )
You can download this post as a literate Haskell program .
{-# LANGUAGE Rank2 Types #-} {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances #-} module Differentiation where
Automatic differentiation
The overloading approach to automatic differentiation has become more popular recently among typed functional programmers .
The basic idea is to overload arithmetic operators such as + , × , and sin so that they work on not just floating - point numbers but pairs ( or more generally , sequences ) of them , which track quantities along with their rates of change .
The overloaded operators are easy to define because , unlike with integration , the rules of differentiation are compositional : you know , d(x + y ) = dx + dy , d(x × y ) = dx × y + x × dy , d( sin x ) = cos x × dx , and so on .
Here they are in Haskell .
data D a = D a a deriving Show lift :: Num a => a ->
D a lift x = D x 0 infinitesimal :: Num a =>
D a infinitesimal = D 0 1 instance Eq a => Eq ( D a ) where D x _ == D y _ = x == y instance Ord a =>
Ord ( D a ) where compare ( D x _ ) ( D y _ ) = compare x y instance Num a =>
Num ( D a ) where D x x ' +
D y y' = D ( x + y ) ( x ' + y ') D x x ' * D y y' = D ( x * y ) ( x ' * y + x * y ') negate ( D x x ' ) = D ( negate x ) ( negate x ' ) abs ( D x x ' ) = D ( abs x ) ( signum x * x ' ) signum ( D x _ ) = lift ( signum x ) from Integer x = lift ( fromInteger x ) instance Fractional a => Fractional ( D a ) where recip ( D x x ' ) = D ( recip x ) ( - x ' / x / x ) fromRational x = lift ( fromRational x )
The two components of a D value are a quantity and its derivative , so the lift function ‘ lifts ’ a number to a constant quantity , and infinitesimal is a quantity with value 0 and derivative 1 .
Were abs defined by abs x = signum x * x by default , we would n’t have to define abs for D above .
Let us use these definitions to model how a parabola reflects light .
Suppose that a light ray ( red above ) enters a parabolic mirror y = x² / 4 from above .
Where does the reflected ray cross the y axis ?
In the diagram above , if the point where the ray hits the parabola is ( x , y ) , then the derivative of y with respect to x is tan θ , and the y coordinate where the reflected ray crosses the y axis is y + x / tan 2θ , which is equal to y + x ( 1 / tan θ − tan θ ) /2 .
We can compute this coordinate by automatically differentiating y with respect to x :
curve x = x ^2/4 reflect x = let D y y' = curve ( lift x + infinitesimal ) in y + x * ( recip y' - y ') / 2
As expected , the parabola reflects all incoming rays from above to the focal point ( 0,1 ) .
* Differentiation > map reflect [ 1..5 ] [ 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 ]
To be sure , this code does not work by symbolically differentiating y = x² / 4 to yield y′ = x /2 .
Rather , it computes y alongside y′ for one particular x at a time , so the curve could just as well be defined by a more complex program that uses if and recursion .
For example , a ray tracer usually deals with scenes much more complex than a single parabola .
This code also does not work by numerically comparing the values of y at nearby values of x .
Instead of approximating dy / dx by Δy / Δx where Δx is a very small real number , we compute with an actually infinitesimal dx .
Differentiation is a higher - order function
Before we continue , let us abstract the pattern for differentiation in reflect above into a new higher - order function d , which differentiates any given function at the input 0 .
For convenience , d also returns the value of the given function at 0 .
d :: Num a => ( D a -> D b ) -> ( b , b ) d f = let D y y' = f infinitesimal in ( y , y ' ) reflect :: Fractional a => a -> a reflect x = let ( y , y ' ) = d ( \h -> curve ( lift x + h ) ) in y + x * ( recip y' - y ') / 2
Even though the reflect function uses differentiation internally , we can still differentiate it .
Such differentiate is said to be nested .
For the parabola , we can confirm that the reflected ray hits the focal point not just at but also around x = 3 , because the derivative computed below is zero .
* Differentiation > d ( \k -> reflect ( 3 + k ) ) ( 1.0,0.0 )
For other curves and surfaces , the derivative is typically not zero and tells us the density of light energy that falls around each point on the y axis .
Hence , as Dan Piponi noted , this kind of calculation is performed by ray tracers and other programs that sample from probability distributions .
Another application of automatic differentiation is to find roots of a function using Newton ’s method .
Therefore , we can use nested automatic differentiation to find local extrema and saddle points of a function using Newton ’s method .
The danger of confusing infinitesimals
Jeff Siskind and Barak Pearlmutter pointed out a kind of programmer mistake that makes nested differentiation give the wrong result .
As they show , this kind of mistake is easy to make in the framework defined above , because all it takes is putting a call to the lift function in the wrong place .
The definition of reflectBug below is only slightly different from reflect , but the result is very different and very wrong .
reflectBug x = let ( y , y ' ) = d ( \h -> lift ( curve ( x + h ) ) ) in y + x * ( recip y' - y ') / 2 * Differentiation > d ( \k -> reflectBug ( 3 + k ) ) ( Infinity , NaN )
They demonstrate this problem using running code in Haskell and Scheme that computes
to be 2 rather than the correct answer 1 .
The essence of this problem is that the two nested invocations of differentiation use two different infinitesimals , which a mathematician would denote by dh and dk .
These two infinitesimals should not be confused , just as years and feet and persons should not be confused .
Using types to check units
Björn Buckwalter showed that we can use a generic type system to prevent such confusion statically , just as Haskell uses state threads to distinguish pointers into different memory regions .
Recall that the type ST s a in Haskell represents a monadic computation that yields a result of type a using mutable cells in the state thread represented by the phantom type s .
To construct such a computation , we can use primitive operations such as
newSTRef :: a -> ST s ( STRef s a )
and the fact that ST s is a monad .
To run such a computation , we must use the primitive function
runST :: ( forall s. ST s a ) -> a
in which forall s forces different state threads , created by different calls to runST , to be represented by different phantom types s .
One way to understand this rank - 2 type is that it makes the type checker generate a new phantom type s for each argument to runST .
Analogously , Buckwalter redefines the type constructor D to take a phantom - type argument s , which represents an infinitesimal unit .
data D s a = D a a deriving Show
Accordingly , the other definitions above change in their types , but not in their terms or behavior .
The most important change is the new rank - 2 type of d , which forces different infinitesimals , created by different invocations of differentiation , to be represented by different phantom types s .
d :: Num a => ( forall s. D s a -> D s a ) -> ( a , a ) d f = let D y y' = f infinitesimal in ( y , y ' ) lift :: Num a => a ->
D s a lift x = D x 0 infinitesimal :: Num a =>
D s a infinitesimal = D 0 1 instance Eq a => Eq ( D s a ) where D x _ == D y _ = x == y instance Ord a =>
Ord ( D s a ) where compare ( D x _ ) ( D y _ ) = compare x y instance Num a =>
Num ( D s a ) where D x x ' +
D y y' = D ( x + y ) ( x ' + y ') D x x ' * D y y' = D ( x * y ) ( x ' * y + x * y ') negate ( D x x ' ) = D ( negate x ) ( negate x ' ) abs ( D x x ' ) = D ( abs x ) ( signum x * x ' ) signum ( D x _ ) = lift ( signum x ) from Integer x = lift ( fromInteger x ) instance Fractional a => Fractional ( D s a ) where recip ( D x x ' ) = D ( recip x ) ( - x ' / x / x ) fromRational x = lift ( fromRational x )
Because the phantom type s is part of the type of a number , and because arithmetic operations such as + require the arguments and the return value to have the same type , it is a type error to add numbers denominated in different infinitesimals .
In particular , the erroneous definition reflectBug above is now a type error , as desired .
Occurs check : cannot construct the infinite type : t = D s t Expected type : t Inferred type : D s t In the first argument of `lift ' , namely `( curve ( x + h ) ) '
In the expression : lift ( curve ( x + h ) )
For this checking of infinitesimal units to be sound , this library for automatic differentiation should not export the values D and infinitesimal to its users , though of course the type constructor D and its type - class instances need to be exported , along with the functions d and lift .
( In the discussion that ensued , David Roundy noted that the same kind of static safety can be achieved by exporting just a function
d :: Num a => ( forall b. Num b => ( a -> b ) -> b -> b ) -> ( a , a )
for differentiation .
The type b makes it unnecessary and useless to export the type constructor D , even though d is still implemented using D .
Also , the new argument of type a -> b makes it unnecessary and useless to export the lift function .
Finally , the type - class context Num b makes it unnecessary and useless to export the Eq , Show , and Num instances for D .
However , as Chris Smith lamented , we need additional differentiation functions of the types
Fractional a => ( forall b. Fractional b => ( a -> b ) -> b -> b ) -> ( a , a ) Floating a => ( forall b. Floating b => ( a -> b ) -> b -> b ) -> ( a , a )
in order to differentiate functions that use Fractional or Floating operations .
Oleg Kiselyov used similar types to express symbolic differentiation . )
Automatic lifting
Although the type system now prevents us from putting calls to lift in the wrong place , it is still annoying to have to invoke lift manually — especially for nested differentiation , a useful case as discussed above .
Depending on ‘ how constant ’ a quantity is , we need to feed it through a composition of exactly the right number of lift s.
This manual coding is frustrating because the unique right number of lift s to apply is obvious from the input and output types desired : to convert a type a to the type D s a , apply lift once ; to convert a to D s ( D s' a ) , apply lift twice ; and so on .
We want the compiler to manage these subtyping coercions automatically .
An analogous situation arises with state threads , which can be organized into a hierarchy of memory regions .
As part of a monadic computation that uses mutable cells in a parent region , we can create a child region and perform a subcomputation that allocates and accesses mutable cells in both regions .
After the subcomputation completes , the child region is destroyed en bloc , but we can still use the parent region and observe any effect on it brought about by the subcomputation .
To allow the subcomputation to use the parent region , we want every region to be a subtype of its descendents .
Matthew Fluet and Greg Morrisett ’s implementation of nested regions in Haskell uses explicit subtyping coercions just like our lift : depending on ‘ how senior ’ a region is , we need to compose exactly the right number of region coercions .
In a pending submission to the Haskell symposium , Oleg and I show how to automate region subtyping coercions using type classes .
One might hope to apply that approach to lifting in automatic differentiation .
Indeed we can , but I only know how to automate counting lift s , not how to automate placing them .
That is , instead of feeding each use of an input quantity to the lift function exactly the right number of times , we can feed it to a new function once .
The new function , called lifts , belongs to a new type class Lifts , which takes two type parameters .
The constraint Lifts a b holds if and only if the type b is the result of applying zero or more type constructors D s to the type a .
class Lifts a b where lifts :: a -> b
More concretely , the following instances incompletely approximate the intended meaning of Lifts .
instance Lifts a a where lifts = id instance Num a =>
Lifts a ( D s a ) where lifts = lift instance Num a =>
Lifts a ( D s ( D s' a ) ) where lifts = lift .
lift instance Num a =>
Lifts a ( D s ( D s ' ( D s '' a ) ) ) where lifts = lift .
lift .
lift
The definition above of reflect in terms of d applies lift once to one occurrence of x but not to other occurrences of x and h .
The same function can be expressed using Lifts , by applying lifts once to each occurrences of the input variables x and h .
reflectAuto :: Fractional a => a -> a reflectAuto x = let ( y , y ' ) = d ( \h -> curve ( lifts x + lifts h ) ) in y + lifts x * ( recip y ' - y ') / 2
Expressing reflect in this new way frees us from counting how many times to lift the inputs x and h each time they are used .
How to implement Lifts ?
On one hand , as an implementation of Lifts , the approximate instances above are incomplete and unsatisfactory in theory , in that they restrict how many lift each lifts can stand for .
They are perfectly useful in practice , however , and rely on no extension to Haskell other than rank - 2 types and multiparameter type classes with flexible instances .
On the other hand , a complete implementation is possible using the TypeCast class for type improvement ( originally used by Kiselyov , Lämmel , and Schupke to implement heterogeneous collections ) , but it requires more Haskell extensions : functional dependencies , overlapping instances , and undecidable instances .
Without further ado , below is the complete implementation .
instance Lifts a a where lifts a = a instance ( TypeCast ( D s b ' ) b , Num b' , Lifts a b ' ) =>
Lifts a b where lifts = typeCast .
lift .
lifts class TypeCast a b | a -> b , b -> a where typeCast :: a -> b class TypeCast ' t a b | t a -> b , t b -> a where typeCast ' :: t -> a -> b class TypeCast '' t a b | t a -> b , t b -> a where typeCast '' :: t -> a -> b instance TypeCast ' ( ) a b => TypeCast a b where typeCast x = typeCast ' ( ) x instance TypeCast ' ' t a b => TypeCast ' t a b where typeCast ' = typeCast '' instance TypeCast '' ( ) a a where typeCast ' ' _ x = x
Perhaps it 's just bad timing .
Perhaps it 's unfortunate juxtaposition .
Fallout 3 made its E3 debut in a demonstration at Microsoft 's Xbox 360 briefing in close proximity to Gears of War 2 and Resident Evil 5 .
All of a sudden , in that context , this very special follow - up to some of the most revered properties in role - playing gaming - venerable Interplay classic Fallout , and developer Bethesda 's recent smash hit Oblivion - did n't look so special any more .
The barren , broken landscape , the deformed mutant enemies , the muted brown colour scheme , the developers enthusiastically detailing the myriad options for amusing dismemberment , gore , explosions and carnage .
It all became a bit of a blur .
Then EA showed Dead Space and Left 4 Dead and Rage , and Sony showed Resistance 2 , and Take - Two showed Borderlands , and on and on for the rest of the week until - despite the quality of several of these games - the blur became a huge , ugly , indistinguishable smear across the whole of E3 .
A smear that Fallout 3 , of all games , really should n't be getting lost in .
So , yes - it was bad luck .
After all , you can hardly expect a Fallout game to be about anything other than a post - apocalyptic world beset with mutants , and it is n't Bethesda 's fault that the current commercial and political landscape has given the games industry an unhealthier - than - usual obsession with that subject matter .
You can , however , expect Bethesda to approach it with polish , sophistication and a unique sense of humour - and this is exactly where we found our half - hour hands - on demo lacking .
You can't see this poor thing 's other head .
We tried to shoot it off , but sadly VATS does n't discriminate .
Fallout 3 , as detailed by Kieron , concerns our young hero 's search for his father in the wasteland that was once Washington DC , before a nuclear holocaust 200 years ago .
At the start of the demo , we emerge from the hermetically - sealed 1950s utopia of the Vault , via a vast and elaborately clunking airlock door , into Washington 's sepia - toned ruins .
No doubt , it 's a dramatic , heart - in - mouth moment , very well handled .
As is Fallout tradition , the game 's RPG interface is tidied away into a PIP - Boy 3000 personal terminal , which your character wears on his wrist .
It 's actually very stylishly and economically done , giving easy and logical access to all the stats and options you could need , and graced with wryly funny drawings of Vault - Boy - the ironic , grinning , cow - licked mascot of the Fallout universe - on every screen .
Wandering forth , we 're struck by the extreme openness of the landscape , characterised , as was Oblivion , by rolling inclines and carefully arranged vistas of dramatic architecture .
It 's several worlds away from the lush , pastoral fantasy of the Elder Scrolls , though .
It 's one thing to look down on destruction from an isometric viewpoint and coo over the details - it 's another to look out across it , all the way to the horizon .
( It 's also another thing to navigate jagged , messy piles of rubble in 3D , and more than this pre-release version of the game can cope with , as our avatar descends , juddering , up to his waist in the ground . )
" Super Mutant Behemoth " .
Shoot it in the face .
Or the Fire Hydrant , if you like .
Visually , Fallout 3 is unremittingly bleak .
So it should be , although you have to wonder if there will be enough variation in this vast wasteland to sustain interest .
But let 's give Bethesda 's artists the benefit of the doubt on that count , because unfortunately the game has much more tangible shortcomings to take them to task on : the flat , sterile lighting , the excessive contrast , the feeble effects ( excepting the mini - nuke explosions of wrecked cars ' power units ) and , worst by far , the hilariously , embarrassingly wooden animation .
This was a weakness of Oblivion 's , too , but it 's even more jarring in Fallout 3 .
The game presents itself in the first - person perspective , but you can pull the camera out to quite a distant third - person viewpoint and move it in full 3D .
This means you can examine your character 's Gerry Anderson jerking and flailing from any angle ; we 'd recommend you do n't .
Unfortunately , you can't help but observe the erratic path - finding , motionless trances and limp movements of the few enemies you encounter this early in the game .
You simply can't invoke the visual style of an action game and get away with this stuff .
It ’s not difficult to make the case that conservative republicans suffer from a form of mental illness .
Americans have watched them embrace family values and discover ethics , while stealing an election and contriving the circumstances for starting wars .
They have worked tirelessly to undermine the American Constitution while frantically waving the flag .
They firmly believe in the privatization of government and consistently ignore the inconvenient history of the American taxpayer bailout of one failed / scandalized corporation after the next .
These things , by and of themselves , do n’t make republicans soft in their heads , but as Einstein said of insanity , it ’s “ doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . ”
There are no practical reasons that Americans , unless they are independently wealthy , or industrial capitalists , should belong to the republican party .
In a healthy , freedom loving democracy , republicanism would not be tolerated , and its inherents would be shunned like the plague .
One has only to ask , “ Just what is it that conservative republicans have ever done for the collective good of the nation ? ”
If a rejoinder is slow in coming it ’s understandable , because the answer is , not much , if anything .
Republican mental illness manifests itself in the duality that conservatives want to turn the clock back to mom , apple pie , and that good , ol ’ time religion , while unmercifully exploiting every natural resource until the ravaged earth will no longer support life .
Turning yet another profit takes precedence over their own survival .
This is not a healthy , mental state .
To attain public office , conservative republicans must lie .
The truth must be disguised because their motives for leadership rest solely on their ambition to material gain .
Sharing the nation ’s vast wealth among its people is anathema to republicans .
The idea so repulses them that their willing to practice any deception that will tilt the playing field in their direction .
FDR personifies their hatred of government acting in the interests of all Americans .
Conservative republicans despised FDR because of all presidents , it was FDR who first showed Americans that government is a tool that properly used , can and will improve the lives of all citizens .
A rock ribbed republican will always argue that FDR was a socialist , or worse , a communist .
The many successful government programs that were initiated under FDR are dismissed as “ touchy feely , warm and fuzzy ” examples of wasteful , liberal spending .
Even while FDR pulled the nation out of its economic morass , republicans never tired of criticizing him , thundering to anyone who would listen that FDR was destroying the business incentive to compete .
They cried copious tears when FDR made them pay employee ’s a livable , minimum wage .
We can ’t , they howled !
FDR , acting against the day ’s anti-trust laws , allowed business to stabilize prices under the condition that as their profits rose so would their employee ’s wages .
The National Recovery Administration brought business , labor and government together , and for the first time in the nation ’s history , these elements found mutual ground on which to cooperate with each other .
The NRA imposed sweeping regulations on business , forcing production standards on goods and services .
Child labor laws were enacted bringing more howls of protestation from the badly frightened republicans .
Somehow , they got over it as children reported to school instead of work .
They learned to read and write , add and subtract , thereby guaranteeing a future work force of educated employees .
Of course republicans , to this day , fail to see the point .
Upon winning office by a landslide , FDR immediately closed the nation ’s banks until the U.S. Treasury could move in and supervise them .
The Great Depression was in full swing and Roosevelt , quite rightly , had reservations about trusting the nation ’s bankers whose arrogance was only exceeded by their incompetence .
Roosevelt also began the Security & Exchange Commission , the SEC , to keep fat cat , republican capitalists honest .
His New Deal would redistribute wealth downward , and attempt to put the nation back on sound , financial footing .
FDR ’s regulations on corporate behavior kept such things as today ’s outrageous fuel costs from happening .
Persistent poverty in the south was met with Roosevelt ’s Resettlement Administration , Farm Security Administration , Rural Electrification Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Southern farmers could bring their products to market , and enhance their lives and their work with electricity .
The school lunch program , new roads into rural areas , and reforestation began having significant , positive effects on poverty .
The democrats lost the south when LBJ signed the Civil Rights
Act into law .
Johnson put down his pen and said , " We have lost the South for a generation . "
It seems the south should have been ashamed to inspire such a comment , but no , racism thrives when it ’s seen as virtue .
Roosevelt demonstrated to Americans that government is a tool that ’s best employed for improving the lives of citizens .
Republicans like to call the New Deal socialism and FDR a socialist .
They pretend ignorance that corporations are always the first in line , screaming for taxpayer handouts , when corporate CEO ’s run their companies into the ground and then walk away with their employee ’s pensions .
Greed on a scale this vast can no longer be considered merely greed - the terrible need to take and keep taking , no matter at who ’s expense , is a sure indication of an aberrant , disordered mind .
Roosevelt brought Social Security into existence , largely eliminating older Americans crushing poverty when they could no longer work .
Republicans were apoplectic with fury .
Why should we pay one cent in taxes to help a bunch of old geezers who are better off dead , they asked .
Elected in 1932 , Roosevelt , by 1933 had steered the nation into a sharp , upward economic recovery .
Republicans , mentally ill and maddened by his success still , to this day , hold a deep abiding hatred for FDR .
They ca n’t abide the thought that wealth could be distributed to benefit all citizens .
Selfishness does n’t begin to explain the conservative republican ’s fixation on material gain .
Mental aberrance does .
George Bush has been the crowning achievement of conservative republicanism .
A dullard , who ca n’t string a coherent sentence together , he gleefully follows the lead of every traitorous republican who has his ear .
Karl Rove , a fat , marshmallow , donut of a man , looks and acts exactly like someone who would like to get even for all the slights he had to have suffered when young .
A mental case in his own right , Rove thinks nothing of tearing down a nation to satisfying his grotesque egoism .
Cheney ’s character is displayed plainly across his face .
His snarling countenance illuminates his mental instability and his vast capacity for greed is unequaled .
These mentally abhorrent spectacles are anti-American and have fundamentally betrayed the U.S. Constitution and every other trust they have been given .
The Bush Administration has long been a national embarrassment to the American people .
Much worse , they have shamed a great nation that was once a model for humanity to emulate .
Appointed by a rogue Supreme Court , these jokers began sacking the U.S. Treasury from their first days in office .
Their neocon cohorts and partners in crime should invoke nothing but disgust in the minds of all Americans .
At some point in the future Conservative Republicanism will be a distant memory whose only remaining function will be horrifying historians .
Republicans embrace the political philosophy that wealth should be concentrated to a few , at the expense of many .
This mindset is breathtakingly arrogant , or more accurately , is a symptom of corrupted minds .
At the top of the republican food chain exist such despicable creatures as Richard Mellon Scaife , Rupert Murdock , The Reverend Sun Moon and Adolph Coors , among others .
Beneath them are the politicians that lick their boots for elected office .
Then come the jokers , the fools and knaves .
Limbaugh , Coulter and Bill O’Reilly are a few such republican lapdogs who trumpet right wing propaganda into the ears of the most gullible , the most ignorant Americans .
Rupert Murdoch , in a just world , would have his U.S. citizenship revoked , as would the Rev. Sun Moon .
Coors , Scaife and their ilk have far more money than brains , and should be heavily fined every time they open their mouths .
Scaife and Murdoch became self appointed extensions of the U.S. Dept. of Justice when they financed endless fishing expeditions into President Bill Clinton ’s business dealings and sex life .
The republican congress jumped in behind them spending millions of taxpayer dollars .
They could n’t find the dirt they longed to bury Clinton under and they finally gave up , sputtering and growling - mumbling curses and striking their heads - just as any nutcase might .
The Rev. Sun Moon has referred to his adopted land as “ Satan ’s Harvest . ”
This clown is allowed to own a Washington newspaper with which he spreads lies and propaganda .
He and Murdoch , both naturalized Americans , should be booted out of the country .
Moon , a Korean , was given “ lawful permanent resident ” status during the Nixon Administration .
Moon bought his residency with the billions he has given away to republican , wingnut causes .
Republican causes make an interesting study .
They are never about improving the lives of Americans .
They are always about forcing their whacky , misguided beliefs on anyone stupid enough to believe them , and on getting , and holding onto power .
The worst manifestation of republican mental illness has been the war in Iraq .
Local WalMarts across the nation reserve a wall on which they display the pictures of young American men and women .
These children are offered in Iraq as George Bush cannon fodder .
Their 18 and 19 year old faces gaze back from their portraits .
Their dress caps always seem too big for them .
All wear stern , unsmiling , expressions , to let the photographer know they are going to kill other human beings , for God and Country , the viewer supposes .
They joined the army to escape small town America - to serve their country and be rewarded with the promise of free college .
They are babies .
They are naïve and do n’t have any way to understand the horror of war .
They ’ve watched Hollywood ’s less than realistic cinematic efforts to capture the terror , the waste , the incredible devastation that war visits on all who are touched by it .
Innocent children have no hope of equating burnt , ripped flesh , sudden death , a dying friend crying for his mother , with Bush and his wholly contrived war .
Republicans promise more war , endless war , even a new front - this time in Iran .
This is insanity at its worst .
Republicans , and sadly many democrats , support the wars and endorse the incidental madness that spins off from them .
Torture , the suspension of Habeas Corpus , government eavesdropping on private phone calls and emails , above all the suspicion that is deliberately encouraged by the nation ’s so called leaders who seek to divide , weaken , and in so doing realize complete control over Americans who never seem to learn that war is the result of a complete failure of political leadership .
Insanity has its own way of proliferating .
While Americans continue to sleep through the right wing ’s hysteria , Condoleezza Rice imagines mushroom clouds sprouting over Brooklyn .
Cheney ’s old man delusions , while conveniently making him fantastically wealthy , nonetheless mark him as paranoiac .
When Cheney moved into the Vice President ’s residence at the Naval Observatory , local and national news reported that strange noises could be heard coming from inside the observatory .
The noises , that according to witnesses sounded like digging , issued from the observatory night and day for many weeks .
Cheney , like Saddam , was preparing a deep hole in which he could hide and feel safe .
Freud would no doubt have some interesting comments on Cheney ’s tunneling compulsions .
As for Bush , he ’s not crazy at all .
He ’s not smart enough , and lacks the imagination to be crazy .
He ’s a comical figure .
He offers his half - witted observations , sincerely believing he ’s the big man .
He has n’t understood that the U.S. Presidency is not an office for his macho fantasies to gain substance .
The poor bastard is so stupid he can’t feel remorse , or even connect his egoism with the dead , and those who grieve them .
After his 9 - 11 scare , when he flew all over the country evading imaginary enemies , he found a persona that has always suited him .
That is - " He ’s a cool dude in a smooth mood . "
Those Supreme Court Justices who voted to install Junior in office should be unceremoniously run off when Obama gets elected .
Roberts , Alito , Thomas and Scalia are a disgrace .
All are openly partisan and their interpretations of the constitution may be politely described as radical .
If Americans expect to reclaim their nation they have a very long , steep road ahead of them .
The Corporate Oligarchy that replaced representative government has a death grip on the levers of power and it has no intention of giving it up .

O'Reilly , Savage , Hannity on accused church shooter 's reading list Diane Sweet
Published : Monday July 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Jim Adkisson , the 58 year old man being held in a Knoxville , Tennessee jail on murder charges stemming from a shooting during a children 's musical at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church on Sunday , is said to have had a array of right - wing political books in his home , along with brass knuckles , empty shotgun shell boxes , and a handgun discovered by police who searched his home .
A report from the local Knoxville news details the findings from Adkisson 's home , along with key statements from a document written by Adkisson related to an apparent motive behind the violent attack that rocked the suburban community : " Adkisson targeted the church , Still wrote in the document obtained by WBIR - TV , Channel 10 , ' because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country , and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country 's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of media outlets . '
" Adkisson told Still that 'he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office . '
" Adkisson told officers he left the house unlocked for them because 'he expected to be killed during the assault . '
" Inside the house , officers found ' Liberalism is a Mental Health Disorder ' by radio talk show host Michael Savage , ' Let Freedom Ring ' by talk show host Sean Hannity , and ' The O'Reilly Factor , ' by television talk show host Bill O'Reilly . "
Further details from an earlier AFP wire report : " It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job , his frustration over that , and his stated hatred for the liberal movement , ' Owen said .
' We have recovered a four - page letter in which he describes his feelings . '
" Owen said Adkisson had specifically targeted the Unitarian church .
" ' It appears that church had received some publicity in the recent past regarding its liberal stance on things and that is at least one of the issues we believe caused that church to be selected , ' he said .
" ' He indicated also in that letter that he expected to be in there shooting people until the police arrived and he fully expected to be killed by the responding police , ' the police chief said . "
A newly released AP report has more details on the background of the accused , a veteran who was a helicopter repairman in the 70's , a ' specialist ' who was then downgraded back to ' private ' before discharge : " Adkisson , a 58 - year - old truck driver on the verge of losing his food stamps , had 76 rounds with him when he entered the church and pulled a shotgun from a guitar case during a children 's performance of the musical ' Annie . '
" Adkisson 's ex-wife once belonged to the church but had n't attended in years , said Ted Jones , the congregation 's president .
Police investigators described Adkisson as a ' stranger ' to the congregation , and police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife 's link was a factor in the attack .
" Adkisson remained jailed Monday on $ 1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder .
More charges are expected .
Four victims remained hospitalized , including two in critical condition .
" The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes .
But the anger behind it may have been building for months , if not years .
" ' It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job , his frustration over that , and his stated hatred for the liberal movement , ' Police Chief Sterling Owen said .
" Adkisson was a loner who hates ' blacks , gays and anyone different from him , ' longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice , Texas , told the Knoxville News Sentinel .
" Authorities said Adkisson 's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations .
But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell .
" The couple had been married for almost 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened ' to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out . '
She told a judge that she was ' in fear for my life and what he might do . ' "
Adkisson killed two members of the church , and wounded six others during the shooting before he was overcome by church members who held him at bay until authorities arrived on the scene .
He carried a shotgun into the church inside a guitar case along with 76 shotgun shells , but only managed to fire off three rounds before the congregation subdued him .
He faces first degree murder charges in the death of 60 - year - old Greg McKendry , was hailed as a hero for shielding others from gunfire , Linda Kraeger , 61 , who was visiting the church from Westside Unitarian Universalist Church , was also killed .
Among the wounded , three remain in critical or serious condition .
None of the children were injured during the shooting .
Sharia law SHOULD be used in Britain , says UK 's top judge
Explosive : The Lord Chief Justice 's endorsement of Sharia law has already created huge controversy
The most senior judge in England yesterday gave his blessing to the use of sharia law to resolve disputes among Muslims .
Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips said that Islamic legal principles could be employed to deal with family and marital arguments and to regulate finance .
He declared : ' Those entering into a contractual agreement can agree that the agreement shall be governed by a law other than English law . '
In his speech at an East London mosque , Lord Phillips signalled approval of sharia principles as long as punishments - and divorce rulings - complied with the law of the land .
But his remarks , which back the informal sharia courts operated by numerous mosques , provoked a barrage of criticism .
Lawyers warned that family and marital disputes settled by sharia could disadvantage women or the vulnerable .
Tories said that legal equality must be respected and that rulings incompatible with English law should never be enforceable .
Lord Phillips spoke five months after Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams suggested Islamic law could govern marital law , financial transactions and arbitration in disputes .
The Lord Chief Justice said yesterday of the Archbishop 's views : ' It was not very radical to advocate embracing sharia law in the context of family disputes ' .
He added there is ' widespread misunderstanding as to the nature of sharia law ' .
The Sharia Council of Britain : ( from right to left ) Dr Suhaib Hasan , Maulana Abu Sayeed and Mr Mufti Barabatullah preside over marriage cases at their headquarters earlier this year
Under fire : The Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams .
His comments on Sharia sparked a political storm
Lord Phillips said : ' Those who are in dispute are free to subject it to mediation or to agree that it shall be resolved by a chosen arbitrator .
There is no reason why principles of sharia law or any other religious code should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of dispute resolution . '
Lord Phillips said that any sanctions must be ' drawn from the laws of England and Wales ' .
Severe physical punishment - he mentioned stoning , flogging or amputating hands - is ' out of the question ' in Britain , he added .
Lord Phillips ' speech brought protests from lawyers who fear women could be disadvantaged in supposedly voluntary sharia deals .
Barrister and human rights specialist John Cooper said : ' There should be one law by which everyone is held to account .
' Well - crafted laws in this country , drawn up to protect both parties including the weak and vulnerable party in matrimonial break - ups , could be compromised . '
Resolution , the organisation of family law solicitors , said people should govern their lives in accordance with religious principles ' provided that those beliefs and traditions do not contradict the fundamental principle of equality on which Britain 's laws are based . '
Spokesman Teresa Richardson said religious law ' must be used to find solutions which are consistent with the basic principles of family law in this country and people must always have redress to the civil courts where they so choose . '

Robert Whelan , of the Civitas think tank , said : ' Everybody is governed by English law and it is not possible to sign away your legal rights .
That is why guarantees on consumer products always have to tell customers their statutory rights are not affected .
' There is not much doubt that in traditional Islamic communities women do not enjoy the freedoms that they have had for 100 years or more in Britain .
' It is very easy to put pressure on young women in a male - dominated household .
The English law stands to protect people from intimidation in such circumstances . '
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' Mediation verdicts which are incompatible with our own legal principles should never be enforceable .
One of the key aspects of our free society is equality .
This should be understood and respected by all . '
The Ministry of Justice said : ' English law takes precedence over any other legal system .
The Government has no intention of changing this position .
Alongside this , it is possible to resolve civil law dispute by other systems . '
Man in the news : Lord Phillips
When appointed Lord Chief Justice , Nicholas Phillips gave the impression he would steer an uncontroversial course .
He was best known as a Master of the Rolls - the most senior civil law judge - who had condemned the compensation culture .
His first act in office was to declare : ' I intend to keep out of politics ' .
However 70 - year - old Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers has followed his predecessor Lord Woolf in pushing for fewer prison sentences for criminals and has repeatedly clashed with ministers over criminal and constitutional law .
This week , members of the Government criticised the punishments he has devised for youths caught carrying knives .
In October 2006 , newspapers pictured the Law Lord carrying out a community punishment in jeans and high visibility jacket , leaning on a shovel , and declaring government penal policy to be ' madness ' .
In September , Lord Phillips is to leave the post to become the chief Law Lord and President of the new Supreme Court when it opens next year .
He has two children with his French wife , Christylle , and two stepchildren .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama raised $ 52 million in June , his campaign said on Thursday , a jump from last month and more than double the $ 22 million raised by his Republican rival John McCain .

The Obama campaign raised the funds with an average donation of $ 68 , a sign of his continued strength among small donors , campaign manager David Plouffe said in an e-mail to supporters .
The Obama campaign has $ 72 million in the bank .
“ But more impressive than the number is how you did it , ” Plouffe wrote .
“ Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people contributed to building our campaign for change .
Many were first - time donors , giving only what they could afford -- and the average donation was just $ 68 . ”
The Democratic National Committee raised more than $ 22 million in June and had $ 20 million in cash in the bank -- giving Obama and the party a combined $ 92 million .
Obama ’s June figure was just shy of the Illinois senator ’s best fund - raising month , February , when he took in $ 55 million .
His fund - raising slowed to $ 21.9 million in May , down from just over $ 30 million in April .
The June figure included $ 2 million for the general election campaign in November against McCain .
The rest must be spent by the end of the Democratic convention in late August , when Obama will formally become the party ’s White House nominee .
McCain ’s $ 22 million figure in June represented his best month of fund - raising and his campaign has voiced confidence he can compete financially with Obama .
By the end of June , the Republican National Committee had nearly $ 68 million in the bank to help support the Arizona senator in the final push to the November 4 presidential election .
Some political analysts had questioned whether Obama ’s fund - raising ability had ebbed , since his monthly numbers had been dropping .
The Illinois senator , who would be the first black U.S. president if elected , has smashed all fund - raising records during the presidential campaign , partly because of his success in using the Internet to bring in contributions from small donors .
He has said he would bypass the public financing system , rejecting $ 84 million in public funds and the accompanying limits on spending .
Despite his absence , Mr Rove 's place was marked with a name - tag Karl Rove , President Bush 's ex-aide , has refused to attend a congressional hearing on allegations that he helped politicise the US Justice Department .
Mr Rove has been accused of attempting to influence the prosecution of a former Democratic governor of Alabama .
He is also said to have been involved in the firing of several US attorneys , allegedly for political reasons .
Lawmakers subpoenaed Mr Rove to attend the hearing , but he has refused , citing executive privilege .
The president and those who work for him are allowed by law to resist certain attempts by the judicial and legislative branches of government to force them to co-operate with inquiries - this right is known as " executive privilege " .
But the House Judiciary sub-committee , which is conducting the investigation into the Justice Department and issued Mr Rove with a subpoena , has rejected Mr Rove 's claim of immunity .
Despite Mr Rove 's absence , the committee set up a chair for him , and marked his place with a name - tag .
Stunt
The committee could decide to seek Mr Rove 's prosecution for contempt .
Two other officials - White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers - have already been held in contempt by the committee for failure to testify .
Republicans in the US House of Representatives have dismissed the committee 's actions as a stunt , and have called on its members to accept an offer made by Mr Rove to speak to them informally in private .
The committee rejected Mr Rove 's offer , because they wanted his remarks to be made under oath .
The inquiry stems from the firing in 2006 - 07 of a number of US attorneys .
Critics say the attorneys were sacked for political reasons , and that the Department of Justice subsequently attempted to mislead the public about the reasons for the dismissals .
Mr Rove claims that executive privilege allows him to skip the hearing
The committee 's investigation has also been extended to cover the prosecution of former Democratic governor of Alabama Don Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted last year of accepting and concealing a contribution to his campaign to start a state education lottery , in exchange for appointing a hospital executive to a regulatory board .
He was sentenced last year to more than seven years in prison but was released in March when an appeals court ruled that he had raised " substantial questions of fact and law " in his appeal .
Siegelman has alleged that his prosecution was pushed by Republican officials , including Mr Rove .
A former Republican campaign volunteer told congressional attorneys last year that she had overheard discussions suggesting that Mr Rove had put pressure on officials from the Justice Department to prosecute Siegelman .
Departmental officials have disputed the claims , arguing that Siegelman was convicted by a jury , and that the case had been handled by career professionals , not political appointees .

What are these ?
FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Audi , the luxury unit of Volkswagen VOWG .DE , sees great opportunities in electric cars and will offer automobiles with no exhaust emissions within ten years , its top executive told a German weekly .
Rupert Stadler told Welt am Sonntag in an interview published on Sunday that he expects diesel and battery technology to dominate in the coming five to ten years .
“ By then we will offer cars without exhaust emissions , ” Stadler said .
Asked if Audi was not lagging domestic rivals Mercedes DAIGn.DE and BMW BMWG .DE in the development of lithium - ion batteries that are more powerful than batteries used now in hybrids , Stadler said Audi 's research capacities were larger than those of its German competitors .
“ Electric cars offer great opportunities , which we have already seized on , ” Stadler said without elaborating .
Developing fuel - saving technology tops the agenda of Germany ’s car industry in an effort to fulfill stricter emission regulations and conserve fuel .
BMW has said it would decide this year whether to build an electric vehicle , while U.S. carmaker General Motors GM.N plans to roll out its Chevrolet Volt plug - in electric car in 2010 .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A couple of times a year , David Holzhammer drives more than 200 miles from his home in Iowa City , Iowa , to see the Chicago Cubs play baseball .
That is a luxury he is not giving up , despite high gas prices and other strains on his wallet .

In an economic downturn , U.S. fans still go to sports games , partly as an escape from financial woes , but they are saving on the extras , like hot dogs and beer .

But he is cutting back on hot dogs and beer at the relatively expensive concession stands at Wrigley Field .
“ I try to spend less at the game , ” said Holzhammer , 55 .
“ I came up with three high - school boys and I had them eat outside the ballpark . ”
Even in an economic downturn , fans still go to sports games , and some leagues are setting attendance records , but such statistics hide a more complicated story on the effect of a weakening U.S. economy on sports .
In a Reuters / Zogby survey on June 12 to 14 , almost 15 percent of those polled said they are attending fewer sporting events this year , and most of those people cited the weak economy as the reason .
About 28 percent are spending less on food and souvenirs .
“ The reality is people are going to spend less and be more careful about choosing what they spend it on , ” Rich Gotham , president of the National Basketball Association ’s Boston Celtics , said in a telephone interview .
The results of the survey were borne out in numerous interviews at ballparks , arenas , golf courses and race tracks around the United States , where fans like Holzhammer said they were scaling back on what they spend .
Bob Carter , 66 , has given up ticket packages for National Football League and Major League Baseball teams in Houston .
“ I ’m retired .
On a fixed income you ca n’t do a whole lot , but I had to cut back , ” he said .
Carter was speaking on May 31 at a Houston Dynamo Major League Soccer game , where tickets on average are less expensive than the local football and baseball teams .
ON THE BRINK
Americans like Carter have every reason to be gloomy .
Home prices extended their record slide in April , average prices at the gas pump top $ 4 a gallon , food prices are surging and former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned the U.S. economy is “ on the brink ” of recession .
John Thomas , a 32 - year - old consultant from Los Angeles attending the recent U.S. Open golf event at Torrey Pines in San Diego , has also tightened his belt .
“ With the gas prices , it eats into what I might spend on concessions because at that point then I might as well just eat at home , save my funds and drink in a bar after the game instead of enjoying $ 8 beers , ” Thomas said .
Gas prices and other rising expenses are hitting consumers everywhere .
Almost six of every 10 polled in the Reuters / Zogby survey are considering changing how often they drive , 39 percent mulling changes to where they vacation and 31 percent reconsidering how often they eat out .
A June survey of new - car buyers by Kelley Blue Book found similar results as 27 percent have stopped attending sporting events altogether , while another 25 percent said they attend them less often .
Nevertheless , most sports are seeing record attendance , even though some analysts say teams could be handing out more complimentary tickets to keep numbers up .
Baseball , for example , is on track for attendance topping 80 million and revenue of $ 6.08 billion , both records , despite “ some modest decline ” in merchandise sales , MLB President Bob DuPuy said .
And history shows consumers consider a night attending the big game just the tonic after a bad day at the office .
“ The evidence from past recession is indeed that sports is one of the last things people cut back on , ” said Andrew Zimbalist , a professor of economics at Smith College in Northampton , Massachusetts .
“ They need their distractions and they need their obsessions . ”
This makes sports teams more recession - proof than many industries , according to the Celtics ’ Gotham .
“ Sports are a great distraction from the economy , ” he said .
THIS “ PERKS ME UP ”
Gerald O’Neal , a Garden City , Michigan , resident at a downtown rally on June 6 to celebrate a championship by the National Hockey League ’s Detroit Red Wings , agreed .

“ Things are pretty tough in Michigan right now , but this kind of perks me up , at least for a minute anyway , ” said O’Neal , who was laid off in May after 13 years with Home Depot .
Michigan ’s economy has been hard hit by the struggles of the auto sector , particularly General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co .
Smaller leagues , like the indoor Arena Football League , may do even better than the big ones .
“ The last time we went into a recession , I was surprised because it actually helped , ” Arena Football League Commissioner David Baker said .
“ When people are staying closer to home , it kind of gives more emphasis to us as an option . ”
Arena Football just closed its regular season with record attendance numbers , while revenue from ticket and merchandise sales were respectively running 11 percent and 6 percent higher than last year .
The average Arena Football ticket costs $ 24 , compared with $ 67 for the National Football League .
One area that is suffering is NASCAR , whose fans drive hundreds of miles to watch races .

DuPuy said that Major League Baseball is mindful of the state of the economy and the cost - cutting measures that fans have to take , noting inexpensive seats as low as $ 1 in some cases , all - you - can - eat deals and family packages .
For example , the San Francisco Giants are offering a $ 25 gas card through August when fans buy four game tickets online for $ 75 .
“ Baseball was there during the Depression , during World War II , as an element of the country ’s recovery from 9/11 , and will continue to be available at affordable prices , ” DuPuy said .
But the plight of consumers has not stopped the major North American sports leagues from raising ticket and concession prices , as the cost to take a family of four to games in the NFL , baseball , NBA and National Hockey League has increased in the range of 2.6 percent to 5.7 percent , according to Team Marketing Report .
The Celtics , which just won the National Basketball Association title , have already raised their season ticket prices for next season an average of 10 to 15 percent .
For many U.S. sports leagues , the bigger worry as the economy slows may be a scramble for corporate dollars and TV rights fees .
“ Until the corporations really start peeling back I do n’t know that there ’s going to be a real problem with the leagues showing any financial softness , ” said David Carter , executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute .
“ They ’re servicing those folks like the dickens now because they know they ca n’t afford to lose them at a time when they might be scaling back their marketing , advertising and sponsorship pledges , ” he added .
For many fans , sports are just too powerful a pull .
Holzhammer , at the Cubs game with his 17 - year - old son and his son ’s friends , was pleased to see the Cubs beat the Atlanta Braves 3 - 2 , despite having to cut back in other areas like meals in restaurants .
Peter Silva , 56 , of Malden , Massachusetts , speaking before the Celtics ’ final game in Boston , said he wanted his son see the team going for the title .
“ That is an over - riding factor .
The tickets cost a lot , but that ’s what you have savings for , for special events . ”
A linear string of mud pots and mud volcanoes suggest surface evidence for a southern extension of the San Andreas Fault that runs through the Salton Sea , according to a paper published in the August issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America ( BSSA ) .
Researchers David K. Lynch and Kenneth W. Hudnut of USGS report the results of a comprehensive survey of mud pots in the area immediately east of the southeastern - most portion of the Salton Sea in Imperial County , Calif .
Using satellite imagery , followed by a physical examination of the land , they identified a cluster of 33 mud pots , mud volcanoes and sink holes which , when plotted , form a clear linear pattern .
Mud pots and mud volcanoes are geothermal features produced when water or gas is forced upward through soil and sediments .
Mud pots can assume a variety of forms , typically being depressions or enclosed basins containing gas seeps , bubbling water or viscous mud .
Mud pots can also be water - laden and appear as bubbling muddy water .
Mud volcanoes , on the other hand , are elevated conical structures composed of accumulations of viscous mud extruded from a central vent .
They range from finger - sized to several kilometers across , though the largest in the Salton Sea area are about 2 meters high .
Small mud volcanoes on land , ranging from one to 10 feet in height , are usually called mud cones or gryphons and are usually associated with volcanic and seismic activity .
" The presence of a linear field of geothermal features is evidence of a planar rift extending to considerable depth in the crust , " Lynch and Hudnut write .
While geologists have suspected that the San Andreas Fault extended beyond its confirmed terminal point near Bombay Beach , erosion , seismic inactivity and agricultural reshaping of the land have erased any previously identifiable surface evidence to support the theory .
The San Andreas Fault is a plate boundary separating Pacific and North American plates .
" This new evidence indicates that the region is more complicated than we previously thought , " Lynch said .
" The extension of the San Andreas does not appear to be active .
It is probably a very old part of the fault , and helps to explain the larger , more complex transition area between the Imperial fault and San Andreas fault , called the Brawley Seismic Zone . "
The southern portion of the San Andreas Fault is the focus of the Great Southern California ShakeOut , which will be an earthquake drill on 13 Nov. 2008 designed to help prepare local citizens for the next very large earthquake .
The scenario will call for a quake with a magnitude of 7.8 that begins in the same area that is the subject of this paper .

Carmack : Doom 4 Sports Better Graphics Than Rage ; Uses id Tech 5 , Lower Frame Rate
The jump in graphical fidelity comes about as Doom 4 is targeted to run at 30 frames per second , whereas Rage will run at 60 frames per second .
Carmack claims this allows id to throw " three times as much horsepower " at Doom 4 .
Above , id's Rage
" [ Doom 4 is ] going to be a 30 Hz game , " he told Maximum PC .
" It 's going to look like a totally new game engine on there , even though it 's going to be built on the four years of effort that we spent developing this generation of technology . "
No platform or release details have been revealed for Doom 4 , which was unveiled in a surprise announcement earlier this year .
However , the id Tech 5 - powered Rage will arrive on PC , PS3 , Xbox 360 and Mac , suggesting similar platforms for Doom 4 .
On the subject of id Tech 5 , Carmack noted that the PC , PS3 and Xbox 360 editions of the hardware can all use the exact same build with no issues , whereas the Mac engine requires an extra conversion step .
" We wanted to say OK , here 's the build and run the same build on the PC , the 360 , and the PS3 , " he explained .
" We still have to go through one extra step to build it on the Mac .
But it really does work that way on the other [ console ] platforms . "
More details on Rage , Doom 4 and id Tech 5 are expected at Quakecon , which kicks off at the end of July .
In the meantime , scope out our recent interview with John Carmack and the below Rage trailer for more information .

Babies have been born with DNA from three parents instead of two .
They have been described as the first genetically engineered humans , as the added DNA they carry could be passed on down the generations .
New Scientist reported last year that a certain fertility treatment would spawn babies with DNA from more than two parents ( 2 December 2000 , p 16 ) .
Now cells from two one - year - old babies born as a result of this treatment have indeed turned out to have a little extra DNA from a donor mother , as well as that from their own parents .
In the mid-1990s , Jacques Cohen and Jason Barritt at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of Saint Barnabas in New Jersey wondered whether some women could not have babies because of defects in the cytoplasm of their eggs – the fluid surrounding the nucleus .
So they decided to try adding ‘ healthy ’ cytoplasm from a donor egg .
While the vast majority of our genes are housed in the nucleus , the cytoplasm contains tiny energy - producing structures called mitochondria , which have their own set of 13 genes .
Injecting donor cytoplasm into an egg involves transferring mitochondria and their genes as well .

The researchers examined 12 of the 30 babies born with the help of the technique and found that two of them carry donor mitochondria .
“ This report is the first case of human germline genetic modification resulting in normal healthy children , ” say Barritt and his colleagues in the journal Human Reproduction .
These mitochondria could be passed on to future generations .
“ We wo n’t know till they reach reproductive age , ” he told New Scientist .
Barritt stresses that the 13 genes in mitochondrial DNA do nothing except provide proteins to produce energy .
“ Genes in the nucleus control the mitochondria , not the other way around , ” he says .
Mitochondrial DNA “ does n’t influence any nuclear genes in any way , shape or form . ”
However , no one knows if the added mitochondria were the reason why the fertility treatment worked in these two cases .
Other , non-genetic components of the cytoplasm might have done the trick .
“ We think every patient is different , and some might need mitochondria for extra energy , and some might need messenger RNA or proteins , ” says Barritt .
Some researchers want to go further .
James Grifo of New York University has been given approval to try to treat infertile women by removing the nucleus from their egg and injecting it into a donor egg whose nucleus has been removed .
In this case , all the mitochondria of any baby born would come from the donor .
This technique could also help prevent women who have mutations in mitochondrial DNA passing the problem on to their children .
Such mitochondrial diseases cause various problems , and can be fatal .
Meanwhile , scientists are still fighting about whether terms such as “ genetic modification ” apply to this treatment .
Despite what Barritt wrote in Human Reproduction , he maintains it is not germline therapy .
“ To be true genetic or germline therapy , you must modify genes in nuclear DNA . ”
But Norman Nevin , chairman of the UK’s Gene Therapy Advisory Committee , says : “ My gut feeling is that you ’re adding mitochondrial DNA , so that is gene therapy . ”
The UK’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says it has not had any requests for licences to perform similar cytoplasm injection procedures in the UK .
A subcomittee of the HFEA looked at the technique last year , when details of the first live births resulting from the new technique were published .
“ At the time , we decided that there was no evidence to show a significantly improved success rate , and there were also concerns about any carry over of DNA , ” says a spokeswoman .

This last week has been an interesting one for observers of how climate change is covered in the media and online .
On Wednesday an interesting paper ( Thompson et al ) was published in Nature , pointing to a clear artifact in the sea surface temperatures in 1945 and associating it with the changing mix of fleets and measurement techniques at the end of World War II .
The mainstream media by and large got the story right – puzzling anomaly tracked down , corrections in progress after a little scientific detective work , consequences minor – even though a few headline writers got a little carried away in equating a specific dip in 1945 ocean temperatures with the more gentle 1940s - 1970s cooling that is seen in the land measurements .
However , some blog commentaries have gone completely overboard on the implications of this study in ways that are very revealing of their underlying biases .
The best commentary came from John Nielsen - Gammon ’s new blog where he described very clearly how the uncertainties in data – both the known unknowns and unknown unknowns – get handled in practice ( read that and then come back ) .
Stoat , quite sensibly , suggested that it ’s a bit early to be expressing an opinion on what it all means .
But patience is not one of the blogosphere ’s virtues and so there was no shortage of people extrapolating wildly to support their pet hobbyhorses .
This in itself is not so unusual ; despite much advice to the contrary , people ( the media and bloggers ) tend to weight new individual papers that make the news far more highly than the balance of evidence that really underlies assessments like the IPCC .
But in this case , the addition of a little knowledge made the usual extravagances a little more scientific - looking and has given it some extra steam .
Like almost all historical climate data , ship - board sea surface temperatures ( SST ) were not collected with long term climate trends in mind .
Thus practices varied enormously among ships and fleets and over time .
In the 19th Century , simple wooden buckets would be thrown over the side to collect the water ( a non-trivial exercise when a ship is moving , as many novice ocean - going researchers will painfully recall ) .
Later on , special canvas buckets were used , and after WWII , insulated ‘ buckets ’ became more standard – though these are n’t really buckets in the colloquial sense of the word as the photo shows ( pay attention to this because it comes up later ) .
The thermodynamic properties of each of these buckets are different and so when blending data sources together to get an estimate of the true anomaly , corrections for these biases are needed .
For instance , the canvas buckets give a temperature up to 1 º C cooler in some circumstances ( that depend on season and location – the biggest differences come over warm water in winter , global average is about 0.4 ºC cooler ) than the modern insulated buckets .
Insulated buckets have a slight cool bias compared to temperature measurements that are taken at the inlet for water in the engine room which is the most used method at present .
Automated buoys and drifters , which became more common in recent decades , tend to be cooler than the engine intake measures as well .
The recent IPCC report had a thorough description of these issues ( section 3.B.3 ) fully acknowledging that these corrections are a work in progress .
And that is indeed the case .
The collection and digitisation of the ship logbooks is a huge undertaking and continues to add significant amounts of 20th Century and earlier data to the records .
This dataset ( ICOADS ) is continually growing , and the impacts of the bias adjustments are continually being assessed .
The biggest transitions in measurements occurred at the beginning of WWII between 1939 and 1941 when the sources of data switched from European fleets to almost exclusively US fleets ( and who tended to use engine inlet temperatures rather than canvas buckets ) .
This offset was large and dramatic and was identified more than ten years ago from comparisons of simultaneous measurements of night - time marine air temperatures ( NMAT ) which did not show such a shift .
The experimentally - based adjustment to account for the canvas bucket cooling brought the sea surface temperatures much more into line with the NMAT series ( Folland and Parker , 1995 ) .
( Note that this reduced the 20th Century trends in SST ) .
More recent work ( for instance , at this workshop in 2005 ) , has focussed on refining the estimates and incorporating new sources of data .
For instance , the 1941 shift in the original corrections , was reduced and pushed back to 1939 with the addition of substantial and dominant amounts of US Merchant Marine data ( which mostly used engine inlets temperatures ) .
The version of the data that is currently used in most temperature reconstructions is based on the work of Rayner and colleagues ( reported in 2006 ) .
In their discussion of remaining issues they state :
Using metadata in the ICOADS it is possible to compare the contributions made by different countries to the marine component of the global temperature curve .
Different countries give different advice to their observing fleets concerning how best to measure SST .
Breaking the data up into separate countries ’ contributions shows that the assumption made in deriving the original bucket corrections — that is , that the use of uninsulated buckets ended in January 1942 — is incorrect .
In particular , data gathered by ships recruited by Japan and the Netherlands ( not shown ) are biased in a way that suggests that these nations were still using uninsulated buckets to obtain SST measurements as late as the 1960s .
By contrast , it appears that the United States started the switch to using engine room intake measurements as early as 1920 .
They go on to mention the modern buoy problems and the continued need to work out bias corrections for changing engine inlet data as well as minor issues related to the modern insulated buckets .
For example , the differences in co-located modern bucket and inlet temperatures are around 0.1 deg C :
( from John Kennedy , see also Kent and Kaplan , 2006 ) .
However it is one thing to suspect that biases might remain in a dataset ( a sentiment shared by everyone ) , it is quite another to show that they are really have an impact .
The Thompson et al paper does the latter quite effectively by removing variability associated with some known climate modes ( including ENSO ) and seeing the 1945 anomaly pop out clearly .
In doing this in fact , they show that the previous adjustments in the pre-war period were probably ok ( though there is substantial additional evidence of that in any case – see the references in Rayner et al , 2006 ) .
The Thompson anomaly seems to coincide strongly with the post - war shift back to a mix of US and UK ships , implying that post - war bias corrections are indeed required and significant .
This conclusion is not much of a surprise to any of the people working on this since they have been saying it in publications and meetings for years .
The issue is of course quantifying and validating the corrections , for which the Thompson analysis might prove useful .
The use of canvas buckets by the Dutch , Japanese and some UK ships is most likely to blame , and given the mix of national fleets shown above , this will make a noticeable difference in 1945 up to the early 1960s maybe – the details will depend on the seasonal and areal coverage of those sources compared to the dominant US information .
The schematic in the Independent is probably a good first guess at what the change will look like ( remember that the ocean changes are constrained by the NMAT record shown above ) :
Note that there was a big El Niño event in 1941 ( independently documented in coral and other records ) .
So far , so good .
The fun for the blog - watchers is what happened next .
What could one do to get the story all wrong ?
First , you could incorrectly assume that scientists working on this must somehow be unaware of the problems ( that is belied by the frequent mention of post WWII issues in workshops and papers since at least 2005 , but never mind ) .
Next , you could conflate the ‘ buckets ’ used in recent decades ( as seen in the graphs in Kent et al 2007 ‘s discussion of the ICOADS meta - data ) with the buckets in the pre-war period ( see photo above ) and exaggerate how prevalent they were .
If you do make those mistakes however , you can extrapolate to get some rather dramatic ( and erroneous ) conclusions .
For instance , that the effect of the ‘ corrections ’ would be to halve the SST trend from the 1970s .
Gosh !
( You should be careful not to mention the mismatch this would create with the independent NMAT data series ) .
But there is more !
You could take the ( incorrect ) prescription based on the bucket confusion , apply it to the full global temperatures ( land included , hmm … ) and think that this merits a discussion on whether the whole IPCC edifice had been completely undermined ( Answer : no ) .
And it goes on – once the bucket confusion was pointed out , the complaint switched to the scandal that it was n’t properly explained and well , there must be something else …
All this shows wishful thinking overcoming logic .
Every time there is a similar rush to judgment that is subsequently shown to be based on nothing , it still adds to the vast array of similar ‘ evidence ’ that keeps getting trotted out by the ill - informed .
The excuse that these are just exploratory exercises in what - if thinking wears a little thin when the ‘ what if ’ always leads to the same ( desired ) conclusion .
This week ’s play - by - play was quite revealing on that score .

( CNN ) --
" I can't find the right words to describe when you are homeless , " says Iraq war veteran Joseph Jacobo .
" You see the end of your life right there .
What am I going to do , what am I going to eat ? "
War trauma sends many veterans to the streets where they beg for survival .
Jacobo is one of an increasing number of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who come home to life on the street .
The Department of Veterans Affairs is fighting to find them homes .
Veterans make up almost a quarter of the homeless population in the United States .
The government says there are as many as 200,000 homeless veterans ; the majority served in the Vietnam War .
Some served in Korea or even World War II .
About 2,000 served in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The VA and several nongovernmental organizations have created programs that address the special needs of today 's veterans returning from war .
In addition to treating physical and mental injuries , there are career centers and counseling programs .
But the VA still expects the homeless rate among the nation 's newest veterans to rise because of the violent nature of combat seen in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Officials say many more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer post - traumatic stress disorder than veterans of previous wars .
The government says PTSD is one of the leading causes of homelessness among veterans .
" They come back , and they are having night trauma , they are having difficulty sleeping .
They are feeling alienated , " says Peter Dougherty , the director of homeless programs for the VA .
The VA says 70 percent of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan saw some form of combat , either through firefights , rocket attacks or the most common strikes on troops -- roadside bomb attacks on their vehicles .
That is three times the rate of combat experienced by Vietnam veterans , according to the VA .
Jacobo spent more than a year as an Army mechanic in Iraq between 2004 and 2006 .
He saw many of his fellow soldiers killed during attacks on his base .
He suffers from PTSD and found himself homeless after being discharged from the Army in 2006 , but recently moved into a VA - funded shelter in Washington .
Until he found the VA facility , he was sleeping in laundry rooms and washing himself in fast food restrooms until he would be kicked out .
Jacobo says he speaks to many veterans from Vietnam who say that if the programs veterans receive today were available to them , they would most likely not be homeless .
" Where would I be if it was not for this place ?
Where would I get a job to give an address to an employer ?
They have phones here where you can make calls , so this is the step every veteran needs to have .
A place for an address , a phone where you can be contacted and this is really good , " says Jacobo .
The VA and organizations that help veterans are trying to reach out to those who may not know there is help available or are not interested in assistance .
Social workers walk the streets and scour soup kitchens looking for vets who might need help , working with organizations that offer shelter or medical assistance .
" Because we are convinced , and we know that the earlier the intervention happens , particularly when it is related to PTSD , the better the prognosis is for recovery , " Dougherty says .
" Unfortunately , we have learned much to our detriment when we did n't recognize PTSD as an illness that people suffer with it for decades , and when they tried to get it addressed , it was a much longer and more difficult process to get that readjustment , " Dougherty says .
While the VA is prepared for a rise in homeless veterans , it is taking a measured approach .
Based on statistics from around the country , the number of homeless veterans is increasing slowly , which the VA attributes to the programs already in place .
Dougherty says the outlook is good for future veterans .
" We are also increasing significantly the level of services we provide , not only in homeless programs , but we are really focused more on the prevention of these veterans from ever becoming homeless in the first place , " he said .

If you 've ever played a really horrible game , you 've probably thought :
Wow , the people who made this are talentless .
You fume at the derivative , seen - it - before gameplay ; you complain that the levels are far too monotonous , or far too unmanageable .
After a while , you throw down your controller and boast :
Hell , I could make a game better than this .
Ah , but could you ?
I recently found out when I spent some time with Blast Works , a brilliant new Wii title that allows you to create your own games .
What I discovered is , as you might expect , it 's pretty damn hard to make a fun game .
You 'll probably fail .
But in the process of doing so , you 'll learn a ton about what makes a good game good .
Or to put it another way : Designing games makes you a better connoisseur of them .
On the surface , Blast Works is a side - scrolling , spaceship - blasting game with a clever twist .
Much like Gradius , you drift inexorably rightward , ever beset by blocky , polygonal enemies .
But when you blast them into pieces , you can – much as with Katamari Damacy – swoop in and scoop up any loose parts , which then stick to your spaceship .
Turrets from enemy guns remain functional , so you quickly can amass a huge , unruly mess of weapons that jut out from every direction .
If you did nothing else but play the single - player component , you 'd have fun .
But if you stopped there , you 'd miss out on the philosophically rich treats to come .
Because also embedded inside Blast Works is an amazingly full - featured editor that lets you create customized spaceships , bullets and levels .
Almost everything , from physics to camera zoom , is tweakable .
Objects can be designed down to the last pixel if you 're obsessed enough .
Basically , it 's everything you need to craft your own side - scrolling shooter .
Hot damn , I thought .
I plunged into the editor and decided to try crafting a shooter with a nutty electric - guitar aesthetic .
At first , it seemed really easy .
In barely 10 minutes , I designed a crude Flying V - style ship .
I crafted a couple of even more crude - looking enemies :
Weak ones were shaped like guitar picks , and more - ferocious killers were shaped like ... well , big lumps of something or other .
Hey , I 'm tolerable at design , but only barely .
And in any case , I was getting impatient to try out my creation .
How would it play ?
I loaded the game , hit Start , and when the Flying V ship drifted onscreen , I was hit with a giddy jolt of pride .
Dude !
I 'm playing my own game !
But my pride quickly deflated , upon a sober realization :
My game sucked .
I 'd clustered the enemies far too closely together , making it impossible to avoid their attacks .
Hell , I did n't even leave enough breathing space .
The first notes of the ominous they 're - here music had barely started when the armada arrived and sliced through me like I was soft cheese .
I went back in and tinkered with the attack spacings , but found I quickly tipped into the opposite problem :
Now the game was too easy .
Hmmm .
Over the next few hours , two things happened .
I got deep into the weeds of my game , tweaking and teasing the enemies and the landscape to try and balance things out .
More important , I gained an amazingly rich sense of just how remarkable truly good game design is – the talent that 's necessary to reach that tightrope balance point where something 's optimally challenging without being controller - chucking frustrating .
I mean , if I was having this much trouble crafting a simple side - scroller – one of the most rudimentary genres – imagine trying to create a complex online world , an immersive shooter or a mystery game .
How the hell do Blizzard , Bungie and Cyan do it ?
Creating a game , in other words , makes you a better consumer of games , because it forces you to think concretely about the linguistics of the craft : balance , collisions , human motivation , camera work , artwork , physics .
It 's like how being required to write speeches and short stories in elementary school trains you to appreciate a truly spectacular novel or bit of oratory – or how knowing how to play an instrument , even poorly , gives you a deeper insight into true musical genius .
But the fascinating thing is that there are lots of people out there who are pretty good at game design .
If you go over to the Blast Works website , you can download ships , enemies , weapons and entire levels that gamers have created , and try them for yourself .
The creativity is occasionally stunning .
There are re-creations of famous Nintendo characters like Mario and Link ; there 's even a precise rendition of the original Super Mario Bros .
Someone assembled a hilariously spot - on homage to Star Wars .
And one gamer , amazingly , re-created the look of Space Invaders by crafting a level so narrow it does n't scroll – and you thus remain on one screen .
I 'm not suggesting that these are addictive , must - play games .
No , they 're more like fan fiction – a way of thinking about what game design really is .
They remind me of how new - media artists like Cory Arcangel have plundered old - school game environments as a form of cultural commentary .
( Indeed , I 've even now been inspired with my own quasi-artistic idea : I 'm designing a Blast Works level that has no enemies at all – just a backdrop of buildings that will slowly spell out a message in enormous letters as you scroll by .
It 's Gradius as a form of text messaging ! )
Of course , Blast Works is n't entirely new : Many previous games have offered modding and editing tools before .
But I 've never seen any game that mixed such flexibility with relative simplicity – and offered such a quick way to share your design ideas with others .
And at the very least , it allows you to finally answer your own windy boast : Man , I could do that .
Well , sure .
Just try .

Have you been thinking about putting yourself up for sale lately ?
Ever wonder how much money you could get on the open human market ?
This fun quiz will attempt to place a value on your life using a variety of criteria in 4 basic facets of life .
Among the criteria used include athletic ability , education level , income , amount of exercise , weight , and sense of humor .
This is obviously a very subjective survey and is not intended and does not claim to be scientifically accurate .
The more honestly you answer the questions , the more realistic the dollar value returned will be .
Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Mark Changizi says that actions like catching a football or easily moving through a room full of people requires something more than quickly responding to a situation — it requires our ability to foresee the future .
It takes our brain nearly one - tenth of a second to translate the light that hits our retina into a visual perception of the world around us .
While a neural delay of that magnitude may seem minuscule , imagine trying to catch a ball or wade through a store full of people while always perceiving the very recent ( one - tenth of a second prior ) past .
A ball passing within one meter of you and traveling at one meter per second in reality would be roughly six degrees displaced from where you perceive it , and even the slowest forward - moving person can travel at least ten centimeters in a tenth of a second .
In the Orbison geometric illusion , the squares closer to the center of the image seem larger than those on the outside of the drawing .
Evolution has seen to it that drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future .

Changizi claims the visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays , allowing it to generate perceptions of what will occur one - tenth of a second into the future , so that when an observer actually perceives something , it is the present rather than what happened one - tenth of a second ago .
Using his hypothesis , called “ perceiving - the - present , ” he was able to systematically organize and explain more than 50 types of visual illusions that occur because our brains are trying to perceive the near future .
His findings are described in May - June issue of the journal Cognitive Science .
“ Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future , and those perceptions do n’t match reality .
There has been great success at discovering and documenting countless visual illusions .
There has been considerably less success in organizing them , ” says Changizi , who is lead author on the paper .
“ My research focused on systematizing these known incidents of failed future seeing into a ‘ periodic table ’ of illusion classes that can predict a broad pattern of the illusions we might be subject to . ”
More than meets the eye
We experience countless illusions in our lifetime .
The most famous being geometrical illusions — those with converging lines and a vanishing point we often see in Psychology 101 classes or in entertaining optical illusion books .
To picture one , think of the Hering illusion , which looks like a bike spoke with two vertical lines drawn on either side of the center vanishing point .
Although the lines are straight , they seem to bow out away from the vanishing point .
The optical illusion occurs because our brains are predicting the way the underlying scene would project in the next moment if we were moving in the direction of the vanishing point .
The Hering illusion is exemplified by the perceived curvature of the straight lines near the vanishing point in the center of the drawing .
The optical illusion occurs because our brains are predicting the way the underlying scene would project in the next moment if we were moving in the direction of the vanishing point .

“ Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future , ” says Changizi .
“ The converging lines toward a vanishing point are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving forward — as we would in the real world , where the door frame seems to bow out as we move through it — and we try to perceive what that world will look like in the next instant . ”
Beyond geometric , Changizi was able to identify 27 other classes of illusions .
He organized them into 28 predictable categories classified on a matrix that distributes them among four columns based on the type of visual feature that is misperceived ( size , speed , luminance , and distance ) and among seven rows based on the different optical features that occur when an observer is moving forward .
He then culled hundreds of previously documented illusions to test whether they would follow the appropriate prediction as determined by the table , and found that they did , indeed , follow the patterns he laid out in the matrix .
This new organization of illusions presents a range of potential applications , including more effective visual displays and enhanced visual arts .
It especially may help constrain neuroscientists aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying vision , according to Changizi .
Changizi conducted his research during a fellowship in the Sloan - Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology .
Coauthors on the paper include : Caltech Biology Professor Shinsuke Shimojo , former Caltech undergraduate student Andrew Hsieh , and former Caltech postdoctoral researcher Ryota Kanai , as well as Romi Nijhawan , a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England .

Oil Boom : Exxon Breaks Record for Profits by U.S. Company Buoyed by high oil prices , ExxonMobil reports $ 11.68B profits .
July 31 , 2008  -- HOUSTON ( AP ) -- Exxon Mobil reported second - quarter earnings of $ 11.68 billion Thursday , the biggest quarterly profit ever by any U.S. corporation , but the results fell well short of Wall Street expectations and shares fell in premarket trading .
The world 's largest publicly traded oil company said net income for the April - June period came to $ 2.22 a share , up from $ 10.26 billion , or $ 1.83 a share , a year ago .

Revenue rose 40 percent to $ 138.1 billion from $ 98.4 billion in the year - earlier quarter .
Excluding an after - tax charge of $ 290 million related to an Exxon Valdez court settlement , earnings amounted to $ 11.97 billion , or $ 2.27 per share .
Analysts on average expected Exxon Mobil to earn $ 2.52 a share on revenue of $ 144 billion , according to a survey by Thomson Financial .
The estimates typically exclude one - time items .
The record - setting results were largely expected , given that crude prices in the second quarter were nearly double what they were a year ago .
Natural gas prices were significantly higher too .
But investors expected even bigger profits Thursday , especially after Europe 's Royal Dutch Shell reported a 33 percent jump in second - quarter earnings of $ 11.6 billion , which fell just shy of Exxon 's own record earnings from 2007 .
Shares fell 2 percent , or $ 1.68 , to $ 82.70 in premarket trading .
Setting U.S. profit records has become commonplace for Irving - based Exxon Mobil .
The $ 11.68 billion topped its own U.S. record of $ 11.66 billion , posted in the fourth quarter of last year .
Right behind that was the $ 10.9 billion it reported to start 2008 .
Exxon Mobil owns the record for at least the top six most - profitable quarters for a U.S. company , as well as the largest annual profit .

PROZAC IS ONE of the most successful drugs of all time .
Since its introduction as an antidepressant more than 20 years ago , Prozac has been prescribed to more than 54 million people around the world , and prevented untold amounts of suffering .
But the success of Prozac has n't simply transformed the treatment of depression : it has also transformed the science of depression .
For decades , researchers struggled to identify the underlying cause of depression , and patients were forced to endure a series of ineffective treatments .
But then came Prozac .
Like many other antidepressants , Prozac increases the brain 's supply of serotonin , a neurotransmitter .
The drug 's effectiveness inspired an elegant theory , known as the chemical hypothesis : Sadness is simply a lack of chemical happiness .
The little blue pills cheer us up because they give the brain what it has been missing .
There 's only one problem with this theory of depression : it 's almost certainly wrong , or at the very least woefully incomplete .
Experiments have since shown that lowering people 's serotonin levels does not make them depressed , nor does it worsen their symptoms if they are already depressed .
In recent years , scientists have developed a novel theory of what falters in the depressed brain .
Instead of seeing the disease as the result of a chemical imbalance , these researchers argue that the brain 's cells are shrinking and dying .
This theory has gained momentum in the past few months , with the publication of several high profile scientific papers .
The effectiveness of Prozac , these scientists say , has little to do with the amount of serotonin in the brain .
Rather , the drug works because it helps heal our neurons , allowing them to grow and thrive again .
In this sense , Prozac is simply a bottled version of other activities that have a similar effect , such as physical exercise .
They are n't happy pills , but healing pills .
These discoveries are causing scientists to fundamentally reimagine depression .
While the mental illness is often defined in terms of its emotional symptoms - this led a generation of researchers to search for the chemicals , like serotonin , that might trigger such distorted moods - researchers are now focusing on more systematic changes in the depressed brain .
" The best way to think about depression is as a mild neurodegenerative disorder , " says Ronald Duman , a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at Yale .
" Your brain cells atrophy , just like in other diseases [ such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's ] .
The only difference with depression is that it 's reversible .
The brain can recover . "
Given the prevalence of depression - more than 16 percent of people will suffer from a major depressive episode at some point in their lives - a more accurate scientific understanding of the disease is of immense value .
In fact , this research is already being used to develop more effective treatments for the mental illness , some of which are currently in clinical trials .
The progress exemplifies an important feature of modern medicine , which is the transition from a symptom - based understanding of a disease - depression is an illness of unrelenting sadness - to a more detailed biological understanding , in which the disease is categorized and treated based on its specific anatomical underpinnings .
In the 19th century , the " fever " was a common medical illness .
Of course , doctors now realize that a fever is merely a common symptom of many different diseases , from the flu to leukemia .
Likewise , when Richard Nixon declared a " War on Cancer " in 1971 , scientists largely defined cancer in terms of its most tangible characteristic : uncontrolled growth leading to a tumor .
As a result , every cancer was treated with the same blunt tools .
Over time , of course , scientists have discovered that cancer is not a single disease with a single biological cause .
Breast cancer , for instance , can be triggered by a wide variety of genes and environmental risk factors .
Because doctors can look beyond the superficial similarities of the symptoms - all tumors are not created equal - they are able to tailor their treatments to the specific disease .
Neuroscience is only beginning to catch up .
Thanks to a variety of new experimental tools , such as brain scanners and DNA microarrays , researchers are now refining their understanding of mental illness .
In many instances , this means recategorizing disorders , so that patients are no longer diagnosed solely in terms of their most obvious symptoms .
" We used to think there was only one kind of anemia , " says Arturas Petronis , a scientist at the University of Toronto who investigates the underlying causes of schizophrenia .
" But now we know there are at least 15 different kinds .
We 'll likely learn the same thing about many mental illnesses . " . . .
One of the first cracks in the chemical hypothesis of depression came from a phenomenon known as the " Prozac lag . "
Antidepressants increase the amount of serotonin in the brain within hours , but the beneficial effects are not usually felt for weeks .
This led neuroscientists to wonder if something besides serotonin might be responsible .
Duman , for instance , began to study a class of proteins known as trophic factors , which help neurons grow and survive .
Trophe is Greek for nourishment ; what sunlight and water do for trees , trophic factors do for brain cells .
Numerous studies had shown that chronic stress damages the brain by suppressing the release of trophic factors .
In a series of influential papers published earlier this decade , Duman demonstrated that the same destructive hallmark is seen in depression , so that our neurons are deprived of what they need .
" The mental illness occurs when these stress mechanisms in the brain spiral out of control , " he says .
Once that happens , the brain begins to shut itself down , suppressing all but the most essential upkeep .
Not only do neurons stop growing , but the brain seems to stop creating new cells .
A 2003 study , led by Columbia University neuroscientist Rene Hen , found that when the birth of new brain cells was blocked with low doses of radiation in " depressed " rats , antidepressants stopped working .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Rebecca Jeschke sez , " EFF 's Jennifer Granick outlines how you should protect yourself while traveling with private data .
Bad news : it 's not easy . "
If you encrypt your hard drive with strong crypto , it will be prohibitively expensive for CBP to access your confidential information .
This answer is imperfect for two reasons–one is practical , the other is technological .
Practically , the government has not disclosed CBP 's laptop search practices , despite our Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for these documents .
We do n't know what a border patrol agent will do when confronted with an encrypted machine .
One possibility is that the agent will simply give up and let the traveler pass with her belongings .
Other possibilities are that the agent will turn the traveler and her machine away at the border , or that he will seize the laptop and allow the traveler to continue on .
I suspect that on most occasions , CBP agents confronted with encrypted or password - protected data tell the owner to enter the password or get turned away , and the owner , eager to continue her voyage or to return home , simply complies .
If you do n't want to comply , CBP cannot force you to decrypt your data or give over your password .
Only a judge can force you to answer questions , and then only if the Fifth Amendment does not apply .
While no Fifth Amendment right protects the data on your laptop or phone , one federal court has held that even a judge cannot force you to divulge your password when the act of revealing the password shows that you are the person with access to or control over potentially incriminating files .

This week The McKinsey Quaterly asks : what does stimulating the creativity of animators have in common with developing new product ideas or technology breakthroughs ?
Apparently , a lot .
In Innovation lessons from Pixar , McKinsey writes :
Brad Bird makes his living fostering creativity .
Academy Award - winning director ( The Incredibles and Ratatouille ) talks about the importance , in his work , of pushing teams beyond their comfort zones , encouraging dissent , and building morale .
He also explained the value of “ black sheep ” — restless contributors with unconventional ideas .
Steve Jobs hired him , says Bird , because after three successes ( Toy Story , A Bug ’s Life , and Toy Story 2 ) he was worried Pixar might struggle to stay innovative .
Jobs told him :
“ The only thing we ’re afraid of is complacency — feeling like we have it all figured out , ” Bird quotes his boss as saying “ … We want you to come shake things up . ”
Bird explains to McKinsey how he did it — and why , for “ imagination - based companies to succeed in the long run , making money ca n’t be the focus . ”
The piece is behind McKinsey ’s pay wall , but we extract its 9 key lessons below .
Lesson One : Herd Your Black Sheep
The Quarterly : How did your first project at Pixar — The Incredibles — shake things up ?
Brad Bird : I said , “ Give us the black sheep .
I want artists who are frustrated .
I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody ’s listening to .
Give us all the guys who are probably headed out the door . ”
A lot of them were malcontents because they saw different ways of doing things , but there was little opportunity to try them , since the established way was working very , very well .
We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories , and we changed the way a number of things are done here .
Lesson Two : Perfect is the Enemy of Innovation
The Quarterly : What sorts of things did you do differently ?
Brad Bird : I had to shake the purist out of them — essentially frighten them into realizing I was ready to use quick and dirty “ cheats ” to get something on screen …
I ’d say , “ Look , I do n’t have to do the water through a computer simulation program …
I ’m perfectly content to film a splash in a swimming pool and just composite the water in . ”
I never did film the pool splash [ but ] talking this way helped everyone understand that we did n’t have to make something that would work from every angle .
Not all shots are created equal .
Certain shots need to be perfect , others need to be very good , and there are some that only need to be good enough to not break the spell .
Lesson Three : Look for Intensity
The Quarterly : Do angry people — malcontents , in your words — make for better innovation ?
Brad Bird : Involved people make for better innovation …
Involved people can be quiet , loud , or anything in - between — what they have in common is a restless , probing nature : “ I want to get to the problem .
There ’s something I want to do . ”
If you had thermal glasses , you could see heat coming off them .
Lesson Four : Innovation Does n’t happen in a Vacuum
The Quarterly : How do you build and lead a team ?
Brad Bird : I got everybody in a room .
This was different from what the previous guy had done ; he had reviewed the work in private , generated notes , and sent them to the person … .
I said , “ Look , this is a young team .
As individual animators , we all have different strengths and weaknesses , but if we can interconnect all our strengths , we are collectively the greatest animator on earth .
So I want you guys to speak up and drop your drawers .
We ’re going to look at your scenes in front of everybody .
Everyone will get humiliated and encouraged together …
Lesson Five : High Morale Makes Creativity Cheap
The Quarterly :
It sounds like you spend a fair amount of time thinking about the morale of your teams .
Brad Bird :
In my experience , the thing that has the most significant impact on a movie ’s budget — but never shows up in a budget — is morale .
[ what ’s true for a movie is true for a startup ! ]
If you have low morale , for every $ 1 you spend , you get about 25 cents of value .
If you have high morale , for every $ 1 you spend , you get about $ 3 of value .
Companies should pay much more attention to morale .
Lesson Six : Dont Try To “ Protect your success ”
The Quarterly : Engagement , morale — what else is critical for stimulating innovative thinking ?
Brad Bird :
The first step in achieving the impossible is believing that the impossible can be achieved . …
“ You do n’t play it safe — you do something that scares you , that ’s at the edge of your capabilities , where you might fail .
That ’s what gets you up in the morning . ”
Lesson Six : Steve Jobs Says ‘ Interaction = Innovation ’
The Quarterly : What does Pixar do to stimulate a creative culture ?
Brad Bird :
If you walk around downstairs in the animation area , you ’ll see that it is unhinged .
People are allowed to create whatever front to their office they want .
One guy might build a front that ’s like a Western town .
Someone else might do something that looks like Hawaii … John [ Lasseter ] believes that if you have a loose , free kind of atmosphere , it helps creativity .
Then there ’s our building .
Steve Jobs basically designed this building .
In the center , he created this big atrium area , which seems initially like a waste of space .
The reason he did it was that everybody goes off and works in their individual areas .
People who work on software code are here , people who animate are there , and people who do designs are over there .
Steve put the mailboxes , the meetings rooms , the cafeteria , and , most insidiously and brilliantly , the bathrooms in the center — which initially drove us crazy — so that you run into everybody during the course of a day .
[ Jobs ] realized that when people run into each other , when they make eye contact , things happen .
So he made it impossible for you not to run into the rest of the company .
Lesson Seven : Encourage Inter - disciplinary Learning
The Quarterly : Is there anything else you ’d highlight that contributes to creativity around here ?
Brad Bird : One thing Pixar does [ is ] “ PU , ” or Pixar University .
If you work in lighting but you want to learn how to animate , there ’s a class to show you animation .
There are classes in story structure , in Photoshop , even in Krav Maga , the Israeli self - defense system .
Pixar basically encourages people to learn outside of their areas , which makes them more complete .
[ and more creative ] .
Lesson Eight : Get Rid of Weak Links
The Quarterly : What undermines Innovation ?

I can usually spot those people fairly soon and I weed them out .
Lesson Nine : Making $ $ Ca n’t Be Your Focus
The Quarterly : How would you compare the Disney of your early career with Pixar today ?
Brad Bird :
When I entered Disney , it was like a classic Cadillac Phaeton that had been left out in the rain … .
The company ’s thought process was not , “ We have all this amazing machinery — how do we use it to make exciting things ?
We could go to Mars in this rocket ship ! ”
It was , “ We do n’t understand Walt Disney at all .
We do n’t understand what he did .
Let ’s not screw it up .
Let ’s just preserve this rocket ship ; going somewhere new in it might damage it . ”
Walt Disney ’s mantra was , “ I do n’t make movies to make money — I make money to make movies . ”
That ’s a good way to sum up the difference between Disney at its height and Disney when it was lost .
It ’s also true of Pixar and a lot of other companies .
It seems counterintuitive , but for imagination - based companies to succeed in the long run , making money ca n’t be the focus .
Professor Stephen Hawking of the University of Cambridge , makes remarks at an event marking the 50th anniversary of NASA , Monday , April 21 , 2008 , at George Washington University in Washington .
Alien lifemay well exist in a primitive form somewhere in our corner of the galaxy , famedastrophysicist Stephen Hawking said Monday .
Given thesize of the universe , it is unlikely that Earth is the only planet to develop somesort of life , Hawking told an audience at George Washington University inWashington , D.C.
He added that humanity must embrace space exploration , if onlyto ensure itslong - term survival .
? Whilethere may be primitive life in our region of the galaxy , there don?t seem to beany advanced intelligent beings , ? said Hawkingduring a lecture as part of a series commemorating NASA ?s 50th anniversary thisyear .
The lack ofsuccess by the Search for Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) project todiscover signals from an alien civilization suggests that none exist withinseveral 100 light - years of Earth , Hawking said , though he offered threetheories on the dearth of interplanetary communications .
Theprobability of primitivelife developing on a suitable planet may be extremely low , or it may behigh , but aliens intelligent enough to beam signals into space may also besmart enough to build civilization - destroying weapons like nuclear bombs , hesaid .
More likely , he added , is that primitive life is likely to develop , butintelligent life as we know it is exceedingly rare .
? We don ? tappear to have been visited by aliens , ?
Hawking said , adding that he discountsreports of UFOs .
?
Why would they only appear to cranks and weirdoes ??
Alien lifeaside , Hawking said humanity must pursue a long - term effort of spaceexploration that would span hundreds of years in order to ensure the survivalof the species .
He likened those opposed to spending money on space science andexploration to those who wrote off Christopher Columbus ?
trans-Atlantic Oceanvoyage in 1492 as a waste of money .
? Thediscovery of the New World made a profound difference on the old .
Just think , we would n't have had a Big Mac or KFC , ?
Hawking said .
? Spreadingout into space will have an even greater effect , ? he added .
?
It will completelychange the future of the human race , and maybe determine whether we have anyfuture at all .?
Hawking , 66 , is a renownedtheoretical physicist and cosmologist who suffers from the neurologicaldisorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .
He uses a wheelchair , communicateswith the aid of a computer , and co-wrote a children ? s book about science -?
George ?s Secret Key to the Universe ? - with his daughter Lucy in the hope ofinspiring youth to pursue studies in science and technology .
? We live ina society that is increasingly governed by science and technology , ?
Hawkingsaid .
?
Yet fewer and fewer people want to go into science .?
Sendingastronauts back to the moon , establishing a lunar base with a clear target ofgoing on to Mars would do much to restore the public ?s support for spaceflight , he added .
? If thehuman race is to continue for another million years we will have to boldly gowhere no one has gone before , ?

Iowa Politics
July 26 , 2008
Four Iowans were arrested today while attempting to make a Citizens ’ Arrest of Karl Rove in Des Moines , Iowa .
Citing Iowa
Code provisions for making Citizen ’s Arrests as well as citing Federal Statute violations they claimed Rove had violated , the four were stopped at the gate of the Wakonda Country Club in Des Moines where Rove was scheduled to speak at a Republican Fundraiser .
The four arrested were retired Methodist minister and Peace and Justice Advocate , Rev. Chet Guinn , 80 , as well as three Des Moines Catholic Workers , Edward Bloomer , 61 , Kirk Brown , 25 , and Mona Shaw , 57 .
All four were cited for trespassing and released .
The four maintained that they were acting within the guidelines of Iowa Code that obligate private citizens to make such an arrest if they believe a felony has been committed and turn Rove over to police officials to bring Rove before a judge for formal indictment .
By law , a federal judge should consider the charges and determine if an indictment should be made .
Brown and Shaw made a similar attempt last March when Rove spoke at the University of Iowa , Iowa City .
Brown and Shaw were arrested and released without charges following that attempt .
Deaths in the Middle East since the March attempt number in the thousands including , 151 more US troops have been killed in Iraq , and 284 killed in Afghanistan as well as far more citizens of those two nations .
Rove remains unindicted and recently refused to cooperate with a Congressional subpoena in the Valerie Plame leak investigation .
Despite mounting evidence of Rove ’s wrongdoing concerning leading the U.S. to war as well as other actions , Congress and the U.S. judicial system remain reluctant to bring charges against either Rove or the Bush administration .
Recent evidence includes Articles of Impeachment that will again be presented by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich tomorrow .
Vincent Bugliosi ’s new book “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder ” carefully lays out a case against Bush and his administration for war crimes and felony murder .
Bugliosi was prosecutor for the Charles Manson Family murders and author of the book “ Helter Skelter , ” which dealt with that crime .

A specially preserved giant squid has gone on display in Paris .
The squid , 6.5 m ( 21.5 ft ) long , has undergone plastination , which means its liquids have been replaced by a polymer .
The process , which took two - and - a - half years and cost 65,000 euros ( $ 100,000 ; £ 50,000 ) , is designed to make the preserved squid look as natural as possible .
The creature is a gift from New Zealand , where it was fished out of the deep seas in 2000 .
Sea monster
The squid hangs from the ceiling of France 's National Museum of Natural History , where its long pink tentacles stretch down towards a terrified - looking shark .
The giant creature has been named
Wheke , after the sea monster of Maori mythology that led the Polynesians across the ocean to discover Aotearoa , or New Zealand .
It was 9 m long when it was caught , but it shrank to 6.5 m after it died .
The biologist who helped organise the donation said there should be a giant squid in the country of Jules Verne - the Frenchman who wrote the celebrated novel 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea .
That was an epic tale of struggles between sailors and tentacled monsters , featuring a giant squid that tried to engulf a submarine .
Fluids replaced
The plastination process involves replacing the water , fat and other liquids in the body with a polymer that hardens .
A pink pigment was added to make it look as close as possible to the living creature .
It was first used by the German anatomist Gunther von Hagens , who has controversially preserved and exhibited human cadavers .
The usual way of preserving life forms - by pickling them in a jar - would , the museum said , have been demeaning , and out of the question .
As Congress prepares new guidelines for the NSA 's domestic spying program , US lawmakers are leaving untouched a wide array of government programs which also perform surveillance on Americans :
These programs – most of them highly classified – are run by an alphabet soup of federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
They sift , store and analyze the communications , spending habits and travel patterns of U.S. citizens , searching for suspicious activity .
The surveillance includes data - mining programs that allow the NSA and the FBI to sift through large databanks of e-mails , phone calls and other communications , not for selective information , but in search of suspicious patterns .
Other information , like routine bank transactions , is kept in databases similarly monitored by the Central Intelligence Agency .
" There 's virtually no branch of the U.S. government that is n't in some way involved in monitoring or surveillance , " said Matthew Aid , an intelligence historian and fellow at the National Security Archives at The George Washington University .
" We 're operating in a brave new world . "
I love Swopa .
But I am astounded that he misses this fact : in a post arguing against getting lost in the minutiae , he presents the issue as one of Bush " coddling criminals , " and not as one of Bush using his pardon power to hide his own ( and Cheney 's ) involvement in a crime .
It was not Libby who came up with the idea of leaking Valerie Wilson 's identity to Judy Miller , it was Cheney , and he did so with the authorization of Bush .
This is not a mistake Wexler makes .
Indeed , his resolution defines in clear terms what Bush 's commutation amounts to :
[ Bush 's ] decision to reward the perjury of Mr. Libby ... effectively protected President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other
Administration officials from further scrutiny .
Given that Wexler has such a clear understanding of the issue here , it is unfortunate that he stops at censure .
Sure , it 'd make for bad press for the President .
On Tuesday .
But by Thursday , Bush could rest easy that he had ended all scrutiny into his actions , once and for all .
Censure would amount to a closing off of inquiry ; it would provide a way for the Republicans to defeat any effort to get the grand jury materials that Fitzgerald and his team spent so much effort putting together .
It would end this thing , at precisely the moment when the country is finally beginning to understand the magnitude of what Bush and Cheney did .
In fact , our forefathers gave us clear instructions what to do at a time like this , when a President uses his pardon authority to cover up his own crimes .
In the same convention George Mason argued that the President might use his pardoning power to " pardon crimes which were advised by himself " or , before indictment or conviction , " to stop inquiry and prevent detection . "
James Madison responded : [ I ] f the President be connected , in any suspicious manner , with any person , and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him , the House of Representatives can impeach him ; they can remove him if found guilty ..
It does n't take minutiae to prove that Bush has " sheltered " someone whose crime was " advised by himself . "
It takes Libby 's notes and grand jury testimony .
The punishment for the abuse of the pardon power is clear : impeachment .
Just as the punishment for Libby 's obstruction was clearly 30 months .
If we 're going to complain about the commutation itself , we have no business letting Bush off with nothing more than censure .
If the last 10 years have taught us anything , it 's that the cable industry in the US is focused on openness , innovation , and customer satisfaction ; but if we can't keep the government 's knuckleheaded regulators out of our cable lines and off our Internet , cable 's nearly absurd level of innovation will be throttled down more effectively than BitTorrent uploads on Comcast 's network .
Well , so says the cable industry , at least .
Cable : pro-consumer and innovative
Kyle McSlarrow heads the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) , the trade group that represents cable .
Any job that involves getting up on a regular basis and defending cable 's insane rate hikes as consumer - focused measures that spur innovation can't be a real laughfest , but McSlarrow soldiers on .
Yesterday , he gave a major speech to the National Press Club in Washington , DC that made the above points ( though with fewer digs at Comcast ) and claimed that cable was " a great American success story . "
In the speech , McSlarrow described cable 's basic approach as one characterized by " embracing innovation and open markets and platforms " and " focusing on the customer . "
( I know , right ? )
The point of the speech was n't just to talk up cable , though , and it opened with a call for a " public policy approach that relies on ' self - regulatory ' actions that facilitate collaborative private - sector solutions to complicated technology and business disputes " like network management and net neutrality .
It closed the same way , with the statement that " the evidence is overwhelming that marketplace collaboration and self - regulation is a pro-consumer approach that deserves our support . "
So let 's do as McSlarrow suggests and take a look at the evidence .
What hath deregulation wrought ?
Business do n't always dislike regulation ; if regulation throws up such stiff barriers to entry that new competitors rarely emerge , that 's great for incumbents .
And if you can " capture " your regulator in such a way that you have a cozy industry / government connection that does n't rely on market forces or respond to customer pressure , that can work out pretty well , too .
But in most other cases , businesses would prefer deregulation , the more the better .
It 's an idea that flourished in the last few decades , but regulatory enthusiasm is making a comeback .
In the just - released new issue of The Atlantic , editors count down the " 11 ½ Biggest Ideas of the Year , " and number seven is " the return of regulation . "
Clive Crook notes that " this empowerment of the market was usually advantageous , sometimes bungled , and nearly always controversial — but for years the trend was mostly one - way .
Now a major rethink is underway . "
Certainly deregulation has been good to cable .
Consumers Union , the nonprofit that puts out Consumer Reports magazine , took a look at the results .
Their conclusion ?
It led to much , MUCH higher prices .
" Until 1984 , local governments kept cable prices in check , " says CU .
" Then deregulation resulted in a torrent of price hikes , interrupted only by a brief period , 1993 - 1996 , when rates were regulated .
The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 opened the flood gates to deregulation and more price hikes .
Since passage of the 1996
Act , cable rates have increased by 59 percent — almost three times the rate of inflation — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . "
The lost art of customer service
So maybe the prices are high and the competition is low , but customer service is just phenomenal .
Unfortunately , it 's not .
Even McSlarrow admits , " You might expect me to avoid the subject of customer service . "
When the spinmeister - in - chief for the industry admits there are serious issues , the situation is probably dire .
For a quantitative look at just how dire it is , we can turn to the widely - watched American Customer Satisfaction Index from the University of Michigan .
McSlarrow admitted that " we do n't find the kind of customer feedback you see reflected in some surveys acceptable , " and this was certainly one of those surveys he had in mind .
In 2007 , the ACSI found that cable satisfaction scores were , if not actually in the toilet , at least perched on the edge of bowl .
In 2008 , despite McSlarrow 's newfound customer commitment , cable scores lagged below the satellite TV operators as Charter and Comcast lost even more ground ( Time Warner did gain a single point , though ) .
Smaller operators improved their satisfaction scores , but Comcast set " an all - time low for the largest cable provider in the country , " according to Dr. Claes Fornell , who heads the study .
Fornell also noted last year that " there seems to be an element of monopoly - like pricing in the cable industry . "
Given these results , it 's unclear how McSlarrow arrived at his statement that " on a fundamental level , consumers love our services and they intuitively understand the great value they receive . "
No one I have ever spoken with about cable service has made such claims , but perhaps I simply know the wrong sort of people .
Net neutrality : a " private sector dispute "
So , given how well Congress ' " wise decision in 1996 to deregulate our industry " has worked when it comes to traditional cable television service , it 's at least fair to be skeptical about cable 's continued calls for government to stay completely away from network management and net neutrality issues .
To its credit , the cable industry and America has at least provided a real alternative to DSL ( one not seen in much of Europe , where line - sharing is used to create competition instead ) , and cable companies have put some much - needed pressure on incumbent telcos with VoIP home phone services .
Finally , cable has built a broadband infrastructure that , even if it's not cheap or particularly fast compared to other leading countries , reaches most Americans and is generally capable of faster speeds than DSL .
With DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades currently beginning , cable should get significantly faster than DSL over the next few years .
And all of this without much in the way of government regulation !
But one has only to look at the recent FCC oversight hearing on network management that has focused on practices at Comcast to see how important it is to have a public - interest regulator looking over the shoulders of these companies .
With the Internet now a key resource that has quickly come to rival water , heat , and power as a utility , such issues are surely a bit more than some mere " private sector dispute " ( as McSlarrow put it ) .
Even he admits that cable has had " helpful public - policy nudges " along the way , and one thinks about Comcast 's recent decision to investigate fairer , user - focused throttling that does n't target particular protocols or applications .
While new laws and increased regulation may not prove necessary to keep the Internet healthy in America , it would still be a shame if Congress and regulators like the FCC were so much of McSlarrow 's mindset that oversight proved a mere formality and enforcement became toothless .
This is n't a " reflexive desire by some to involve government in every private sector dispute , " but a recognition that Internet access in a less - than - fully - competitive marketplace is too important for total self - regulation .
" Foxes " and " henhouses " come to mind , but when the henhouse is actually the most innovative henhouse in the world , a place of almost magical scope and variety where eggs of every shape and color are laid by all the chickens of the world , any prudent farmer would at least pay someone to sit at the door with a shotgun .
Paul Supporters
Go on Offensive Ron Paul vows battle for liberty far from over ; ‘ revolutionaries ’ plan major showing at convention By Pat Shannan Ron Paul ’s formal end to his presidential campaign leaves him more free time to do what scares the Establishment most : educate rising generations of young Americans on the Constitution .
Fear that new generations of educated Americans will end globalization and save national sovereignty strikes fear into the hearts of such elites as Bilderberg ( AFP June 23 , 2008 ) .
Response to his campaign “ overwhelmed me , ” Paul said in his formal withdrawal .
“ More Americans believe in liberty and the Constitution than I ever imagined .
. . .
It is time now to take the energy this campaign has awakened and channel it into long - term efforts to take back our country .
We have some exciting plans and projects to move the revolution forward .
I will work until my last breath on behalf of this great message . ”
Paul ’s exit came on a high note .
Only a week earlier , The Los Angeles Times , certainly a mainstream publication , surprisingly described Paul as a true conservative alternative to McCain ’s candidacy who “ looks to do
more than merely show up at the door . ”
“ Largely under the radar of most people , ” reported the Times , “ the forces of Rep. Ron Paul have been organizing across the country to stage an embarrassing public revolt against Sen.
John McCain when Republicans gather for their national convention in Minnesota at the beginning of September .
They hope to demonstrate their disagreements with McCain vocally at the convention to . . .
Paul , who ’s running unopposed in his home Texas district for an 11th House term , still has some $ 5 million in war funds and has instructed his followers that their struggle is not about a single election , but a long - term revolution for control of the Republican Party . ”
What the Times described is precisely what the party elite feared so much .
Their chosen candidate is so weak they cannot chance a public showdown on the convention floor .
Paul supporters are eager to help carry the message and protect the messenger .
Said Florida organizer and activist Henry Morgan , “ We can put the militia around his house and provide a private bodyguard for every one of his grandchildren , if necessary . ”
“ He must n’t quit now , ” said Carol Asher of Idaho .
“ He has a verbal contract with a few million of us . ” Ms. Asher said several more delegates are sure to come from the Montana state convention , another Ron Paul
Janet Lee reported from the Washington state convention earlier that the parking lot was swamped with Ron Paul signs and only two were visible for McCain .
The Paulites outdid the McCainiacs on the convention floor with a count of 685 people , where McCain had only 618 , yet the McCain chairman conveniently refused to do a vote count .
Evidence of vote fraud carried out against the Paul campaign continues as Rene Holaday pointed out : I was an elected state delegate for Ron Paul , and was supposed to be put on the ballot for the National Convention .
I sent in my paperwork and my fee to the Washington State Republican Party , but my name was n’t on that list , and neither were many other Ron Paul supporters from my district .
The chairman said they must have been lost , if we did in fact send them .
They told us they would put our names on the list if we had our receipts of mailing and proof of payment with us .
Most of us were blind - sided by that tactic , and of course , we did n’t have those receipts with us , as they were sent in almost two months prior to the event .
So I stood up and asked the chairman if it was the official statement of the Republican Party , that all they had to do to keep Ron Paul delegates from going to the National Convention was to throw away or lose the delegates paperwork ?
And the chairman said , ‘ Yes . ’
I was so shocked I stated , ‘ Are you really sure that is the official statement from the Republican Party — that all you have to do to keep us from going to vote for the president is lose our paperwork prior to the state convention ? ’
Again he said , ‘ Yes , the burden of proof is on the challenger . ’
Of course , no McCain supporters ’ paperwork was lost at all .
So the majority of the Ron Paul people were n’t even listed on that ballot for the vote .
How simple a scam for the McCainers .
Author and talk show host Alan Stang has summed up the choices :
“ The inconceivable , utterly unthinkable fact — as I write I am telling myself it ca n’t be —is that on Tuesday , November 4 , unless God decides
He has had enough and intervenes by giving us Ron Paul , the American people will elect a communist president of the United States . ”
Pat Shannan is an assistant editor at American Free Press .

Those who have visited Chinatown , any Chinatown , will observe statues of a stout fellow carrying a linen sack .
Chinese merchants call him Happy Chinaman or Laughing Buddha .
This Hotei lived in the T’ang Dynasty and he had no desire to gather disciples around him .
Instead , he would carry around the sack filled with gifts of candy , fruit , or doughnuts .
These he would give to the children of the streets who gathered around him in play .
Whenever he met a Zen devotee , he would say , “ Give me one penny . ”
If any asked him to return to the temple to teach others or pray , he would say , “ Give me one penny . ”
Once , as he was about his play - work , another Zen master happened along and inquired , “ What is the significance of Zen ? ”
Hotei slouched and immediately dropped his sack down to the ground in silent answer .
Then , another Zen master asked , “ What is the actualization of Zen ? ”
At once the Happy Chinaman swung the sack over his shoulder and continued on his merry way .

It ’s been decided ; the US economy is crashing … or it is n’t .
The Great Depression is quickly coming upon us … or it ’s not .
We ’ll all soon be poor , out of work , with no money or food … or we wo n’t .
To me , it seems pretty clear what ’s going on , what ’s happening , and what ’s going to happen …
I think it will really matter to all of us and be very painful , or it wo n’t .
Actually , what difference does it make what words the government uses to describe what ’s going on ?
The only thing that matters is what we think and what we do about it .
We can panic and worry all we want ; it wo n’t change anything .
I know , upon reading this next part , most might consider me crazy but I ask you to consider the coming events in a positive light .
Look forward to that which we cannot change .
Of course I do n’t mean to allow yourself to be like a leaf on the ocean being blown every which way by the whim of the wind or currents ; of course you must prepare as best you can .
But once you have made preparations , then look for the positive things .
Things I look forward to is spending more time with my children , not spending money , but thinking of more ways that we can grow closer together in a sort - of “ old fashioned way . ”
Are n’t people always saying that , especially when it comes to family , “ things used to be better . ”
They were .
Long ago , people did n’t have to spend money to bring their families closer together .
Nowadays , people do n’t know what to do with their leisure time if they do n’t spend money .
Why do I need to pack the family up in a car and drive them to Disneyland , spending hundreds , if not thousands of dollars , to be entertained when I can pack a picnic basket and take them to a park and come closer together by entertaining them with reading a book or stories from my youth , conversing , or playing catch ?
What family would n’t this type of activity benefit ?
It would benefit all families both psychologically as well as economically .
And speaking of psychological benefits , I wondered the other day what it would be like to have to walk around all day , go to work ( thankfully still having a job ) , with absolutely no money in my pocket when I left my home ?
Up until recently , I would spend about $ 25 a day on food and at convenience stores .
On July 1st , I stopped .
I did n’t have to .
I just wanted to see what it would be like .
I told my wife to put no money in my wallet everyday .
I could n’t spend money I did n’t have in my pocket .
I would get up 10 minutes early and eat leftovers ; I would buy no coffee at Starbucks ; I would drink tap water at work , then go home to eat leftovers .
If I were fortunate , my wife would have cooked something new by then .
I ’ve done this now for almost one month .
You know what ?
It was n’t so hard .
In fact , when I changed my thinking and began to calculate that the money I saved was going to feed my children , it was easy .
I ’m fortunate ; I still have a job .
But I might not next month .
Why should we wait to prepare for what might be coming when we can get ready now ?
Why should n’t I walk before I am forced to run ?
Since I started this , I ’ve saved about $ 250 dollars .
Not a lot of money , but $ 250 dollars is $ 250 dollars .
One year of doing this will have saved one month ’s of mortgage payments .
Think about that .
Perhaps we have come to live too accustomed to the so - called “ Good Life . ”
When we want something , we buy it .
But do I really need that new gadget or game soft ?
Do I really need to eat lunch out at a restaurant 250 days a year ?
No , I do n’t think so .
Living this way makes me appreciate more the simple things .
In fact , I used to eat dinner out about 350 nights a year .
Now I do n’t .
When I ate out every night , I did n’t look forward to it .
Now , I do .
It has become special again .
Now I look forward to coming up with new ideas and ways that I can spend time with my kids and not spend money .
I feel , in a way , like I live in a Time - Machine and I am taking them back in time to when life was simpler and families actually spent time together and a kid ’s best friend was actually his own dad .
What ’s changed , actually ?
Nothing .
Just my way of thinking changed .
The economy is ruined and things are becoming scarce …
What can I do about it ?
I ’ve prepared as best I can so now I ’m going to pick up the sack , swing it over my shoulder , and continue on my merry way .
Finally , consider this :
Ryokan , a Zen master , lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain .
One evening , a thief visited the hut only to discover that there was nothing to steal .
Ryokan returned and caught him .
“ You may have come a long way to visit me , ” he told the prowler , “ and you should not return empty - handed .
Please take my clothes as a gift . ”
The thief was bewildered .
He took the clothes and slunk away .
Ryokan sat naked , watching the moon .
“ Poor fellow , ” he mused , “ I wish I could give him this beautiful moon . ”

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Researchers using a medical scanner have worked out why a Stradivarius violin sounds so good -- it is because of the remarkably even density of the wood .
A Stradivarius violin known as " The Penny " is displayed at Christie 's auction house in New York March 27 , 2008 .
The 300 - year - old Antonio Stradivari violin named after its previous owner , the pianist and violinist Barbara Penny , will be auctioned on April 4 .

For the past 300 years , musicians and scientists have puzzled over the unparalleled quality of classical Cremonese violins made by Italian masters like Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesu .
Now a Dutch doctor and a violin maker from Arkansas think they have cracked the mystery after comparing five classical and eight modern violins in a computed tomography ( CT ) scanner normally used to examine patients .
Using an adaptation of a computer program developed to calculate lung densities in people with emphysema , they were able to analyze the physical properties of violins without risking damage to instruments worth millions of dollars .
They found no significant differences between the median densities of the modern and the antique violins but did discover far less variation between wood grains of early and late growth in the old ones .
Since differentials in wood density affect vibration and therefore sound quality , the discovery may well explain the superiority of the Cremonese violins , they reported in the online journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday .
So why is the maple and spruce wood in a Stradivarius so different ?
Part of the reason may be that trees grow slightly differently today than in the past .
“ Climate difference could explain part of it but treatment of the wood could be another explanation .
A third answer could simply be the ageing of the wood over the past 300 years , ” Dr Berend Stoel of the Leiden University Medical Center told Reuters .
“ There is no way of knowing from this data ; we ’ve just shown there are density differences . ”
Still , Stoel and U.S. violin maker Terry Borman think the research may help modern instrument makers seeking to replicate the work of the Italian masters .

Federal budget policy is a dry subject with far too many numbers and charts , which makes it uninviting to most Americans .
But the theme of the current budget story is one that could have come from a blockbuster summer movie :
We are doomed .
There is a fiscal asteroid on course to pulverize us , and no one is coming to the rescue .
The problem is simple and depressingly familiar .
This year , federal spending will exceed federal revenue by more than $ 400 billion .
Given the weak state of the economy , the deficit will get worse before it gets better .
Actually , it may never get better , because the current shortfall coincides with the start of the most dreaded fiscal event of all time : the retirement of the baby boomers , who will soon consume eye - popping amounts in Social Security and Medicare .
If that 's not bad enough , Bruce Willis is not on hand to intercept the doomsday object before it arrives .
Worse yet , neither Barack Obama nor John McCain wants the job .
The latest proof came when McCain unveiled his economic plan , in which he vows to eliminate the deficit in four years .
His plan to balance the budget is simple :
He plans to balance the budget .
Exactly which programs he will trim to reach that goal are anyone 's guess .
For someone with a reputation as a fearless foe of congressional earmarks and pork - barrel waste , McCain is amazingly timid in taking on the rest of the budget .
About his only specific proposal is a one - year freeze in those discretionary programs that do n't involve defense or veterans .
McCain does n't say how much that would save , but it would n't be a lot .
Those expenditures amount to only 17 percent of all federal outlays .
Eighty - three percent of the budget would keep on growing .
After a year , so would the other 17 percent .
He vows to follow up with " comprehensive spending controls . "
But promising to control spending in general means promising to control nothing in particular .
Just because voters will go along with a vague limit on total outlays does n't mean they are willing to surrender funds going to them or their favorite causes .
It 's one thing to inform a toddler that he should n't eat too much candy .
It 's another to take the Tootsie Roll Pop out of his hand .
The Republican standard - bearer , however , acts as though the task will be easy .
Among the methods offered in this plan : " Eliminate broken programs .
The federal government itself admits that one in five programs do not perform . "
How about naming one ?
How about promising to pound a stake through its heart ?
When it comes to spending , though , Obama is even worse .
The National Taxpayers Union Foundation added up all the promises made by the two candidates and found that McCain 's would cost taxpayers an extra $ 68 billion a year .
Obama 's add up to $ 344 billion a year .
The Illinois senator 's pledge to get tough on unnecessary expenditures is as solid as cotton candy .
Among his vows is to " slash earmarks to no greater than what they were in 2001 , " but earmarks make up less than 2 percent of the budget .
Trying to restore fiscal discipline by cutting earmarks is like trying to lose weight by adopting an exercise program for your left index finger .
Obama claims he 'll pay for all his new spending with new revenues and spending cuts .
But like McCain , he has been hazy on the details .
And it will be far easier for him to get Congress to approve new spending than to enact the measures needed to pay for it .
Unless Obama is willing to take on his own party with the veto pen , we should expect four more years of irresponsible budgeting .
His only defense is that he would not have to make up as much lost revenue as his rival .
The Tax Policy Center says his tax plan would cut federal receipts by $ 2.7 trillion over the next decade , compared with $ 3.6 trillion for McCain .
The details differ , but the basic picture is the same regardless of who wins : Washington will spend more , red ink will roll down like a mighty river , and we as a nation will continue to dodge the critical choices we face .
It would be nice to think some unexpected event will save us from the consequences of that folly .
But as McCain is fond of saying , it 's always darkest just before it goes totally black .
The deadly 2003 cedar fire was raging through San Diego County .
Rep. Duncan Hunter , whose home in Alpine would burn to the ground , could n’t understand why military aircraft had n’t been called in to fight the blaze .
He decided to do something about it .
Hunter phoned Ray Quintanar , regional aviation chief for the U.S. Forest Service , and demanded that giant C - 130 cargo planes be mobilized to attack the fire with retardant .
Quintanar explained that winds were too high and visibility too poor for aircraft to operate .
Forest Service air tankers had already been grounded .
But , as both men recall the episode , Hunter would not be dissuaded .
He told Quintanar to call “ Mr. Myers ” and rattled off a Washington , D.C. , phone number .
“ Who ’s he ? ” Quintanar asked .

“ He ’s the one with all the stars on his chest standing next to Don Rumsfeld , ” Hunter replied , describing Gen. Richard B. Myers , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
When Quintanar resisted , Hunter called Washington and pleaded his case directly with Myers .
Over the next two days , six C - 130 Hercules transports were dispatched to Southern California from bases in Wyoming , North Carolina and Colorado .
The planes saw action once the weather improved , but in Quintanar ’s view they contributed little to controlling the fire .
Hunter says he has no regrets about his end run around the chain of command .
“ California was on fire , I got ‘em the planes , ” he said in a recent interview .
“ That ’s my job . ”
To professional firefighters , though , it was a prime example of a “ political air show , ” the high - profile use of expensive aircraft to appease elected officials .

Fire commanders say they are often pressured to order planes and helicopters into action on major fires even when the aircraft wo n’t do any good .
Such pressure has resulted in needless and costly air operations , experienced fire managers said in interviews .
The reason for the interference , they say , is that aerial drops of water and retardant make good television .
They ’re a highly visible way for political leaders to show they ’re doing everything possible to quell a wildfire , even if it entails overriding the judgment of incident commanders on the ground .
Firefighters have developed their own vernacular for such spectacles .
They call them “ CNN drops . ”
“ A lot of people do a lot of things for publicity and for politics that do n’t need to be done , ” said Jim Ziobro , fire aviation chief for the Oregon Department of Forestry .
Advertisement
Increased use of aircraft is helping to drive up the cost of fighting wildfires .
The Forest Service spent $ 296 million on aerial firefighting last year , compared with $ 171 million in 2004 .
Aviation costs amount to about one - fifth of the agency ’s fire - suppression spending .
Nearly all of the nation ’s firefighting aircraft are owned and operated by private companies under contract with the government .
The meter starts running when an incident commander calls aircraft to a fire .
It continues whether a plane is in the air dropping retardant or sitting on a remote tarmac , waiting for visibility to improve .
It costs up to $ 14,000 a day to keep an air tanker on call and as much as $ 4,200 per hour to put it in the air .
Heavy - duty helicopters , the workhorses of aerial firefighting , can cost $ 32,000 a day on standby , plus $ 6,300 per hour of flight time .
“ When you deal with aviation on a wildland fire , you have a big bank in the sky that opens up and showers money , ” said Timothy Ingalsbee , a former Forest Service and National Park Service firefighter who has criticized federal firefighting and forest management practices .

Unrealistic expectations
Pressure to use aircraft has grown as wildfires have become larger and more dangerous , and as more subdivisions have sprung up in fire - prone canyons and woodlands .
When a column of smoke appears in the distance , frightened homeowners want dramatic action , and an air tanker pouring red retardant on a blazing ridgeline is undeniably dramatic .
As a result , Americans have become conditioned to think officials are n’t taking a fire seriously until they unleash a ferocious aerial attack .
Advertisement
“ If there ’s a fire and there ’s not an air tanker circling in California , people go , ‘ Oh my God , we ’re defenseless , ’ when in fact we ’re probably not , ” said Scott Vail , a retired Forest Service incident commander .
Aircraft have an important but limited role in firefighting .
In the early stages of a fire , drops of water or retardant can hold the flames in check until ground crews arrive .
Aircraft can also douse fires on ridges or in canyons that firefighters can’t reach .
An all - out aerial attack can save money if it brings a fire under control early .
“ You can make or break a fire in one day with the right amount of aviation , ” said Dennis Hulbert , the Forest Service ’s aviation chief for California .
But it ’s a firefighting axiom that “ aviation does n’t put out a fire . ”
Only crews and engines on the ground can do that .
Advertisement
What ’s more , bulky tankers such as C - 130s -- designed to carry troops , armored vehicles and other equipment -- are not well - suited to operate in California ’s steep canyons and mountains or at the low altitudes required for effective delivery of water and retardant .
The Forest Service and other federal agencies have about 450 firefighting planes and helicopters under contract .
The planes are mainly older single - and multi-engine crop dusters and surplus military craft retrofitted for firefighting .
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has its own air force .
The fleet includes two dozen tankers , 11 heavy - duty helicopters , 14 twin -engine command - and - control planes and a converted DC - 10 jumbo jet on lease .
Cal
Fire spent more than $ 34 million on aviation last year , including $ 7 million for the exclusive use of the DC - 10 .
The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise , Idaho , is supposed to allocate aircraft based purely on professional judgment .
The center , known as NIFC ( pronounced nif- see ) , was created in 1965 to serve as the nation ’s operational nerve center for wildland firefighting .
The idea was to insulate decision - making from political pressure .

In practice , though , politicians still manage to influence when and where planes are deployed .

A resort uses its clout
When a wildfire broke out at the edge of the Sun Valley ski resort near Ketchum , Idaho , last August , locals were dismayed to see no firefighting aircraft overhead .
Advertisement
The planes were busy fighting other fires deemed higher priority by NIFC .
So Sun Valley homeowners and businesspeople began working the phones .
In short order , they had the state ’s most powerful politicians pressing their case .
Gov. C.L. “ Butch ” Otter and U.S. Sen. Michael D. Crapo , both Republicans , called NIFC , the Federal Emergency Management Agency , even the White House .
“ People wanted more aircraft .
Our office did put pressure on NIFC , ” said Crapo ’s press secretary , Lindsay Nothern .
“ The squeaky wheel gets the grease . ”
Other elected officials did their part .
State Sen. Clint Stennett , a Democrat whose district includes Sun Valley , told federal officials that the fire threatened property valued at $ 10 billion .
He did n’t need to remind them that the resort ’s part - time residents include California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , U.S. Sen .
John Kerry , high - powered business executives and movie stars .
Advertisement
“ There ’s a significant amount of political influence in this community , and we do n’t hesitate to use it , ” Stennett said .
The lobbying blitz turned a low - priority fire into a high - priority one .
“ Once the governor started making noise , well , then the aircraft started moving in our direction , ” Jeanne Pincha - Tulley , the Forest Service incident commander on the Sun Valley fire , recalled with a laugh .
“ When you go to the White House like Butch was doing , it ’s got to have some effect .
We started getting stuff .
It was the most beautiful air show you have ever seen in your life . ”
At its peak , the fleet of contract aircraft at Pincha - Tulley ’s disposal included 19 helicopters and several air tankers .
She said she was happy to have the resources and did not consider them excessive .
But for much of the time , the aircraft were grounded by 70 - mph winds .
Advertisement
The fire was brought under control in about three weeks , with no loss of life or property and at a cost estimated at $ 39 million .
Aerial firefighting accounted for about 24 % of the total .
Hulbert , the Forest Service aviation chief and a veteran of California wildfires , nodded in recognition when asked about political meddling .
“ I ’ll say this :
In this region , there are a lot of political and economic pressures .
But you just cannot fly in 20 - to 25 - mph winds and be effective , ” he said .
“ The poor incident commander is stuck in the middle between the cost issue and the political pressure .. . . .
“ I ’ve had a case where I got a call -- I wo n’t tell you who it was -- and I was told to put a helicopter in the air .
I just could n’t do it . ”

Calling in the military
Fire commanders say that politicians are especially keen to mobilize military aircraft when wildfires are burning .
Dale Gardner directed federal firefighting on the 2002 Kraft Complex fire , which charred 48,000 acres of North Dakota prairie .
Gov. John Hoeven dispatched two National Guard helicopters “ that we had no need for , ” Gardner recalled .
There were sufficient ground forces and civilian aircraft to handle the situation , he said .
Advertisement
“ But it was pretty clear he wanted to see those [ helicopters ] working on our fire , ” said Gardner , now retired .
“ We used them .
It was obvious the politics of the situation dictated that we better drop some water with those helicopters . ”
Hoeven ’s office referred a request for comment to the North Dakota National Guard .
Greg Wilz , director of military support operations for the Guard during the fire , said the helicopters were “ partially effective . ”
“ Dropping 150 gallons at a few hundred feet on a fire is literally a drop in the bucket , ” he said , but he added that the helicopters were able to reach parts of the fire that ground crews could not .
Elaine Zieroth , former supervisor of the Apache - Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona , said she felt similar pressure to use military planes when a big blaze broke out in her domain in June 2004 .
Advertisement
Earlier that year , federal officials had grounded private air tankers after a series of accidents , and Arizona politicians arranged for two C - 130s to be stationed in the state as a stop - gap .
Rep. Rick Renzi , a Republican from Flagstaff , issued a news release touting the deployment and his role in arranging it : “ Today , Arizona stands in a stronger , safer position to fight fires and protect our rural communities . ”
When the Three Forks fire erupted in the national forest , Zieroth said , the Forest Service ’s regional office gave her some advice :
Whatever you do , call in the C-130s .
“ The politicians had lobbied to get these military air tankers , ” said Zieroth , who retired last year .
“ We ordered them , but we probably would n’t have if we had n’t been advised it would be a good political move . ”
Advertisement
The tankers were too big and flew too high to make accurate drops of retardant in the forest ’s rough terrain , said Zieroth , who watched the C - 130s in action from another plane .
“ A lot of the retardant just overshot the fire , ” she said .
For every two C -130s dispatched to a fire , a third follows to carry equipment and support personnel .
The military tankers mobilized for this summer ’s California wildfires cost nearly $ 12,000 per hour of flight time , records show .
Much of the cost of such missions is billed to the Forest Service .
During the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County , commanders had civilian tankers available but could n’t use them because of high winds .
Quintanar , a 34 - year veteran of wildland fires , said that was why he resisted Rep .
Hunter ’s demand for military aircraft .
Advertisement
“ The pilots could n’t see ; the windshields were pitted with dirt , ” recalled Quintanar , now retired from the Forest Service .
“ It ’s beyond dangerous . ”
But because of the severity of the fire , which ultimately killed 15 people and destroyed nearly 5,000 structures , pressure to get more aircraft on the scene was intense .
Once the weather eased , the C- 130s dispatched by the Pentagon in response to Hunter ’s lobbying unleashed 154,000 gallons of retardant .
But Quintanar said the drops added little to what civilian aircraft had already accomplished .
“ It was a politician trying to play fireman and thinking the answer was air tankers , ” he said .

Wildfire workhorses
The big money on fires is expended on high - performance helicopters , which fire bosses love for their versatility .
They can often fly when wind or weather ground fixed - wing aircraft .
Commanders use them to ferry personnel and supplies as well as to drop water and retardant .
On a single day of last year ’s Zaca fire in Los Padres National Forest , the use of one Sikorsky S - 64 heavy - lift helicopter cost taxpayers nearly $ 65,000 -- $ 32,760 to keep the machine on standby for 14 hours and $ 6,370 per hour for five hours of flight time , Forest Service records show .
By the end of that week , the bill for the helicopter had reached $ 368,645 .
Dozens of helicopters worked the Zaca during the four months it took to put the fire out .
Advertisement
To rein in aviation costs , Forest Service officials have tried to curb unnecessary use of helicopters .
Internal memos have taken aim at “ heli - mopping ” -- using the aircraft to douse remnants of a fire or to perform chores that ground crews could do more effectively .
The leasing of helicopters is only part of their cost .
Whereas air tankers fly from established bases , helicopters need bases near a fire , which have to be created ad hoc , often in backcountry lacking roads , utilities and water .
Forest Service contracting officers lease land from property owners .
Heavy equipment sometimes has to be brought in to carve roads and clear terrain .
Water trucks are hired to keep dust down .
Pilots , mechanics , fueling crews and other support personnel must be transported to the scene and provided with food , water , supplies and a place to sleep .
A team of emergency medical personnel is required at all times .
Advertisement
During the Zaca fire , the government paid Tower Tech Inc. of Meadow Vista , Calif. , $ 4,700 a day for a portable air traffic control tower and two air traffic specialists .
ICL Performance Products in Ontario operated a mobile retardant mixing station for a base fee of $ 3,345 per day , plus $ 1,000 to $ 4,000 in daily operating charges .
The retardant itself cost an additional $ 2,095 a ton ; water to mix it was delivered by a $ 1,761 - a - day truck .
Such outlays can continue for months on a wildland fire .
One of the busiest companies in aerial firefighting is Aero Union Corp. of Chico .
It flies eight fixed - wing P - 3 Orion tankers under contract with the Forest Service .
The company also produces the pressurized tank system that C -130s use to drop retardant .
Advertisement
Aero Union has been awarded federal fire - suppression contracts totaling at least $ 169 million since 2000 , government records show .
Columbia Helicopters of Aurora , Ore. , secured nearly $ 90 million in fire contracts with the Forest Service over the same period , the records show .
The company ’s heavy - lift helicopters also remove timber from national forests .
Some aviation companies are politically active .
Executives and employees of Columbia , for instance , contributed more than $ 400,000 to federal candidates and election committees in the last 10 years , according to campaign finance records .
In its home state , the company made $ 868,000 in political donations over the same period .
Columbia President Michael A. Fahey said in an e-mail that the contributions “ have never been made to create influence .
. . .
We believe our unrivaled capabilities and exceptional efforts on the fire lines speak entirely for themselves . ”
Advertisement
Aviation contractors , including many smaller companies , look after their interests in Washington through Helicopter Assn. International .
The trade group has reported spending $ 856,000 lobbying Congress over the last 10 years on a variety of issues , including funding for wildland firefighting .

Skirting the rules
Under firefighting protocols , military aircraft are to be sent to a fire only if no civilian planes are available and only if federal or state officials ask for help .
In reality , elected leaders frequently finesse these rules .
Advertisement
Among the most forceful advocates for using military aircraft is Hunter , a former Army Ranger and the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee .
When wildfires swept Southern California last October , Hunter again got on the phone asking for C-130s .
This time , he reached Lt. Gen. Steven Blum , head of the National Guard Bureau , in Washington .
Blum was willing to send the planes , but there was a hitch .
Neither the state of California nor the Forest Service had requested military assistance .
“ I said , ‘ Can you launch the planes ? ’ ” Hunter recalled .
“ He [ Blum ] thought about it for a minute and said , ‘ We ’ll send ‘em out , and we ’ll call it a training mission . ’
We got the planes . ”
Nine C-130s were dispatched from bases around the country -- six to fight the fires and three to carry equipment and 150 support personnel , all of whom were put up in hotels at public expense .
Advertisement
In all , the deployment cost taxpayers $ 5.5 million .
Putting military planes or helicopters in the crowded skies above a fire requires careful coordination between Forest Service and military personnel .
Military aircraft use different radio and navigational systems than civilian planes , and their crews use different terminology to communicate in the air .
To promote safety and efficiency , state officials normally insist that a civilian air manager , sometimes called a spotter , accompany each military helicopter flying on a California fire .
The requirement led to delays in getting military helicopters aloft during last fall ’s wildfires ; at one point , there were n’t enough spotters to go around .
Advertisement
After heated discussions with elected officials , Cal Fire agreed to assign one spotter for every three military helicopters .
Hunter , who makes no secret of his impatience with the Forest Service bureaucracy , has pushed legislation to speed the process for mobilizing military planes during wildfires .
He suggested that fire managers are slow to request military aircraft because they want to give business to private contractors .
Incident commanders say they ’re reluctant for different reasons :
The big military tankers cost a lot and often are n’t effective .
L. Dean Clark was fire management officer at the Chiricahua National Monument in southeast Arizona when the 1994 Rattlesnake fire broke out in the Chiricahua Mountains .
Advertisement
Clark recalled standing with a group of ranchers as they watched C-130s release clouds of retardant high above steep canyons and rugged pine forests .
“ It was a pointless exercise in humidity - raising , ” said Clark , now retired .
“ They could n’t get in close enough to do much good .
The feds needed to be showing the citizens they were doing everything they could to put out the fire .
. . .
It was a laughable example of a waste of federal money . ”
Long before it reached the ground , the retardant had dissipated into a mist .

Text of report by Palestinian newspaper Al - Ayyam on 24 June
[ Commentary by Isa Sa'dallah : " Despite the Fact That the Calm in Gaza Has Entered Its Fifth Day , the Occupation Is Still Refusing to Increase the Number of Sick People Allowed to Leave the Strip for Treatment " ]
Despite the fact that the calm in the Gaza Strip has entered its fifth day , the occupation forces are still refusing to increase the number of sick people allowed to leave for treatment in the hospitals of Israel , the West Bank , and Jerusalem , or those of neighbouring Arab countries .
Dr Mu'awiyah Hasanayn , director - general of the Ambulatory and Emergency Department at the Ministry of Health , said that there has been no increase whatsoever in the number of sick people leaving the Gaza Strip for treatment .
During an interview with Al - Ayyam , Hasanayn also noted that Israel is still insisting on allowing only about 20 patients to cross daily , whereas about 150 were allowed to cross prior to the tightening of the siege a year ago .
He warned of the consequence of Israel continuing to adopt this policy , which led to the deaths of about 200 patients last year .
If Israel continues with the same policy in dealing with sick people , he expects an increase in the number of patients who will die .
Hasanayn said : " The Ministry of Health has not received any indication or promise from the Israeli side that it will increase the number of patients leaving for treatment . "
He also mentioned that the Ambulatory and Emergency Department , as well as the Coordination Department , are making contacts regarding the possibility of helping the medical sector in the various areas .
Patients Need Treatment Abroad
Hasanayn also mentioned that about 650 patients in the Gaza Strip urgently need to travel for treatment and about 1,000 patients need to be re-examined and undergo tests in medical and consultation centres that are not available in the Strip .
He noted that the Ministry of Health insists on allowing ambulances to move patients to the hospitals and medical centres in Israel and the West Bank ; however , since 2004 , Israel has been preventing the entry of ambulances into its territory .
This has made the conditions for patients worse and has sometimes led to their deaths .
He wondered about the usefulness of the calm if it does not fulfil the necessary humanitarian needs .
He called for increasing the number of patients allowed to leave the Strip and cancelling the humiliating and long inspection measures at the crossings .
Hasanayn said : " There is an urgent need for relief workers , physicians and consultants to be able to move between the West Bank , the Gaza Strip , and Israel . "
He confirmed that Israel refuses entry or exit to medical delegations and this leads to the loss of scores of opportunities for these delegations to attend world medical conferences .
With respect to increasing the kinds of medications and medical supplies , Hasanayn noted that the Israeli side had promised to increase their quantity .
He also pointed out that the Israeli side had promised to increase the number of medical teams allowed to reach the areas near the borders ; up to now , only two have been allowed .
Developing the Medical Sector
In the same context , Hasanayn called for rehabilitating and assisting the Ambulatory and Emergency Department , as well as its ambulances that have been damaged as a result of the intensive work they have had to do over the past months when security conditions escalated .
He said that the department would benefit from the calm period in order to carry out more development work .
He noted that this department organized a meeting with representatives of international health organizations for this objective .
It is worth noting that the medical sector was mostly affected as a result of the tight Israeli embargo imposed on the Gaza Strip on the eve of Hamas 's military control of the Strip in June 2007 .
According to statistics issued by the Ministry of Health and the Popular Committee for Lifting the Siege , about 200 patients have died because they were not able to leave the Strip for treatment in hospitals abroad .
Last year , the hospitals in the Strip suffered , and are still suffering , from a great lack of many kinds of medications and medical supplies .
Hospitals also suffer from an excess in employees and from the lack of maintenance work , due to the shortage of necessary materials for maintenance and development work .
Outside the medical referral clinics , there are long queues of citizens who are seeking to obtain the necessary medical referrals abroad .

The People , the Press , & the Case for Impeachment
The People , the Press , and the Case for Impeachment Support for impeachment in the past and on the hearing date .
MSNBC , Zogby House Justice Committee Hears Kucinich Resolution - Part 2
" When our founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence they were not worried about political will , how much time there was , or about any parties ' political future , they were just worried they were going to be hanged by the neck .
But they did what was right .
Now it is your time . "
Elliott Adams , President , Veterans for Peace , testimony July 25 , 2008
The July 25 , 2008 House Committee on the Judiciary hearings focused on the Kucinich resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush .
In his resolution , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) argues that Bush knew that the Iraqis had no weapons of mass destruction , yet claimed that they did in order to justify the March 2003 invasion .
The " fraudulent misrepresentations , " as they 're referred to in the resolution , cost lives , compromised national security , and represented a clear abuse of constitutional power .
The evidence supporting these claims is highly persuasive .
Click for big version
Congressional witnesses review their critique of the president .
Representatives

For the most part , the witness statements from House members and the panel of invited witnesses contain specific justifications for impeachment .
The Kucinich resolution for impeachment , H. Res 1345 , offers a concentrated body of evidence substantiating the charges and demonstrates the main charge in the resolution : the president knew that he was misrepresenting the facts about Iraq at the time he was doing it .
In the resolution , Rep. Kucinich lists corrections for each of the false assertions made by the president to justify the Iraq invasion .
In addition , the resolution provides excerpted evidence and sources to support each correction of the president 's fabricated rationale .
The statements in single quotes in the Kucinich resolution text below are from the president 's justifications for war .
From the resolution :
1. Iraq was not ' continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability . '
2 . Iraq was not ' actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability . '
3 . Iraq was not ' continuing to threaten the national security interests of the United States . '
4 . Iraq did not have the ' willingness to attack , the United States . '
5 . Iraq had no connection with the attacks of 9/11 or with al - Qaida 's role in 9/11 .
6 . Iraq possessed no weapons of mass destruction to transfer to anyone .
7 . Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and therefore had no capability of launching a surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or to provide them to international terrorists who would do so .
8 . There was not a real risk of an ' extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack ' because Iraq had no capability of attacking the United States .
9 . The aforementioned evidence did not ' justify the use of force by the United States to defend itself ' because Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , or have the intention or capability of using the nonexistent WMDs against the United States .
10 .
Since there was no threat posed by Iraq to the United States , the enactment clause of the Senate Joint Resolution 45 was predicated on misstatements to Congress .
H. Res. 1345 ( alternate link )
The facts from that time do n't come close to justifying the use of force .
As demonstrated in the resolution , the president 's case for war was based on " fraudulent representations made to Congress , " the military , and the citizens of the United States .
See the draft of H. Res. 1345 at AfterDowingStreet .
Org for direct links to the primary sources used in the resolution .
The Library of Congress ( THOMAS ) and this alternate site have the official versions of the resolution , modified somewhat from the draft .
This information and more has been known for years to many citizens , particularly those who actively work for the impeachment of Bush and Cheney .
Hundreds of them waited hours to get a seat in the public hearing which accommodated less than twenty of those who had waited in line .
Citizens Share Their Wisdom - 5:00 am Early Responders on Capitol Hill
As it turned out , the earliest arrivals for the hearings were from the key states responsible for the Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution , Virginia and Massachusetts , and the city in which they were developed , debated , and adopted , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Bill Perry and Sam Adams , two of the several representatives from Philadelphia 's Delaware Valley Veterans for America , were on also present just before 5:00 am , as well .
Perry and Adams , Viet Nam veterans had just worked on " A Sea of Tombstones : The Cost of War " mourning the Iraq war dead .
When asked about claims that impeachment might hurt national security , Perry said clearly , " We are national security " and pointed out that the war makes us more rather than less vulnerable as a nation .
Adams was clear on the necessity for impeachment : " We have to do it so the next guy down the road wo n't do the same thing . "

It was the nation 's capitol for a time during the revolution and the building in which both the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were debated .
The Liberty Bell is located nearby .
Rain Burroughs , Mary Genther - Carter , and Chris Dorsey of RVA4 Peace got up very early and drove from Richmond , Virginia to Washington , DC for the impeachment hearings .
They arrived before 5:00 am .
When asked why impeach Bush this late in his term , Dorsey responded , " It 's never too late for accountability . "
Burroughs had a special point to make by attending the hearings .
Along with her seven year old daughter , she 'd been removed from a 2007 Fourth of July celebration by Richmond police for displaying a sign containing the word " Impeach . "
Genther - Carter was just glad to be there even though she needed to be back in Richmond for work in mid afternoon .
David Swanson , another Virginian , also arrived very early .
Swanson has been a constant advocate for White House accountability , impeachment , and an end to the occupation of Iraq .
As the head of AfterDowningStreet .
Org , he provides and hosts much of the key information on the hearings , including videos of the July 25 hearings .
When asked what he'd say to those who said this is too late and a waste of time , Swanson was quick to respond stating that there are " many reasons why that 's absolute nonsense . "
He pointed to the overwhelming proof that the reasons for the Iraq invasion were fabricated , the undeniable admissions concerning FISA violations , and asked , " What 's this second to ? "
Swanson also pointed out that there 's no need for a prolonged impeachment process since the proof is already in place and widely available .
Robert Feuer from Stockbridge , Massachusetts , made a point of arriving early to the impeachment hearing line .
He 's campaigning hard against incumbent Rep. John Oliver ( D - MA ) in the Democratic primary for the Massachusetts 1st congressional district .
A small town lawyer , Feuer is outraged that his representative has ignored the will of the people expressed at town hall meetings across the district .
Oliver , he reports , admits that he 's fully aware that many towns have voted in favor of impeachment by huge margins but refuses to support the effort .
Feuer hopes to replace Oliver and solve at least that problem .
It would have been impossible to keep Stuart Hutchison out of the capitol on the day of the hearings .
He founded North Jersey Impeach Groups , one of the most active impeachment organizations in the country .
He outlined his motivation for impeachment in no uncertain terms :
" The biggest threat to the security of the United States is not Osama bin Laden .
The most severe threat 's not Iran or Musharraf or the Taliban in Afghanistan , and it 's not al - Qaeda .
None of these has the power to defeat the United States , not one can undo American democracy .
The USA does suffer a grave threat to its security , a clear and present danger to the future of every person in our country , and it 's led by Dick Cheney , George Bush , and the gang they put together who overthrew the government of the United States in November 2000 . "
The mainstream media continued to lag far behind everyday citizens by ignoring the big issues while ridiculing those who take the lead in addressing vital concerns .
Class Clown Dana Milbank of the Washington Post
Dana Milbank successfully defended his title as class clown of the Washington press corps in a column that was so divorced from reality one wonders if he even attended or watched the hearings .
He began with this :
" It seems that we are hosting an anger management class , " Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas told his colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee yesterday morning .
" He had a point . "
Washington Post , July 26 , 2008
He continued by endorsing Republican committee member wise cracks and disparaging Chairman John Conyers ' ( D - OH ) handling of the event .
Milbank wrote a 2005 hit piece on Conyers in which he mocked the hearings held by the Michigan Democrat on the Downing Street Memo .
Labeled " Secret and Personal - for UK Eyes , " the July , 2002 secret report by a British foreign policy aid described meetings with Bush - Cheney representatives which included plans for war based on political not security reasons .
" Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy .
"
It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action , even if the timing was not yet decided .
But the case was thin .
Matthew Rycroft , July 23 , 2002 , reported in the London TimesOnline , May 1 , 2005
Milbank failed to note the tens of thousands of deaths and injuries suffered by U.S. soldiers .
He missed the 1.0 million plus dead Iraqi civilians resulting from the civil strife caused by the invasion .
And one wonders if he even knew about the 5.0 million Iraqi children orphaned by the war .
These highly relevant facts were an inconvenience to Milbank who brushed them aside for his humorous approach to the national tragedy enabled by gross violations of the Constitution and a total lack of common decency .
The facts are also more than inconvenient for the paper that supports his tasteless humor , the Washington Post , which has so faithfully supported the aggressive and violent foreign policy .
Maybe Milbank and his editor should read their own poll on the public assessment of their man : " Nearly 6 in 10 -- 58 percent -- said they have doubts about Bush 's honesty , the first time in his presidency that more than half the country has questioned his personal integrity . "
Washington Post , Nov. 4 , 2004
The Paper that thought Judith Miller fit to print - New York Times
The New York Times did n't think that the hearing was worth covering .
A July 27 search of their news database , " newest first , " resulted in nothing for " John Conyers , Jr. " A similar search produced nothing since January 25 , 2008 for " Kucinich . "
It 's not hard to understand why The Times wants to avoid a hearing about " fraudulent representations " by the Bush , Cheney , etc. leading to death , destruction and national bankruptcy .
They were full participants in the national disaster through their relentless barrage of propaganda offered up by their once star reporter , Judith Miller .
At least the Times had the decency to avoid the wildly inappropriate humor and flippant mockery that the Post endorsed from columnist Milbank .
Associated Press - Los Angeles Times
The AP article showed a degree of rationality until the reporter tipped his hand .
After sparse coverage of the panel of distinguished witnesses , their choice for mockery by proxy emerged :
" One witness , law professor Jeremy Rabkin of George Mason University , said he was " astonished at the mood in this room . "
" The tone of these deliberations is slightly demented , " Rabkin said .
" You should all remind yourselves that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were Caligula . "
Associated Press , July 26 , 2008
Did the Associated Press know that law professor and climate change skeptic Rabkin wrote an article called " Gitmo detainees are not ordinary felons " in which he minimizes abuse there and fails to mention extreme punishments and torture ?
We have to wonder if Rabkin ever read this or this about Guantanamo or looked at the photographs from Abu Ghraib .
The AP reporter chose to end the article with academic Rabkin 's implication that supporting impeachment is the equivalent of seeing Bush " as if he were Caligula . "
Most members of a high school debate team would easily note that this statement involves at least two logical fallacies - " poisoning the well " and a " false dilemma . "
In addition , it 's simply wrong .
So much for AP sourcing .
From this review of the New York Times , Washington Post , and the Associated Press , it 's clear that motivated citizens are more informed and generate much better analysis than the press .
The People Know
A clear majority of citizens knew that the war in Iraq was a bad idea from the start .
In mid December 2002 , a majority of Republicans and Democrats opposed an invasion prior to the completion of thorough weapons inspections .
Citizens are clear that Bush is one of the very worst presidents in our history .
They never did and never will abide by the viscous torture administered at the order of the Bush - Cheney zealots .
And they 're not likely to " close this chapter and move on " without a full investigation of the events leading to war and those responsible .
In fact , it 's reasonable to predict that the majority of citizens will be adamant in their demands for answers to the following questions .
How were the White House and many in the top tier of the media able to spread " fraudulent misrepresentations " about Iraq ?
Given the deliberate misrepresentations that justified the war , is n't the president directly responsible for the tens of thousands lost and injured U.S. soldiers and the over 1.0 million Iraqi citizens killed in civil strife ?
What responsibility do his subordinates and the enablers in the media bear for the deaths and injuries ?
How can they justify a $ 3.0 trillion dollars for a war based on lies and who benefited ?
How could the president and his supporters conduct a war against people who supposedly " hate our freedoms " by taking away those freedoms as quickly as possible ?
What motivation was there to remove fundamental constitutional guarantees ?
How do citizens make sure that open hearings take place and that justice follows ?
The July 25 , 2008 congressional was just the beginning .
" The decision before us is whether to demand accountability for one of the gravest injustices imaginable .
" The decision before us is whether Congress will stand up to tell future Presidents that America has seen the last of these injustices , not the first .
" I believe the choice is clear .
" I ask this committee to think , and then to act , in order to enable this Congress to right a very great wrong and to hold accountable those who have misled this Nation . "
The Honorable Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , July 25th , 2008
The citizens of the United States face the same challenge .
Now it 's our turn .
END
Note : Mr. Bugliosi used the figure of 100,000 dead U.S. soldiers and Iraqis .
I use a much higher figure .
Mr. Bugliosi is , no doubt , referring to official death count of the military plus the specific death reporting process operated by Iraq Body Count .
This formalized process is the type of evidence better suited for a court of law .
The 1.0 million plus dead Iraqi civilians comes from two surveys , one by Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the other , a several times updated survey research project by the Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) , a polling firm in Great Britain .
These well executed survey research efforts are best used to understand the actual impact of the war .
The two figures are not contradictory .
They represent different levels of data gathering .

Kurt Hauser is a San Francisco investment economist who , 15 years ago , published fresh and eye - opening data about the federal tax system .
His findings imply that there are draconian constraints on the ability of tax - rate increases to generate fresh revenues .
I think his discovery deserves to be called Hauser 's Law , because it is as central to the economics of taxation as Boyle 's Law is to the physics of gases .
Yet economists and policy makers are barely aware of it .
Like science , economics advances as verifiable patterns are ...
alexis ohanian , the co-founder of reddit is a great guy , a creative visionary and a starter of things .
But most importantly alexis ( or kn0thing as he is known online ) is single - handedly responsible for what modest success I have as an entrepreneur -- and any future success I might have .
He 's second only to my mother in making me possible .
This bold admission was arrived upon after some negotiation with alexis .
His modesty would not allow him to take full credit for my success .
( His modesty is widely acclaimed and demonstrated through his use of all lower - case characters for many proper nouns associated with him -- hence the weird capitalization in the title of this article . )
Back to why alexis is responsible for my success .
alexis and Steve Huffman begat reddit ( this is the first time I 've used the word begat in a sentence -- it feels good ) .
reddit sort of begat OnStartups.com ( my startup blog ) by driving a bunch of traffic in the early days and helping build that crucial initial readership .
OnStartups.com sort of begat HubSpot ( my current marketing software startup ) .
So there you have it .

Former Fannie Mae CEO , Franklin Raines .
This chart records the traumatic property experience of Japan .
A monumental boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s reversed dramatically and house prices fell by 76.4 pc from the peak .
This happened , not in a corrupt , tin - pot dictatorship , dependent on commodities for its sole exports , but in the world 's most sophisticated economy , with the most dynamic financial sector and a history as the world 's pre-eminent innovator .
Could it happen here ?
Will Irish house prices fall back to levels seen in 2000 / 2001 or even to levels seen last century ?
Will our house prices drop by 70 pc before they stabilise ?
These numbers need to be considered because there are plenty of reasons to be fearful .
The similarities between both Ireland and Japan are striking ; the main difference is that the Japanese controlled their own interest rates and thus were able to cut them to soften the blow .
As EU inflation topped 4 pc this week , it looks likely that we will be facing higher not lower rates for the foreseeable future .
Not good .
One similarity is the capacity for self - delusion and failure to face up to the magnitude of our crisis .
It was the same in Japan 20 years ago .
I remember the Japanese mania even reached Irish shores in the grim late 1980s .
When I was in college , a particularly ambitious set of business students who used to wear suits to lectures ( a true sign of recession ) began taking private Japanese lessons .
If you did n't have a grasp of Japanese , or at least a smattering , their view was you might as well quit now and not even bother turning up for final year interviews .
We sat there , petrified , as professor after professor told us about the threat of Japan to our careers ( not that the class of 1988 appeared to have a particularly stellar future ahead of them in the first place ) .
Every airport waiting lounge was stuffed with hardback tomes heralding the rise and rise of Japan and no economics exam was complete without the question : " Explain the fundamental economic reasons behind Japanese world economic domination " .
Japan of the late 1980s was experiencing a huge asset - price boom and stocks were going through the roof , allowing Japanese companies to buy trophy assets abroad such as the Rockefeller Centre and MGM .
Bulging Japanese banks dwarfed their European and US counterparts and threatened to dominate the City and Wall Street .
Most spectacular of all was the Tokyo property market .
In 1990 , the land upon which the imperial palace in Tokyo was built was valued at more than the entire real estate of Canada , the second largest country in the world .
When I read the silly valuations in the ' Irish Times ' property section , particularly the " Take 5 at € 400,000 " section , I am reminded of the Japanese Imperial Palace delusion .
Clearly a two up , two down in Rialto is not worth the same as a seven - bedroomed house in the Dordogne .
Now that prices are falling rapidly , the idea that pokey Irish houses are worth more than French chateaux will look increasingly daft .
The other problem for Ireland is the sheer extremity of the housing boom .
Irish house prices have risen 380 pc since 1996 , compared with 260 pc in the UK -- the next frothiest market .
House prices fell in Germany and of course Japan in the same period .
While in Switzerland -- Europe 's technically most sophisticated economy -- house prices only rose by 5 pc in the 12 years since 1996 .
As a result of this binge , Ireland is the most indebted nation in Europe .
Outstanding residential mortgage debt now amounts to 192 pc of our total GNP !
This is truly shocking and depressing when you consider that in Germany , outstanding mortgage debt only amounts to 3 pc of GNP .
Even in the US -- where many disingenuous Irish commentators are suggesting this crisis originated -- outstanding mortgage debt only accounts for 44 pc of GNP .
We are way out of whack with the rest of the world and our dilemma is very much of our own making .
Think about the chart again .
Have a long look and consider that in the past 10 years residential loans per capita in Ireland increased by 552 pc .
This is miring us in an ocean of debt .
We got into debt five times faster than the average profligate American and , extraordinarily , 50 times faster than the parsimonious Germans .
With our British neighbours , we managed to lose the run of ourselves completely .
In the UK , where billions of Irish euros were spent in the past five years , there is carnage on the high street .
According to the estate agents
Allsops , the real weakness is being seen in the thousands of new docklands - style developments which mushroomed all over British cities .
Many of these investors were Irish and most apartments are now trading at a 30 pc to 40 pc discount to prices originally paid in 2005 .
The British have the comfort of a falling exchange rate determined in London , we on the other hand are stuck to the Germans .
This is why the personal debt comparisons with Germany are so instructive .
The German has no property - related debt to speak of .
This means that the average Gunter does n't really mind if European interest rates rise , as it will make no difference at all to his budget at the end of the month .
In contrast , the average Paddy , who has seen his personal property indebtedness rise by over 500 pc since the late 1990s , will be roasted by a rise in rates .
So will Irish house prices follow the Japanese model and fall by 70 pc from the peak ?
Maybe .
Who knows ?
However , the similarities are too striking to be ignored .
It is clear the Japanese market did n't freeze , as during the slump there were still distressed sellers and opportunistic buyers who thought they had bought at rock bottom , only to see prices fall again .
Overall , however , in the 13 - year slump there was not one period of six months when any sustained rally was recorded .
The lesson being , when things start falling , they drop like a stone .
Take a look at the chart again .
Not a pretty sight .

Since we ’re off on vacation , here ’s a timely reminder to get your finances in order for vacation .
This post originally appeared at My Two Dollars .
Taking time off and traveling is fun , relaxing and sometimes stressful .
Planning ahead and getting your finances in order before you travel will allow you to get the most out of your vacation and leave some of your worries at home .
Here ’s a checklist to guide you through the financial preparations needed before leaving home .
Planning for Vacation
Pay your bills ahead of time .
If you use automatic bill - pay , confirm that all the payments will be sent before the due dates .
Make a checklist of financial needs for your trip .
Hit the ATM for cash , exchange some money into the needed currency if you are traveling abroad , or purchase traveler ’s checks if you plan to use them .
Evaluate time - sensitive purchases .
Eat all the food that will spoil before leaving home to avoid wasting it ( and coming home to the smell of rotted food ) .
Leave a key with someone you trust .
You never know when you might have a financial emergency , and someone may need to get into your house to retrieve information or paperwork .
Do n’t try new financial organization methods .
Now is not the time to try to switch to automatic bill - pay in case something goes wrong .
Save changes for when you are home and have time to follow - up .
Double - check rates .
Confirm your flights , hotels and car rentals .
If prices have gone down re-book or ask for a credit … yes , even some airlines will issue a credit if the rates drop .
Arrange for someone to pick up your mail or have it held .
Do n’t let mail with your personal information sit in your mailbox while you are gone .
Enroll in rewards programs .
Look up the frequent flier programs for your airline and rewards programs for your hotels .
Enroll before you go to get all your points and miles without hassle .
Consider infrequent bills .
Remember to check the due dates for car titles , annual insurance payments , homeowners dues and other bills that you do n’t pay regularly .
Research your destination .
Tripadvisor has a great resource that people can review restaurants , attractions and more .
Use the reviews to find great places at your destination without spending a fortune .
Pay bills for an extra week .
Just in case your vacation is extended unexpectedly , you ’ll want to have your finances in order .
Have fun .
Knowing that you do n’t have to worry about your finances while you are gone will allow you to relax and enjoy your vacation .
Once you get home from vacation , check to see that everything went smoothly and all your bills were paid on time .
If there were any problems , follow up immediately .
Open your mail as soon as possible to check for time - sensitive correspondence .
Since you planned ahead , you should be able to pick right up where you left off before vacation .
Barack Obama is hailed as the tonic for the culture wars , but the Democratic candidate himself seems trapped by the past .

How to dive into another team ’s Django code
I ’m starting to learn my way around another team ’s Django project .
They started from yet another team ’s code base , and extensively modified it over the last ~ 1.5 years .
It ’s code for a large commercial site , which I hope to use to build an even larger commercial site having needs similar to , but different from , theirs .
My immediate goals are to figure out what code changes the new site will require , and some project logistics .
Source pool management will be the trickiest of these — do we share , partially share , use separate pools with periodic merges , or cleave off and stay forever separate ?
I tend to approach design holistically .
But sometimes , like now , I have to force myself to use a different approach in order to get the best results .
Here ’s my approach for jumping head first into another team ’s pool .
Ask a good friend to tell me the obvious .
For this pool reconnoiter and analysis , I should focus on one area at a time , rely on malleable assumptions about unexplored areas , and be content with gradually building a knowledge base .
And so I need to ditch my preferred , “ chew on and digest it all simultaneously , ” approach .
Therefore , the first task is to put my head in an entirely different mode !
For me , what works well is to share my concerns with a good friend , and count on him to remind me of the obvious .
( Think of this as a metaphorical cuff on the head . )
I did this last week , and my wise friend did n’t disappoint .
“ Just break the problem down into smaller parts and then attack each one , ” says the wise friend …
To this , you might say , Well duh !
Yes , I already knew this .
But for some deep emotional reason maybe stemming from never getting enough toys as a child , I needed to hear him say it .
And it worked — my head has switched modes .
( He ’s uttered other pearls of wisdom in the past , like , “ Take a deep breath and back away from the keyboard , ” and , “ You ’re a freak of nature . ”
He has n’t been wrong yet . )
Understand all the settings .py variants .
Settings.py is a Django project ’s master control .
It defines important characteristics about databases , caches , sessions , etc. , which anchor the project ’s execution environment .
So I choose to start my pool exploration here .
“ Understand ” does n’t mean , “ skim . ”
It means I ’ll totally grok what ’s in settings.py , and any dev or test variants thereof .
If I find something I have n’t seen before , I stop and learn it .
By understanding how the team created their development environment , I ’ll understand what I need to do to get their code running on my dev box .
Understand the URL dispatching .
I investigate URL dispatcher files next .
Again , I do n’t glance or skim , but I really understand what ’s going on here .
This will tell me which source pool directories are used , and which can be ignored .
And how syndication feeds are handled .
And the view arguments ’ code conventions , and ( hopefully ) how the code is organized .
In this situation , there ’s original code , modified original code , and superseded code .
The URL dispatching files will map this universe .
If the mapping gets too complicated , I might color - code a source tree listing with a highlighter .
Find and read the model files .
I next figure out where all the active and used ( vs. historical , archive , or oops we neglected to delete that one ) model files live , and read them .
If I do n’t recognize a field type or option , I stop and understand it .
And I scrutinize all the custom manager methods .
If the number of tables is n’t stratospheric , I ’ll make a schema diagram of the project ’s models — DjangoGraphViz is good for this .
Run the project on my laptop .
The last step is to run the project up on my laptop , using their developer settings files , and play with it so I understand the views ’ functionality for the user .
After all of this , I ’ll be ready to think about the changes my project needs , different middleware or contrib packages , source pool management , etc .
How do you learn your way around an alien Django project ?
I ’d like to hear other ways of doing this .
The Federal Reserve moved Monday to overhaul the financial apparatus behind derivatives trading , a regulatory step intended to assure that the failure of a major bank or investment firm would not create the systemic threat seen in March after the collapse of Bear Stearns .
Timothy F. Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of the chief architects of the Bear Stearns bailout , convened a meeting of 17 major financial institutions Monday afternoon to discuss creating a central system for the trading and settlement of credit derivatives , a sophisticated type of financial instrument .
Because no central clearinghouse currently exists for derivatives trading , a default by a major party could lead to cascading losses at big banks and brokerage firms .
Fears about this so - called counterparty risk have rattled nerves on Wall Street amid a worsening credit crisis .
Participants at the meeting , which included every major investment bank , also agreed to register their trades with a computerized system that would allow for nearly instantaneous recording .

A Note About The Cover
The pictures on the cover are significant for two reasons .
Around 1994
I started dating a woman who was a quilter .
Quilting is a traditional American craft in which the quilter takes small scraps of fabric and sews them together into patches , then sews the patches into blocks .
Eventually the blocks are assembled into a quilt top , which is sandwiched with some stuffing to make the complete quilt .
The layers of the sandwich are sewn together , with the stitching forming patterns ; this stitching is the actual quilting .
Quilts are like programs in some ways .
They are built up from smaller bits that work together .
The programs in this book are even more like quilts , because this book is about building programs from prefabricated standard parts and by plugging variations into stock patterns .
There are many traditional designs for quilt blocks , with colorful names like Flying Geese , Corn and Beans , Broken Dishes , Log Cabin , Courthouse Steps , Underground Railroad , Bear Claw , and so on .
But after seeing a lot of quilts and pictures of quilts , it occurred to me that there might be a lot of block designs that nobody used , and that perhaps had never been seen .
I was curious about this , and also I wanted to impress my new girlfriend , so I wrote a suite of Perl programs to generate all the quilt blocks of a certain type : sixteen " half - square triangle " patches arranged into a square with 90 - degree rotational symmetry , and printed out the result :
( I made a mistake in my output ; one block appears twice .
Can you find the duplicate ? )
I was delighted , because the results confirmed my suspicions : there are a lot of excellent but rarely - seen quilt blocks .
The cover of the book shows the development of one of these blocks , starting from the half - square triangle patch , then four such patches joined together , then a complete block with 90 - degree rotational symmetry , and then a larger piece formed by joining four blocks together .
This reminds me of the way the functions in this book take functions as inputs and use them as components in larger and more complicated assemblages .
I was even more delighted when the quilter and I got married .
She made the program output into a real quilt and gave it to me as a wedding present .
There are pictures here .
The other reason that the cover pictures are significant is that since my original goal in writing the programs was to impress my girlfriend , the cover pictures are therefore part of the output of the most successful Perl programs I 've ever written .
I wish all my programs achieved their design goals so spectacularly .

Two new Zogby polls were released today , and they reveal that Obama has a growing lead in North Carolina , but the race is still a virtual tie in Indiana .
Obama has added four points to his lead in NC , and now leads Clinton 51 % - 37 % .
In Indiana Obama still holds a two point lead 45 % - 43 % with 5 % for someone else , and 7 % not sure .
This primary is still polarized by race .
In North Carolina Obama leads among African American voters 79 % - 11 % , but Clinton leads among whites 52%- 37 % .
Early voting began in the state on April 17 , and 30 % of those surveyed said that they had already voted .
Obama leads this group 57 % - 34 % .
Obama leads among men 56 % - 34 % , and women 47 % - 40 % .
His strength among women is with young African American women .
Obama still wins among younger voters and Clinton the older voters .
The key is the group aged 35 - 54 .
Obama leads the middle aged crowd 58 % - 29 % .
North Carolina looks like a solid win for Obama tonight .
Clinton strength among white voters could hold Obama ’s margin of victory under double digits , but a 7 - 9 point sounds about right .
Advertisements
The story is much different in Indiana , where Obama leads among men 47 % - 42 % , but the race is tied at 44 % among women .
Interestingly , in yesterday ’s half of the two day poll that makes up the results Obama led 48% - 40 % with 12 % undecided .
Clinton leads among whites 48%- 40 % , and Obama leads among African Americans 82%- 13 % .
The problem for Obama in Indiana is that only 11 % of the Democratic primary electorate is African American , compared to 32 % in North Carolina .
Obama has a big lead in Indianapolis , but Clinton has a big lead in southern Indiana .
The key part of the state to watch tonight will be the northern tier from Gary to Fort Wayne .
The candidates are essentially tied there , with Clinton holding a two point lead 44 % - 42 % .
This race is a little flipped because Clinton has a small lead among voters aged 25 - 34 , and Obama has a one point lead with voters age 55 - 64 .
There is a very real possibility that the candidates split the delegates in the two contests tonight .
I do n’t think that either gets a blow out .
For perceptions sake both candidates need a sweep , but if either gets it , it wo n’t be by much .
Obama does n’t need big wins .
He can afford to keep on splitting states and inching his way to the nomination .
This is the slow road , but Obama can afford grind Clinton down and run out the clock on this primary season .

The attempt to break the record will begin at 1800 BST .
" There is actually no record for the greatest amount of software downloaded in one day , so for 24 hours from the moment we push the bits live , that 's when the countdown starts , " he said .
Mr Kim said Mozilla had no specific target for the number of downloads it would like to achieve on the day but racking up five million would be " awesome " .
By comparison , Firefox 2.0 registered 1.6 million downloads on the day it was made available on 24 October , 2006 .
More than 1.3 million people have pledged to download the new version on 17 June .
WEB BROWSER STATS Internet Explorer - 83.27 % Firefox - 13.76 % Apple Safari - 2.18 % Opera - 0.55 % Netscape - 0.14 % Source : OneStat
Behind the scenes of Firefox 3.0 New features in Version 3 include automatic warnings when users stray onto webpages booby - trapped with malicious code .
Also in Version 3 will be " Smart Location Bar " that lets people return to places they have visited even if they have not bookmarked them or cannot remember the full web address .
Firefox 3 will work with Windows 2000 , XP and Vista and some non-Windows operating systems including Linux .
Mozilla is not alone in marking the release of the new software .
According to the Mozillaparty website more than 566 celebrations are planned for when the software becomes available .
Market battle Firefox first appeared in early 2004 and since then has steadily eroded Microsoft 's hold on the web browsing world .
Although firm statistics are hard to gather Firefox is currently thought to be used by about 15 - 17 % of web users .
In some territories the percentage of Firefox users is far higher .
For instance , according to market analysis firm OneStat , 27.23 % of German web users browsed the web with Firefox in February 2008 .
Most of the rest ( 67.63 % ) used Internet Explorer ( IE ) .
" Firefox is making very steady encroachment in to the market , " said Adam Vahed , managing director of OneStat UK partner Apache Solutions .
" It 's a very serious contender to the world domination of IE . "
He expected there to be great interest in Firefox 3.0 because most users of the browser tend to upgrade to the latest version as soon as it comes out .
By contrast , he said , many people were still using very old versions of IE .
According to browser stats gathered by Chuck Upsell about 35 % of IE users are on version 7 and 35 % use version 6 .
Mr Vahed said Firefox was generally popular with more " tech - savvy " web users and they turned to it because using it meant more webpages appeared as their designers intended .
" It 's still very much the case that Firefox is way ahead of IE when it comes to standard compliance , " he said .
IE 's lack of compliance with web standards can make some webpages look very odd , he said .
But , he added , IE7 was better at respecting standards and IE8 is expected to go further .
The second test or " beta " version of IE8 is due in August .
The improved standards compliance means that anyone using it might find that pages tailored to work with the quirks of IE7 will now seem broken .

A report from our Berlin correspondent on design and society .
The Post - Materialist has been in London this week , searching — as I like to do , being a serious type who believes the world is entering a serious moment — for signs of ethical seriousness in the young .
Among the work of student designers on display at summer degree shows across the city , I found much to like .
Take , for example , the work of Emma Weber , a student at the London College of Communication .
Emma has made an ethical labeling project combining a bar code sticker that consumers at the supermarket can read with their cellphone cameras , an Ethical Facts Web site and a ratings system which measures , from zero to nine , how the people who made the product are treated , how the product affects the environment and how harmlessly it can be dumped or recycled .
The result is a combined “ ethiscore ” ; the pomegranate smoothie in Emma ’s example got a ethiscore of 24 out of a possible 27 — a rating likely to impart a righteous glow to consumer and producer alike .
Across town at the Royal College of Art , Andrew Stordy has invented a Fair Roaster ; a machine that extends the remit of the coffee machine to include roasting the raw green coffee beans .
“ The Fair Roaster , ” Andrew explains , “ aims to bring the farmer closer to the consumer , thereby cutting out dependency on the middle man ” — namely , multi-national roasting companies .
The result is “ the ultimate fresh cup of coffee ” supplied by small organizations which can offer “ alternative flavors based on the origins of the coffee ” .
You ca n’t save the world with a typeface , but you might be able to improve the aesthetics of the “ Evil Empire ” of meh - standard design , Microsoft .
“ It ’s so incredible that so many people love Comic Sans , ” says Valerio Di Lucente , one of the four creators of the font ’s sibling - rival , Serious Sans .
“ At the same time it ’s one of the typefaces most hated by designers . ”
Struggling to understand what could possibly be good about Comic Sans , Valerio — together with partners Hugo Timm , Filip Tydén and Erwan Lhussier — found that the doggedly goofy font ’s irregular forms made it one of the easiest typefaces for dyslexics to read .
The designers also liked how it undermined the authority — and changed the meaning — of texts set in it .
Serious Sans sees Microsoft ’s silly , inescapable font called to heel and given a shampoo and style .
The designers even made a spoof crest in which the Microsoft dog gets replaced by a “ serious fox . ”
One small step for ethics , perhaps , but a giant leap for aesthetics .

Kucinich : ' We went to war for the oil companies ' Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who has introduced measures to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , said Thursday that oil executives who secretly met with the vice president in 2001 should be held criminally liable for pushing an illegal war .
" In March of 2001 , when the Bush Administration began to have secret meetings with oil company executives from Exxon , Shell and BP , spreading maps of Iraq oil fields before them , the price of oil was $ 23.96 per barrel .
Then there were 63 companies in 30 countries , other than the US , competing for oil contracts with Iraq , " the Ohio Democrat said during a speech on the House floor .
" Today the price of oil is $ 135.59 per barrel , the US Army is occupying Iraq and the first Iraq oil contracts will go , without competitive bidding to , surprise , ( among a very few others ) Exxon , Shell and BP . "
The New York Times reported last week that those companies , Chevron , Total and some smaller companies were set to receive no -bid contracts from Iraq 's Oil Ministry .
According to the paper , such deals " are unusual for the industry , " and the companies prevailed over more than 40 others , including some from Russia , China and India .
In March 2001 , two years before Iraq was invaded , Cheney met with top executives from Exxon Mobil Corp. , Shell Oil Co. , BP America Inc. and others on his infamous secret Energy Task Force .
Kucinich seemed to accuse participants in that meeting of plotting the invasion of Iraq .
There 's no indication that the participants discussed military action , although documents later released showed they did eye Iraq 's oil fields .
The White House convinced the Supreme Court to let it keep secret the proceeding 's of Cheney 's task force , although the Washington Post later revealed most of its activities .
Kucinich accused the US government of forcing Iraq to privatize its oil fields , which are estimated to hold more than 100 billion barrels of oil , and keeping US troops at war to protect the oil reserves .
" Our nation 's soul is stained because we went to war for the oil companies and their profits .
There must be accountability not only with this Administration for its secret meetings and its open illegal warfare but also for the oil company executives who were willing participants in a criminal enterprise of illegal war , the deaths of our soldiers and innocent Iraqis and the extortion of the national resources of Iraq , " he said .
" We have found the weapon of mass destruction in Iraq .
It is oil , " Kucinich continued .
" As long as the oil companies control our government Americans will continue to pay and pay , with our lives , our fortunes our sacred honor . "

The U.S. Army and Colorado National Guard have announced intentions to reserve more than 500 hotel rooms for lodging during the Democratic National Convention , hinting at the number of military personnel that may be in Denver for the high - profile event that is expected to draw an estimated 50,000 protesters .
While the Democratic convention is being held on Aug 25 - 28 , officials with the Colorado National Guard are seeking to reserve 438 rooms for Aug. 22-30 and 78 rooms for Aug. 18-30 according to award announcements published Friday on the Federal Business Opportunities Web site , a page run by the federal government for business contract solicitations .
The documents show that majority of guard personnel staying from Aug. 22-30 are set to lodge at Johnson & Wales University , located on 7150 Montview Blvd in far east Denver , while 32 rooms will be rented out for an unknown Extended Stay America location in Denver .
NOTICE OF INTENT : Due to lack of other known sources the Colorado National Guard intends to award a sole source contract to Johnson & Wales University for 3,510 room nights and 3 meals per day 22 - 30 August 2008 for the Democratic National Convention .
The place of performance will be the Denver Colorado .
The term " room nights " refers to the total number of rooms per -night that are being used during a guest ’s stay , and is calculated by multiplying the number of rooms by the number of nights a guest stays at the property .
Those staying from Aug. 18-30 are set for the Drury Hotels according to the documents , a building that is also located in far east Denver at 4400 Peoria St .
NOTICE OF INTENT : Due to lack of other known sources the Colorado National Guard intends to award a sole source contract to Drury Hotels Denver East for 1,020 room nights from 18 - 30 August 2008 for the Democratic National Convention .
The awards notices show that a total of 4530 room nights are planning to be purchased for the Democratic convention , although the cost is currently unknown .
It was recently reported that at least 900 police officers are expected to come to Denver from Wyoming and 12 other locations around the state to assist with security during the convention , for a cost of $ 25 million in federal tax dollars .
Stayed tuned to the Colorado Independent for more information .

Is reading someone 's genetic code the same thing as practicing medicine ?
That issue has always loomed over the nascent direct - to - consumer genetic - testing industry , which includes such well - known names as 23andme , Navigenics , and DeCodeMe .
It has become very real now that California public - health officials have ordered 13 online companies to immediately stop offering their services in that state .
The companies offer genetic tests that look for DNA mutations associated with a higher risk of developing heart trouble , dementia , or other maladies .
Some critics have said that the science behind some of these tests is relatively new and may be incomplete .
Others say the tests are dangerous because they can identify risk factors for some conditions that have no treatment , such as Alzheimer 's disease .
The California Department of Public Health contends the services violate medical - testing rules that require a physician 's involvement and proof that tests produce a valid medical result .
The real issue , however , may be as much about turf and how society will react to this new technology as patient safety .
Companies offering the tests have made a point of sidestepping doctors , insisting that consumers have a right to know the information coded in their genes .
They also have said that the results they deliver are informational , not diagnostic .
Bypassing traditional medical outlets is an important issue for these companies , since much of the medical establishment has n't yet embraced widespread genetic testing .
Traditional health - care providers tend to be skeptical of the usefulness of the results .
That skepticism would not bode well for a business model that depends on them to be the gatekeepers for ordering these tests .
Requiring a doctor 's approval also seems overly paternalistic to many believers of the Web 2.0 ethos of free access to personal information .
In the past , the state public - health department has laid out five criteria for direct - to - consumer genetic testing companies :
Is there a California licensed physician involved ?
Are tests being authorized by a California licensed physician ?
Does testing include pre- and post - test counseling ?
Are tests being conducted at CLIA Certified [ federally approved ] labs ?
Are the tests validated ?
The answers to these questions vary by company , and some of the questions are being debated as to exactly what they mean .
All three of the biggest providers — 23andme , Navigenics , and DeCodeMe — conduct their tests in labs that have been federally certified , for instance , but do not offer counseling .
One , Navigenics , says it uses doctors to process orders .
The question of what is meant by a " validated " test is also open to debate .
The tests are all " valid " in that they usually provide accurate information about one 's genetic makeup — that is , whether one has a particular base ( adenine , cytosine , guanine , or thymine ) at a particular spot in their genetic code .
But most of the tests have not yet been through rigorous testing with human trials to confirm their accuracy and validity as predictors of risk factors for disease .
California 's move comes several weeks after its health department said it was investigating consumer complaints against online - testing sites .
Karen Nickel , chief of laboratory field services for the California Department of Health , recently told Forbes : " The tests have not been validated for clinical utility and accuracy , and they are scaring a lot of people to death . "
New York State has also written to several online genetic - testing firms warning them they are not in compliance with similar laws in that state .
The companies have suspended operations there as they hold discussions with authorities .
The federal Department of Health and Human Services plans to hold hearings in Washington next month to investigate online genetic testing .
The hearings could lead to federal regulations .
As society sorts through the promise of this technology , doctors , hospitals , and other powerful economic and political stakeholders are likely to join the debate .
Public - health bureaucracies also will continue to weigh in if they feel that these tests are a danger to the public .
Eventually , the stakeholders will come together , as they should , to forge a new mandate .
What exactly this new DNA regime will look like will depend on all parties working together to insure what I believe should be three criteria for genome - wide genetic testing :
Individuals have freedom of access to their personal genetic data .
A system of trials and approvals be implemented that insure the validity of genetic tests and risk factors .
Doctors and other experts have a vital role in the analysis of disease - oriented information and should use it as part of an overall diagnosis for a patient 's health .
Balance is the key here , as in so many debates about markets .
Overregulation can squelch innovation ; under - regulation may lead to commercial abuse , consumer confusion , and distrust of these tests .
Condoleezza Rice was George Bush 's handmaiden for the war in Iraq but she is now emerging as the best hope for avoiding a military conflict between the United States and Iran .
The Secretary of State , who is one of the few people with the President 's ear , has shown the door to Vice - President Dick Cheney 's cabal of war - hungry advisers .
Ms Rice was able to declare yesterday that the administration 's decision to break with past policy proves that there is international unity in opposing Iran 's nuclear programme .
" The point that we 're making is the United States is firmly behind this diplomacy , firmly behind and unified with our allies and hopefully the Iranians will take that message , " Ms Rice said .
Mr Bush 's decision to send the number three in the State Department , William Burns , to attend talks with Iran in Geneva at the weekend caused howls of outrage that were heard all the way from the State Department 's sanctuary of Foggy Bottom to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue .
A parallel initiative to reopen the interest 's section of the American embassy in Tehran , which would be the first return of a diplomatic presence on Iranian territory since 1979 , has also received a cool response from neo-conservatives .

" This is a complete capitulation on the whole idea of suspending enrichment , " said Mr Bush 's former UN envoy , John Bolton .
" Just when the administration has no more U - turns to pull , it does another . "
In public , Ms Rice has been as bellicose as any neo -con when it comes to Iran , calling dialogue with its leaders " pointless " and declaring : " For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons . "
She had been the prime mover behind Mr Bush 's disastrous policy of " preventive wars " and cheerleader of his expansive plans to reorganise the entire Middle East and to " export democracy " .
But with the rumblings of war with Iran growing steadily louder , Ms Rice worked feverishly behind the scenes to stop sparks from flying in the drive by the US and Israel to shut down Iran 's nuclear programme .
The breakthrough , if that is what it turns out to be , that persuaded Mr Bush that it was time to end the 30 - year boycott of high - level diplomatic contacts with Iran , came from the simple act of Ms Rice signing her name to a joint letter offering sweeter terms to Tehran than it had seen before .
The very act of putting her name to a package of incentives presented in Tehran last month persuaded the Iranian authorities that there was movement that would allow them to proclaim victory over the US , while ending their nuclear programme .
When he saw Ms Rice 's signature on the document , Iran 's Foreign Minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , was visibly stunned , according to those present at the meeting .
He formally responded to the offer with a letter addressed to Ms Rice and the EU 's foreign policy envoy , Javier Solana , as well as foreign ministers of the five other countries at the talks .
His letter skirted around the hot - button issue of Iran 's uranium enrichment programme , but it contained an olive branch of an offer to " find common ground through logical and constructive actions " , according to reports .

Hearing of Mr Mottaki 's reaction and then receiving a formal response persuaded Ms Rice that Iran was finally willing to have meaningful talks with the US that could avoid a war .
Before approaching the President with a plan to avoid war in the last six months of his presidency , Ms Rice had to persuade Mr Cheney , chief among those described as the " Vulcans " of his administration .
She made her pitch at a meeting that included Mr Cheney , Stephen Hadley , the national security adviser , Joshua Bolton , the White House Chief of Staff , and Mr Burns , who is heading to Geneva at the weekend to take part in the " one time only deal " .
Iran welcomed the American change of attitude yesterday , but with governments from France to China also welcoming the shift , Tehran also signalled that there was a long way to go before the diplomats break out the champagne .
Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , declared that there are still " clearly defined red lines " , meaning that Iran is insisting that it has the right to peaceful nuclear energy .
This is a position that Israel and the American conservatives still find unacceptable .
Thirty years on from the humiliation of the US embassy hostage crisis in Tehran , the country 's boycott of all high - level direct contact with Iran has achieved little beyond making it impossible for the two sides to learn to trust one another and employ diplomatic skills to avoid conflict .
But there are also doubts about the effectiveness of using sophisticated weaponry against a nuclear programme that is secreted deep underground and in multiple sitesacross Iran .
The US administration was recently advised that it would be folly to expect the regime to fall in Iran if it was attacked .
If anything , a US and Israeli attack would strengthen the rule of the mullahs while causing further tension on the oil market .
From hawk to dove
Condoleezza
Rice may have a bright political future ahead , despite the many roles she has played in the discredited Bush White House .
Her soundbites have often come back to haunt her .
She wilfully distorted the truth while pressing the case for the invasion of Iraq : " We do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . "
No one , she declared , " could have predicted " that al - Qai'da would try to fly planes into buildings before 11 September 2001 ; " I 'm proud of the decision of this administration to overthrow Saddam Hussein , " she said .
And when George Bush asked her about the looming war saying : " Should we do this ? " , Ms Rice replied in a heartbeat " Yes . "
The book Rise of the Vulcans , by James Mann , describes Ms Rice as a major player in the Iraq war , detailing how she served as the White House co-ordinator and as the President 's closest adviser , throughout the entire operation .
Despite this , the future looks bright for the 52 - year - old .
Stopping a war with Iran could even catapult her into the vice - presidency under a John McCain presidency .
“ The secretary wanted to take advantage of the fact that Admiral Mullen would be in the region to reinforce our concern with the Pakistanis about the spike in violence in Afghanistan and to keep the pressure on in the tribal areas , ” Geoff Morrell , the Pentagon press secretary , said in a telephone interview about Admiral Mullen ’s Pakistan stopover .
Capt .
John Kirby , a spokesman for Admiral Mullen , said it was apparent to the admiral that “ the Pakistani leadership is aware of their challenges in the border region , as well as of U.S. military concerns there , and are working to address those challenges . ”
Pakistan , for its part , has complained that American forces have repeatedly hit Pakistani territory , in particular on June 10 , when United States air and artillery strikes killed 11 members of the Pakistani paramilitary force , the Frontier Corps , manning a border post .
General McKiernan did not comment on the June 10 attack since a three - party investigation into the border clash had not yet been concluded , but he was very clear that militants were using their sanctuary in Pakistan to fire across the border and that the NATO and American forces had the right to fire back .
“ We have the ability to protect ourselves , ” he said .
“ The point that I am trying to make is that the border security situation is not good , and that border runs for 2,500 kilometers , ” or about 1,500 miles , he said .
While he expressed optimism that the American - led forces here would prevail and the insurgency would be defeated , “ I look at this problem regionally , the viable outcome in Afghanistan to a large degree is dependent on some outcome in Pakistan with these tribal areas .
That is a problem that is not getting better with time . ”
The base that came under attack in Kunar Province on Sunday lies in one of the most inhospitable mountainous regions where American forces have frequently faced fierce battles with insurgents .
( CNN ) -- Police in Israel are investigating the burning of hundreds of New Testaments in a city near Tel Aviv , an incident that has alarmed advocates of religious freedom .
Investigators plan to review photographs and footage showing " a fairly large " number of New Testaments being torched this month in the city of Or - Yehuda , a police spokesman , Micky Rosenfeld , said Wednesday .
News accounts in Israel have quoted Uzi Aharon , the deputy mayor of Or - Yehuda , as saying he organized students who burned several hundred copies of the New Testament .
The deputy mayor gave interviews to Israeli radio and television stations after word of the incident surfaced about two weeks ago .
Soon he was talking with Russian , Italian and French television stations , " explaining to their highly offended audiences back home how he had not meant for the Bibles to be burned , and trying to undo the damage caused by the news ( and photographs ) of Jews burning New Testaments , " The Jerusalem Post reported .
Aharon told CNN on Wednesday that he collected New Testaments and other " Messianic propaganda " that had been handed out in the city but that he did not plan or organize a burning .
Instead , he said , three teenagers set fire to a pile of New Testaments while he was not present .
Once he learned what was going on , he said , he stopped the burning .
The episode has worried defenders of Israel 's minority population of Messianic Jews , who consider themselves Jewish but believe in the divinity of Jesus , as do Christians .
It also has concerned evangelical Christians in North America , Europe and Asia , who visit Israel by the hundreds of thousands .
Calev Myers , an attorney for Messianic Jews in Israel , told CNN he plans to file a formal complaint Thursday with the national police at the request of the United Christian Council in Israel , an umbrella organization for a few dozen Christian organizations outside Israel .
" I hope the people who are responsible for breaking the law will be indicted and prosecuted , " he said .
About 200 New Testaments were burned , Aharon said , but he saved another 200 .
His goal was to stop attempts to distribute Christian literature in the city , he said .
Myers , however , said he doubts that Messianic Jewish missionaries distributed the New Testaments .
He said it 's not clear how the volumes found their way into homes in Or - Yehuda .
The deputy mayor told CNN he respects the New Testament and would not do what has been done to the Jews in the past -- a reference to Nazi burning of Jewish and other books in the 1930s , and other occasions when Jewish texts , including sacred ones , were burned .
Myers said his complaint will ask the authorities to investigate possible violations of two Israeli laws .
One forbids the destruction or desecration of any religious icon or item that a group holds sacred .
Another bans people from speaking publicly in a way that offends or humiliates a certain religion .
Both laws are meant to prevent people from inciting religious violence , he said .
The burning controversy has unfolded against the backdrop of other instances that Myers cited as examples of discrimination against Messianic Jews in Israel .
About two months ago , the teenage son of a Messianic pastor was severely injured when a package delivered to his home exploded , Myers said .
In addition , several rabbis urged students to boycott further participation in a Bible competition after they learned that one winner -- a high - school student in Israel -- was a Messianic Jew , he said .
Groups such as the Anti-Defamation League have sharply criticized the burning of New Testaments .
" We condemn this heinous act as a violation of the basic Jewish principles and values , " said Rabbi Eric J. Greenburg , director of interfaith policy for the Anti-Defamation League .
" It is essential that we respect the sacred texts of other faiths .
The Jewish people can never forget the tragic burning of sacred Jewish volumes at many points in history . "
" While there may be legitimate concerns of proselytizing , these matters must be addressed through the proper legal channels , " Greenburg said in a statement .
" It is unacceptable and not legitimate to burn someone else 's sacred texts . "

designed this Alice Chess Set inspired by Through the Looking Glass .
When pieces are removed from the board , they become opaque , obscuring them while they 're out of play .
The theme of ' Alice through the Looking Glass ' is the difference between the real world and the world behind the mirror .
In keeping with this theme there is a contrast between the unlit mirrored piece and the clear glass piece .
Each unlit mirrored piece is a smooth and modern shape .
Each lit piece is clear glass , with the negative shape of a traditional , delicate Staunton chess piece enclosed within it .
In the book the White Knight talks about how he thinks better when he is upside down .
In a reference , the White Knights in the set only work when they are placed upside down .
This joke is hidden to all but those who know the background of the chess set
The Chessboard is made out of LightPoints a material manufactured by Schott , which is glass that has LED 's embedded in it ; the pieces are coated with Mirona , a Material that turns transparent when light shines through it .
When the piece is placed on the board it completes the circuit and lights up the LED under it turning it transparent , like magic .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Crude oil prices may fall below $ 100 a barrel in the coming months after the market reached a point that has choked off demand , but gold and grain prices still look firm , commodity analysts said on Tuesday .
" For the first time probably in seven or eight years we 're predicting oil prices will actually go lower .
There 's a possibility ... that the high oil price that we 've seen this year will not be exceeded next year , " Phil Flynn , vice president and energy analyst with Alaron Trading Corp , told a commodities outlook meeting at the Chicago Board of Trade , a CME Group CME.O unit .
“ Look for oil to get down to double digits , back near $ 99 ” a barrel , Flynn said , barring any unforeseen natural disaster like hurricanes that could temporarily affect supply .
NYMEX
December crude oil was down $ 2.52 at $ 123.57 a barrel on Tuesday , down from a record $ 148.60 set on July 11 .
Flynn also forecast that retail gasoline prices could fall more than $ 1 per gallon to about $ 3 and heating oil futures slip to around $ 2.20 a gallon from current levels .
NYMEX
December heating oil was down 8.70 cents at $ 3.6015 on Tuesday , down from its record high July 11 of $ 4.2935 .
Crude oil has been the leader of the commodities sector as investors flocked to oil , metals and grains as a hedge against inflation and the weak economic U.S. outlook .
Commodities have outperformed stocks and bonds over the past year -- with indexes rising to record highs in 2008 .
Despite the weak U.S. economy and mushrooming financial market crises , interest in commodities continues to be rooted in bullish fundamentals : a weak dollar , Asian demand for food and raw materials and a legislated boom in biofuels .
At least in the case of crude oil , however , escalating prices appears to be trimming demand , Flynn said .
“ We could see a disassociation of oil from gold and the grains , ” he said .
“ If you look at the demand side , we are seeing the most significant demand destruction in oil that we ’ve probably seen in the history of oil . ”
The U.S. Transportation Department on Monday reported a steep drop in highway miles driven in May , by a record 3.7 percent .
The 9.6 billion miles less traveled was the biggest drop ever for any May , when traffic usually rises due to the Memorial Day holiday and the beginning of summer vacations .
Flynn also noted that Chinese utilities are exporting oil for the first time in seven years after switching to coal as an energy source to avoid high oil prices .
GRAINS , GOLD SEEN FIRM OVER COMING YEAR
Other analysts speaking at the conference were bullish on grains and gold , all still well above price ranges that , until the last two years , had been the norm for decades .
“ You need to see two things happen for a major top in commodities , ” said David Hightower , analyst and editor of The Hightower Report .
“ A major economic collapse or significant reduction in demand .
So far , especially in the grain markets we have not see that reduction in demand . ”
Hightower forecast that Chicago Board of Trade corn prices would trade in a range of $ 5.50 to $ 8 a bushel over the next year -- double to triple historical averages .
CBOT March 2009 corn was up 12 - 3/4 cents at $ 6.33 - 1/2 on Tuesday , back at levels seen in May before Midwest floods in June spiked the price to a record $ 8.16 by June 27 .
CBOT wheat will likely trade in a range of $ 7.50 to $ 10 and soybeans in a range of $ 13 to $ 16 , Hightower said .
Charles Nedoss , metals analyst with Peak Trading Group / Rosenthal Collins , said he expected gold prices to remain volatile in the coming year and forecast New York gold futures in the $ 850 to $ 1,200 an ounce range .
December COMEX gold was at $ 926.40 , down $ 11.40 on Tuesday .
“ The key drivers here will continue to be crude oil , the U.S. dollar , and any unforeseen geopolitical events , ” Nedoss said .
China just indicated that its reserves reached $ 1808.8 billion at the end of June .
That is obviously a huge sum -- it is $ 126.6 b more than China reported at the end of March .
But the increase in June was surprisingly small -- only $ 11.9 billion .
Moreover , the euro rose in June .
After adjusting for valuation gains , China ’s June reserve growth works out to something like $ 3 billion .
That assumes that about 25 % of China ’s reserves are in euros -- which may be too high .
Still , the increase in China ’s reported reserves in June is very low , both relative to the increase in past months and relative to China ’s still - large trade and current account surplus .
The volatility in China ’s reserve growth this year has been extraordinary .
Reserve growth -- without considering valuation gains - has gone from a high of $ 75 billion in April to a low of $ 12 billion in June .
That is a bigger swing than the dip from close to $ 60 billion in January and February to $ 35 billion in March .
Adjusting for valuation effects ( the dollar value of China ’s euro reserves rises when the euro rises , and vice - versa ) actually makes the swings bigger .
After adjusting for valuation gains and losses , April ’s reserve growth is close to $ 80 billion and June ’s reserve growth is less than $ 5 billion .
Clearly the 100 bp rise in the bank reserve requirement - which may have subtracted $ 36 billion from June ’s reserve growth -- has something to do with the low total in June .
But the reserve requirement also was hiked by 50 bp in April , so the bigger - than - usual increase in the bank reserve requirement in June is not the full explanation .
Either hot money flows fell , or China has found a new way of keeping reserves from appearing on the central banks books .
Adding in the $ 36 billion in foreign exchange that China ’s regulators likely pushed onto the banks in June brings the monthly total up to around $ 40 billion .
The June trade surplus was about $ 20 billion , FDI inflows were a bit below $ 10 billion and interest income on China ’s existing foreign assets were maybe $ 6 billion .
Sum it all up and everything roughly balances , implying modest hot money inflows .
At least if the data that was reported captures the full picture .
It is hard to know .
China has cracked down on hot money inflows .
At the same time , the huge swing in the very rough measure of hot money flows most analysts uses from April to June is a bit suspicious .
More tomorrow .
Update : Michael Pettis gets a slightly higher total for ( adjusted ) June reserve growth than I do : $ 50 billion v $ 40 billion .
He assumes smaller valuation gains than I do , and puts a somewhat higher dollar value on the increase in China ’s reserve requirement than I do .
But I basically agree with his analysis .
And I fully agree with core conclusion of his FT oped with Logan Wright , namely that the large increase in hot money flows to China over the last year poses a major challenge to China ’s central bank , and significant risks to the financial system -- as it is evidence of a highly pro-cyclical monetary and exchange rate policy framework .
The June reserve increase -- whether $ 40 or $ 50 billion , after taking into account valuation changes and the rise in the state banks ’ holdings of foreign exchange ( see Logan Wright ’s comments in the FT ) , brings the total increase in China ’s foreign assets in the first half up to around $ 450 billion .
That is $ 900 billion annualized .
China ’s current account surplus is on track to be around $ 400 billion ( probably a bit less ) ; FDI inflows are on track to be around $ 100 billion ( probably a bit more actually , as the monthly data has tended to understate FDI inflows in the BoP data ) .
That works out to around $ 500 billion .
$ 900 billion in foreign asset growth consequently implies very large additional inflows , even if neither the trade nor FDI balances include any disguised hot money flows .
The pace of foreign asset growth so far in 2008 implies that hot money flows -- which likely were significant in 2007 -- picked up substantially in the first half of 2008 .
We do n’t yet know whether the recent policies China has adopted to control these inflows are working .
The modest June reserve increase suggests that they may be .
But China now has an incentive to disguise its reserve growth to create the perception that these policies are working , and until China fully discloses all of its swaps with the state banks , it is hard to know if reserve growth has really slowed or if China simply is using new ways to move some foreign exchange off the PBoC ’s balance sheet .
Andrew Batson of the Wall Street Journal has this exactly right : the lack of transparency about the management and accounting for China ’s reserves -- and the low quality of China ’s balance of payments data -- creates a lot of room to interpret , and to misinterpret , the Chinese data .
China could do the world a favor by clarifying how exactly foreign exchange is moving around in China -- and by doing the basics , likely disclosing its monthly reserve growth in a timely and predictable way .
China ’s foreign asset growth now matters too much to the rest of the world for it to produce some of the world ’s worst reserves data .
So answer Batson ’s opening question , China both has too many reserves and too few statistics .
One thing is now I think pretty clear : China seems to carry its dollar reserve portfolio at face value , rather than marking its bond portfolio to market .
We know that Japan marks its bond portfolio to market , so falls in US rates tend to push up Japan ’s reserves .
If China does too , its reserves should move in a way that is somewhat correlated with Japan ’s reserves .
China has more bonds , and likely has more long - duration bonds , than Japan .
Yet Japan ’s reserves fell in April and rose in June , while China ’s reserve growth was strong in April and weak in June .
That is circumstantial evidence , I know -- as market moves could be overwhelmed by other changes .
But it is all we have to go on , and it does suggest , at least to me , that falling US long - term rates were not the main explanation for the rise in China ’s reserves in q1 .
I should have a set of detailed charts showing China ’s 2008 foreign asset growth -- or my best estimate of China ’s foreign asset growth -- up in the next day or two .
Stay tuned .
Deforestation threatens the long - term future of the Congo rainforest Plans to use a state - of - the - art camera onboard a satellite to monitor deforestation levels in Africa 's Congo Basin have been unveiled .
The high resolution RALCam3 camera , designed and built by UK scientists , will provide the first detailed view of the area 's rate of forest cover loss .
The project is part of the Congo Basin Forest Fund , a £ 108 m joint - initiative by the UK and Norwegian governments .
The fund aims to curb climate change by preventing deforestation in the region .
Speaking at the launch of the scheme , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " We are pledging to work together to secure the future of one of the world 's last remaining ancient forests .
" Preserving our forests is vital if we are going to reduce global emissions and tackle climate change . "
Ecological hotspot
The Congo rainforest is the second largest in the world , containing more than a quarter of the planet 's remaining tropical rainforest .
The UN warns that two - thirds of the Congo rainforest will be gone by 2040
It is also home to more than 50 m people , and supports an estimated 10,000 plant species , 1,000 types of birds and 400 different kinds of mammals .
A UN study warned that unless action was taken to tackle deforestation in the region , more than 66 % of the rainforest would be lost by 2040 .
The high definition camera will be made by a team at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( RAL ) .
" We 're delighted to be involved in this very important and timely project , " said Nick Waltham , head of RAL's Imaging Systems Division .
" RALCam3 will provide 10 - metre per pixel ground sampling from an orbit of 650 km ( 400 miles ) altitude , " he told BBC News .
" The image [ width ] is 88 km ( 55 miles ) thereby enabling large areas of the terrain to be imaged in one satellite pass . "
Dr Waltham said the system would also have other applications , including surveillance of environmental change and offshore pollution .
The camera is one of the first projects to be supported by the fund , which is headed by former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai .
" The Congo Basin Forest Fund is a joint response to a global problem whereby an innovative and consensual mechanism has been embraced , " Professor Maathai explained .
" It involves various partners committed to preserve and protect one of the most unique ecosystems in the world . "
The fund , which has received an initial £ 58 m ( 73 m euros ) from the UK government and £ 50 m ( 63 m euros ) from the Norweigan goverment , will support anti-logging projects in the region until 2012 .

Think Bush ’s tax cuts reduce taxes for the wealthy ?
How about eliminating them altogether ?
In 2005 , the number of federal tax returns with $ 200,000 or more of adjusted gross income that paid absolutely no federal income taxes at all jumped 161 % compared to the year before .
In addition the number who paid absolutely no income taxes worldwide increased 75 % .
These numbers come from the IRS , and the increase in tax avoidance comes directly from two tax law changes .

The Crisis Is Upon Us
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
I have , for the past 35 years , expressed my grave concern for the future of America .
The course we have taken over the past century has threatened our liberties , security and prosperity .
In spite of these long - held concerns , I have days — growing more frequent all the time — when I ’m convinced the time is now upon us that some Big Events are about to occur .
These fast - approaching events will not go unnoticed .
They will affect all of us .
They will not be limited to just some areas of our country .
The world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed .
Though the world has long suffered from the senselessness of wars that should have been avoided , my greatest fear is that the course on which we find ourselves will bring even greater conflict and economic suffering to the innocent people of the world — unless we quickly change our ways .
America , with her traditions of free markets and property rights , led the way toward great wealth and progress throughout the world as well as at home .
Since we have lost our confidence in the principles of liberty , self - reliance , hard work and frugality , and instead took on empire building , financed through inflation and debt , all this has changed .
This is indeed frightening and an historic event .
The problem we face is not new in history .
Authoritarianism has been around a long time .
For centuries , inflation and debt have been used by tyrants to hold power , promote aggression , and provide bread and circuses for the people .
The notion that a country can afford guns and butter with no significant penalty existed even before the 1960s when it became a popular slogan .
It was then , though , we were told the Vietnam War and the massive expansion of the welfare state were not problems .
The seventies proved that assumption wrong .
Today things are different from even ancient times or the 1970s .
There is something to the argument that we are now a global economy .
The world has more people and is more integrated due to modern technology , communications , and travel .
If modern technology had been used to promote the ideas of liberty , free markets , sound money and trade , it would have ushered in a new golden age — a globalism we could accept .
Instead , the wealth and freedom we now enjoy are shrinking and rest upon a fragile philosophic infrastructure .
It is not unlike the levies and bridges in our own country that our system of war and welfare has caused us to ignore .
I ’m fearful that my concerns have been legitimate and things may even be worse than I first thought .
They are now at our doorstep .
Time is short for making a course correction before this grand experiment in liberty goes into deep hibernation .
There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than any the world has ever experienced .
Instead of using globalism in a positive fashion , it ’s been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians , bureaucrats and central bankers .
Being an unchallenged sole superpower was never accepted by us with a sense of humility and respect .
Our arrogance and aggressiveness have been used to promote a world empire backed by the most powerful army of history .
This type of globalist intervention creates problems for all citizens of the world and fails to contribute to the well - being of the world ’s populations .
Just think how our personal liberties have been trashed here at home in the last decade .
The financial crisis , still in its early stages , is apparent to everyone : gasoline prices over $ 4 a gallon ; skyrocketing education and medical - care costs ; the collapse of the housing bubble ; the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble ; stock markets plunging ; unemployment rising ; massive underemployment ; excessive government debt ; and unmanageable personal debt .
Little doubt exists as to whether we ’ll get stagflation .
The question that will soon be asked is :
When will the stagflation become an inflationary depression ?
There are various reasons that the world economy has been globalized and the problems we face are worldwide .
We cannot understand what we ’re facing without understanding fiat money and the long - developing dollar bubble .
There were several stages .
From the inception of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to 1933 , the Central Bank established itself as the official dollar manager .
By 1933 , Americans could no longer own gold , thus removing restraint on the Federal Reserve to inflate for war and welfare .
By 1945 , further restraints were removed by creating the Bretton - Woods Monetary System making the dollar the reserve currency of the world .
This system lasted up until 1971 .
During the period between 1945 and 1971 , some restraints on the Fed remained in place .
Foreigners , but not Americans , could convert dollars to gold at $ 35 an ounce .
Due to the excessive dollars being created , that system came to an end in 1971 .
It ’s the post Bretton - Woods system that was responsible for globalizing inflation and markets and for generating a gigantic worldwide dollar bubble .
That bubble is now bursting , and we ’re seeing what it ’s like to suffer the consequences of the many previous economic errors .
Ironically in these past 35 years , we have benefited from this very flawed system .
Because the world accepted dollars as if they were gold , we only had to counterfeit more dollars , spend them overseas ( indirectly encouraging our jobs to go overseas as well ) and enjoy unearned prosperity .
Those who took our dollars and gave us goods and services were only too anxious to loan those dollars back to us .
This allowed us to export our inflation and delay the consequences we now are starting to see .
But it was never destined to last , and now we have to pay the piper .
Our huge foreign debt must be paid or liquidated .
Our entitlements are coming due just as the world has become more reluctant to hold dollars .
The consequence of that decision is price inflation in this country — and that ’s what we are witnessing today .
Already price inflation overseas is even higher than here at home as a consequence of foreign central banks ’ willingness to monetize our debt .
Printing dollars over long periods of time may not immediately push prices up — yet in time it always does .
Now we ’re seeing catch - up for past inflating of the monetary supply .
As bad as it is today with $ 4 a gallon gasoline , this is just the beginning .
It ’s a gross distraction to hound away at drill , drill , drill as a solution to the dollar crisis and high gasoline prices .
It ’s okay to let the market increase supplies and drill , but that issue is a gross distraction from the sins of deficits and Federal Reserve monetary shenanigans .
This bubble is different and bigger for another reason .
The central banks of the world secretly collude to centrally plan the world economy .
I ’m convinced that agreements among central banks to monetize  U.S. debt these past 15 years have existed , although secretly and out of the reach of any oversight of anyone — especially the U.S. Congress that does n’t care , or just flat does n’t understand .
As this gift to us comes to an end , our problems worsen .
The central banks and the various governments are very powerful , but eventually the markets overwhelm them when the people who get stuck holding the bag ( of bad dollars ) catch on and spend the dollars into the economy with emotional zeal , thus igniting inflationary fever .
This time — since there are so many dollars and so many countries involved — the Fed has been able to paper over every approaching crisis for the past 15 years , especially with Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , which has allowed the bubble to become history ’s greatest .
The mistakes made with excessive credit at artificially low rates are huge , and the market is demanding a correction .
This involves excessive debt , misdirected investments , over - investments , and all the other problems caused by the government when spending the money they should never have had .
Foreign militarism , welfare handouts and $ 80 trillion entitlement promises are all coming to an end .
We do n’t have the money or the wealth - creating capacity to catch up and care for all the needs that now exist because we rejected the market economy , sound money , self - reliance and the principles of liberty .
Since the correction of all this misallocation of resources is necessary and must come , one can look for some good that may come as this  Big Event unfolds .
There are two choices that people can make .
The one choice that is unavailable to us is to limp along with the status quo and prop up the system with more debt , inflation and lies .
That wo n’t happen .
One of the two choices , and the one chosen so often by government in the past is that of rejecting the principles of liberty and resorting to even bigger and more authoritarian government .
Some argue that giving dictatorial powers to the President , just as we have allowed him to run the American empire , is what we should do .
That ’s the great danger , and in this post - 911 atmosphere , too many Americans are seeking safety over freedom .
We have already lost too many of our personal liberties .
Real fear of economic collapse could prompt central planners to act to such a degree that the New Deal of the 30’s might look like Jefferson ’s Declaration of Independence .
The more the government is allowed to do in taking over and running the economy , the deeper the depression gets and the longer it lasts .
That was the story of the 30s and the early 40s , and the same mistakes are likely to be made again if we do not wake up .
But the good news is that it need not be so bad if we do the right thing .
I saw  Something Big happening in the past 18 months on the campaign trail .
I was encouraged that we are capable of waking up and doing the right thing .
I have literally met thousands of high school and college kids who are quite willing to accept the challenge and responsibility of a free society and reject the cradle - to - grave welfare that is promised them by so many do - good politicians .
If more hear the message of liberty , more will join in this effort .
The failure of our foreign policy , welfare system , and monetary policies and virtually all government solutions are so readily apparent , it does n’t take that much convincing .
But the positive message of how freedom works and why it ’s possible is what is urgently needed .
One of the best parts of accepting self - reliance in a free society is that true personal satisfaction with one ’s own life can be achieved .
This does n’t happen when the government assumes the role of guardian , parent or provider , because it eliminates a sense of pride .
But the real problem is the government can’t provide the safety and economic security that it claims .
The so - called good that government claims it can deliver is always achieved at the expense of someone else ’s freedom .
It ’s a failed system and the young people know it .
Restoring a free society does n’t eliminate the need to get our house in order and to pay for the extravagant spending .
But the pain would not be long - lasting if we did the right things , and best of all the empire would have to end for financial reasons .
Our wars would stop , the attack on civil liberties would cease , and prosperity would return .
The choices are clear : it should n’t be difficult , but the big event now unfolding gives us a great opportunity to reverse the tide and resume the truly great American Revolution started in 1776 .
Opportunity knocks in spite of the urgency and the dangers we face .
Let ’s make  Something Big Is Happening  be the discovery that freedom works and is popular and the big economic and political event we ’re witnessing is a blessing in disguise .

Maxine Waters Backs off of Her Statement About Socializing the Oil Companies
During the last senate hearings with the oil companies Maxine Waters said this , ” This liberal will be all about socializing , uh , uh … would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies . ”
Maxine Waters could not help herself , her true feelings , and the feelings of the left came out .
Just look at the words taking over and running that should be enough to make everyone realize who these people really are and what they believe .
She said her true feelings back then but now she is backing away from them .
Friday her spokesman had this to say about Maxine Waters ’ past comments , “ It was one comment in a long hearing , and it has continued to have a life of its own in the blogosphere , ” he said .
“ It was not her intention to announce a big policy proposal .
It ’s not a developed policy proposal .
It was not an intentional statement . ”
It was not an intentional statement ?
That is n’t exactly a vote against socializing the oil companies but rather an admission that she should n’t have made her true feelings public .
She is who she is and she believes what she believes .
She is a socialist pure and simple and now her spokesman is only saying that she should n’t have said what she did , he did not deny that she believes what she said .
In 2008 , John McCain works hard to convince people he ’s not just like George W. Bush .
In 2005 , John McCain worked hard to convince people of the exact opposite .
Looking over the transcript from the June 19 , 2005 , episode of “ Meet the Press , ” the context of the video is actually slightly worse for McCain .
Tim Russert read off a list of issues on which McCain and Bush appear to disagree and told the senator , “ The fact is you are different than George Bush . ” McCain responded , “ No. No . ”
One could argue , I suppose , that this was in 2005 , and McCain has reinvented himself since then , but then again , looking at his Senate voting record , McCain voted with Bush ’s position 95 % of the time in 2007 and 100 % of the time in 2008 .
McCain gets pretty annoyed when his critics talk about a “ third Bush term , ” but it ’s hard to deny that McCain has already made the argument for us .
He not only shares Bush ’s agenda and platform , but McCain spent years telling national audiences that no one agrees with Bush more than he does .

32 - bit versus 64 - bit operating systems : the 4GB memory limit

Consumers have enjoyed record low memory prices for over nine months now in DDR2 memory .
Over the past six months , even latest 4GB and 8GB kits have been finding new lows .
We 've seen a continued demand for DDR2 , even with all of the DDR3 support that 's been cropping up .
Many Nvidia nForce and all AMD processors are still limited to DDR2 and even the new Intel P45 chipset still supports it , so it does n't look like it will be going away any time soon .
In fact , the P45 chipset only supports 8 GB of DDR3 memory , while DDR2 gets 16GB !
But with the increased availability and decreased price , enthusiasts are faced with a new question : is a 4GB kit or even an 8 GB kit worth the cash splash over a basic 2GB ?
What scenarios warrant the extra memory ?
With the help of memory giant Corsair ( who kindly provided us with a few 2GB and 4GB PC2 - 6400 C5 DHX memory kits ) , we decided to take a range of typical , sometimes intensive real world scenarios to see what makes the difference , and where the common memory footprint now lies .
Despite the P45's ridiculous 16GB support , 4GB DDR2 DIMMs are still very , very expensive ... so we 've limited our scope to four sticks of 2GB ( totaling 8GB ) at most .
As you may or may not know , 32 - bit operating systems are limited to addressing a maximum memory size of 4,294,967,296 bytes , or " 4GB " in more normal terms .
However , this 4GB is shared between all MMIO ( Memory - Mapped Input Output ) devices - this includes graphics cards .
Therefore , that nice , shiny new 512MB graphics card you 've just bought limits your entire system memory use to just 3.5GB .
What about the newest Nvidia GeForce 280 GTX with 1GB of GDDR3 ?
That 'll reduce your system memory to just
In this respect , it means that if you 're a gamer at least and want to upgrade your graphics setup , this will only just continually impede on your overall system memory availability .
64 - bit operating systems on the other hand can address 16,384GB ( or just over 16TB ) of memory , giving significant room for consumer machines to use now and well into the future .
The MMIO system space is still there and addressed in the same way , but the available space is so massive that your graphics memory ( or any other addressable memory ) in no way impacts your main system memory size .
From top to bottom , we used Vista x64 with Service Pack 1 because it provides a uniform base for which to test over .
Vista 32 - bit and probably more appropriately , XP 32 - bit , might still be popular , but the stigma against Vista x64 is no longer true : drivers are readily available and since Service Pack 1 , we 've found it works very well indeed .
In a recent community poll we found half of those questioned already run Vista x64 with SP1 and a good amount of those still running a 32 - bit OS were considering the upgrade sometime soon too .
In this respect , like all our in house testing now - be it motherboard , graphics , heatsink or gaming - Vista x64 SP1 has become the logical standard .
We used a free program from Microsoft called Process Explorer 11.1 to monitor the memory use of three variables : which is the total amount of " address space " allocated to a process but not all this address space is necessarily mapped to either physical memory or pagefile .
represents the exclusive , total amount of physical and paged memory allocated to a particular process .
And finally , is the total amount of exclusively allocated physical memory assigned to a process but it also includes shared data from other processes .
High levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are causing climate change .
We have an idea which we think is able to tackle this issue .
We know that it works in theory – we need to understand how we can make it work in practice .
We are developing this project in an open source way , so that we can draw as widely as possible on the expertise required to transform this idea from concept to reality .

I had a good laugh when my friend Seth Gitell reported in the New York Sun on a campaign by the dean of the obscure Massachusetts School of Law to put George Bush and other top White House officials on trial for war crimes .
Lawrence Velvel , Gitell notes , wrote last month that his model was the Nuremberg trials held after second world war .
Velvel went so far as to say that " we must insist on appropriate punishments , including , if guilt is found , the hangings visited upon top Germans and Japanese . "
Oh , my .
Though I found Velvel 's apparently earnest quest as ridiculous as Gitell did , the idea of holding our leaders accountable for the crimes and constitutional violations of the past seven and a half years is n't ridiculous in the least .
We are less than a decade removed from impeaching a president and nearly relieving him of office because of a lie in a civil deposition about blowjobs .
Yet when congressman Dennis Kucinich recently attempted to impeach Bush over torture , extraordinary rendition and other grotesque constitutional abuses , Kucinich 's embarrassed fellow Democrats could n't kill the measure quickly enough .
Why ?
Top Democrats are so complicit in what has happened since 9/11 that my guess is they dare not travel down that road .
From voting in favor of the war in Iraq to holding the telecommunications companies guiltless for their role in spying on Americans ( Barack Obama infuriated much of his progressive base by voting for immunity ) , the Democrats have often acted more as enablers than as a true opposition party .
From their point of view , no doubt it 's best to move on .
And yet we can't move on .
Everywhere you turn , there are reminders of the demons that have been unleashed in the name of fighting terrorism .
We are less democratic and less free than we were before Bush and Dick Cheney entered office following an election that they demonstrably did not win .
If we do n't come to terms with what happened , there 's little chance of reversing our slide into authoritarianism .
We should n't be too optimistic .
Even when the truth is proclaimed , few are willing to listen .
Not long ago the McClatchy newspapers published a five - part series on what went wrong with American detention policies , mainly at Guantánamo and in Afghanistan .
The massively documented stories revealed horrifying tales of torture and abuse ; of innocent Afghans imprisoned for years because they ran afoul of tribal rivalries the Americans did n't understand ; of ordinary people radicalised and transformed into violent jihadists inside US - run prisons .
Yet because McClatchy is not part of the media elite , its journalism has barely been mentioned by the New York Times , the Washington Post and the television networks .
We find ourselves , nevertheless , at a certain transformational moment where things that had long gone unsaid are now being spoken aloud .
Take , for instance , the ideologically promiscuous war supporter Christopher Hitchens , the British expat who recently underwent waterboarding - voluntarily - and pronounced it to be torture .
Hitchens can't help himself from inveighing against any " lame and diseased attempt to arrive at a moral equivalence between those who defend civilisation and those who exploit its freedoms to hollow it out " .
Still , he concludes by saying he wishes Americans did n't practice torture .
Or consider Vincent Bugliosi's new book , The Prosecution of George W Bush for Murder , which has zoomed up the bestseller lists despite having received virtually no attention from the mainstream media .
Bugliosi , a celebrity lawyer - author with a decent reputation , argues that because Bush misled the country into the war in Iraq , he should be held criminally responsible for the deaths of American soldiers .
Finally , consider that most mild - mannered of liberal pundits , the Times ' Nicholas Kristof , who on Sunday actually called for the formation of a truth commission in the manner of post - apartheid South Africa " to lead a process of soul searching and national cleansing " .
The determinedly bipartisan Kristof , who did read the McClatchy series , writes that both Obama and John McCain should commit themselves to forming such a commission .
For that to make sense , though , you 'd have to ignore such inconvenient facts as McCain 's own ambiguous stands on torture and his demagoguery over the supreme court 's recent decision upholding the habeas corpus rights of those being held at Guantánamo .
Velvel is organising a weekend - long war crimes conference to be held in mid-September at his campus at the Massachusetts School of Law .
The school is located in the beautiful New England town of Andover , home of Phillips Andover Academy , of which Bush is an alumnus .
Shuttle buses will be running from the nearby Wyndham Hotel for those attending from elsewhere .
It promises to be a fun - filled two days of righteous anger , leading to nothing .
But if Bush should n't be hanged by the neck until dead , as the ancient pronouncement would have it , he - and we - nevertheless must be called to account for what we have allowed to happen to our country .
If we do n't , then we are all responsible - if not for what happened , then for what is yet to come .
A few weeks ago we brought you news about the Hyperwall - 2 which was developed by NASA and dubbed the " world 's highest resolution visualization system . "
However , it appears that that title has already fallen to the Hiperspace , or the " Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Space project " developed by UC San Diego .
According to the press release , the display features nearly 287 million pixels of screen resolution - surpassing Hyperwall - 2's record by about 10 % .
It is also about 30 % bigger than the original Hiperspace Wall developed in 2006 at 31.8 feet wide and 7.5 feet tall .
What you see here is not a simple array of LCD displays .
This is NASA 's hyperwall - 2 , the world 's …
The expanded system features " 70 high - resolution Dell 30 " displays , arranged in 14 columns of five displays each .
Each ' tile ' has a resolution of 2,560 by 1,600 pixels — bringing the combined , visible resolution to 35,640 by 8,000 pixels , or more than 286.7 million pixels in all . "
To power this beast , the system utilizes 18 Dell XPS 710/720 computers with Intel quad - core CPUs and dual Nvidia FX5600 GPUs .
All in all we are talking about 100 processor cores and 38 GPUs cranking out 20 teraflops of peak processing power and 10 terabytes of storage ( which increases due to the on and off campus OptIPuter infrastructure ) .
Now , that is a geek orgasm .
Hiperspace is already being used for a wide array of research applications including seismic activity models , climate - change predictions , the structure of the human brain .
The full details are available in the press release below .

UC San Diego Unveils World 's Highest - Resolution Scientific Display System
Calit2 Also Releases New Version of CGLX Cluster Visualization Framework
As the size of complex scientific data sets grows exponentially , so does the need for scientists to explore the data visually and collaboratively in ultra-high resolution environments .
To that end , the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology ( Calit2 ) has unveiled the highest - resolution display system for scientific visualization in the world at the University of California , San Diego .
The Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Space ( HIPerSpace ) features nearly 287 million pixels of screen resolution - more than one active pixel for every U.S. citizen , based on the 2000 Census .
The HIPerSpace is more than 10 percent bigger ( in terms of pixels ) than the second - largest display in the world , constructed recently at the NASA Ames Research Center .
That 256 - million - pixel system , known as the hyperwall - 2 , was developed by the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames , with support from Colfax International .
The expanded display at Calit2 is 30 percent bigger than the first HIPerSpace wall at UCSD , built in 2006 .
That system was moved to a larger location in Atkinson Hall , the Calit2 building at UCSD , where it was expanded by 66 million pixels to take advantage of the new space .
The system was used officially for the first time on June 16 to demonstrate applications for a delegation from the National Geographic Society .
" Amazingly it took our team less than a day to tear down the original wall , relocate and expand it , " said Falko Kuester , principal investigator of the HIPerSpace system .
" The higher resolution display takes us more than half - way to our ultimate goal of building a half - billion - pixel tiled display system to give researchers an unprecedented ability to look broadly at large data sets while also zooming in to the tiniest details . "
Kuester is the Calit2 Professor of Visualization and Virtual Reality , and associate professor in the Jacobs School of Engineering 's departments of Structural Engineering as well as Computer Science and Engineering .
He also leads the Graphics , Visualization and Virtual Reality Lab ( GRAVITY ) , which is developing the HIPerSpace technology .
Calit2's expanded HIPerSpace is an ultra-scale visualization environment developed on a multi-tile paradigm .
The system features 70 high - resolution Dell 30 " displays , arranged in fourteen columns of five displays each .
Each ' tile ' has a resolution of 2,560 by 1,600 pixels - bringing the combined , visible resolution to 35,640 by 8,000 pixels , or more than 286.7 million pixels in all .
" By using larger , high - resolution tiles , we also have minimized the amount of space taken up by the frames , or bezels , of each display , " said Kuester .
" Bezels will eventually disappear , but until then , we can reduce their distraction by keeping the highest possible ratio of screen area to each tile 's bezel . "
Including the pixels hidden behind the bevels of each display , which give the " French door " appearance , the effective total image size is 348 million pixels .
At 31.8 feet wide and 7.5 feet tall ( 9.7 m x 2.3 m ) , the HIPerSpace is already being used by a wide range of research groups at UC San Diego , which want to be able to view their largest data sets while also drilling down to the smallest elements on the same screen .
A team from the Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art , Architecture and Archaeology ( CISA3 ) went to Florence to laser - scan the main hall of the Palazzo Vecchio , and the center 's researchers at Calit2 can now manipulate the computer model , depicting all 2.5 billion data points and explore the space in real time .
Other scientists model the impact of seismic activity on structures , climate - change predictions , the structure of the human brain , to name a few such applications .
In order to run simulations and explore data interactively , the developers of the HIPerSpace have built into the environment a large computer and graphics processing cluster .
The wall is powered by 18 Dell XPS 710/720 computers with Intel quad - core central processing units ( CPUs ) and dual nVIDIA FX5600 graphics processing units ( GPUs ) .
A head node and six streaming nodes complete the hardware pool for a total of 100 processor cores and 38 GPUs .
Thus the HIPerSpace system offers roughly 20 teraflops of peak processing power and 10 terabytes of storage , but its access to computing and storage capacity increases dramatically because the wall is an integral part of the National Science Foundation - funded OptIPuter infrastructure on , and beyond , the UCSD campus , including the so - called " OptIPortal " tiled display systems ( some with as few as four tiles ) that are the primary end - point for scientists using the infrastructure .
" The HIPerSpace is the largest OptIPortal in the world , " said Calit2 Director Larry Smarr , a pioneer of supercomputing applications and principal investigator on the OptIPuter project .
" The wall is connected by high - performance optical networking to the remote OptIPortals worldwide , as well as all of the compute and storage resources in the OptIPuter infrastructure , creating the basis for an OptIPlanet Collaboratory . "
" We have full access to the OptIPuter resources , which drastically increase the CPUs , GPUs and storage at our disposal , " added Kuester .
" Nodes are interconnected via a dedicated gigabit subnet and tied into the OptIPuter fabric with a 10 Gigabits - per- second [ Gbps ] uplink . "
In addition to 10 Gbps connectivity to resources at nine locations on the UCSD campus , including Calit2 and the San Diego Supercomputer Center ( SDSC ) , the OptIPuter provides the HIPerSpace system with up to 2 Gbps in dedicated fiber connectivity with its precursor HIPerWall at Calit2 on the UC Irvine campus ( and its roughly 205 million pixels ) .
As a result , scientists can gather simultaneously in front of the walls in San Diego and Irvine and explore , analyze and collaborate in unison while viewing real - time , rendered graphics of large data sets , video streams and telepresence videoconferencing across nearly half a billion pixels .
HIPerSpace is serving as a visual analytics research space with applications in Earth systems science , chemistry , astrophysics , medicine , forensics , art and archaeology , while enabling fundamental work in computer graphics , visualization , networking , data compression , streaming and human - computer interaction .
In particular , HIPerSpace is a research testbed for visualization frameworks needed for massive resolution digital wallpaper displays of the near future that will leverage bezel - free tiles and provide uninterrupted visual content .
Release of CGLX Version 1.2.1
The most notable of these frameworks is the Cross - Platform Cluster Graphics Library ( CGLX ) , which introduces a new approach to high - performance hardware accelerated visualization on ultra-high - resolution display systems .
It provides a cluster management framework , a development API as well as a selected set of cluster - ready applications .
Coinciding with the launch of the expanded HIPerSpace system , Calit2 today announced the official release of CGLX version 1.2.1 , available for downloading at http://vis.ucsd.edu/~cglx .
" There is no reason why you need to start from scratch every time you want to program an application for a visualization cluster , " said CGLX developer Kai - Uwe Doerr , project scientist in Kuester 's lab .
" CGLX was developed to enable everybody to write real - time graphics applications for visualization clusters .
The framework takes care of networking , event handling , access to hardware - accelerated rendering , and some other things .
Users can focus on writing their applications as if they were writing them for a single desktop . "
With the emergence of OptIPortal technology , ultra - high resolution multi-tile display environments are no longer limited to a few select research facilities with highly specialized research teams supporting them .
As a result , an intuitive yet powerful development framework is needed that supports fundamental research while enabling experts as well as novice users to utilize these systems .
From a high - level view , CGLX creates a distributed , parallel graphics context and manages its state and events transparently - allowing the user to focus on content and context rather than how render nodes and displays are combined to show the final visual .
CGLX enables OpenGL programs , developed for a single workstation , to be executed on a large - scale tiled visualization grid with minimal or no changes to the original code .
The distributed nature of the framework supports and encourages the development of programs to generate visual analytics infrastructures , which enable researchers to collaboratively view , interrogate , correlate and manipulate data in real time with visual resolutions well beyond a single workstation .
Key features of the framework include :
- Cross-platform , hardware - accelerated rendering ( UNIX and Mac OSX support ) ;
- Synchronized , multilayer OpenGL context support ;
- Distributed event management ; and
- Scalable multi-display support .
Applications using CGLX include a real - time viewer for gigapixel images and image collections , video playback , video streaming , and visualization of multi-dimensional models .
The CGLX framework is already used by nearly all 90 megapixel - plus OptIPortals worldwide , and it is available for Linux ( Fedora , RedHat , Suse ) , Rocks Cluster Systems ( bundled in the hiperroll ) , and Mac OSX ( leopard , tiger for ppc and Intel ) .
CGLX is so flexible that it can even be scaled down to run on a commodity laptop .
" With CGLX , " explained Falko Kuester , " researchers can finally focus on solving demanding visualization and data analysis challenges on next - generation visual analytics cyberinfrastructure . "
More than 800,000 frames from the Spitzer Space Telescope were stitched together to make this portrait of dust and stars radiating in the inner Milky Way .
An application developed for the HIPerSpace wall allows Calit2 to display this and other large data sets locally while connecting to remote storage clusters .
Two researchers in Kuester 's lab - Kevin Ponto and So Yamaoka - are developing visual analytics techniques to display gigapixel imagery at interactive ( real - time ) speeds on ultra- high resolution displays , notably the HIPerSpace wall .
In a forthcoming publication , Ponto and Yamaoka demonstrate an application they developed on top of CGLX for use on the HIPerSpace wall .
It uses OptIPuter networking to connect to remote storage clusters hosting target data sets , including the Spitzer Space Telescope Survey ( for which each image of the inner Milky Way is 24,752 by 13,520 pixels ) , and NASA 's Blue Marble visualizations of the Earth at monthly intervals ( 86.4 million x 43.2 million pixels ) .
" These ultra -scale visualization techniques load data adaptively and progressively from network attached storage , requiring only a small local memory footprint on each display node , while avoiding data replication , " explained graduate - student Ponto .
" All data is effectively loaded on demand in accordance with the locally available display resources . "
Added fellow Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. student Yamaoka : " A render node driving a single four - megapixel display , for example , will only fetch the data needed to fill that display at any given point in time .
If the viewing position is updated , the needed data is again fetched , on demand . "
EFF 's Patent Busting Project , continues to march forward , this time with more good news about the petition that EFF , in conjunction with Paul Grewal and James Czaja of Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder , filed last April seeking reexamination of the NeoMedia bar - code lookup patent .
We 're happy to report that the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) recently rejected all ninety - five claims [ 5.3 MB PDF ] of the patent .
The PTO agreed to take another look at the patent last October after EFF filed a petition for ex parte reexamination that called to the PTO 's attention a wealth of prior art that the PTO had not previously considered and that showed that the NeoMedia patent claims were not novel .
After consideration of the prior art EFF submitted , the PTO found that none of the ninety - five claims in the NeoMedia patent should have been allowed .
Now that the PTO has agreed with us that the patent claims were n't novel , NeoMedia is in the difficult position of trying to explain what was so inventive about its ideas , in light of the prior art that EFF highlighted .
Alternatively , NeoMedia can try to amend its claims to narrow them , and argue that the narrower claims were non-obvious , even if the original claims were n't .
( By the way , the PTO 's rejection is merely the latest bad news for the NeoMedia patent .
After the PTO agreed to reexamine the patent , NeoMedia agreed to put on hold its pending litigation against Scanbuy [ PDF ] , in which NeoMedia is alleging of infringement of the bar - code lookup patent , as well as another patent . )

BBC News , Madar village , Yemen
The prints show how dinosaurs behaved , says Dr Wosabi
The village of Madar is perhaps an unlikely setting for a major scientific discovery that has been hailed as a ' new frontier ' for the Middle East .
Tucked away in the heart of rural Yemen , Madar now finds itself in the limelight after a series of dinosaur prints were discovered in the village - the first such discovery on the Arabian Peninsula .
The dinosaur tracks have been lying exposed , above ground , for centuries , but scientists only recently stumbled across them following a tip - off from a local journalist .
Villagers have lived alongside the now famous footprints for generations , but never had any inkling about how important they would turn out to be .
" Before these tracks were named , we believed they were footprints from giant camels , " said Yahir Saleh Arshami , who has dinosaur tracks running right in front of his house .
" But now they tell us they are from dinosaurs - we were extremely surprised .
Luckily I built my house around the footprints so as not to disturb them . "
The prints are located in several different sites dotted around Madar village , and are from both ornithopods - bipedal dinosaurs - as well as sauropods , which walked on four legs and are the largest animals ever to have lived on land .
Ancient beach
At 150 million years old , the tracks are so ancient they were made before the landmasses of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula were separated by the Red Sea .
Mr Arshami thought the prints around his home were made by giant camels Scientists are extremely excited about the discovery .
" These prints are very important in terms of culture and history , but they also allow us to go back in time and trace their history , and find out about the environment at the time , " said Dr Mohammed al - Wosabi , of the University of Sana'a .
Dr Wosabi was the first scientist to view the tracks .
" These prints were made on limestone rock , which is only deposited in shallow marine areas , so we know these dinosaurs were living in a beach - type environment . "
But perhaps more importantly , the prints - some of which are half a metre wide - also offer a glimpse into the dinosaurs ' behaviour , vital information which cannot be gleaned by studying fossils alone .
The footprints capture a specific moment in time , almost like a photograph , and by analysing the spacing of the tracks scientists can tell what the dinosaurs were doing all those millions of years ago - even how quickly they were walking .
" The prints show a herd of eleven dinosaurs walking together , " said Dr Wosabi .
Villagers have been excited to learn about their famous heritage " We can see that the smaller animals were walking quickly to keep up with the bigger dinosaurs , while the bigger ones slowed down their pace so the smaller ones could keep up .
" This is an example of social behaviour we did not know about before . "
Villagers in Madar are both excited and proud to have such an important discovery right on their doorstep .
' Great adventure '
" It is thanks to Dr Wosabi that we know about these footprints - we used to just pass on by them , " said Abdul Aziz , a local councillor in Madar .
" It 's a great adventure to have dinosaur prints here , it feels really great - all this culture and history , and right here in our village as well . "
Many hope the prints will attract more tourists to Madar One of the biggest challenges for scientists who studied the prints was explaining to villagers what dinosaurs looked like .
" We brought picture books to show the villagers , and especially the children , what dinosaurs were , " said Dr Wosabi .
" When they saw the pictures the villagers were surprised - stunned even - because what they thought were camels had changed into dinosaurs .
They were very shocked . "
But villagers have now embraced their famous heritage , and most of Madar 's 3,000 inhabitants have even watched the Hollywood blockbuster , Jurassic Park .
Scientists in Yemen have applied for the prints to be given Unesco status , not only to properly protect them , but also in the hope that the dinosaur tracks might help pull in curious tourists as well .
Madar 's friendly locals are keen for more foreigners to visit the village .
As Mr Arshami , whose home is ringed by dinosaur prints , said : " It 's something good for the country and many people have come to see this site .
For scientists and tourists , it 's very good .
We hope more tourists will come . "

CLR INTERVIEW : Leonard Susskind is the Felix Bloch Professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University .
His new book , The Black Hole Wars , details his battles with Stephen Hawking over the true nature of black holes .
The resulting theory postulates that every object in our world is actually a hologram being projected from the farthest edges of space .
Seriously .
Below is Dr. Susskind ’s interview with the California Literary Review .
The Black Hole War : My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics by Leonard Susskind Little , Brown and Company , 480 pp .
Would you give us an overview of what a black hole is ?
A black hole is what you get if you compress so much mass into a region of space that it collapses , under its own weight , to an infinitely small , dense , point called the “ singularity . ”
Everything that gets too close to the black hole gets sucked in , and squashed beyond recognition .
There is no escape from the singularity , even for a light ray .
Someone falling into a black hole might try to send a message , on a beam of light , to the outside world : “ Help , I ’m being sucked in . ”
But even the light ray gets pulled back to the singularity .
There is a certain radius — a particular distance from the dangerous singularity — that I like to call “ the point - of - no - return . ”
If you accidentally pass the point - of - no - return there is nothing you can do to escape ; you and all your messages will get swept to the singularity and destroyed .
The point - of - no - return is also called the horizon of the black hole .
Passing the horizon seems very innocent while it is happening .
It ’s like being in a rowboat above Niagara Falls .
If you accidentally pass the point where the current is moving faster than you can row , you are doomed .
But there is no sign — DANGER !
POINT OF NO RETURN — to warn you .
Maybe on the river there are signs but not at the horizon of a black hole .
Stephen Hawking once said something about black holes that apparently upset you .
What was it ?
Stephen said that when a bit of information falls into a black hole it is permanently lost to the outside , despite the fact that he also proved that black holes evaporate and eventually disappear .
That claim touched off a crisis in physics , a clash of basic principles like no other since Einstein was young .
The problem that upset me is that the most basic principle of physics — the principle that underpins everything including classical physics , thermodynamics , quantum mechanics , energy conservation , that physicists have believed for hundreds of years — is that information is never truly lost .
It can be scrambled beyond recognition , but it is never completely erased .
Hawking ’s claim was outrageous , but he had very good reasons for it .
So good that it took more than two decades to figure out why he was wrong .
And the question led to a tremendous paradigm shift in the way we think about space , time , matter , and bits of information .
Why was this so important ?
Well it ’s probably not important for curing cancer , or knocking down enemy missiles , or speeding up your computer .
But it is important to the future of physics and cosmology .
The universe is controlled by two fundamental laws : Einstein ’s gravity theory ( the General Theory of Relativity ) and Quantum Mechanics .
Stephen argued very convincingly that the two ( GTR and QM ) were on a collision course .
Gravity and Quantum Mechanics were just plain incompatible .
One or the other would have to give , at least by Hawking ’s logic .
Stephen was wrong , but his astonishing question has changed the history of physics , and there is much more to come .
So , what do you believe happens to matter sucked into a black hole ?
Remember that in a monumental contribution to physics , Hawking showed that black holes evaporate , like puddles of water on a hot day .
It happens very slowly but the black hole does emit particles , and eventually disappears .
The answer is that the evaporation products — the photons and other particles — carry away every bit of information , BUT in an extremely scrambled form .
What we have learned is that black holes are not information - erasers but information - scramblers .
What was the final outcome of your competing theories ?
The short answer is that Stephen was wrong and I was right .
But that is a tremendous oversimplification and I would not like history to see it that way .
Stephen asked an audacious , bold , and very brave question — do black holes erase information ?
Just realizing that there was a question took profound insight .
It was enough to make anyone ’s reputation .
The outcome was a whole new paradigm called the Holographic Principle .
The Holographic Principle says something astonishing and completely beyond intuition .
The world is a kind of hologram : an image projected from a distant mathematical film , far at the edges of the universe .
To understand how we got from black holes to holograms you ’ll have to read my book , but here is a hint .
The horizon of a black hole ( a two dimensional surface like a film ) somehow stores all the information that ever fell into the hole .
Where does biology fit into a theoretical physicist ’s thinking ?
Do the attempts at an elegant “ Theory of Everything ” include life ’s impulse to survive and replicate ?
Physicists do n’t like to think that their science is anything like biology .
Biology is messy , imprecise , and complicated .
Physics is simple , crystal clear , and elegant , or so the argument goes .
But physicists have been hit over the head with some “ ugly ” facts .
There are powerful reasons to believe that the universe may also be a consequence of random mutation .
It sounds crackpot , or at best , like fringe speculation , but by now the idea is very firmly established in the mainstream physics and cosmology literature .
That ’s was what my book “ The Cosmic Landscape ” was all about .
According to String
Theory the tiniest dimensions of space are curled up and twisted into an analog of the Double Helix .
The Double Helix is a frame on which base - pairs can be arranged .
And as you know , the pattern of base pairs determines the properties of a given biological entity .
Microscopic space ( according to String Theory ) is not a Double Helix , but something similar : a Calabi Yau manifold ( do n’t ask ) .
The analog of the base pairs of DNA are called “ fluxes . ”
The details do n’t matter .
What does matter is that there exists an incredibly rich set of possibilities — you can call them blueprints — for the construction of a universe .
And according to modern cosmological theory , the universe is filled with sub-universes of every allowable kind , formed from a process similar to random mutation .
If this is so then the question , “ Why our universe is the way it is ? ” may have an “ anthropic ” component : we live in a very rare environment where the ordinary laws are such that life can exist .
Where else would we live ?
Where else would it be possible to ask the question ?
How about consciousness or awareness ?
Are there any physicists who see consciousness as a distinct but interwoven part of the universe ?
I suppose there are .
My own view is similar to Richard Feynman ’s when he was asked whether the conceptual puzzles of quantum mechanics confused him .
He said that quantum mechanics was so puzzling that he was n’t even sure if there was a puzzle .
There are other questions like that — questions that you ca n’t even imagine what an answer could be like .
“ Why does mathematics work ? ” “ Why does logic work ? ” “ What is the purpose of the universe ? ” “ What is the connection between mind and matter ? ”
As I said , these seem like legitimate questions , but you ca n’t imagine what answers would be like .
My sense is that consciousness is one of those questions .
Incidentally , I do n’t mean to imply that these questions will never get answers ; just right now I do n’t have a clue .
But then again I am not a licensed cognitive scientist .
If I understand it correctly , you ’ve recently written that our universe may just be one of an infinite number of universes , each with unique properties or laws of physics .
Is this where you think our knowledge is headed and if so , do you find that discouraging or encouraging in terms of what we can ultimately know about the universe ?
First of all I am not in the least bit alone in this view , nor am I the originator of it .
It has been around for a long time .
But since I wrote “ The Cosmic Landscape , ” it has practically become the conventional view .
As to whether I find it discouraging or not — no — not at all .
There are people who do , but I think they are victims of their own prejudices and hopes .
The universe is far more interesting and challenging than we imagined .
The next generation of physicists and cosmologists will have the fun and excitement of discovering the right mathematical formulation of a “ multiverse . ”
Finding observational ( astronomical ? ) ways to confirm that we live in such a diverse world is another challenge .
Only the old fogies who thought that physics was almost finished are disappointed .
The only thing that I would find discouraging would be that we run out of questions .
Heard any good theoretical physics jokes lately ?
Yup , and you ’ll find them in my book .

Butler does n't see the Heat as underdogs
" We 're going to do this our way " -- Jimmy Butler embraces the fact that no one picked the Heat to be in the NBA Finals .
Introduction to crime
Ice T : When I got to high school , I started seeing people with things that were beyond their means .
I saw guys in the 12th grade that got cars and you 're looking at everybody asking yourself what was really going on .
Then my boys started to sell weed .
They would buy pounds of home - grown weed , then sell joints for a dollar .
Then my other friend , his sister used to steal the lunch ticket roll from the school and sell the tickets .
She was making a lot of money .
She put us to work .
She said , " You guys sell them and I 'll give you half the money . "
I was like , " This little broad is running an organised crime ring . "
When you get into that you start to hang around with people who take pride in beating the system .
That 's the scary part .
Everyone around you says , " If you ai n't a hustler then you 're not cool . "
You believe stolen money is good , and working money is not .
My friends were doing little corny things like grabbing car stereos , selling fake jewellery .
We 'd go downtown to the jewellery mart and get the fake shit , and they 'd put the " 14 K .
Gold " sticker on it and we'd hustle that .
Then we learned how to run cons with fake diamond rings at the bus station .
You walk up on a guy and tell them you just bought this for your mother and now you 're stuck out of town and can't get home .
We 'd tell them the ring was worth $ 800 and the guy would end up giving you $ 100 for a ring that was worth $ 10 .
The only people that get conned are greedy people .
You never get conned if you 're honest .
I was on a petty game and then I got my girlfriend pregnant coming out of 12th grade and I started to feel a little hint of responsibility .
That 's when I went into the military .
When I came out my friends had elevated their game .
Jewellery stores were the targets .
Playing a jewellery store is all about lifting jewellery without anyone knowing it .
There used to be what we called a pop lock on jewellery cases .
We inserted a modified nailfile called a trim that functioned as a lock pick .
You 'd turn 'em and the locks would pop out , opening the case .
With teams of people and confusion we were able to throw the jewellery store off long enough for somebody to reach over and do the bust .
It 's not like a one - minute lick , you had to plan it .
At the end of this game they 're not even supposed to know their shit is gone .
That was a victory for us .
That was finesse .
There was what was called " bashing " , which is really just walking in with sledgehammers during the day and taking the jewellery store down .
Another basic one is the snatch and grab .
For that they have to put the jewellery in your hands .
They bring it out , and you say , " Can I see this watch ?
Can I compare this one against that one ? "
Some fools will bring all that shit out .
I never been to prison .
I never been caught .
The getaway is more important than the crime .
You have to figure out what you 're going to do with the jewellery before you steal it .
If you 're getting something that 's very expensive , pre-sell it .
Drug dealers want it .
Drug dealers ' girls are the best - they want every fucking thing .
They want minks , they want this , they want that .
The guys selling the drugs , they 've got illegal money , they can't really spend it in stores .
A lot of casing goes on .
I could be in Salt Lake City and find what we call " a lick " - a little store with an old lady that happens to have a lot of shit and no one around .
I saw a lick recently in Vegas .
I looked right at it and I told my wife , " Yo , this could get got , really , really easily . "
I do n't care what you 've done , if crime was ever a part of your life , that part never leaves .
What happened with me was , everybody that I was rolling with started to go to jail .
One of my friends was in the middle of a bank robbery and his friend got killed by the police .
What happens is that eventually those small crimes are n't going to sustain the lifestyle you live .
When you 're young you sell a little weed here and there , you try to get some rims OK .
Now , you move up to Benzs and Ferraris .
You can't sell joints , you gotta sell pounds .
The more the crime escalates the more violence escalates .
I was in as deep as I could get and my friends started to go under .
I 'll never forget , I went on this one lick in the Pacific Palisades with all these cats that I normally would n't fuck with .
It was the most slapstick disastrous shit I ever been on .
We got away , but I was like , " Yo , no .
This is why I never fuck with these guys . "
It gets crazy .
From an artistic perspective , those rappers and artists that got out of the life , have great experiences to share .
I think people can be entertained with other people 's pain .
It 's exciting and fun to listen to , but to live it is something totally different .
Watching the mafia is an exciting thing , but to be in it and to live every day with the potential of somebody blowing your brains out is not as sexy as it sounds .
Nelson George : I remember getting caught shoplifting a comic book , trying to stuff it down my pants .
I was so embarrassed , I really was n't cut out for crime .
I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn during the era when heroin first came in .
I remember when we had junkies on the corner and how that changed the tenor of the neighbourhood .
They would break the elevators and knock the lights out in the stairways .
My mother used to go to night school ; I could n't sleep until she got home .
She 'd have to walk past the junkies by the subway station .
She 'd have to negotiate the elevator or the staircase and it was a nightmare .
We had a lot of gangs , the 70s gangs like the Jolly Stompers and the Savage Skulls .
Once there was a gang kid on a little mini - bike and he fell down in front of my building .
A bunch of the dudes hanging out in front laughed at him .
He went home , came back and shot one of those kids .
That was like a light bulb that told me the world was changing .
My little crew of friends were all sports guys .
We flipped baseball cards , collected comic books and played sports all the time .
Then this stuff started happening .
We used to have conversations about whether or not the gang would try and recruit us and what you would do if they did .
My most frightening adult memory of crime involves the police .
It happened in DC where I was seeing this woman and we were walking out of her house at about 5 or 6 pm .
Six police cars pull up , cops with 9 mms jump out , I 'm grabbed , frisked and thrown in the back of a car .
The girl 's freaking out , I 'm freaking out , and I 'm handcuffed .
There had been a robbery in the neighbourhood maybe a half - hour earlier .
The guy had a black leather jacket on , I had a brown leather jacket on .
The police grabbed me , drove me and another guy they 'd snatched up to a line - up on the sidewalk .
Three people were in the store .
One of them looks at me and nods that I 'm the guy .
Now I 'm fucking freaking out .
But the two other people came out and said I was n't the guy .
Then they apologised and let me go .
I was like : " Wow .
Just one more bad ID and I 'm in jail for the weekend . "
It made me realise how easy it would be to get arrested .
It just ruins your whole self - image : " Well , I 'm a respectable dude , I 'm an adult , I 'm this , I 'm that ... " - no .
In the old days , black kids got snatched up like that all the time .
They still do in South Central and places like that .
People think they are so disconnected from criminal activity and the criminal justice system .
But you can always be just one or two bad IDs away from jail .
If you live in a neighbourhood that has a lot of crime , you may never actually be a victim of crime but the fear of it prevails .
Seeing all these random bits of crime around you can drive you crazy .
The same way we talk about what 's going on in Afghanistan and Iraq with traumatic stress syndrome - a lot of these gang - bangers have the same thing .
I was intimidated at a point earlier this year , because of my involvement in the American Gangster TV show .
I was n't threatened physically , but there was a guy who came looking for me with a bunch of others .
For about a week it was really bad .
I realised how physically I was affected by that fear .
I had to meet with this dude , and I actually had to bring a dude with me and all that drama .
I did n't sleep the night before , I did n't want to make love to my girlfriend .
It worked out in the end , but the fear factor was high .
What if this is your existence for months and years at a time ?
What does that do to you ?
The mental health aspect of that fear is something that is n't explored enough .
A TV show like The Wire taps into it in a really good way , the kind of fear that happens daily with every interaction .
Some of Deadwood gets it .
I dated this white woman from California and when she used to visit me in the city she was blissfully unaware of everything .
I grew up in New York .
I 'm walking down the street at night , my head 's on a swivel looking to see who 's behind me .
Things that were vaguely threatening would happen and she would never even know they occurred .
It amazed me .
When 9/11 happened , part of me said , " Well , now the rest of America knows how most black people have lived . "
The fear that something really bad could fucking happen to you at any time .
Not to minimise the violence , but to say that fear and paranoia are a daily thing in most housing projects in America and have been for ever .
There , it 's also the fear of white authority .
It 's not like , " Oh , I 'm scared today . "
It 's like , " I ca n't keep my food down , " or " I have a burning in my stomach , " or " I ca n't make love to my husband or wife . "
That 's all crime .
Hip - hop and violence
Ice -T : Thank God this music called hip - hop came along , and then rap .
We were pimping , we were in the game , we had girls making money .
Then rap came along and at that time I idolised Iceberg Slim , the style and flair of his conversation .
I took my name from him .
At some point I realised , " This dude is a writer .
So , if I 'm really idolising him I not only gotta live the game , I have to document it . "
That 's when I started to rap .
I did n't really feel I could be a writer , so this was a place where I could talk about " the life " .
What makes my music different from pretty much anybody else 's is that I always try to show both sides of the game .
I tell you about the fun at the beginning but there 's pain in the end .
Anybody who tells you about crime and does n't tell you that there 's pain , they 're full of shit and they 've never been there .
Half of my crew is locked up .
They tell me what 's going on , and I listen .
Sometimes you learn from your mistakes , sometimes through the mistakes of others .
I felt like I was running down this road , this hustling road , where I thought it was going to be roses and money and all that good shit at the end .
I got to the end of the road and I seen there 's a cliff , over the edge of the cliff fires are burning .
Now I 'm running back up yelling at people not to go down that road .
Nelson George :
There is a really weird dynamic with hip - hop culture .
On one hand there 's a feeling that music is so powerful that these guys can create violence .
They 're engaged in a dialogue about it , obviously , but they do n't create it by any means .
On the other hand these guys are all great actors .
Hip - hop music is about a creation of persona .
When you talk about the whole violence thing , the truth is that no matter how criminal - minded you are , or whatever your life was before you started making records , that 's maybe two albums ' worth of stuff .
If you were that big a criminal , and had done all the things that are on the records , you would never get signed because you 'd be in jail .
If you have any success on your first album then your lifestyle changes so radically .
Take 50 Cent , for example - it 's kind of weird to hear him talk about shooting people or beating people up because he lives in a mansion in Connecticut .
He 's got horses and a stable .
He just made $ 60 m - $ 70 m , he 's a big businessman .
So how credible is he as an MC talking about the streets ?
By this point it 's all memory , or it's all other people 's stories .
It 's a very complicated relationship , yet the world believes that rappers are what they say they are .
Al Pacino played two of the greatest gangster figures of the postwar period in Scarface and The Godfather : Tony Montana and Michael Corleone .
Fuck all these rap records , nobody 's more influential in the gangster mentality of this country than Tony Montana and Michael Corleone .
The basic perception of a lot of black people is that white people buy hip - hop to enjoy the violent tales of black people killing each other .
It 's really that simple .
When you hear that 70 % of all rap records are purchased by white kids in the suburbs , that makes people insanely mad .
White people are enjoying this , especially young white people , and we 're allowing them to say things like " nigger " .
They hear it on the record so they feel like they can use it as well .
And then there 's the question : what is this doing to black people ?
When you look at the numbers of people incarcerated , you look at the unemployment numbers , the dropout rate , you can see this downward spiral that has been happening since the 70s .
Rap records have been a phenomenon of this period , so people want to blame it all on the music .
Take LA .
The black population that rioted in Watts in 1965 worked at jobs .
There were factories out in South Central , construction work , manual labour .
A lot of people moved to California after the war because of all these jobs .
That sustained places like South Central , Watts and Compton for years .
As white people moved out , black people moved in .
Since the 70s , the jobs went away , overseas and to Mexico .
So the kinds of jobs that their grandfathers and fathers had just disappeared .
The crime industry and gangs filled that vacuum .
The gang problem in LA - and eventually around the country - was exacerbated by crack .
Gangs got more guns , more weapons ; the amount of money they could make increased .
The stakes got higher and the violence grew .
Gangsta rap , as we know it , comes out of that context .
If you go back to Criminal Minded by BDP - which was really the first crack album - the crack economy , and the mentality fostered by it , was articulated and taken to the next level on record .
You can make a good argument that the first few NWA albums are " ghetto reporting " .
Rappers say the 1992 riots validated them , and I agree .
It validated everything they said about the conditions , and the fear and interplay between the LAPD and the black community .
There are tangible economic conditions that created the world we live in today .
The three strikes thing made incarceration easier .
It put a lot of people in jail quickly , but when they got out it created a deeper criminal class .
Housing juveniles in jail with adults happened frequently .
The music is all about these things .
For people to act like the music exists in a vacuum is bullshit .
Hip - hop continued to evolve up until the 90s .
There were always counter - movements - the political stuff , the bohemian De La Soul thing - and all those threads are still around .
But the gangster thing became the easily marketable formula .
Especially after Tupac and Biggie died .
There are nuances in what Jay - Z does and what 50 Cent does that are different from Tupac and Biggie , but it 's a formula these guys profit from that is easily understandable by the corporations that now run the music .
Somebody told me the other day that 70 % of the rap market is controlled by one entity , Universal Records .
There 's a group thing that happens in any corporation that 's selling culture .
Hollywood does the same movies over and over again .
Hip - hop is the same .
The videos really reflect that .
There are very few countervailing images in the videos in terms of what sexuality is , what success is , what gender roles are , and what materialism is .
So what once could legitimately be called ghetto reporting - Chuck D called it the black CNN - is pale and tired 15 years after the 1992 riots .
That 's why sales are down .
A lot of these same white kids that everyone was so upset about are moving away from hip - hop in big numbers .
They 're not buying those records because they 're not raw ; it 's almost like NWA and PE were rock 'n ' roll figures , rebel figures .
Jay - Z and 50 Cent present themselves as businessmen and always have .
It 's become corporate hip - hop in the way that we used to make fun of corporate rock in the 80s .
One of the reasons hip - hop rose was because it was very masculine in the era of Michael Jackson , Prince , Luther Vandross , Freddie Jackson .
The LL Cool Js of the world provided the answer to a craving for masculinity .
Now these guys are so slick and cleaned up and smoothed out ; they claim to still be street but they 're not .
It was interesting when Jay - Z's new album came out last year , the audience was like : " You 're old and you 're rich . "
The audience that buys those records was n't interested in a middle - aged guy being rich in hip - hop .
Puffy 's album did n't do that well and he 's wearing a suit on his album cover .
The self - satisfaction and glorification of materialism has reached a point that there 's a great exhaustion .
As always with any cultural movement , the success often predicates the decline .
Video games
Ice - T : I love them .
The best one is Grand Theft Auto , which is just fucking mayhem .
I'm in the Scarface game , which teaches you how to sell drugs , and I was in Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
I played a cracked - out rap star who had his lyrics stolen and the person that stole them became a star .
So I went on crack and by the end of the game I get my reputation and my mansion back .
You start off as a kid in South Central LA , you build up your rep and then you get a gang .
It 's definitely some crazy shit .
The Vice City games are the worst shit ever - in a good way .
It 's so intentionally wrong that you 've got to get into it .
You go , " Oh my God , if I 'm out of money I just rob a liquor store . "
Inside this world , all the things that you think about , you can do .
Does that make you want to do it in real life ?
No .
To me it diffuses it .
People say video games make kids violent .
I do n't think so .
It can be an outlet for that aggression .
It 's a masculine thing .
Human beings have some weird blood lust , it roots back to us being animals .
It 's ill , though .
Nelson George : Video games are more important than hip -hop .
There 's no doubt about it .
The violence and nihilism that everyone thinks is in hip - hop is pumped up about 18 times in video games .
That 's really what 's driving young male culture , that 's really the new rock 'n'roll .
The funny thing about this debate is so many hip - hop critics are fixated on rap and not talking enough about video games , which are n't a racially determinant form .
Obviously those Grand Theft Auto guys were very canny because they tied in to Scarface , they tied in to hip - hop .
I mean , Def Jam has a line of video games .
Hip - hop became subsumed into the games .
But the games are different - they 're not folk statements .
Hip - hop was a folk music up until the late 80s ; I mean , it was music made by people for people .
Even Run-DMC , you know , three million records was big for rap but it was n't big on an international level at the time .
There were little labels pushing it .
In the 90s bigger companies started getting in there and it began to change .
I would say Interscope and what they did with Snoop , Tupac and Dr Dre really took it to a new level .
With video games the relationship to the culture is different , they 're much more like movies .
They 're a really interesting hybrid .
The Grand Theft Auto dudes were all about figuring out how to tap into urban culture .
Video games , like movies , take in so many disciplines .
At the same time , it 's not a folk expression - at least , the way I understand it - of an individual .

“ So , what changed ? ”
It was simple really : I realized that the majority of the successful people I knew relied on paper .
PAPER !
Not the latest iPhone .
Not the latest GTD tool .
Not the latest whatchamacallit .
Just plain old paper .
“ What ’s the big deal with paper ? ”
First , go pick up a copy of Todoodlist and you will quickly see what I mean .
It ’s an easy read , you ’ll get a few good chuckles and it includes a number of practical tips that I was able to use immediately .
( One of the best things about it is the 30 day refund policy – so you have absolutely no excuse not to buy it .
Just return if you really do n’t get anything out of it . )
As I ’ve said before , learning just one new idea from a book is the best way to spend $ 20 today .
“ What system do you use ? ”
Here are my tools of choice :
That ’s it – three simple things that wo n’t go out of style tomorrow , wo n’t break the bank and never , ever need to be charged up .
I was sitting here peacefully , weeping , when I received the strangest email from Tyrone :
Tyler , cheer up !
The decline in housing prices is a godsend .
Is n’t it a standard line — from both left and right — that we are spending too much on the elderly and not enough on the young ?
Is n’t lack of upward mobility , for the generation on its way into the world , the new problem ?
Are n’t the American poor to expect an even greater squeeze in the future ?
There ’s a simple remedy for all of these problems at once — lower housing prices !
Lower stock prices too !
You do n’t even have to get a bill passed through Congress , or overcome AARP , and we all know how hard that is these days .
The housing stock is still there , the relatively established homeowners are a bit poorer , and those poor strugglers on the way up can now buy their dreams at lower prices .
Even better , lots of the laid - off construction workers are Mexican immigrants , who for years have been keeping wages down for low - skilled American workers .
This is an economic nationalist ’s wish list , no ?
SUV drivers made to park at the back of the store like black people on buses
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Wednesday , July 16 , 2008
Government fueled alarmism about global warming – which has not occurred in the last 10 years nor will it occur in the next 10 years – is accelerating the creation of new forms of malthusian control over our lives , with the ultimate goal of identifying those who do n’t submit to the whims of the climate cult as second class citizens and enforcing a new manifestation of 1950 ’s style segregation .
The image at the top of this story is from an Office Depot outlet in Austin , Texas .
People who drive those evil life - giving gas , plant food spewing , SUV’s are forced to park further away from the entrance to the store as a kind of collective societal punishment for not conforming to the green agenda .
Gas guzzlers have to park around the back – sort of like black people had to sit at the rear of buses during segregation .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The signs going up coincide with an increase in incidents of attacks and tire slashings on SUV ’s by a militant group of morons , not too dissimilar to Chairman Mao ’s “ Red Guard ” thugs during the Communist revolution , let ’s call them “ Green Guards ” , who think they are changing the world when in actual fact they are doing the bidding of their corporate masters and megalomaniacs , who have publicly announced their plan to use global warming alarmism as a means of tightening the screws on our freedoms and ultimately eliminating us altogether .
Click for enlargement .
Meanwhile in California , all new cars from 2009 will be forced to display both a smog score sticker and a carbon emissions score sticker , rating the vehicle between one and ten for both categories .
The consequences of daring to drive a vehicle that emits the same gas that humans exhale are likely to be greater than merely extra layers of taxation and inconvenience .
Now that you are mandated to display your equivalent to the yellow star that Jews had to wear in Nazi Germany , you can expect to be scorned and vilified at best and you or your car physically attacked by the “ Green Guard ” at worst .
In the UK , a proposal to set up a form of rationing to forcibly restrict how much energy people could use , by assigning “ every individual a quota of carbon credits , which they would need in order to buy heating or vehicle fuel , electricity , or other things deemed under the scheme to cause carbon emissions , ” was briefly circulated but shot down – though the plan is likely to return at a future stage .
Advocates of man-made global warming like to silence any form of debate by claiming that any form of dissent is akin to holocaust denial , yet the agenda that they support , and one that is being enforced by governments with increasing vigor and disregard for fundamental rights of mobility and privacy , bears all the hallmarks of a fascist putsch .
As Brendan O’Neill writesin his excellent Guardian article , “ In the current debate on liberty , we hear a lot about the attack on our democratic rights by the government ’s security agenda , but little about the grave impact of environmentalism on the fabric of freedom .
It seems to me that green thinking – with its shrill intolerance of dissenting views , its deep distaste for free movement and free choice , and its view of individuals , not as history - makers , but as filthy polluters – poses a more profound threat to liberty even than the government ’s paranoid anti-terrorist agenda . ”
“ Liberty – true liberty – requires that people see themselves as self - respecting , self - determining subjects , capable of making free choices and pursuing the “ good life ” as they see fit .
Today , by contrast , we are warned that we are toxic , loaded , dangerous specimens , who must always restrain our instincts and aspire to austerity .
This is not conducive to a culture of liberty ; indeed , it represents a dangerous historic shift , from the Enlightenment era of free citizenship to a new dark age where individuals are depicted as meek in the face of more powerful , unpredictable forces : the gods of the sea , sky and ozone layer , ” he concludes .

BANGALORE : An employer who fires attracts bad reputation , and potential recruits may shy away from the company .
So , here is a novel retrenching mechanism concocted by tech / BPO firms to get their unwanted staff out , very smartly and discreetly , sans any heartburn or negative media publicity .
It 's called `out - placement ' ( placed out of the organization ) .
See how it works ?
Deepak Pradhan , a networking professional with a large IT company , got a job offer from an MNC through a headhunter although he was not scouting for a new job .
Well , it was a `stage - managed ' offer by his own HR head , who had a mandate to cut 8 people from Pradhan 's team .
The company has confidently asked its external hiring agency to poach on its own people , strictly without their knowledge .
Pradhan who moved out to a new firm six months ago along with three of his colleagues said , " Some half a dozen of us got similar job offers .
I simply thought it was just coincidental , till recently when the same HR consultant spilled the beans .
I did not feel bad as luckily what I landed was a better deal . " " Generally it is scary to be associated with companies that often fire .
Also firing stories make media headlines .
That 's when companies deploy the very same channel used in hiring to get people out .
Such firing is gaining momentum among tech / BPO firms , " said G Gautam Charan , an HR professional .
The World From Berlin ' The Memory of Bush Will Darken America 's Image for Years to Come '
German newspaper commentators have launched a scathing attack on US President George W. Bush 's record , saying he embodies " the arrogance of power " and has shattered the world 's faith in America .
Copy gets in the way .
Actually , thinking about copy gets in the way .
You start writing and then you patch and layer and write and dissemble and defend and write and the next thing you know , you ’ve killed it .
So , try this instead :
Write a classified ad .
What ’s the offer ?
What do you want me to do ?
You ’re paying by the word !
" Lose weight now .
Join our gym . "
Six words .
Promise and offer .
Now , you can make it longer .
Of course , if your gym is on the space station and it ’s the only gym around , and if the people reading your ad are looking at the bulletin board and seeking out what they want , then your ad is now long enough .
But most of the time , in most settings , a little longer is better .
So ,
add a few words or even a sentence .
Is it better ?
More effective ?
Gently and carefully add words until it ’s as effective as possible , but
as short as possible .
Perhaps you want to make your promise more vivid , or more clear .
Perhaps you need a testimonial or two to back up your promise .
Perhaps your call to action needs to be more urgent …
You can play with all of that , keeping in mind the original classified , keeping in mind that you ’re still paying by the word ( because attention is expensive ) .
And yes , this applies to articles in the newspaper , to blog posts , to how - to books and to direct marketing letters .
It applies to the emails you send and the copy on your website too .
WASHINGTON – When San Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi ascended to speaker of the House 18 months ago , liberals cheered .
Now some jeer , calling her a traitor to her principles .
In just the past two weeks , this former opponent of the Iraq war negotiated a deal to fund it for one more year .
Then , this longtime defender of civil liberties compromised on a surveillance bill critics say covers up illegal wiretapping by the Bush administration and telecom companies .
“ You ’d have to really think your constituents were stone - cold stupid to count that a victory , ” fumed liberal blogger Michael Lazzaro , known as Hunter on Daily Kos , about the surveillance deal .
But in an illustration of the intricate balancing act of politics , some of the very moves that have sparked liberal ire across the country are drawing a quite different reaction in the nation ’s capitol .
Pelosi , once deemed by conservatives as a shrill and impractical outsider , is now being seen as a clever pragmatist positioning her party for success at the polls – and with the next president .
“ She ’s a pretty canny politician and knows how to limit risks by cutting deals , ” said John Feehery , a Republican Party strategist who was spokesman for Pelosi ’s predecessor , Dennis Hastert .
“ In her heart of hearts , you know she hated that ( surveillance ) deal , but she had to get something done , ” he added .
“ She knows you live to fight another day . ”
Pelosi herself is quite aware of the tightrope she walks .
At a recent breakfast with reporters , she admitted the surveillance compromise “ was a cause for great anger . ”
She is also regularly reminded how her Iraq war efforts are being received :
At various times over the past year a dozen or more anti-war protesters have camped outside her Pacific Heights home .
A closer look at the surveillance and Iraq funding issues makes clear just how Pelosi works her compromises – and what she gets in return .
Pelosi said she did n’t like the provision of the surveillance deal that effectively grants retroactive immunity to telecoms from lawsuits about how they wiretapped customers after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But despite those concerns , she guided the surveillance bill through the House – allowing it to move even though more House Democrats voted against the bill ( 128 ) than for it ( 105 ) , and Republicans had to muster the votes for victory .
That ’s a turnabout :
In past years , when the GOP controlled the house , Republican speakers regularly blocked legislation opposed by a majority of their party .
Iraq war funding
“ The fact is , we had to have a bill , and we could n’t do better , given the hand that was dealt us , ” Pelosi said .
Pelosi took a somewhat different tack this year on Iraq .
Changing course on the war was Pelosi ’s “ highest priority ” when she took over House leadership in January 2007 , but she ran into presidential vetoes and veto threats – and Congress fell far short of the votes needed to override .
So this year Pelosi let the funding legislation proceed , but attached to it a GI bill , initially opposed by the White House , that greatly expands veterans ’ benefits .
Bush signed the bill Monday .
The increase in veterans ’ benefits was “ a shrewd move because the Democrats can portray themselves as pro-military ” on the campaign trail , said Julian Zelizer , who has written several books on Congress .
Zelizer said the wiretapping deal should also help Democrats running in competitive districts .
Rep . Anna Eshoo , a Palo Alto Democrat and friend of the speaker , put Pelosi ’s strategy more succinctly : “ She knows when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em . ”
Eshoo ’s comments underscore an important part of Pelosi ’s success :
At least this year she has been able to guide her diverse majority without a lot of destructive , internal bickering .
John Farrell , author of a biography of former Speaker Tip O’Neill , said one reason is that many of the liberal leaders in the House – not just Pelosi but also Massachusetts Reps.
Barney Frank and Ed Markey and Charles Rangel of New York – have learned from past defeats .
“ They went through the experience of losing power , ” Farrell said .
“ Now they ’re older and more pragmatic . ”
But pragmatism only goes so far .
When she came to power , Pelosi and other Democrats underestimated Bush ’s commitment to the war and the high hurdle posed by the Senate ’s 60 - vote threshold to pass a bill , said Bruce Cain , who heads the University of California Washington Center .
The result has been deadlock on many issues .
No excuses
Pelosi is n’t making excuses .
“ I know voters want results on energy and health care .
They do n’t want to hear about how hard it is to get 60 votes in the Senate , ” Pelosi told reporters .
But in 2008 , the most important votes for Pelosi are not the ones taking place on the House floor .
Democrats have added to their House majority by winning special elections with “ Blue Dog ” moderate candidates backed by Pelosi .
But liberal activists are n’t sure that an expanded majority is worth the cost .
“ What the Democratic leadership is saying is quite clear :
We will continue to trample on the Constitution and support endless expansions of the surveillance state because that is how we ’ll win in swing districts and expand our majority , ” activist Glenn Greenwald wrote in his blog .
With Congress in session only six more weeks before the election , Pelosi said she will focus on energy costs and housing foreclosures while trying to wrap up the budget bills , and shelve everything else until 2009 .
Her calculation : a President Obama and an expanded Democratic majority will make next year more productive .
In August , Pelosi will take on another important role , chairing the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
During the hard - fought race between Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , Pelosi occasionally rebuked backers of both candidates when their attacks went too far .
“ We are all very passionate about our politics and the issues we believe in , but we have to be very dispassionate about how we approach winning , ” she said in March .
At the time , she was talking about the presidential race .
But Pelosi could have been talking about how she has learned to play the game of politics .
George Soros has been a prominent international supporter of democratic ideals and causes for more than 30 years .
His philanthropic organization , the Open Society Foundations , supports democracy and human rights in more than 100 countries .
In the battle against a 49,000 - acre fire in Butte County , the weather took the fire ’s side Wednesday .
Exhausted firefighters felt it turning against them .
The winds whipped up .
The air grew hotter .
Black smoke fouled the sky .
All day , they hoped for a moist and cool night to tilt the balance in their favor .
But dusk brought no relief .
There was no dew , none of the normal evening chill .
Just more scorching heat and parched air -- strange weather that seemed determined to thwart them .
“ We really do n’t need it right now , ” said Janet Upton , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .

The Butte County blaze in Northern California surged to the forefront of statewide firefighting efforts Tuesday after flames there destroyed about 50 homes and forced about 10,000 residents to evacuate .
Elsewhere in the state , fire officials reported slow but steady progress .
A vast blaze in the Big Sur area was still only 27 % controlled , but firefighters were gaining against the fire near Goleta , which is at least 55 % contained .
Since lightning bolts first ignited a drought - seared state June 20 , California has seen more than 1,700 blazes destroy about 688,000 acres -- a combined acreage that ’s more than double the area of the city of Los Angeles .
Fire officials said about 12,800 residences remained under threat .
In all , 99 homes have been lost .
By late Wednesday , 322 fires still raged , and temperatures were projected to hit triple digits in some areas .

The threat to federal firefighting resources prompted U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) on Wednesday to seek $ 910 million in emergency federal funding for fire suppression and other fire - related needs .
“ The situation in California is explosive , ” Feinstein wrote in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee .
“ Excessive - heat warnings have been issued , more dry - lightning strikes are expected , our resources are stretched to the breaking point , and the state remains tinder - dry . ”
The Butte County fire spreading through areas near Paradise , north of Sacramento , came within two miles of Paradise ’s Feather River Hospital .
The staff scrambled to evacuate more than 40 patients .
By Wednesday afternoon , hallways there looked like a ghost town , said Jen Niswonger , an administrative resident who stayed behind at the hospital .
At the Basin Complex fire in Big Sur , the blaze had claimed a whopping 86,726 acres by Wednesday morning and destroyed another home , bringing the total to 24 lost since June 21 .
Residents and business owners continued to trek back to the region , but Chief Frank Pinney of the Big Sur volunteer fire brigade said that the scenic route of California Highway 1 would remain closed to outsiders at least until Monday .

Nearly 2,300 firefighters went toe - to - toe with the blaze Wednesday in brutal , 115 - degree heat , said Don Ferguson , a spokesman for the multi-agency effort .
At least one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion and had to be carried out , he said .
“ You ca n’t hardly keep water in these folks , ” Ferguson said .
All but five monks who had remained behind despite evacuation orders to try to keep the fire away from the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center finally decamped Wednesday with flames nearby .
Ferguson said that the “ priority structures ” at the monastery had been wrapped in a kind of protective foil .
In the Goleta area , where about 200 acres of avocado orchards have been destroyed , bulldozer lines and fire breaks had hemmed in the southern edge of that fire by late Wednesday , though the flames were still advancing to the north , said William Boyer , a Santa Barbara County spokesman .
On the western edge of the blaze , firefighters got help from the California Army National Guard , which sent eight large bulldozers in a convoy up U.S. 101 to plow firebreaks into the mountain slopes .

The Extraordinarily Useful WordPress Hacks You Probably Have n’t Used as Yet
Today almost every website is powered by WordPress , so as WordPress hacks .
Here in this article , you will go to see some code snippets or hacks which user is required to implement on a website so that he or she can take their website in a right direction or in a direction they want to .
1. Enabling Shortcodes in Widget
The edges which we want for our website , Widgets never gave the same .
They have considered as an indispensable part of almost every WordPress website and if a user wishes to enhance the features or look of the website then for this shortcodes are here .
A filter can also be used for this .
add_filter ( ‘ widget_text ' , ‘ do_shortcode ' ) ;
2. Move the Navigation menu to the Center
Move the navigation menu to the center , hack allows the user to realign the logo and to place the same at the center of the header so that it does n’t look in such a manner that it is out of the place .
And here presents a code to do this :
#navigation {
position : relative ;
}
#main - nav {
clear : left ;
float : left ;
list - style : none ;
margin : 0 ;
padding : 0 ;
position : relative ;
left : 50 % ;
text - align : center ;
}
.nav li {
display : block ;
float : left ;
list - style : none ;
margin : 0 ;
padding : 0 ;
position : relative ;
right : 50 % ;
}
.nav li.hover , .nav li.hover {
position : relative ;
}
. nav li ul li {
left : 0 ;
3. Let Your RSS Feed Contain the Post ’s Featured Image
If pictures are used in your posts , it always leaves a good impression on your audience and pushes them to read and forward or share the same in your circles .
And when posts featured image can be used by you in your RSS Feeds , your reach to the post can be enhanced by making it visible clearly and to perform this task , the following code snippets are useful :
add_filter (‘ the_content_feed ' , ‘ rss_post_thumbnail ' ) ;
function rss_post_thumbnail ( $content ) {
global $post ;
if ( has_post_thumbnail( $post->ID ) )
$ content= ‘< p>'.get_the_post_thumbnail ( $post->ID , ‘ thumbnail ' ) .
‘</p>'. $ content ;
return $ content ;
}
4. Display the Most Accurate and Current Copyright Date
Copyright is a very important part of the website as it contains large relevant information which is confidential too and thus any webmaster does n’t want to be copied the same by any other randomizers on the internet .
Thus , to display the copyright information correct with max accuracy and in synchronization with the current year is very essential .
Here the code helps you to do some updating in the copyright information on the constant basis and that too automatically .
function comicpress_copyright ( ) {
global$wpdb ;
$ copyright_dates= $ wpdb->get_results ( “ SELECT YEAR ( min( post_date_gmt ) ) AS firstdate , YEAR ( max ( post_date_gmt ) )
AS lastdate FROM $ wpdb -> posts WHERE post_status = ‘ publish ' ” ) ;
$ output= ” ;
if ( $ copyright_dates ) {
$ copyright= “ © “ . $ copyright_dates [ 0 ] -> firstdate ;
if ( $copyright_dates [0 ]-> firstdate != $ copyright_dates [ 0 ] -> lastdate ) {
$ copyright .= ‘-‘. $ copyright_dates [ 0 ] -> lastdate ;
}
$ output= $ copyright ;
}
return $ output ;
}
5 . Set the Editor You Want to as Default
Most of the people have a habit of using HTML Editor as it very user - friendly instead of the Visual Editor so here it allows you to select the option with which you are comfortable and wishes to set as the default one .
And to set the preferred editor as default , given hack is to be followed .
# Visual Editor asdefault
add_filter ( ‘ wp_default_editor ' , create_function ( ” , ‘ return “ tinymce ” ; ' ) ) ;
# HTML Editor asdefault
add_filter ( ‘ wp_default_editor ' , create_function ( ” , ‘ return “ html ” ; ' ) ) ;
6. Cast Away the Primary orTop Navigation
Canvas , in particular , has two navigation bars .
One navigation bar is located above the header and it is thereby called the Top Navigation Bar .
Then , you have the Primary Navigation that is located below the header .
Now , whether you wish to use both or just ones is entirely your prerogative , on our end , we can show you how to remove them :
Primary Navigation can be gotten rid of by this code :
add_action ( ‘ init ' , ‘ remove_canvas_main_navigation ' , 10 ) ;
function remove_canvas_main_navigation ( ) {
// Remove main nav from the woo_header_after hook
remove_action ( ‘ woo_header_after ' , ' woo_nav ' , 10 ) ;
}
And to remove the Top Navigation , you will need this :
add_action ( ‘ init ' , ‘ remove_canvas_top_navigation ' , 10 ) ;
function remove_canvas_top_navigation ( ) {
// Remove top nav from the woo_top hook
remove_action ( ‘ woo_top ' , ‘ woo_top_navigation ' , 10 ) ;
}

Table of Contents
1. Introduction
HTML has been in continuous evolution since it was introduced to the Internet in the early 1990's .
Some features were introduced in specifications ; others were introduced in software releases .
In some respects , implementations and author practices have converged with each other and with specifications and standards , but in other ways , they continue to diverge .
HTML 4 became a W3C Recommendation in 1997 .
While it continues to serve as a rough guide to many of the core features of HTML , it does not provide enough information to build implementations that interoperate with each other and , more importantly , with a critical mass of deployed content .
The same goes for XHTML1 , which defines an XML serialization for HTML 4 , and DOM Level 2 HTML , which defines JavaScript APIs for both HTML and XHTML .
[ HTML4 ] [ XHTML1 ] [ DOM2HTML ]
The HTML 5 draft reflects an effort , started in 2004 , to study contemporary HTML implementations and deployed content .
The draft :
Defines a single language called HTML 5 which can be written in a " custom " HTML syntax and in XML syntax .
Defines detailed processing models to foster interoperable implementations .
Improves markup for documents .
Introduces markup and APIs for emerging idioms , such as Web applications .
1.1 Open Issues
HTML 5 is still a draft .
The contents of HTML 5 , as well as the contents of this document which depend on HTML 5 , are still being discussed on the HTML Working Group and WHATWG mailing lists .
Some of the open issues include ( this list is not exhaustive ) :
De facto semantic definitions for some formerly presentational elements .
Details of accessibility and media - independence features , such as the longdesc , alt and summary attributes .
, and attributes .
The repetition model .
1.2 Backwards Compatible
HTML 5 is defined in a way that it is backwards compatible with the way user agents handle deployed content .
To keep the authoring language relatively simple for authors several elements and attributes are not included as outlined in the other sections of this document , such as presentational elements that are better dealt with using CSS .
User agents , however , will always have to support these older elements and this is why the specification clearly separates requirements for authors and user agents .
This means that authors can not use the isindex or plaintext element , but user agents are required to support them in a way that is compatible with how these elements behaved previously .
Since HTML 5 has separate conformance requirements for authors and user agents there is no longer a need for marking things " deprecated " .
1.3 Development Model
The HTML 5 specification will not be considered finished before there are at least two complete implementations of the specification .
This is a different approach than previous versions of HTML had .
The goal is to ensure that the specification is implementable and usable by designers and developers once it is finished .
1.4 Impact on Web Architecture
The following areas / features defined in HTML 5 are believed to impact the Web architecture :
The use of the DOM as a basis for defining the language .
The concept of browsing contexts .
The distinction between user agent requirements and authoring requirements .
The use of imperative definitions rather than abstract definitions with the requirement of black - box equivalence in implementations .
The new content model concepts ( replacing HTML 4's block and inline concepts ) .
The focus on accessibility as a built - in concept for new features ( such as the irrelevant attribute , the progress element , et cetera ) instead of an add - on ( like the alt attribute ) .
attribute , the element , et cetera ) instead of an add - on ( like the attribute ) .
The focus on defining the semantics in detail ( e.g. the outline algorithm , replacing the vague semantics in HTML 4 ) .
The server - sent events feature ( the event - source element ) .
element ) .
The datagrid element .
element .
The menu and command elements .
and elements .
The origin concept .
Offline Web application caches .
The definition of the browsing context " navigation " algorithm and the related session history traversal algorithms .
The content - type sniffing and character encoding sniffing .
The very explicit definition of a parser .
The two structured storage features .
The contentEditable feature and the UndoManager feature .
feature and the feature .
The Drag and Drop and Copy and Paste architecture .
The cross-document messaging feature ( the postMessage API ) .
API ) .
The new sandboxing features for iframe .
2. Syntax
The HTML 5 language has a " custom " HTML syntax that is compatible with HTML 4 and XHTML1 documents published on the Web , but is not compatible with the more esoteric SGML features of HTML 4 , such as < em / content / .
Documents using this " custom " syntax must be served with the text / html MIME type .
HTML 5 also defines detailed parsing rules ( including " error handling " ) for this syntax which are largely compatible with popular implementations .
User agents will follow these rules for resources that have the text / html MIME type .
Here is an example document that conforms to the HTML syntax :
<! doctype html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " > < title > Example document </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Example paragraph </ p> </ body > </html >
The other syntax that can be used for HTML 5 is XML .
This syntax is compatible with XHTML1 documents and implementations .
Documents using this syntax need to be served with an XML MIME type and elements need to be put in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace following the rules set forth by the XML specifications .
[ XML ]
Below is an example document that conforms to the XML syntax of HTML 5 .
Note that XML documents must have an XML MIME type such as application / xhtml+xml or application / xml .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Example document </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Example paragraph </ p> </ body > </html >
2.1 Character Encoding
For the HTML syntax of HTML 5 authors have three means of setting the character encoding :
At the transport level .
By using the HTTP Content - Type header for instance .
header for instance .
Using a Unicode Byte Order Mark ( BOM ) character at the start of the file .
This character provides a signature for the encoding used .
Using a meta element with a charset attribute that specifies the encoding as the first element child of the head element .
< meta charset = " UTF - 8 " > could be used to specify the UTF - 8 encoding .
This replaces the need for < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " >
For the XML syntax authors have to use the rules as set forth in the XML specifications to set the character encoding .
2.2 The DOCTYPE
The HTML syntax of HTML 5 requires a DOCTYPE to be specified to ensure that the browser renders the page in standards mode .
The DOCTYPE has no other purpose and is therefore optional for XML .
Documents with an XML MIME type are always handled in standards mode .
[ DOCTYPE ]
The DOCTYPE declaration is <! DOCTYPE html > and is case - insensitive in the HTML syntax .
DOCTYPE s from earlier versions of HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML based and therefore required a reference to a DTD .
With HTML 5 this is no longer the case and the DOCTYPE is only needed to enable standards mode for documents written using the HTML syntax .
Browsers already do this for <! DOCTYPE html > .
2.3 Miscellaneous
There are a few other syntax changes worthy of mentioning :
HTML now has native support for IRIs .
In HTML 4 this was only handled as error handling .
The lang attribute takes the empty string in addition to a valid language identifier , just like xml:lang does in XML .
3. Language
This section is split up in several subsections to more clearly illustrate the various differences there are between HTML 4 and HTML 5 .
3.1 New Elements
The following elements have been introduced for better structure :
section represents a generic document or application section .
It can be used together with h1 - h6 to indicate the document structure .
article represents an independent piece of content of a document , such as a blog entry or newspaper article .
aside represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page .
header represents the header of a section .
footer represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author , copyright information , et cetera .
nav represents a section of the document intended for navigation .
dialog can be used to mark up a conversation like this : < dialog > < dt> Costello < dd>
Look , you gotta first baseman ?
< dt> Abbott < dd> Certainly .
< dt> Costello < dd>
Who 's playing first ?
< dt> Abbott < dd >
That 's right .
< dt> Costello < dd >
When you pay off the first baseman every month , who gets the money ?
< dt> Abbott < dd >
Every dollar of it .
</ dialog >
figure can be used to associate a caption together with some embedded content , such as a graphic or video : < figure > < video src=ogg >…</ video > < legend > Example </ legend > </ figure >
Then there are several other new elements :
audio and video for multimedia content .
Both provide an API so application authors can script their own user interface , but there is also a way to trigger a user interface provided by the user agent .
source elements are used together with these elements if there are multiple streams available of different types .
embed is used for plugin content .
mark represents a run of marked text .
meter represents a measurement , such as disk usage .
time represents a date and / or time .
canvas is used for rendering dynamic bitmap graphics on the fly , such as graphs , games , et cetera .
command represents a command the user can invoke .
datagrid represents an interactive representation of a tree list or tabular data .
details represents additional information or controls which the user can obtain on demand .
datalist together with the a new list attribute for input is used to make comboboxes : < input list=browsers > < datalist id=browsers > < option value= " Safari " > < option value= " Internet Explorer " > < option value = " Opera " > < option value= " Firefox " > </datalist >
The datatemplate , rule and nest elements provide a templating mechanism for HTML .
event - source is used to " catch " server sent events .
output represents some type of output , such as from a calculation done through scripting .
progress represents a completion of a task , such as downloading or when performing a series of expensive operations .
The ruby , rt and rb elements allow for marking up ruby annotations .
The input element 's type attribute now has the following new values :
datetime
datetime - local
date
month
week
time
number
range
email
url
The idea of these new types is that the user agent can provide the user interface , such as a calendar date picker or integration with the user 's address book and submit a defined format to the server .
It gives the user a better experience as his input is checked before sending it to the server meaning there is less time to wait for feedback .
3.2 New Attributes
HTML 5 has introduced several new attributes to various elements that were already part of HTML 4 :
The a and area elements now have a media attribute for consistency with the link element .
It is purely advisory .
The a and area elements have a new attribute called ping that specifies a space separated list of URIs which have to be pinged when the hyperlink is followed .
Currently user tracking is mostly done through redirects .
This attribute allows the user agent to inform users which URIs are going to be pinged as well as giving privacy - conscious users a way to turn it off .
The area element , for consistency , now has the hreflang and rel attributes .
The base element can now have a target attribute as well mainly for consistency with the a element and because it was already widely supported .
Also , the target attribute for the a and area elements is no longer deprecated , as it is useful in Web applications , for example in conjunction with iframe .
The value attribute for the li element is no longer deprecated as it is not presentational .
The same goes for the start attribute of the ol element .
The meta element has a charset attribute now as this was already supported and provides a nicer way to specify the character encoding for the document .
A new autofocus attribute can be specified on the input ( except when the type attribute is hidden ) , select , textarea and button elements .
It provides a declarative way to focus a form control during page load .
Using this feature should enhance the user experience as the user can turn it off if he does not like it , for instance .
The new form attribute for input , output , select , textarea , button and fieldset elements allows for controls to be associated with more than a single form .
The input , button and form elements have a new replace attribute which affects what will be done with the document after a form has been submitted .
The form and select elements ( as well as the datalist element ) have a data attribute that allows for automatically prefilling of form controls , in case of form , or the form control , in case of select and datalist , with data from the server .
The new required attribute applies to input ( except when the type attribute is hidden , image or some button type such as submit ) and textarea .
It indicates that the user has to fill in a value in order to submit the form .
The input and textarea elements have a new attribute called inputmode which gives a hint to the user interface as to what kind of input is expected .
You can now disable an entire fieldset by using the disabled attribute on it .
This was not possible before .
The input element has several new attributes to specify constraints : autocomplete , min , max , pattern and step .
As mentioned before it also has a new list attribute which can be used together with the datalist and select element .
input and button also have a new template attribute which can be used for repetition templates .
The menu element has three new attributes : type , label and autosubmit .
They allow the element to transform into a menu as found in typical user interfaces as well as providing for context menus in conjunction with the global contextmenu attribute .
The style element has a new scoped attribute which can be used to enable scoped style sheets .
Style rules within such a style element only apply to the local tree .
The script element has a new attribute called async that influences script loading and execution .
The html element has a new attribute called manifest that points to an application cache manifest used in conjunction with the API for offline Web applications .
The link element has a new attribute called sizes .
It can be used in conjunction with the icon relationship ( set through the rel attribute ) to indicate the size of the referenced icon .
The ol element has a new attribute called reversed to indicate that the list order is descending when present .
The iframe element has two new attributes called seamless and sandbox which allow for sandboxing content , e.g. blog comments .
Several attributes from HTML 4 now apply to all elements .
These are called global attributes : class , dir , id , lang , style , tabindex and title .
There are also several new global attributes :
The contenteditable attribute indicates that the element is an editable area .
The user can change the contents of the element and manipulate the markup .
attribute indicates that the element is an editable area .
The user can change the contents of the element and manipulate the markup .
The contextmenu attribute can be used to point to a context menu provided by the author .
attribute can be used to point to a context menu provided by the author .
The draggable attribute can be used together with the new drag & drop API .
attribute can be used together with the new drag & drop API .
The irrelevant attribute indicates that an element is not yet , or is no longer , relevant .
attribute indicates that an element is not yet , or is no longer , relevant .
The ref , registrationmark and template global attributes complement the data template feature .
, and global attributes complement the data template feature .
The data- * collection of author defined attributes .
Authors can define any attribute they want as long as they prefix it with data- to avoid clashes with future versions of HTML .
The only requirement on these attributes is that they are not used for user agent extensions .
The following are the attributes for the repetition model .
These are global attributes and as such may be used on all HTML elements , or on any element in any other namespace , with the attributes being in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace .:
repeat
repeat - start
repeat-min
repeat-max
HTML 5 also makes all event handler attributes from HTML 4 that take the form on event - name global attributes and adds several new event handler attributes for new events it defines , such as the onmessage attribute which can be used together with the new event - source element and the cross - document messaging API .
3.3 Changed Elements
These elements have slightly modified meanings in HTML 5 to better reflect how they are used on the Web or to make them more useful :
The a element without an href attribute now represents a " placeholder link " .
The address element is now scoped by the new concept of sectioning .
The b element now represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance , such as key words in a document abstract , product names in a review , or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is emboldened .
The hr element now represents a paragraph - level thematic break .
The i element now represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood , or otherwise offset from the normal prose , such as a taxonomic designation , a technical term , an idiomatic phrase from another language , a thought , a ship name , or some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is italicized .
Usage varies widely by language .
For the label element the browser should no longer move focus from the label to the control unless such behaviour is standard for the underlying platform user interface .
The menu element is redefined to be useful for actual menus .
The small element now represents small print ( for side comments and legal print ) .
The strong element now represents importance rather than strong emphasis .
Quotation marks for the q element are now to be provided by the author rather than the user agent .
3.4 Absent Elements
The elements in this section are not to be used by authors .
User agents will still have to support them and HTML 5 will get a rendering section in due course that says exactly how .
( The isindex element for instance is already supported by the parser . )
The following elements are not in HTML 5 because their effect is purely presentational and therefore better handled by CSS :
basefont
big
center
font
s
strike
tt
u
The following elements are not in HTML 5 because their usage affected usability and accessibility for the end user in a negative way :
frame
frameset
noframes
The following elements are not included because they have not been used often , created confusion or can be handled by other elements :
acronym is not included because it has created lots of confusion .
Authors are to use abbr for abbreviations .

Authors are to use for abbreviations .
applet has been obsoleted in favor of object .
has been obsoleted in favor of .
isindex usage can be replaced by usage of form controls .
usage can be replaced by usage of form controls .
dir has been obsoleted in favor of ul .
Finally the noscript is only conforming in the HTML syntax .
It is not included in the XML syntax as its usage relies on an HTML parser .
3.5 Absent Attributes
Some attributes from HTML 4 are no longer allowed in HTML 5 .
If they need to have any impact on user agents for compatibility reasons it is defined how they should work in those scenarios .
accesskey attribute on a , area , button , input , label , legend and textarea .
attribute on , , , , , and .
rev and charset attributes on link and a .

4. APIs
HTML 5 introduces a number of APIs that help in creating Web applications .
These can be used together with the new elements introduced for applications :
2D drawing API which can be used with the new canvas element .
element .
API for playing of video and audio which can be used with the new video and audio elements .
and elements .
Persistent storage .
Both key / value and a SQL database are supported .
An API that enables offline Web applications .
An API that allows a Web application to register itself for certain protocols or MIME types .
Editing API in combination with a new global contenteditable attribute .
attribute .
Drag & drop API in combination with a draggable attribute .
attribute .
Network API .
API that exposes the history and allows pages to add to it to prevent breaking the back button .
( This API has the necessary security restrictions in place . )
Cross - document messaging .
Server - sent events in combination with the new event - source element .
element .
Notification API to alert the user to new information , such as new e-mail messages in an e-mail application .
4.1 Extensions to HTMLDocument
HTML 5 has extended the HTMLDocument interface from DOM Level 2 HTML in a number of ways .
The interface is now implemented on all objects implementing the Document interface so it stays meaningful in a compound document context .
It also has several noteworthy new members :
getElementsByClassName( ) to select elements by their class name .
The way this method is defined it will allow it to work for any content with class attributes and a Document object such as SVG and MathML .
innerHTML as an easy way to parse and serialize an HTML or XML document .
This attribute was previously only available on HTMLElement in Web browsers and not part of any standard .
activeElement and has Focus to determine which element is currently focused and whether the Document has focus respectively .
getSelection ( ) which returns an object that represents the current selection (s ) .
designMode and execCommand ( ) which are mostly used for editing of documents .
4.2 Extensions to HTMLElement
The HTMLElement interface has also gained several extensions in HTML 5 :
getElementsByClassName ( ) which is basically a scoped version of the one found on HTMLDocument .
innerHTML as found in Web browsers today .
It is also defined to work in XML context ( when it is used in an XML document ) .
classList is a convenient accessor for className .
The object it returns exposes methods , such as has ( ) , add( ) , remove ( ) and toggle ( ) for manipulating the element 's classes .
The a , area and link elements have a similar attribute called relList that provides the same functionality for the rel attribute .

FBI looking into IndyMac Bancorp .
The Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON - Now - defunct IndyMac Bancorp Inc. is under investigation by the FBI for possible fraud in connection with home loans made to risky borrowers , The Associated Press has learned .
It was not immediately clear how long the FBI 's probe of the bank has been ongoing .
The investigation is focused on the company - which was taken over last Friday by the FDIC - and not individuals who ran it , a law enforcement official said Wednesday .
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation .
IndyMac
Bank 's assets were seized by federal regulators after the mortgage lender succumbed to the pressures of tighter credit , tumbling home prices and rising foreclosures .
The bank is the largest regulated thrift to fail and the second largest financial institution to close in U.S. history , regulators said .
The Office of Thrift Supervision said it transferred IndyMac 's operations to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation because it did not think the lender could meet its depositors ' demands .
FDIC spokesman David Barr could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday .
Shortly after the FDIC took over operations , Barr said most depositors were given immediate access to up to $ 100,000 in their accounts and 50 percent of any money beyond that threshold .
Depositors with joint accounts or retirement accounts could immediately withdraw greater sums .
Depositors were given receivership certificates for any money they could n't immediately withdraw and may be able to receive some of that money after the bank 's assets are sold off .
Early this week , hundreds of worried IndyMac customers lined up out of the bank 's headquarters branch in Pasadena , Calif. , demanding to withdraw as much money as they could or get answers about the fate of their funds .
Over the last year , and faced with a cratering housing market , the FBI has opened a wide - ranging probe of companies across the financial services industry , from mortgage lenders to investment banks that bundle home loans into securities sold to investors .
Countrywide Financial Corp. , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , is also under scrutiny .
Additionally , two former Bears Stearns managers were indicted last month on conspiracy and securities and wire fraud charges alleging they lied to investors in a hedge fund that tanked last year as the subprime market collapsed .
Those charges marked the first criminal charges to arise on Wall Street from the subprime mortgage debacle .
In all , the FBI is now investigating 21 companies tied to the subprime mortgage crisis , up from 19 last month .
Authorities are looking into at least 1,400 mortgage fraud cases nationwide , and more than 400 real estate industry players have been indicted since March .
FBI Director Robert Mueller has said the investigations focus on accounting fraud , insider trading , and failure to disclose the value of mortgage - related securities and other investments .
Losses homeowners and other borrowers are estimated at over $ 1 billion .
Timing the Guantanamo Trials
The Bush administration 's extraordinarily unsuccessful attempt to engineer a series of show trials at Guantanamo is about to accelerate .
The Pentagon has declared the Guantanamo war crimes trials a national priority and will more than double the number of military lawyers assigned to them ... .
[ A ] bout 108 uniformed military lawyers [ will ] be added to the prosecution and defense teams in the next three months .
You think this has nothing to do with the upcoming election ?
Then why , after warehousing " enemy combatants " ( or whatever the administration is calling them today ) for the last six years without a single trial , have trials ( perhaps including death penalty trials ) become a sudden priority ?
Pressed for details on the timing , [ Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas ]
Hartmann said , " I do n't know that it always was n't the No. 1 priority but I know that it was formally declared the No. 1 priority in the last two or three weeks " by Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England .
Is the administration orchestrating an election year reminder of 9/11 in a sudden rush to judgment at Guantanamo ?

Race is also a consideration .
Muhammad Ahmed Kareem , 49 , an engineer from Mosul , said he had high expectations of Mr. Obama because his experience as a black man in America might give him more empathy for others who feel oppressed by a powerful West .
“ Blacks suffered a lot of discrimination , much like Arabs , ” Mr. Kareem said .
“ That ’s why we expect that his tenure will be much better . ”
But Mr. Obama also frames the sometimes contradictory feelings Iraqis have about America as the withdrawal of troops has moved closer to the political mainstream in both countries .
Already , the units brought in for the so - called surge last year have left , and the Bush administration has in recent days acknowledged the need both to transfer troops from Iraq to an ever - more - volatile Afghanistan and to recognize that a broader withdrawal is an “ aspirational goal ” for Iraqis .
Mr. Obama has advocated a withdrawal that would remove most combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office .
Despite some fears about such a departure , that stance is not unpopular here .
Many Iraqis hate American forces because soldiers have killed their relatives and friends , and they say they want the troops out .
“ Of course I want the American forces to leave Iraq , ” said May Adnan Yunis , whose sister was killed , along with a female and a male co-worker , when they were gunned down by American soldiers while driving to work at Baghdad International Airport three weeks ago .
“ I want them to go to hell . ”
After the killings , a statement by the American military describing the three employees as “ criminals ” who shot at the soldiers inflamed Iraqi officials even more .
In a rare public rebuke of the American military , the Iraqi armed forces general command described the American soldiers ’ actions as crimes “ committed in cold blood . ”
For General Hiti , who commands a swath of western Baghdad , the American military is a necessary , if vexing , presence .
He ticks off the ways it helps : evacuating wounded Iraqi soldiers , bringing in helicopters when things go wrong , defusing bombs , getting detailed pictures of areas from drone planes .
But the issue of withdrawal is immensely complex , and some of the functions mentioned by General Hiti would not be affected under Mr. Obama ’s plan .
The senator is calling for the withdrawal of combat brigades , but has said a residual force would still pursue extremist militants , protect American troops and train Iraqi security forces .

Memo to Obama : Moving to the Middle is for Losers
Last Friday afternoon , the guests taking part in Sunday 's roundtable discussion on This Week had a pre-show call with George Stephanopoulos .
One of the topics he raised was Obama 's perceived move to the center , and what it means .
Thus began my weekend obsession .
If you were within shouting distance of me , odds are we talked about it .
I talked about it over lunch with HuffPost 's DC team , over dinner with friends , with the doorman at the hotel , and the driver on the way to the airport .
As part of this process , I looked at the Obama campaign not through the prism of my own progressive views and beliefs but through the prism of a cold - eyed campaign strategist who has no principles except winning .
From that point of view , and taking nothing else into consideration , I can unequivocally say : the Obama campaign is making a very serious mistake .
Tacking to the center is a losing strategy .
And do n't let the latest head - to - head poll numbers lull you the way they lulled Hillary Clinton in December .
Running to the middle in an attempt to attract undecided swing voters did n't work for Al Gore in 2000 .
It did n't work for John Kerry in 2004 .
And it did n't work when Mark Penn ( obsessed with his " microtrends " and missing the megatrend ) convinced Hillary Clinton to do it in 2008 .
Fixating on -- and pandering to -- this fickle crowd is all about messaging tailored to avoid offending rather than to inspire and galvanize .
And is n't galvanizing the electorate to demand fundamental change the raison d'etre of the Obama campaign in the first place ?
This is how David Axelrod put it at the end of February , contrasting the tired Washington model of " I 'll do these things for you " with Obama 's " Let 's do these things together " :
" This has been the premise of Barack 's politics all his life , going back to his days as a community organizer , " Axelrod told me .
" He has really lived and breathed it , which is why it comes across so authentically .
Of course , the time also has to be right for the man and the moment to come together .
And , after all the country has been through over the last seven years , the times are definitely right for the message that the only way to get real change is to activate the American people to demand it . "
Watering down that brand is the political equivalent of New Coke .
Call it Obama Zero .
In 2004 , the Kerry campaign 's obsession with undecided voters -- voters so easily swayed that 46 percent of them found credible the Swift Boaters ' charges that Kerry might have faked his war wounds to earn a Purple Heart -- allowed the race to devolve from a referendum on the future of the country into a petty squabble over whether Kerry had bled enough to warrant his medals .
Throughout the primary , Obama referred to himself as an " unlikely candidate . "
Which he certainly was -- and still is .
And one of the things that turned him from " unlikely " upstart to presidential frontrunner is his ability to expand the electorate by convincing unlikely voters -- some of the 83 million eligible voters who did n't turn out in 2004 -- to engage in the system .
So why start playing to the political fence sitters -- staking out newly nuanced positions on FISA , gun control laws , expansion of the death penalty , and NAFTA ?
In an interview with Nina Easton in Fortune Magazine , Obama was asked about having called NAFTA " a big mistake " and " devastating . "
Obama 's reply : " Sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified . "
Overheated ?
So when he was campaigning in the Midwest , many parts of which have been , yes , devastated by economic changes since the passage of NAFTA , and he pledged to make use of a six - month opt - out clause in the trade agreement , that was " overheated ? "
Or was that one " amplified ? "
Because if that 's the case , it would be helpful going forward if Obama would let us know which of his powerful rhetoric is " overheated " and / or " amplified , " so voters will know not to get their hopes too high .
When Obama kneecaps his own rhetoric and dilutes his positioning as a different kind of politician , he is also giving his opponent a huge opening to reassert the McCain as Maverick brand .
We know that McCain has completely abandoned any legitimate claim on his maverick image , but the echoes of that reputation are still very much with us -- especially among many in the media who would love nothing more than to be able to once again portray McCain as the real leader they fell in love with in 2000 .
And the new Straight Talk Express plane has been modeled on its namesake bus , decked out to better recreate the seduction .
The transition between the primaries and the general election -- and from insurgent to frontrunner -- is tricky .
Even a confident campaign can be knocked off course .
So this is when Obama most needs to remember what got him to this point -- and stick with it .
In a Los Angeles Times article detailing Obama 's attempts at " shifting toward the center , " Matt Bennett of the centrist think tank Third Way says that Obama is a " good politician .
He 's doing all he can to make sure people know he would govern as a post- partisan moderate . "
But is n't being a " good politician " as it's meant here exactly what Obama defined himself as being against ?
Instead of Third Way think tankers , Obama should listen to this guy :
" What 's stopped us is the failure of leadership , the smallness of our politics -- the ease with which we 're distracted by the petty and trivial , our chronic avoidance of tough decisions , our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems ....
The time for that politics is over .
It 's time to turn the page . "
That was Barack Obama in February of 2007 , announcing his run for the White House .
" I know I have n't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington , " he said that day , " but I 've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change . "
Was that just " overheated and amplified " rhetoric ?
The Obama brand has always been about inspiration , a new kind of politics , the audacity of hope , and " change we can believe in . "
I like that brand .
More importantly , voters -- especially unlikely voters -- like that brand .
Pulling it off the shelf and replacing it with a political product geared to pleasing America 's vacillating swing voters -- the ones who will be most susceptible to the fear - mongering avalanche that has already begun -- would be a fatal blunder .
Realpolitik is one thing .
Realstupidpolitik is quite another .

We need to do better .
The progressive blogs need to emphatically condemn violent rhetoric in American politics , and we need to do it with the passionate and unified voice this urgent problem demands .
Sunday 's mass shooting at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church raise a difficult question for this country and , subsequently , for the progressive netroots :
Will we take a stand against violent rhetoric ?
The Wrong Approach
Knoxville local news reported that gunman Jim Adkisson not only proclaimed in a letter that he was motivated by his " hatred of the liberal movement ... Liberals in general , as well as gays , " but also police that his home contained copies of books by right - wing pundits Michael Savage and Bill O'Reilly .
( link ) .
In the face of this , the media ( including bloggers ) must do more than speculate on the link between rhetoric and violence .
It must take an emphatic stance against violent rhetoric in American life .
Unfortunately , there is a surprising lack of unity on this issue amongst progressive bloggers .
OpenLeft , for example , posted a timely response to the Adkisson murders on Sunday which connected the problem of email death threats that bloggers regularly receive from right - wingers to the recent tragedy in Tennessee .
Unfortunately , rather than using his post to take an emphatic stand against right - wing violent rhetoric , the site took an oddly neutral position ( emphasis mine ) :
These sorts of emails end up in my inbox a couple of times a week .
Usually , they are as non-sequitor as any other type of spam , and are unremarkable except as yet another demonstration of certain types of right - wing discourse .
The frequency with which right - wing political discussion is laced with threats of fatal violence is rarely discussed , but it appears in my inbox several dozen times a year .
Still , it seems mostly to be talk and macho posturing , since politically motivated violence against leftists in America does not appear common .
Further , I am pretty sure that most prominent progressives who have a public email receive this sort of email on a regular basis too , and so it seems mostly like widespread eliminationist rhetoric than any actual threats .
( " Right Wing Emails and the Tennessee Shootings " )
Keep in mind that OpenLeft is a hugely influential blog due in large part to the incredible job those bloggers have done building bridges to the Democratic Party establishment and to movement progressive organizations .
If we judge a blog 's importance by its influence , rather than just by its site traffic , OpenLeft is one of the top 3 progressive blogs .
Hands down , it is a great site .
While there is no question that the OpenLeft post condemns the Tennessee killings , its position on right - wing violent rhetoric is ambiguous .
Rather than come out emphatically against violent rhetoric from the right , OpenLeft invites its readers to wonder about the relationship between violent rhetoric and violent action , the implied conclusion being that the jury is still out on the sociology of violent rhetoric , therefore , the problem is not really something worth too much attention .
Again , while the post on OpenLeft will not be read by millions and millions of people , as an opinion - maker website , it has been read by enough instrumental people to have a serious impact .
We can safely conclude that as a result of Bowers ' post , Democratic members of Congress , progressive activists and organizers at the state - level , and key members of the media will conclude that the progressive blogs are talking about violent rhetoric in the wake of the Tennessee murders , but they are not unified in viewing it as a problem for American politics , government , or Democracy .
On some level , I can appreciate what OpenLeft is saying .
I can understand the desire to respond to email death threats from right - wingers by saying something along the lines of ' it 's just another kind of right - wing extremism , ' and then referencing a few blog posts with the implied message , ' that 's someone else 's issue ... this stuff does n't really bother me all that much . '
The logic I see is one of a refusal to be intimidated by threats and a desire to show that one is not going to be silenced by right - wingers no matter how extreme they sound .
Nonetheless , I do not see the logic of taking that approach right now -- directly in response to the Tennessee murders .
To be blunt : Innocent people were just killed by a right - winger espousing hatred of liberals as the motivation for his actions , and who had in his home books by the very right - wing pundits who use violent rhetoric to attack progressives on a daily basis .
Given all that , it seems more logical to use this moment as an opportunity to commit to something far more emphatic than a less - than - outraged , almost neutral stand on violent rhetoric or , as the case seems here , to respond to the tragic murders by speculating on the connection between rhetoric and action .
The same ambiguity is also common amongst DailyKos and MyDD front - pagers , all of whom tend to ridicule right - wing violent language while refusing to emphatically condemn it .
Too Late For Neutral
To put this in different terms , the key , front - page bloggers in the progressive netroots who have not yet come out emphatically against right - wing violent language -- who are not yet ready to say that violent rhetoric from the right is a problem in contemporary American politics -- they are behind in doing so .
The vast majority of bloggers , albeit not necessarily the most influential bloggers , have already taken a stand against violent rhetoric because they are forced to take that stand every day .
This emphatic stance against violent rhetoric was posted by Feministing .com over a year ago and is a good model of the kind of stance that all bloggers should have already taken by now :
Death threats towards bloggers are NOT acceptable
In light of Kathy Sierra having to cancel her speech at ETech because of death threats , I just want to say that I completely agree with her and Lindsay and Zuzu , that death threats towards bloggers is NOT protected speech .
They say it all so go read it .
But I want to add Feministing has gotten its share of threatening emails and it is very upsetting .
When I was presenting at SXSW , one of the questions discussed was how safe can we make online communities for diverse voices and is it possible ?
Some people believe that everyone should be able to say what they want , but somethings are just not O.K .
Threatening women or people of color for voicing their thoughts , concerns and opinions is NOT O.K .
It is an old , tired and paranoid brand of racist misogyny and we are not going to put up with it .
It is so unfortunate that someone would have to cancel a speaking engagement because stupid trolls were so threatened by a women talking tech .
Disgusting .
Another example from the same incident from Majikthise :
Female tech blogger cancels keynote amid death threats
Sad news :
Tech blogger Kathy Sierra canceled her scheduled keynote adress at ETech because she was facing a barrage of online death - and rape threats .
Over the past four weeks Kathy has been targeted for a barrage of increasingly credible threats of physical violence .
In her post , Kathy reports that she has contacted the appropriate authorities and that they are taking her complaints seriously .
I 'm saddened to hear that another woman has foregone another opportunity because of misogynist intimidation .
I want Kathy to know that her colleagues in the feminist / lib - left blogosphere are pulling for her .
Thanks to zuzu and Dr. Sox for voicing their support .
Even before the Tennessee shootings , bloggers in the progressive netroots should have converged on a collective and emphatic outrage at right - wing violent language .
Instead , key front - pagers on the most high - profile progressive blogs have not stepped up and spoken clearly on this issue .
For these core parts of the progressive netroots , the issue has been and continues to be urgent enough to take an emphatic stance :
When female bloggers get an email from a right - winger threatening to rape them for something they wrote , the reaction is to take it seriously and call for it to stop -- always .
When gay or lesbian bloggers get an email from a right - winger threatening to sodomize them for something they wrote , the reaction is to take it seriously and call for it to stop -- always .
When African - American bloggers gets an email from a right - winger threatening to lynch them for something they wrote , the reaction is to take it seriously and call for it to stop -- always .
In other words , the not take an emphatic stand against violent rhetoric on the basis of questioning the link between words and action is to overlook the actual persistent , poisonous impact violent rhetoric has on the very public sphere bloggers seek to revive and maintain .
Wondering about the link between violent rhetoric and violent action is interesting and it is important , but it 's not a substitute for the issue at hand .
The question is how violent rhetoric undermines our entire system of government , which is based on a civic sphere that can only function if a certain kind of talk is maintained .
Even if it does not result in murders , it is corroding our public sphere .
And it is that corroded public sphere that gives rise to violent acts with either overt or tangential political aims .
America does not need to descend into widespread political violence before it is incumbent upon all voices in the media and the political establishment to emphatically speak out against violent rhetoric .
The time to speak out against violent rhetoric in a strong and unified voice is before the country descends into physical violence .
Before , not after .
Therefore , the time is now for the most influential progressive bloggers to recognize that violent rhetoric is a persistent problem - - a real and damaging force in our system of government that has gained in intensity since 9/11 , but has much deeper roots in the history of right - wing rhetoric in this country .
Now is the time for influential progressive bloggers who have not done so to put up a post that is 100 % and clearly against violent rhetoric , and to state emphatically that it is an intolerable threat against women , gays , lesbians , people of color , and anyone else who voices their political views .
Now is the time to strongly state that everyone in the netroots should work together to curb this problem .
That is the kind of strong message we need from front page bloggers in response to a right - winger walking into a liberal church and killing people after leaving a note saying he hates liberals and gays .
The leaders of the netroots communities that give us all a place to participate must come together and stand united on this issue .

キャリアグレー ドNATと家庭用NAT の違い
昨日「 IPv4アドレス枯渇とIPv6化に向けての464NAT提案」という記事を書いたのですが、TwitterにてTomo's
Hotline のTomoさんから「4-4-4も4-6-4-NATもインターネットドラフトが出ています。4-4-4は私が書いています。」との情報提供を頂けました。
早速教えていただい たinternet draft 「 Carrier Grade Network Address Translator ( NAT ) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP , TCP and ICMP , draft - nishitani - cgn - 00 」 を拝見しました。 キャリアグレー ドNAT ( CGN ) に関する非常に興味深い内容でした。 恐らく今月 のIETF ( アイルランド ) にて Tomoさんが発表されると思われます。
以下、internet draftに記述してある内容等などからキャリアグレードNATと通常NATで違いそうなところに関して書いてみました。
間違いや勘違い等、ご指摘頂ければ幸いです。
キャリアグレー ドNATでの違い
ポート割り当てテーブル をCPE( Customer Premises Equipment ) 毎に個数制限しなければならない
通常NATであれば、ノード毎のセッション数制限は必要ありません。
SOHOルータでは、全員が一つ のNAT変換テーブルを共有しています。
キャリアグレー ドNATでは、複数のCPEで同一IPアドレスをシェアする必要があります。
UDPやTCPのポート数は宛先/送信元各16ビット長と有限であるため、この有限であるポート数を公平に使えるようにする必要があります。
例えば、100人で1つのIPアドレスをシェアしているのに一人だけ数万ポートを使い、そのために他のユーザが通信できないような事態が発生すると不公平になります。
また、この不公平を放置すると、DoSが容易に行えるようになってしまいます。
これらの理由により、CPE毎にセッション数制限を設ける必要があります。
CPEに対して割り当てられるIPアドレスは同一でなければならない
SOHO ルータであれば、一つに対して複数のIP アドレスが割り当てられる事はないので、こんな事を考えなくても良いのですが、キャリアグレードNATになるとこれも考えなければいけません。
キャリアグレードNATのように多数のユーザを前提としてNATであれば、単一のグローバルIPアドレスではポート番号というプロトコル上有限な資源が足りなくなる可能性もあるため、複数のグローバルIPアドレスを管理しながら運営が行われると思われます。
例えば、キャリアグレードNATの下にいるクライアントが、グローバルなIPアドレスを持つサーバに対して2本のTCPセッションを張った時に、1本目と2本目でIPアドレスが異なってしまうと動作しないプロトコルやアプリケーションがあるかも知れません。
ただ、この 「 同一IP アドレスを可能な限り割り当てる」というのは管理を困難にするかも知れません。
( 次の項目参照 )
各セッションの生存期間と同一IPアドレスを割り当てる事
特定のCPEに対して特定のグローバルIPアドレスを割り当ててしまうと、グローバルIPアドレスの利用効率が落ちてしまう可能性があります。 そのため、CPEへのグローバルIPアドレス区分は、ある程度動的に行いたくなります。
しかし、何らかのセッションが発生している間はCPEのグローバルIPアドレス区分を変更できません。
変更してしまうと「同一IPアドレスを割り当てる事」ができなくなります。
恐らく、CPEから全くセッションが発生しない状態が一定期間以上になれば、グローバルIPアドレス割り当て区分を変えても良いという形になると予想しています。
ただ、常に(もしくは定期的に)何らかのセッションを発生させ続けるユーザがどれだけいるかで、グローバルIPアドレス毎に稼働率が微妙に変わってきてしまい、そのCPEを使っているユーザのトラフィック特性とグローバルIPアドレスのbindingという細かいケアが必要になる場合もあるのかも知れないと、妄想してみました。
一度NAT変換テーブルに割り当てたポートは決められた期間有効でなければならない
一見当たり前に思えますが、これってかなり厳しい要求だと思います。 なぜ、厳しいかというのは次の項目をご覧下さい。
ファームウェアアップグレードどうするんだろう？
ルータ内部のソフトウェアがアップデートする事があります。
機能が増えるということでバージョンアップすることもありますし、セキュリティ上の理由でバージョンアップすることもあります。
一般的には、例えばルータ のOS がアップグレードした らOS を再起動しなければなりません。 再起動をすると保持している情報は消えてしまいます。 家庭 のNAT であればユーザが好きな時に再起動できますが、キャリアグレードNATではそれは許されません。
経路等をできるだけ落とさないようにするためのISSU
( In Service System Upgrade ) という仕組みがありますが、同様の事をNAT の変換テーブルに対してもやらなければならないのではないでしょうか。
ただ、無数のユーザが任意のタイミングで発生させるトランザクションに対するNAT用変換テーブルを保持しながら、ルータのOSを再起動する手法って気が遠くなりそうですね。。。
障害対策
ルータも壊れることがあります。 ファンや電源が故障することがありますし、その他理由で動作しなくなる場合もあります。
ソフトウェアのバグでルータが落ちる可能性もゼロではありません。
また、古くなった製品を新しく置き換えなければならない場合もあります。
今までのルータ等の故障であれば経路情報等を共有していれば、切り替え時にパケットが数個落ちる程度まで改善できているとおもいます。
これは、ルータがセッションのステートを保持しておらず、各セッションの状態を保持しているのがエンドノードであったからです。
ルータが途中でパケットを落としても、エンドノードでTCPがカバーしてくれたりするのであまり問題にはならないことも多いです。
しかし、キャリアグレードNATではルータが状態(ステート)を持ってしまっています。
そこがいきなり落ちると、既存のセッションが全部落ちます。
そのため、通常のルータよりも障害対策難易度が上がると思われます。
番外編
内部からステルススキャンをする人がいると性能が落ちる？
一度NAT変換テーブルに乗ったセッションに対するNATの処理はASICを使って転送効率を上昇させていると思うのですが、まだ確立していないセッションのためにはルータのCPUを使った処理を行うのではないでしょうか。
例えば、ステルススキャンを内部からバシバシ行うと、その分CPUを使ってしまいます。
ASICに行く前のCPUでの処理ばかりになってしまうためです。
もちろん何らかの対策はするのでしょうが、色々難しそうですよね。
感染した人が外と通信できなくなるウィルスが作成できてしまう？
ISP 全体がNAT を行う環境では、 UDPでランダムなIPアドレスに対してランダムなポートを使ってパケットを送りまくるウィルスに感染すると、ユーザは一定期間外と通信できなくなるかも知れません。 例えば、SQL Slammerのようなウィルスに感染すると、即座にキャリアグレードNAT内におけるNAT変換テーブルを制限一杯までUDPホールパンチングしてしまい、それ以上外と通信できなくなってしまいます。
プロトコル毎に制限数を別に設けたりするだとうとは思いますが、TCPセッションを無駄に張り続けるウィルスによってTCPの変換テーブルを浪費させてしまう事も同様に可能です。
SIPの処理？
プロトコル内部にIPアドレス等がアスキーで埋め込まれているような物を変換しなければならないと思うのですが、例えばプロトコル内部の特定のフィールドに書かれた文字列の置き換えを数十Gbpsの回線で行えるようにするためのチューニングってどれだけ大変なんだろう。。。と思ってしまいます。
全部のパケットに対してやるわけではないのですが、そのような細々とした処理をアプリケーション毎( ALG毎)にやるとして、何種類のALGを有効にして稼動させるのだろう、など色々と妄想してしまいました。
大変そうです ね
キャリアグレー ドNATって本当に大変そうですね。。。 導入当初はかなり色々苦労がありそうだと思った今日この頃でした。
追記：2008年7月10 日
internet draftの最後 にICMP に関しての記述があります。
「 NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP protocol ( ietf - behave - nat- icmp ) 」
と同様に、ポート数制限に達してUDP/TCPによる通信ができない場合には、ICMP destination unreachable messageを code 13 ( Communication administratively prohibited ) で送信すべきであると記述されています。
エンドノード側はICMPを監視していればNATにおいてポート数制限に達した事がわかるという仕様ですね。
将来的にはキャリアグレードと家庭用の両方に付属される機能になると思われますが、面白い仕様だと思ったので追記しました。

Recycling & Waste Management Solutions
The world is changing .
Once there was ‘ waste ’ .
Now society recognises that there are potentially valuable resources that we must all challenge ourselves to recover .
By transforming domestic and commercial waste and recyclables into high quality raw materials and renewable energy we ’re making a big contribution to improving the UK ’s resource efficiency .

The court banned execution for adult rape in 1977
The US Supreme Court has struck down a law that would have allowed the execution of someone convicted of raping a child .
The court said the Louisiana law would have violated the US constitution 's ban on " cruel and unusual punishment " .
" The death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the rape of a child , " wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in his majority opinion .
The justices voted 5 - 4 in favour of striking down the law .
The ruling means that a Louisiana man convicted of raping his stepdaughter in 1998 will not now face the death penalty .
' National consensus '
The US Supreme Court struck down a law allowing the death penalty in cases of adult rape in 1977 , but five states still allowed execution when a child rape had been committed .
Citing the 45 states who had imposed bans on execution for child rape , Justice Kennedy wrote in his opinion that " there is a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape " .
Writing on behalf of the minority of justices who opposed the decision , Justice Samuel Alito said : " The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave .
" It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty . "
Pictured : Man completes world 's biggest piece jigsaw which took six months and has 24,000 pieces
Eric Smith is celebrating after spending the last six months completing the world 's biggest jigsaw .
The 73 - year - old used 24,000 - pieces to complete the huge 12ft by six puzzle , which now stands proudly in his garage .
During the meticulous 179 day process furniture had to be moved out of rooms and a special table built just so Eric had enough room to construct the spectacular jigsaw .
Puzzled : Eric
Smith spent six months completing the world 's biggest jigsaw
But after 537 hours the colourful creation - featuring fish , birds , mammals , planets and buildings - was finally completed by the devoted father of two , luckily with no pieces missing .
Eric , from Baddeley Green , Stoke - On - Trent , is believed to be one of just two people in the UK to have completed the giant brain teaser .
He said : ' This is the nicest jigsaw I have ever done and I am really chuffed at how quick I have done it .
' I found all sorts of different animals as I went along and it is very colourful .
The jigsaw has 10 or 12 puzzles in the one
It has about 10 or 12 different puzzles inside one giant puzzle , I was really pleased to complete it .
' You certainly could n't take a photograph that big , so it 's a very special picture and I keep finding new animals and things in it .
' I have enjoyed spending two or three hours a night on this one . '
Eric started doing the puzzles as a hobby about 30 years ago and has only ever lost three pieces of a jigsaw .
The biggest puzzle he had previously completed was 18,000 pieces but Eric says this was the most enjoyable .
Segment of Eric's ' colourful creation '
The retired sales manager , added : ' I just seem to have a knack of doing jigsaw 's really well , I can't walk past one without finding a couple of pieces and putting them in .
' I can do little ones so quickly that I 'd be getting through one a week .
As soon as I see a new big one out , I have got to get it .
' I have done a number of jigsaws from 10,000 pieces upwards in the past but this is the biggest in the world . '
Eric is now thinking of donating the jigsaw to a new hospital that is being built in North Staffordshire but is still open to suggestions from charities who might want it .
He is looking forward to his next challenge and can't wait for a bigger one to come out .
His wife Marion , aged 76 , admits she has n't got the knack for jigsaws but enjoys seeing them completed .
She said : I would rather do a crossword or embroidery but if it keeps him happy I do n't mind him doing it .
' I love to see them when they are finished , they 're always so colourful .
' Everyone thinks it is marvellous how he does it , because it takes a lot of patience .
' However , it does keep him up late at night if he is engrossed in it .
It can be 2 am when he comes to bed sometimes . '
Royce B. McClure , the jigsaws designer , said on his website : ' The challenge for me in a puzzle of this huge size was to eliminate large areas where no changes take place .
' This , of course , means the puzzle will look quite ' noisy ' when shrunk down on the box or in a brochure .
' I hope that the puzzlers who accept the challenge to do this puzzle understand that if the art looks perfectly pleasing in a small size , then it will drive you mad with boredom when blown up to a huge size then cut up into small single coloured pieces .
' The puzzle comes in four packets , breaking the art up into four vertical sections that join together to make ' Life ' .
' I have tried to make each section different enough from the other sections so that you wo n't feel that you are doing the same puzzle over and over . '
( Emma Graham - Harrison has been a correspondent in Beijing for over three years , mostly covering energy and environment stories .
She previously reported for Reuters from Madrid and London .
In the following story , she describes her day - long hike into the cut - off epicentre of the Wenchuan earthquake and the devastation and generosity she found when she got there . )
Reuters journalist Emma Graham - Harrison is pictured in front of the debris of collapsed buildings at Wenchuan County , the epicenter of the earthquake , Sichuan province , May 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Xinhua
YINGXIU , China ( Reuters ) -
An aftershock jolted me awake with the thuds of collapsing buildings .
We were sleeping in a tent far from the tottering remains of Yangzi but still , it was a long time before my heart stopped racing .
A stream of dirty , red-eyed refugees had staggered along the river bank the previous evening as , after more than eight hours of walking and hitch - hiking along a buckled , broken road , we made it to the epicenter of China ’s deadliest quake in decades .
Someone who was leaving handed me a spare gauze square as a face mask : I gratefully tied it over my mouth and nose .
It was meant as a barrier against disease , asbestos from collapsed buildings and the smell of rotting corpses , in a city where officials say nearly 80 percent of residents may have died .
Helicopters roared in and out , flinging dust over the wounded who waited under dirty quilts with mangled arms and legs , to be carried away from the wreckage of their lives and families .
Behind them all , where Yingxiu once stood , were snarled piles of concrete and metal , rows of the dead lying in the streets just meters from makeshift refugee camps , and what looked like a grotesque experiment in engineering .
Fewer than half the town ’s buildings were standing and almost none was upright .
Some leaned forward or back , others tipped at 45 degrees to the ground , supported by piles of rubble , their doors and windows opening to the sky .
DISINFECTANT
I went looking for the primary school , which residents said collapsed like tens of others in the quake zone .
Finding anything is difficult in a town stripped of its buildings and with streets buried in rubble .
When survivors pointed vaguely “ over there ” , it left me no clearer but with no landmarks , I was n’t sure what more to ask .
Eventually I found someone to guide me , who -- without my asking -- pointed out trapped corpses in ruins along the way .
I wondered if he had led other journalists there .
Did he find us ghoulish , flocking to the scene to unearth tragedies while others uncovered survivors ?
In the school courtyard , bodies were lined up in untidy rows beside the national flagpole .
What was left of Yingxiu ’s government had decided there was nowhere safe to bury the bodies and banned parents from taking them away .
Most were covered , but two small feet were left sticking out from beneath one tarpaulin .
I tried to count the dead .
Two soldiers arrived with the spraying kits that small - scale Chinese farmers use to apply pesticide to their crops and started walking up and down , showering the small bodies with disinfectant .
As it dripped slowly down the soles of the young boy ’s feet , I found I was crying and turned away in shame from the grieving mothers nearby .
My normal world was less than 40 km ( 25 miles ) away , but it seemed impossibly distant .
A BOWL OF NOODLES
I had come with three Chinese photographers from Dujiangyan .
It had been badly hit but was still accessible by road and was bustling with rescue efforts as cash , aid and experts poured in .
Still , the scale of the disaster was so vast that even there I had watched desperate searchers , unable to find firefighters or soldiers to help , bury a neighbor ’s family deeper in debris as they tried to reach their own loved ones .
So I wanted to know what help was reaching those at the mountainous , remote epicenter .
But as the damaged road to Yingxiu snaked out of mobile phone coverage , through tunnels and over precipitous landslides , I wondered if I was wise to come .
We walked for hours under a harsh sun while injured and shaken refugees streamed in the opposite direction , towards shelter and safety .
The only glimmer of comfort was the generosity and courage of the survivors .
Some ferried the weak and injured on motorbikes down still - passable stretches of road ; one farmer spent her day boiling clean water for anyone who needed it .
In Yingxiu , people who had lost everything kept trying to press food and water on me .
One old woman mourning her foster daughter had -- unbeknown to me -- told her husband to prepare me a bowl of noodles while I was interviewing her .
When he brought it over , I tried hard to refuse .
Guilt about eating refugees ’ food was the last emotion I wanted to add to the mix that often threatened to engulf me .
But they were so insistent -- and worried I was rejecting the food because I thought it was dirty -- I felt I had no choice .
I wolfed the noodles down , embarrassed but grateful after 24 hours of biscuits and peanuts .
I gave them some money in return , although there was nothing to buy and no one to buy it from .
Protesting without police clearance could result in demonstrators being charged under extraordinary new powers which came into effect yesterday .
The sweeping nature of the regulations is threatening to create a legal and political minefield with protesters apparently willing to test both the scope of the laws and the willingness of the authorities to uphold them .
Chris MacIsaac , the president of the victims ' group Broken Rites , said his organisation was warned of the sweeping new powers during a police briefing .
" It will anger a lot of people who are very frustrated as they can't get anywhere with the church and now they are losing the right to get out there and tell the world , " he said .
__________

Other protesters said they would defy the regulations , and risk a $ 5500 fine .
" We will protect our civil liberties , and help young people to protect their health , and no Pope or premier will stop us , " said Rachel Evans , a spokeswoman for the NoToPope coalition , which is planning to hand out condoms at a July 19 rally .
An online retailer is selling T - shirts that may " cause annoyance " to pilgrims .
" $ 5500 - a small price to pay for annoying Catholics , " reads one .
" Good luck , Pope .
I 've been waiting for a miracle at Randwick for years , " says another .
The NSW Police Commissioner , Andrew Scipione , said the new laws were no different from existing police powers for sporting venues .
But in a written statement , police refused to rule out prohibiting T - shirts or condom hand - outs .
" Anyone engaging in behaviour so as to prevent people from across the world participating in the event , or impacting on their ability to participate , will need to be dealt with , " the statement said .
The president of the NSW Bar Association , Anna Katzmann , said the regulations were far less defined than other " annoyance or inconvenience " legislation .
In the Mount Panorama Motor Racing Act and the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Act , people must be " disorderly or insulting " before they can be removed .
Talkback radio , online forums and the Herald 's letters page were flooded with criticism of the new rules .
" That we have had our right to protest effectively snuffed out is a mockery to those of us who have been harmed by the Catholic Church , " wrote Stephen Kilkeary , who said he , his siblings and his late mother suffered " horrendous abuse at the hands of the Catholic clergy " .
Police have begun arranging meetings with a range of possible protesters and pranksters , from anti-homophobia and pro-contraception activists , to victims of abuse , and even comedians from The Chaser .
The Opposition Leader , Barry O'Farrell , said the Government should reveal who requested the regulations .
The Catholic Church said " neither the Catholic Church nor Cardinal Pell asked for the additional police powers " , adding " we understand some people may want to protest and they have the right to do so peacefully and lawfully " .
The Minister for World Youth Day , Kristina Keneally , said the Government framed the laws on advice from police and after consulting the church .
She stressed they were not drafted at the behest of Cardinal George Pell .

It sounds so strange that the two first names are so close in comparison .
It ’s almost 7 years now that our president Mr. Bush has not yet filled his promise of capture .
The one thing I know for sure is that he ( Bush ) will go down as the worst president in US history , but that does n’t bring back the 4000 soldiers who died for our country or the capture of Osama bin Laden .
I am not sure that Obama if elected , will do any better being handed off a huge deficit , and foreign relation issues .
Where do we go from here ?
Everyday I think of the two names and wonder if the anti-Christ will rise as our next president .
The names are close , but not exact .
I am not sure if our next generation will have a chance to even make it in the next 20 years .
You can forget about Social Security , it will be gone long before I turn 65 , which is in 19 years .
What are we to think come election time ?
I mean who else is even close to being elected ?
It ’s definitely not the old man McCain .
The man is going through father time and that is not what this country needs .
I love America for all it stands for , but America is not the same or even close to what it was back in the early 90’s .
Our country is now stricken by poor leadership and the lack of good government .
I needed to vent as the 7th anniversary of 9/11 is approaching , and being close to that horrific day still makes me want to join the service and fight for revenge , but no service will take a 46 year old man .
If they ever change the age limit to serve and fight for this country , just give me a pen !
God bless and a safe return to all our men and women who served with bravery for our country .
Led Zeppelin - The Ride Coming To Hard Rock Park
Article written by :
Eric Gieszl , Editor
Myrtle Beach , S.C. – Details were announced today about one of Hard Rock Park 's most anticipated attractions , Led Zeppelin – The Ride .
The six - inversion looping roller coaster is one of more 40 attractions opening next spring at the rock ' n ' roll theme park in Myrtle Beach .
" We 've partnered with the most iconic hard rock band of all time to create a truly unique and exciting experience that will serve as one of our signature attractions , " said Steven Goodwin , CEO of Hard Rock Park .
Led Zeppelin –
The Ride will ascend over 150 feet into the sky and feature a high fidelity on - board audio system that soars to Led Zeppelin's hit single " Whole Lotta Love , " creating an unprecedented sensory experience for riders .
Hard Rock Park worked closely with band members Jimmy Page , Robert Plant and John Paul Jones on all aspects of Led Zeppelin – The Ride , including the ride 's name , logo , and overall look and feel of the vehicles .
The band selected " Whole Lotta Love " as the theme song for the attraction .
" Our relationship with Led Zeppelin is just one strong example of the support and authenticity Hard Rock Park is receiving from the rock community , " added Goodwin .
Industry leading roller coaster designers Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland were hired by Hard Rock Park to design and manufacture the ride .
The roller coaster 's layout starts with a straight drop into a vertical loop , followed by a double inversion cobra roll , zero - G roll , vertical loop and a corkscrew .
Three helixes are also mixed into the second half of the ride .
Guest looking for a preview of Led Zeppelin - The Ride can do so by visiting the Hard Rock Park Backstage Tour in Myrtle Beach , SC .
Beginning April 18 , the Backstage Tour will feature a model of the Bolliger & Mabillard manufactured ride and brief computer graphic simulator with binaural sounds that creates a life - like sensory experience for visitors .
Admission to the Backstage Tour is free for all visitors .
The world 's first rock ' n ' roll theme park is currently under construction and slated to open in May 2008 .
Hard Rock Park built on 140 - acres will feature more than 40 attractions for " rockers " of all ages .
For more information , see Hard Rock Park or visit www.hardrockpark.com.

My handgun , my parasite / Never forget :
The brutal effects of the Bush regime will be felt for generations
Ah , so this is how it 's gonna be .
Like recurring cancer .
No , more like a rogue rash , an STD , flaring up at unexpected times and in unexpected places and when it fades , you gently let yourself forget all about it until it suddenly erupts and hits hard and ruins your day , and then you can only sit back and moan softly , slather on ointment , shudder .
Wait , one more : Maybe it 's most like a nasty intestinal worm , a wicked parasite like those you suck down in India or deep Mexico or the jungles of Indonesia , the kind that burrow deep and attach to all manner of essential organs and induce a wicked bout of dysentery or all - over body convulsion , until you finally crawl out of the hospital and drown in antibiotics and slowly work your way back to semi- health — but only semi , because of course you are never quite the same .
This is where we are .
This is the state of the nation after having swallowed the malicious worm of Bush .
We have , by all accounts , suffered — and somehow survived — the very worst of the illness , the cancer , the oozing spirit .
But now , as America 's worst president prepares to amble off the stage he never deserved to be on in the first place , it is time to prepare for any number of convulsions , aftershock , excruciating reminders .
Here is your Bush - loaded Supreme Court , for one regrettable example , addressing the much - misinterpreted Second Amendment for the first time in eons .
Here is the majority of the court basically arguing that , in case you forgot , much of America still blindly loves its guns , and of course handguns are a nice addition to any God-fearing family 's arsenal of ridiculous self - defense weaponry and therefore banning a device designed to do nothing but kill other humans is just plain wrong .
It is , by all accounts , a severe , dark cloud of a decision , loaded with sadness and a feeling of despair , the cruel notion that America is still defined by its love of violence , or even the utterly phony idea , put forth by Justice Antonin Scalia himself , that only violence prevents violence , or that the answer to the gun problem is , quite simply , more guns , because surely that 's what the founding fathers intended , more paranoid NASCAR dads stocking Glocks in the rec room to protect the rug rats from those icky drug - dealing rapists who never come .
Is it worth mentioning how handguns kept in the home are much more likely to be used for suicides and homicides , not to mention fondled by those same curious rug rats who find daddy 's little Elvis in the sock drawer and decide to aim it at their sisters ?
Worth pointing out that the self - defense argument is not only pathetically illogical , part of a silly pseudo - cowboy mythology , it 's also statistically untrue , a perpetual , insidious lie that 's undermined the American identity for generations ?
Nah .
Let us not stare down that particular barrel of gloom just now .
Instead , let us prepare .
Let us steel ourselves .
As we head into the Obama era and as the GOP juggernaut mercifully sputters and lurches back to the cave of 1950 , let us be reminded that escaping the Bush aftermath is n't going to be all wine and roses and new energy policies .
See , we 've been enjoying a small reprieve .
These past six months or so , it 's been sort of delightful to finally turn our attention toward the imminent Democratic sea change and away from the ravages of the Bush disease , to finally look toward the new , as we get to focus on all those things we might be able to do once we get out of this damn hospital and get the weak - kneed Democratic Party out of second gear .
But oh , not so fast .
Let us be reminded , the Bush virus will be with us for years , generations .
Aside from the shambles of Iraq and the Middle East , aside from handguns and the decided mixed blessing of the Supreme Court 's recent spate of decisions , there are maneuvers and decisions we do n't even know about , nefarious arrangements , a corruption so deep that normally staid historians are behaving more like alarmed climate - change scientists :
We know it 's going to be bad , but we just do n't know how bad .
There are destroyed nations , mauled infrastructures , horribly compromised federal agencies from FEMA to the EPA , the CIA to the FCC .
There is a rogue outsourced military , citizens who can no longer sue gun manufacturers , six straight years of increased poverty , untold numbers of homophobic , misogynistic judicial appointees , devastating environmental policies the consequences of which could take generations to comprehend , much less repair .
Where do you dare to look ?
Women 's rights ?
Science ?
Foreign policy ?
Currency devaluation ?
Big Oil ?
Halliburton 's billions in war profit ?
Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and the Dick Cheney agenda of torture and pre-emptive aggression ?
What about unchecked corporate cronyism , the shunning of the United Nations and of international law , Homeland Security , the Patriot Act , wiretapping and surveillance and " evildoers " galore ?
And finally , what of all those families , the thousands of dead U.S. soldiers , the tens of thousands of brain - damaged , disabled , permanently wounded ?
Bush 's legacy is n't just one of staggering social ineptitude combined with shocking success at serving his corporate masters .
It 's foremost a legacy soaked to the bone in blood .
Truly , I firmly believe the record will reveal that no president in modern history has done more to unravel the American identity , to dumb down the populace and cater to the basest instincts of man than the one about to mispronounce his way into the history books .
Even Nixon did n't leave office with Bush 's incredible range of ignominy .
Ironically , this is why many in the GOP are chuckling in secret , rubbing their hands together , plotting their revenge .
They know the colossal pile of issues and problems Barack Obama will inherit is so overwhelming , so unsolvable , it does n't matter how smart and aggressive he might be .
It does n't matter that he 'll have a Democratic Congress .
He 's just plain doomed .
Combine this with America 's infamous short attention span , and within a few years , just watch as the GOP emerges from the murky depths , the champion of a " new " solution .
I know , it can seem bleak .
Insurmountable , even .
But here 's the lesson of any major injury , of surviving a serious illness and getting on with your life .
Often , it 's not merely about letting time heal all wounds .
It 's not always about ignoring the scar , or looking away from our permanent deformity and pretend we do n't now walk with a savage limp .
It 's far more about learning to live with the violence that 's been wreaked upon the national body , letting the scale of the wound fuel us , shock us back to life .
Question is , do we have enough optimistic ointment to cover it all ?

( CNN ) -- Paul
House says you 'll have to excuse him if he is n't feeling especially patriotic this Fourth of July .
House , 46 , spent 22 years on Tennessee 's death row for the rape and murder of his neighbor , Carolyn Muncey , in 1985 .
Thanks to an appeals court ruling , House was released Wednesday , two years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that new DNA evidence could have led a jury to acquit him .
House , who has multiple sclerosis , is thrilled to be spending July Fourth with his family for the first time in more than 22 years .
But he admits that his experience has changed him .
" I 'm not patriotic at all , and I do n't think I should be because of what those idiots have done to me , " House said Friday in a phone interview from his mother 's home in Crossville , Tennessee .
" I think I may have forgiven them , but who knows . "
Despite his reluctant patriotism , House is looking forward to the BBQ and fireworks his mother has prepared .
" I gave up on feeling anything , but boy , I 'm in mama 's house now and I feel good , better than I felt in prison , " he said .
" Prison sucks . "

His mother , Joyce , says having her son home makes this Independence Day even more special .
" It feels great .
I do n't have to worry about him every night and every day .
It 's just fantastic , " she said .
Looking ahead , Joyce House 's days will be filled with caring for her son and shuttling him among doctors .
She has also retrofitted her home with rails and a ramp so he can get around in a wheelchair .
" I 've done my research so I 'm ready for it .
It 's better than him being in prison , " she said .
House denies that he was involved in Muncey 's death .
He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court based on new tests that revealed the presence of DNA from Muncey 's husband on her body .
The high court sent his case back to district court , where U.S. District Court Judge Harry Mattice Jr. ruled in December that the state must retry House or release him .
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judge 's decision .
House is scheduled for retrial in October , though prosecutors will not seek the death penalty .
As he awaits trial , House says he is looking forward to sitting on his mother 's back deck , watching television and maybe playing a game of poker .
But most of all , he is looking forward to the food .
" I 'm sitting here eating a Nestle Crunch bar and it tastes great , " he said .
" They do n't feed you too well in prison . "

This is clothes dryer that vents directly into a chimney , above the boiler vent .
Nothing like adding more moisture to the hydrocarbons from the oil - fired boiler to really eat the insides away !

Look Before You Rinse
I remember during training I was instructed to look under the cabinet before turning on the water .
During this foreclosure , someone took out the drain and P - trap on this bathroom sink .
Now I bring spare towels just in case .

Seems they ran out of furnace flue pipe before they got through the roof .
Nice cap , though — I guess it 's there in case the roof leaks .
And yes , that 's asbestos cloth above as a safety precaution .

A dungeon - based adventure for 5th - level characters .
It should have been the end .
When the bloodthirsty adventurers burst into his throne room and mercilessly cut him down , the tale of Merlokrep , last king of the ill - fated Truescale Tribe , should have ended .
But the fates were n’t yet finished with the Kobold King , and now a dark power has brought him back from the dark beyond to wreak his vengeance upon those foolish adventurers who destroyed his tribe .
Revenge of the Kobold King is compatible with the world ’s most popular roleplaying game .
This takes your heroes back beneath the haunted trees of Darkmoon Wood and into an ancient Azlanti crypt in search of the all - too - familiar monsters that are brutally murdering the people of Falcon ’s Hollow .
This adventure returns to Darkmoon Vale , an area of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting first visited in D1 : Crown of the Kobold King and E1 : Carnival of Tears , and further detailed in Pathfinder Chronicles : Guide to Darkmoon Vale .
Written by Nicolas Logue .
This 16 - page adventure was initially made available for Free RPG Day on June 21 , 2008 .
The print edition of this product is limited to one per customer .
It is not included in the Pathfinder Modules subscription .
Conan O'Brien 's commencement address for Harvard 's Class of 2000 is one of the best speeches I 've ever heard .
As you would expect , the speech is filled with Conan 's trademark self - effacing humor .
But the real gems come at the second half of the speech , when Conan talks about his old days working at SNL and Wilson 's House of Leather .
Here 's the entire speech :
( Additional video links )
Here 's my favorite part of the speech :
I 've dwelled on my failures today because , as graduates of Harvard , your biggest liability is your need to succeed .
Your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve .
Because success is a lot like a bright , white tuxedo .
You feel terrific when you get it , but then you 're desperately afraid of getting it dirty , of spoiling it in any way .
I left the cocoon of Harvard , I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live , I left the cocoon of The Simpsons .
And each time it was bruising and tumultuous .
And yet , every failure was freeing , and today I 'm as nostalgic for the bad as I am for the good .
So , that 's what I wish for all of you : the bad as well as the good .
Fall down , make a mess , break something occasionally .
And remember that the story is never over .
Read Conan 's entire speech here .
Most of the time we see Conan as the charming village idiot who entertains us by dancing with the Masturbating Bear .
He has so effortlessly charmed his way into our living rooms that we forget his stardom was by no means guaranteed .
It was nice getting to see the more introspective side of Conan and his gloriously muddied tuxedo .

Iran in warning to US and Israel
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes Iran will strike Israel and the US navy in the Gulf if it is attacked over its nuclear programme , a senior Iranian official has warned .
" The first US shot on Iran would set the United States ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said Ali Shirazi , an aide to Iran 's supreme leader .
" Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire , " he said .
Tehran denies Western claims that it is seeking to build a nuclear weapon .
It has repeatedly rejected demands to halt enriching uranium , which can be used as fuel for power plants or material for weapons if refined to a greater degree .
The European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran in June .
But it has offered a package of incentives to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran has said it is prepared to negotiate with major world powers , but insisted the talks must address Iran 's nuclear rights .
No ' bullying '
Ali Shirazi is a cleric working as representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the naval unit of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards .
His comments come amid reports of possible US or Israeli plans to strike Iran 's nuclear facilities .
The Iranian nation will never accept bullying
Ali Shirazi
Aide to Iran 's supreme leader " The Zionist regime is pressuring White House officials to attack Iran .
If they commit such a stupidity , Tel Aviv and US shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran 's first targets and they will be burned in Iran 's crushing response , " Mr Shirazi was quoted as saying by Iranian news agencies .
" The Iranian nation will never accept bullying .
The Iranian nation is a nation of believers which believes in jihad and martyrdom .
No army in the world can confront it , " he said .
Last week , the top US military officer said opening up a new front in the Middle East - after Iraq and Afghanistan - would be " extremely stressful " for US forces .
Adm Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was commenting on the likelihood of US or Israeli military action over Iran 's nuclear programme .
President George W Bush has maintained that all options are on the table but that military action against Iran will not be his first choice .

What are these ?
An implementation of an ( almost ) std : : map compatible data structure which offers better performance and memory utilization .
Introduction
std :: map is a one of the most useful containers in the standard template library ( STL ) .
It allows the implementation of sorted dictionaries .
It is usually implemented using a red - black tree data - structure which guarantees a good ( O( log n ) ) performance , and is the container - of - choice for most tasks ( unless you are using a new Standard Library implementation - e.g. , Visual Studio 2008 with Feature Pack 1 or GCC 4.2 - in which case , you can use the new TR1 unordered_map and unordered_set ) .
Although std::map and std:: set are good enough for most tasks , the red - black tree implementation is no speed - demon .
The provided code implements a " drop - in " replacement for std ::map and std:: set ( we have n't implemented the multi- variants ) , which benchmarks show is two times faster .
Note that the implementation imposes restrictions on the Key type for the map : a special " infinity " value is required .
Boost and a modern C++ compiler are required .
Using the Code
smap and sset are drop - in replacements for std ::map and std:: set , respectively .
Here is an example of using smap :
#include < iostream > # include " sti/smap " using namespace sti ; int main ( ) { typedef smap< char , int > Map ; Map my_map ; my_map.insert(std::make_pair( ' a ' , 1 ) ) ; my_map.insert(std::make_pair( ' A ' , 1 ) ) ; my_map.insert(std::make_pair( ' b ' , 2 ) ) ; my_map.insert(std::make_pair( ' B ' , 2 ) ) ; Map::const_iterator it = my_map.find ( ' a ' ) ; std::cout << " my_map [ " << it -> first << " ]= " << it -> second << std::endl ; my_map [ ' a ' ] = 10 ; for ( it = my_map.begin ( ) ; it != my_map.end ( ) ; ++it ) { std::cout << " my_map [ " << it -> first << " ]= " << it -> second << std::endl ; } my_map.erase ( ' a ' ) ; it = my_map.find ( ' b' ) ; my_map.erase ( it ) ; std::cout << " Items : " << my_map.size ( ) << std::endl ; return 0 ; }
Similarly , for sset :
#include < iostream > # include " sti/sset.h " using namespace sti ; int main ( ) { typedef sset < int >
Set ; Set my_set ; my_set.insert( 1 ) ; my_set.insert( 10 ) ; if ( my_set.find ( 1 ) != my_set.end ( ) ) std::cout << " Found 1 in set " << std::endl ; else std::cout << " Could n't find 1 in set " << std::endl ; return 0 ; }
sset and smap are defined in sset.h and smap.h respectively , and defined as follows :
namespace sti { template < class Key , class Type , class Traits = std::less < key > , class Allocator = std::allocator<std:: pair < const Key , Type > > , int BN = 48 , class key_policy = default_stree_key_policy < Key > , class value_policy = default_smap_value_policy < Key , Type > , class gist_traits = default_gist_traits < Key > > class smap ; template < class Key , class Traits = std::less < Key > , class Allocator = std::allocator< Key > , int BN = 48 , </key>class key_policy = default_stree_key_policy <Key > , class gist_traits = default_gist_traits < Key > < key /> > class sset ; }</key >
Template parameters
Choosing BN
Except for the last ( BN ) template parameter , this definition is identical to std : : map and std:: set .
BN is similar to the " order " of a B - Tree - it defines how many elements should be kept in a single node .
Playing with this value can have significant impact on performance .
BN values of 32 to 128 seem to perform well ( see Implementation below for more details ) .
key_policy
key_policy controls how keys are stored in internal nodes ( see implementation below ) .
key_policy can be either std::tr1:: true_type or std::tr1 :: false_type .
If key_policy is true_type , keys are stored " as-is " and are copied around as needed ( when splitting / merging ) using memmove ( ) .
Otherwise , only pointers to keys are stored in the node itself , along with a " gist " ( size_t ) value which is calculated from the key ( using gist_traits ) .
By default , for small , simple types ( POD types - int , char , etc. ) , key_policy is true_type , while for other types , it is false_type .
We do n't want to store more complex types as part of the node , since moving them ( for split / merge operations ) will be expensive ( and wrong , as we then must call the copy constructor ) .
It is therefore recommended to use the default key_policy , and in any case , do not use true_type for types that require a non-trivial copy constructor .
gist_traits
The gist_traits parameter is only valid when key_policy is true_type .
When key_policy is true_type , we only keep pointers to the keys in the inner nodes .
Comparing these pointers will cost us in performance ( see below - Memory as a Bottleneck ) .
Keep a " cheap " value in the node itself that can be used to compare values quickly ( comparing two integral values is virtually " free " ) .
Here 's a code that explains the idea :
struct KeyWrapper { KeyType * _key ; size_t _gist ; } ; bool less ( KeyWrapper l , KeyWrapper r ) { if ( l._gist < r._gist ) return true ; else if ( l._gist > r._gist ) return false ; else retrurn less ( l -> _key , r->_key ) ; }
If gist < sub > 1</ sub > is the gist of key < sub > 1</ sub > , and gist 2 is the gist of key < sub > 2</ sub > , then the following must hold :
if key < sub>1</sub > < key < sub>2</sub > , then gist < sub>1</sub > <= gist < sub>2</sub >
, then If key < sub >1</ sub > == key < sub>2</sub > , then gist < sub>1</sub > == gist < sub>2</sub >
, then if key < sub >1</sub > > key < sub>2</sub > , then gist < sub>1</sub > >= gist < sub>2</sub >
A default gist_traits is provided that simply returns 0 for all keys .
For string s , a specialization is provided that implements the following ( sizeof ( char ) ==1 for simplicity ) :
struct string_gist { const static size_t chars_per_size_t = sizeof ( size_t ) ; size_t operator ( ) ( const std : : string& s ) const { sz = std :: min(sz , chars_per_size_t ) ; size_t r = 0 ; for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < sz ; ++i ) r = ( r < < 8 ) + ( size_t ) c[ i ] ; return r ; } } ;
value_policy
The value_policy parameter controls how an item is stored in the map .
If value_policy is false_type , then each item inserted into the map is allocated separately , and a reference to the item is guaranteed to be valid ( unless the item is erase ( ) d , of course ) .
If value_policy is true_type on the other hand , the items are stored as part of the stree nodes - and therefore can be reallocated when these nodes are split or merged .
By default , value_policy is true_type if both key and value are simple , small types , and false_type otherwise .
Performance
A simple benchmark is provided with the source .
The benchmark creates a large container , then erase ( ) , find ( ) , and insert ( ) are called repeatedly with random values .
The same benchmark is performed for a std : : map<int , int > and smap<int , int > .
Here are the results when compiling with Visual Studio 2008 with standard " Release " optimizations ( Core 2 6400 , 2GB memory running on WinXP ) :
STL map time : 1548678032 smap time : 740111472
smap therefore shows x2.09 performance improvement vs. std::map .
Caveat
To simplify implementation , all iterators are invalidated if the container is modified , so the following code which ( should ) work with std : : map will throw an exception :
smap<int , int > m ; smap<int , int > :: iteraor it ; for ( it = m.begin ( ) ; it != m.end ( ) ; ++it ) { if ( it -> second == 1 ) erase ( ++ it ) ; }
As a workaround , erase ( iterator ) returns an iterator to the next element after the element deleted , so we can write instead ( this will also work with Visual Studio 's STL implementation which extends erase ( ) in the same way ) :
smap<int , int > m ; smap<int , int > :: iteraor it ; for ( it = m.begin ( ) ; it != m.end ( ) ; ++it ) { if ( it -> second == 1 ) it = erase ( it ) ;
In addition , there is a limitation on the Key type : a special infinite ( ) value is required which must be larger than any key .
Implementation
Memory as bottleneck
The basic idea of stree is that in modern architectures , memory has become the main performance bottleneck : accessing a random main - memory location requires tens ( and in some cases , hundreds ) of clock cycles .
New memory architectures mainly improve the transfer rate : once you get to a memory location , reading 1 or 100 bytes takes about the same time .
Cache memory reduces memory - access latency by storing a low - latency copy of frequently used memory - accessing random ( or wide - spread ) memory locations will result in cache misses .
Disk - based data structures face the same issues - e.g. , caching ; high cost of accessing the first bit vs. accessing the next one , etc .
The solution - using " flatter " trees ( B - Trees ) and keeping multiple items together , is now appropriate for memory - based data structures .
A bit on skip lists
A skip - list is basically a sorted linked - list with " shortcuts " which allow a fast ( O( n ) on average ) find operation .
To construct a skip - list , start with a sorted linked list ( let 's call this the 0 - level list ) .
Now , choose ( randomly ) half of the nodes and connect them by another linked - list ( the 1 - level list ) .
Now , choose randomly half the nodes in the 1 - level list and create a 2 - level list , and so - on until no elements are chosen for some level .
To search a linked - list , start by progressing along the highest - level list , " dropping " to the next level , if progressing to the next node will get us past the desired element .
On average , no more than 3 elements need to be examined in each level .
The 1 - 2 - 3 Top - Down skip - lists
Munro , Papadakis , and Sedgewick have proposed an alternative version of the skip - list which is deterministic .
In addition , they described a simpler implementation of the skip - list - the 1 - 2 - 3 Top - Down skip - list .
Here is an example of a 1 - 2 - 3 skip list :
This structure is similar to a binary tree with the node leafs connected in a linked - list .
Search starts with the head node at the top left ( 48 ) , and goes right as long as the searched key is greater than the node 's key , in which case , we drop to the next level and continue our search .
Similar to a B +
Tree , items are stored only in the leafs .
Unlike a skip - list , this is a deterministic data structure : the " gap " between two nodes is always between 2 and 3 .
For example , there is a 3 - node gap between the head node ( 48 ) and the node to its right .
That gap includes the nodes 13 , 30 , and 48 at the middle level .
Similarly , there is a 2 - node gap between nodes 13 and 30 at the middle level , which includes the nodes 9 and 13 at the bottom .
Whenever the gap goes outside the allowed range ( 2 - 3 ) , the structure is fixed by adding ( or removing ) nodes .
stree
The 1 - 2 - 3 skip list allows only gaps of size of at most 3 .
However , there is nothing to prevent us from allowing larger gaps .
This will somewhat reduce the memory requirements ( less inner nodes ) , but will increase the search time ( need to check more items per level ) .
Another possible modification would be to store all nodes of a single gap in an array , which we call an stree .
Here is the stree version of the same skip - list :
By allowing larger gaps ( up to BN ) and replacing the link - list of items in a gap by an array , we get a data - structure quite similar to a B +
Tree .

The Ostrovsky Files
Israeli Finger on the Nuclear Trigger Could Turn the Next Israeli - Arab War Into a Conflagration
By Victor Ostrovsky
It is the finger of a Libyan colonel or an Iranian ayatollah , on the nuclear trigger , that causes western leaders their worst nightmares .
At the same time the historical fact that Israel has been on the verge of using such a weapon does not seem to bother them at the least .
For example , during the Yom - Kippur war in October , 1973 , Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan wanted to nuke Damascus on two occasions , once when the war was not going well and then again when the Golan was retaken and Dayan wanted to teach the Syrians a lesson they would not soon forget .
A veto by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir saved the day .
The fact that instead of affirming possession of the ultimate weapon Israel has resorted to a “ winking denial ” raises special concern .
The point of obtaining a nuclear device is its deterrent capabilities .
Therefore , keeping it a secret defeats its purpose .
However , the Israeli government ’s long - term stance of officially denying that it has the weapons while letting the world assume that it has hundreds of them ( not to mention a sophisticated delivery system such as the “ ANAK ” missile ) puts the entire world in jeopardy .
Most observers believe that Israeli officials reason that an admission that they have nuclear weapons would force the United States to take action against Israel similar to the actions it took against India and Pakistan after they detonated their nuclear devices earlier this year .
That belief , however , is false .
Israel was denying that it has the ultimate weapon long before the United States passed a law forcing the president to cut off U.S. aid to countries with nuclear weapons development programs .
A second point Israeli officials and their supporters argue is that Israel developed these weapons for defense purposes only , and that admitting their existence would start a nuclear race in the region and cause further nuclear weapons proliferation in the world .
False again .
Since it allows rumors of its nuclear weapons capability to persist , Israel already is the catalyst for an arms race in the region .
As for the proliferation of such weapons , it was Israel that provided a nuclear program to South Africa which that country dismantled after the fall of its apartheid government .
Israel also transferred technology and expert advice to India for its nuclear weapons program .
( An Israeli businessman who was well connected to Mossad was the intermediary who sold the Canadian CanDo reactor to India . )
In doing so , Israel in effect forced Pakistan to build a bomb to counter the Indian threat and , therefore , in a roundabout way , was responsible for the first so - called “ Islamic bomb . ”
So why has Israel kept its nuclear weapons arsenal a secret for so long ?
There are only two possible reasons for such a move :
Israel expected to use the weapons as a first strike device and by denying their existence hoped to maintain the element of surprise .
Admitting the existence of such weapons would force Israel to accept a territorial compromise with Syria over the Golan Heights , because the nuclear umbrella would eliminate the strategic value of the territory it holds .
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said in a May 8 , 1998 interview1 that the purpose of developing nuclear weapons was to bring Israel to Oslo , not Hiroshima .
But Peres failed to point out that there could arise in Israel a leader who might use such a weapon at a lower threshold than Peres would have agreed to .
And since there was no public discussion of the matter — as officially it did not exist — he was in effect handing the doomsday machine he had created into the hands of whomever was elected Israeli prime minister .
That is a scary thought for those familiar with Israeli history .
For example , former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion , one of the country ’s founding fathers , called Menachem Begin , who later also became an Israeli prime minister , a “ Hitler ” and Peres himself accused Binyamin Netanyahu of fixing the elections , not to mention inciting right - wing extremists to assassinate Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .
Yet Netanyahu now is the one whose finger is on the nuclear trigger .
And to the surprise of many of his Labor Party colleagues , Peres is now kowtowing to Netanyahu as a result of infighting within the Israeli Labor Party .
( The enemy of my enemy is my friend , and Peres ’s new enemy is Labor Party leader Ehud Barak . )
As things stand today , the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons is probably the greatest danger to world peace .
If there should be another war in the Middle East — and as things appear today one is coming unless Israel can come to terms with Syria — most Israelis will regard it as one that could have been prevented .
If this becomes the prevailing attitude , large numbers of Israeli reserve officers and soldiers will find ways to avoid taking part .
In several surveys that the Israeli military has itself conducted over the past few years , it has found that the majority of its reserve forces prefer to find ways not to serve .
That phenomenon is a new one in the state of Israel , and is cause for great alarm .
As things stand today the military is making its best efforts not to send reserve soldiers into Lebanon or into the occupied territories , mainly because the government is afraid the soldiers will refuse orders to serve there ( as many already routinely do , preferring to serve the time in jail instead ) .
The structure of the Israeli military is such that the regular army , with career officers and noncoms and conscript rank and file , is there to blunt an initial attack while allowing the reserves time to mobilize and move into action to push the enemy back .
Should the Syrians decide on a limited land grab on the Golan ( as predicted by Israeli military intelligence in the event of a permanent halt in the peace process ) , and should the secondary defense line crumble due to the unwillingness of the Israeli populace to fight , Israeli leaders might fear that the country is about to be overrun , as they did in 1973 .
In that case the use of weapons of last resort might appear plausible , or even essential .
As the whiskers of the nuclear cat are slowly allowed to emerge from the proverbial bag , the Israeli government will be looking for a pretext to prove that Israel was not the first to introduce weapons of mass destruction into the region .
It is for this reason that Iran is dragged into the picture .
Netanyahu and his cronies are attempting — quite successfully I might add — to demonstrate to the world that Iran is developing nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of destroying the state of Israel .
As Iran is an extremist Islamic state which officially proclaims its hatred toward the U.S. and Israel , one might believe that what Netanyahu is telling us is true .
The facts , however , are quite different .
In fact , Israel is one of Iran ’s lesser worries .
With the inexperienced nearby Muslim states emerging from Soviet bondage , an all but mad regime in Afghanistan next door , and traditionally hostile Iraq on Iran ’s other side , Iran is not to get weapons of mass destruction to free Jerusalem , but rather to protect itself and its vast oil fields from the hands of its greedy new neighbors .
The only relevance of such Iranian weapons to Israel would be to demonstrate that Iran would have the capability to retaliate in case of a first strike by Israel against Iran .

Internet service provider Embarq eavesdropped on the web surfing habits of 26,000 customers in Kansas without notifying them personally , as part of its test of new , controversial advertising technology that profiles users , the company told federal lawmakers Wednesday .
Embarq , an offshoot from Sprint , tested the service in Gardner , Kansas , saying it was their smallest facility .
The secret test ended earlier this year , though no dates were given for when it started or stopped .
The letter also disclosed that 15 people from the region opted out , even though the company did n't notify the affected subscribers that the technology was being tested – it just added a paragraph to its privacy policy .
Telecom subcommittee head Reps. Edward Markey ( D - Massachusetts ) , watchdog groups and law professors have questioned whether the technology violates federal privacy laws , including the wiretapping statute .
" While I am pleased that Embarq chose to answer our specific questions in their second letter , I am still troubled by the company 's failure to directly inform their consumers of the consumer data gathering test and the notion that an ' opt - out ' option is a sufficient standard for such sweeping data gathering , " Markey said .
The letter ( .pdf ) comes just two days after the company attempted in a Monday letter to justify , rather than explain , the trialto powerful House Commerce members , who have already shown they are highly dubious of any ISP 's plan to monitor its customers ' web usage for profit .
According to one congressional aide , the follow - up letter came after staff made it clear the first letter did n't suffice .
The three have already forced Charter Communications to cancel its proposed trial of ISP eavesdropping technology from a NebuAd , the same company that powered Embarq 's secret test .
Charter , Embarq and NebuAd all say the technology is legal since they only classify web pages and web searches into categories such as " shopping for SUV " – rather than storing the webstream .
NebuAd pays ISPs to let it monitor user 's web surfing and searching in order to classify their interests .
Those profiles are then used to deliver targeted ads when the users visit NebuAd partner sites .
Subscribers must choose to opt - out with each browser they use , though NebuAd wo n't explain how the opt - out works .
In the second letter , Embarq , a Fortune 500 telecom company , said it notified its subscribers by adding new information to its privacy policy , saying that 's how traditional web advertisers do it .
Though the company again defended the test on legal grounds , the company clearly understood in the second letter that Congressmen John Dingell ( D - Michigan ) , Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) and Markey were not pleased with the secret test or the company 's first letter .
" In summary the brief test was concluded earlier this year , no customer data continues to exist , and we have no plans for more tests or for general deployment of this technology , until such time as privacy concerns have been addressed , " CEO Tom Gerke wrote .
The technology partner NebuAd earlier referred questions about the test to Embarq , but had said that it always required its partners to notify individuals before using its technology .

World ’s Largest Working Cell Phone ?
Mr. Tan , an electronic lover in Jeling , China , recently made a massive 3 - foot tall replica of his favorite cell phone .
The cell phone is 621 times bigger than his own , which he used as a reference .
The phone is likely the largest self made phone in the world , measuring 36 x 17 x 6.5 inches and weighing around 48.5 pounds .
It has same functions as a regular cell like sending text messages , video recording , taking pictures , and browsing the Internet .
The only difference is Mr. Han ’s larger version has much better reception than the original model .

A Speech of Mine That Bombed
A few months after Freakonomics was first released I was honored to be invited to speak at my first European TED conference , held in the United Kingdom .
I was n’t sure what to talk about .
At my first TED appearance a couple years earlier I had given a rather edgy talk about gangs that had been pretty well received .
What to do for an encore ?
We had just described all my most interesting research in Freakonomics .
I did n’t just want to rehash that stuff .
So I decided to take a risk and talk about my research on child car seats , even though I had never presented it anywhere before .
( Here ’s the Times article we wrote on the subject . )
I struggled with a way to make it interesting .
I could n’t just get up there and give a standard academic talk .
This audience demands a lot more .
I thought of a more creative way to tell the story , and I felt optimistic .
For a while .
First , I caught a cold .
By the time I landed at Heathrow , my ears were so plugged I could n’t hear a thing .
Between that and jet lag , I was walking around in a mental fog .
Then I saw the schedule .
I was to take the stage right after Sir Richard Dawkins .
One lesson I have learned is you do not want to follow a great speaker .
Dawkins did not disappoint the crowd , giving a fascinating talk about the fundamental issues of mankind and the universe .
I could not believe I was going to follow him by talking about how car seats do n’t work .
My recollection is that I stood on the stage mumbling for 15 minutes with everyone in the entire audience staring at me with a perplexed look .
There was a smattering of polite applause when , to their relief , I finally stopped talking .
I exited the stage and made a run for the airport .
I never gave this talk to another audience .
It was with dread that I discovered that the folks at TED had recently posted the video of my talk online .
I watched a bit of the video , hoping that I would discover my recollections were far more negative than reality .
Unfortunately , my memory was accurate .
Watch at your own risk .

LAKE CITY , Ga. , July 25 ( UPI ) --
A bank moved to foreclose on a Georgia house that got a luxury upgrade three years ago from the TV show " Extreme Makeover : Home Edition . "
Patricia Harper of Lake City in Clayton County near Atlanta , told WSB - TV that she and her husband took out a second mortgage 15 months ago to finance a construction business .
Unfortunately , their timing was bad with the housing crisis getting started .

Harper said the couple had reached an agreement with Chase Home Finance to avoid foreclosure .
Lake City Mayor Willie Oswalt said that he is confused by the Harpers ' dilemma .
Oswalt worked as a volunteer on the makeover , which was sponsored by Beazer Homes .
" Beazer gave them $ 100,000 cash , paid their mortgage off and they still can't make it , " Oswalt said .
Obama needs only about 36 more delegates , and he told The Associated Press in an interview that he expects to get about 15 of those in today ’s primaries in South Dakota and Montana .
Superdelegates will finish the job .
Superdelegates surge to Obama
A tsunami of superdelegates is poised to rush to Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) over the next 12 hours , giving him a mathematical lock on his party ’s presidential nomination .
The superdelegate surge is likely to swamp a few holdouts within the camp of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) who have been resisting a prompt concession .

Aides say Clinton does not plan to concede or bid supporters farewell when she speaks in New York tonight , but instead will salute her supporters and argue for the strength of her candidacy .
But her clout is ebbing by the hour .
At 6:56 a.m. Eastern time , the Obama campaign announced the first of the day ’s slew of endorsements by superdelegates – the Democratic Party officials who have a vote on the nominee and will determine who it is , since neither Obama nor Clinton have won enough delegates in primaries and caucuses to put them over the top .
Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said on NBC ’s “ Today ” show : “ If Senator Obama gets the number , I think Hillary Clinton will congratulate him , call him the nominee .
We have n't gotten to that number yet . ”
Obama needs only about 36 more delegates , and he told The Associated Press in an interview that he expects to get about 15 of those in today ’s primaries in South Dakota and Montana .
Superdelegates will finish the job .
“ A lot of people recognize that it is going to be time for us to pivot and move on , ” he said .
Robert Gibbs , Obama ’s campaign communications director , said on CNN ’s “ American Morning ” that the campaign is “ still working the phones and talking to people . ”
“ I think there 's a pretty good chance that by the time Barack Obama walks out on the stage tonight , we 'll walk out as Democratic nominee as president of the United States , ” Gibbs said .
“ We 'll begin a new phase in this campaign and talk about what 's next for this country and what direction we can take it in — the type of change that you can believe in . ”
Joyce Lalonde , a political and education activist from Michigan , was the first to superdelegate announce for Obama today .
She was quickly followed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) who announced on NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
At noon , the Obama campaign announced : " Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick ( MI - 13 ) endorsed Barack Obama .
Obama is 36.5 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination . "
And on a conference call , Clyburn announced three more superdelegates who he said will endorse Obama today : Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina ; New York superdelegate Ralph Dawson , and Tim Moore , a South Carolina Edwards delegate .
Clyburn said he 'd spoken to Nancy Pelosi .
" She will be making her own announcement on that subject tomorrow ... or the next day , " he said .
Shortly after polls close in Montana at 10 p.m. Eastern time , as many as 28 other superdelegates – including House members , senators and governors – could quickly follow , according to statements they have made to Politico and other news organizations .
Obama aides are hoping that he ’ll be able to announce victory when he speaks in St.
Paul tonight , but they say they are n’t positive he ’ll reach that level in time .
But the nomination should be his within hours after that .
Most Clinton advisers recognize that it ’s just about time for a unity event with Obama , but they say she ’ll take a day or more to choreograph her exit .
A few Clinton diehards argue she can still win , and have vowed to fight all the way through the August convention .
But Obama ’s prospective superdelegate tally is likely to sink that argument .
Federal judge rules Bush aides can be subpoenaed RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Pelosi says
Rove contempt citation possible President Bush 's top advisers are not immune from congressional subpoenas , a federal judge ruled Thursday in an unprecedented dispute between the two political branches .
The House Judiciary Committee wants to question the president 's chief of staff , Josh Bolten , and former legal counsel Harriet Miers , about the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
But President Bush says they are immune from such subpoenas .
They say Congress can't force them to testify or turn over documents .
U.S. District Judge John Bates disagreed .
He said there 's no legal basis for that argument .
He said that Miers must appear before Congress and , if she wants to refuse to testify , she must do so in person .
" Harriet Miers is not immune from compelled congressional process ; she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena , " Bates wrote .
He said that both Bolten and Miers must give Congress all non-privileged documents related to the firings .
From the ruling : " Indeed , the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that Ms. Miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process .
The Supreme Court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances , involving the President 's personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs .
The Executive 's current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law . "
The Bush administration can appeal the ruling .
The Justice Department did not immediately respond for a request for comment .
Update : Pelosi says
Rove contempt citation possible " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) said Thursday that a federal judges ruling that former White House counsel Harriet Miers has to appear before a congressional committee could pave the way for Congress approving a contempt citation against Karl Rove later in the day , " Jared Allen reports for The Hill .
In her statement , Pelosi writes , " As public officials , we take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution seriously and todays landmark ruling by the U.S. District Court is a great victory for the American people , the rule of law and balance of power .
We must restore our nations fundamental system of checks and balances , and todays ruling begins to restore that balance . "
" As I told the House of Representatives in February when we passed the resolution authorizing this court case , congressional oversight is an institutional obligation to ensure against abuse of power , " Pelosi continued .
" And when there are credible allegations that law enforcement has been politicized , the need for congressional oversight is at its greatest .
" The Hill notes that " Pelosi said the ruling could give Congress a new impetus to hold Rove in contempt .
Rove refused to respond to a subpoena requiring his appearance at a Judiciary hearing earlier this month on allegations of improper White House influence over the Justice Department . "
" This decision should send a clear signal to the Bush Administration that it must cooperate fully with Congress and that former Administration officials Harriet Miers and Karl Rove must testify before Congress , " Pelosi 's statement concludes .

Enlarge Wieck NYC taxi drivers are supposed to shift to hybrids , like this Ford Escape , when an Oct. 1 mandate kicks in .
DETROIT 
This fall , New York City yellow taxis will start going green as fleet owners have to buy hybrids to replace the old Crown Victorias as they are retired .
The city 's decision to mandate the move from an all - gas taxi fleet to a gas - electric hybrid fleet has received much applause , but as the effective date approaches , there 's a worry : Inventories of hybrids have dried up across the country as gas prices skyrocket , leaving fleet owners to wonder whether they 'll be able to buy hybrids for taxis when they need them .
Jesse Toprak , chief market analyst for consumer website Edmunds.com , says there are n't enough hybrids on the market to satisfy another huge leap in demand .
" Not even close .
Consumers have been on waiting lists for months , and even they can't get one , " he says .
And the ones available will be spread around .
" From the auto manufacturers ' viewpoint , they need to balance where the supply goes , because they do n't want to irritate the customers who have been waiting for them . "
New York City 's mandate for new yellow taxis takes effect Oct. 1 and is intended to transition the fleet to cars that get 25 miles per gallon or more in city driving .
For now , only hybrids can do that .
By law , NYC fleet operators can use a vehicle as a taxi for three years before it must be replaced .
After the deadline , the new cabs will have to be one of eight approved hybrids .
About 3,000 of the 13,000 NYC yellow taxis are replaced each year .
There are some hybrid taxis around the U.S. , but no other city mandates their use .
Chicago recently ordered taxi fleets to have one hybrid vehicle .
Matthew Daus , commissioner of New York 's Taxi and Limousine Commission , says higher - mileage vehicles eventually will cut 500,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions a year .
He 's proud New York is making the move and says he expects San Francisco , Seattle , Chicago , Houston , Boston and possibly London to follow suit shortly .
" This is the right time for cities to be planning ahead to help the environment , " he says .
Ronald Sherman , a fleet owner and president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade , says he's not just worried about getting hybrids , but also about buying replacement parts when something breaks .
" It 's a twofold problem , " he says .
" Our industry moves a million people a day .
I do n't know what we 're going to do if we can't get them in time . "
The automakers are trying to help .
Earlier this week , Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Nissan , General Motors and Ford will provide 300 hybrids a month .
Nissan will provide the bulk of them , with 200 Altimas for taxi fleets ; Ford and GM each will provide 50 .
Toyota , which makes four of the eight vehicles on New York 's approved - cars list , says it does n't yet support its cars for use as taxis .
So rather than buying vehicles through a fleet program , taxi operators have to get in line like any other customer for a Toyota .
Supplies of its hybrids are short :
There are only three and four days ' worth , respectively , of Prius sedans and Camry hybrids on dealer lots .
Tom Voll , field fleet manager for Toyota , says the automaker is doing what it can to help out taxi drivers , but gas prices are making it hard to keep up with demand .
" Several months ago , there was reasonable availability for consumers and fleets to buy from dealer stock , " he says .
But with the rapid consumer shift toward hybrids , " Demand has increased significantly .
As a result , our ability to fill demand is constrained . "
Daus says he 's confident the transition to a hybrid fleet will be smooth .
His advice to fleet operators worried about dwindling supplies ?
" Have faith and be proactive , " Daus says .
" Get out there and order those vehicles now .
You know what you need to do .
Shop around , get the best deal you can , but do it now . "

New research findings published online in The FASEB Journal provide more evidence that if we get smart about what we eat , our intelligence can improve .
According to MIT scientists , dietary nutrients found in a wide range of foods from infant formula to eggs increase brain synapses and improve cognitive abilities .
" I hope human brains will , like those of experimental animals , respond to this kind of treatment by making more brain synapses and thus restoring cognitive abilities , " said Richard Wurtman , MD , senior researcher on the project .
In the study , gerbils were given various combinations of three compounds needed for healthy brain membranes : choline , found in eggs ; uridine monophosphate ( UMP ) found in beets ; and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , found in fish oils .
Other gerbils were given none of these to serve as a baseline .
Then they were checked for cognitive changes four weeks later .
The scientists found that the gerbils given choline with UMP and / or DHA showed cognitive improvements in tasks thought to be relevant to gerbils , such as navigating mazes .
After these tests were concluded , the researchers dissected the mouse brains for a biological cause for the improvement .
They found biochemical evidence that there was more than the usual amount of brain synapse activity , which was consistent with behaviors indicating higher intelligence .
" Now that we know how to make gerbils smarter , " said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal , " it 's not too far a stretch to hope that people 's intelligence can also be improved .
Quite frankly , this can't happen soon enough , as every environmentalist , advocate of evolution and war opponent will attest . "

Attorney General Cuomo is abandoning one of the highest - profile cases brought by his predecessor , Eliot Spitzer .
Click Image to Enlarge Mary Altaffer / AP Former New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso leaves the New York State Supreme Court at Manhattan in July 2007 .
Yesterday a mid-level appellate court in Manhattan ruled against a bid by the attorney general 's office to force a former New York Stock Exchange chief , Richard Grasso , to give back to the exchange much of his $ 187.5 million in pay .
Just hours after the decision , Mr. Cuomo 's office said it would let the matter rest without an appeal .
" We have reviewed the Court 's opinion and determined that an appeal would not be warranted , " a spokesman , Alex Detrick , said in a statement .
" Thus , for all intents and purposes , the Grasso case is over . "
Mr. Cuomo's decision to drop the case is a reminder of Mr. Spitzer 's sudden disappearance from public life .
Before Mr. Spitzer left office this year due to a scandal involving a call - girl ring , Mr. Cuomo had stayed the course against Mr. Grasso , even hiring a top white - collar defense attorney in private practice to manage the case .
The effort to force Mr. Grasso to return the money became a top priority for Mr. Spitzer 's office beginning more than four years ago , after Mr. Grasso was ousted as stock chief when the sum total of his compensation there became publicly known .
Mr. Spitzer sued under the theory that the pay was " unreasonable " for a nonprofit entity , which the stock exchange then was .
The case became a central battle in Mr. Spitzer 's campaign against Wall Street .
The decision handed down yesterday , which dismissed the remaining two of the eight original claims against Mr. Grasso , left Mr. Cuomo with the option of appealing to the Court of Appeals in Albany to reinstate those claims .
The 3 - 1 court decision turned on the NYSE 's transformation into a for - profit corporation as part of its 2006 merger with Archipelago Holdings Inc .
While the attorney general has the authority to police the amount of pay received by nonprofit executives , the court ruled that the authority did not extend to prosecuting such a suit in an effort to return money to a corporation that was now for - profit .
An decision last week by the Court of Appeals had dismissed the bulk of the attorney general 's case .
One of Mr. Grasso's lawyers , Mark Zauderer , declined to comment .
Mobile Me ?
Poking around the updated files in 10.5.3 , the Russian - language site Deep Apple noticed that iCal ’s “ Localizable.strings ” resource file now contains placeholders for the name “ . Mac ” , with the following comment :
/* Label of the .
Mac button in iCal ’s General preferences .
%@ is the new name of Apple ’s online service ( was .
Mac ) ( remove - XX02 ) */
This is new to 10.5.3 ; in 10.5.2 , the name “ . Mac ” was hard - coded , not a localizable string .
Dmitry Chestnykh at Coding Robots followed Deep Apple ’s lead and uncovered similar localization strings for “ . Mac ” elsewhere in 10.5.3 , including Safari and Apple Mail .
Chestnykh writes :
I looked into binaries to find out what the new name is , but it seems like apps take this value from / System / Library / PreferencePanes /Mac.prefPane , which still has the old name .
It seems like it will be updated via Software Update once Apple renames .
Mac and — boom ! — all your apps will have the new name .
It ’s not exactly a secret that , as I wrote a few weeks ago , .
Mac is .bad .
But in addition to the service being of sketchy quality , the name is crap , too .
It looks and sounds silly , for one thing ( you know it ’s a bad name when the gist of it is so similar to that of a Microsoft initiative like .
NET ) , but for another , tying the service ’s name explicitly to “ Mac ” would make it awkward to , say , introduce new features for over - the - network synching of data to iPhones and iPods belonging to Windows users .
1
Why expand .
Mac to include iPhone synching ?
Consider the new over - the - air push synching of email , contacts , and calendars Apple has already revealed for the scheduled - for - release - next - month iPhone OS 2.0 .
As it stands now , these features will only be available for users of Microsoft Exchange .
Awkward .
Assuming Apple wants to bring similar features to non-Exchange users , too , what we now call .
Mac seems the mostly likely route .
But so what might the new name be ?
Sync and web seem like apt words , but Apple ’s already used “ iSync ” and “ iWeb ” .
Mobile , perhaps ?
That fits with Apple ’s priorities .
At the end of my “ Why Apple Wo n’t Buy Adobe ” piece two weeks ago , I wrote :
And so if Apple , under Jobs , is tightly focused , what is it that they ’re focused on ?
It ’s not the pro market .
It ’s mobility — iPhone , iPod , MacBook Air .
“ iMobile ” , though , sounds wrong .
2
But a bit of searching leads back to these reports from January 2006 regarding trademark filings from Apple for the term “ Mobile Me ” .
AppleInsider reported that Apple filed four separate filings for the term , including two portable electronic devices and a music - over - the - network service .
But it ’s the fourth filing for “ Mobile Me ” that ’s the most interesting :
“ Telecommunication services ; electronic transmission and retrieval of data , images , audio , video and documents , including text , cards , letters , messages , mail , animations , and electronic mail , over local or global communications networks , including the internet , intranets , extranets , television , mobile communication , cellular and satellite networks ; electronic transmission of computer software over local or global communications networks , including the internet , intranets , extranets , television , mobile communication , cellular , and satellite networks ; electronic mail services ; facsimile transmission ; web site portal services ; providing access to databases and local or global communications networks , including the internet , intranets , extranets , television , mobile communication , cellular , and satellite networks ; internet service provider services ; message transmission services , namely , electronic transmission of messages ; telecommunication services for the dissemination of information by mobile telephone , namely the transmission of data to mobile telephones ; mobile telephone communication services . ”
Sounds a bit like the description of a revamped .
Mac geared toward over - the - network synching to iPhones , no ?
PARIS ( Reuters ) - A French air hostess will become one of Europe ’s pioneer space tourists after picking a chocolate wrapper out of the rubbish and finding a winning number in a competition to fly to the upper reaches of the earth ’s atmosphere .
Mathilde Epron , 32 , said she had bought a Kit Kat chocolate bar at her local supermarket but initially threw the wrapper in the bin , telling herself that “ it ’s only others who win . ”
Two hours later , thinking back to the competition , she decided to try her luck and fished the wrapper out of the bin , only to find a code marked inside .
“ For someone who works in air travel it ’s really a dream come true , ” she told France Info radio .
A spokeswoman for Nestle in France confirmed that Epron had won the prize to take a flight on a four - seater , fighter - sized aircraft built by Rocketplane , a company that builds aircraft intended to provide cheap flights into space .
She will receive four days of astronaut training in Oklahoma City in the United States before boarding the Rocketplane XP aircraft which will reach an altitude of 100 km ( 60 miles ) and allow a five - minute experience of weightlessness .
Yesterday , lunar enthusiasts and space buffs gathered to mark the 39th anniversary of the first human steps on the moon .
At NASA ’s new Lunar Science Institute , the assembled crowd was also preparing for a three - day conference devoted to planning the next phase of lunar exploration .
NASA hopes to return humans to the moon by 2020 , but they may have some competition in this space race do - over ; both entrepreneurs and other space agencies are also stepping up their activities .
At the gathering at Ames , NASA researchers made clear that the goals for the next lunar expedition are ambitious .
The United States , they said , needs to focus on creating a permanent presence on the moon , using it as a training platform for missions to Mars and beyond .
“ We ’re going back , and this time we ’re going to stay , ” S. Pete Worden , director of NASA / Ames , said in remarks opening the lunar science conference .
“ This is the first step in settling the solar system ” [ San Jose Mercury News ] .
Meanwhile , in the private sector , things are heating up with the Google Lunar X PRIZE , which offers a $ 30 million prize for the first team to send a robot to the moon .
One of the teams , Odyssey Moon Limited , announced plans to bring a small telescope to the moon on its first mission , which is tentatively planned for 2011 .
The telescope will be provided by the International Lunar Observatory Association , a non-profit group that wants to demonstrate the value of the Moon for scientific study of the galaxy , Moon , Earth , sun and stars ; followed by human exploration and eventual settlement [ The International Space Fellowship ] .
Other space agencies are getting in on the excitement as well ; the Russian Federal Space Agency and the European Space Agency are reportedly collaborating on a next - generation spacecraft that could carry four people to the moon .
And just last week , NASA administrator Michael Griffin said it was “ certainly ” possible that China could reach the Moon before a US mission returned there ….
Dr Griffin said China had the “ technical capability ” to send a manned mission to the Moon before the US [ Telegraph ] .

How does a parasite found in kitty litter get into whales and dolphins ?
By hitching a ride down the sewage pipe and into anchovy guts , say researchers .
Gloeta Massie and Michael Black of California Polytechnic State University say this could explain why one of the most prevalent parasites in humans is now popping up in marine mammals .
They presented their findings at the annual meeting of the American Microbiology Society on Monday .
“ Toxoplasma gondii is the most successful protozoan pathogen on the planet , ” says Michael Grigg of the US National Institutes of Health .
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that nearly one in four people aged 12 or older in the US have been infected with the parasite .
Fatal consequences
The parasite often goes unnoticed but can kill fetuses if women become infected during pregnancy .
It is the third leading cause of death by food poisoning , and can even cause encephalitis – an acute and potentially deadly inflammation of the brain .

Cats are the primary reservoir : they catch the parasite from eating infected mice or birds .
The parasite ’s eggs are dispersed in the cat ’s droppings and can infect food that is poorly washed or prepared .
Over the past decade it has become clear that the problem is not limited to land animals .
T. gondii has been found in marine mammals around the world , from seals and sea-otters to walruses and dolphins .
Beluga whales have been found dead from encephalitis thought to be caused by the parasite .
“ We do n’t know whether the problem has always been there , but there is not a marine mammal that we have looked at that is not exposed to some degree , ” says Grigg .
“ How it is getting there is the million dollar question . ”
Anchovy agents
Some have suggested that the eggs get into the oceans through sewage , and lab studies have shown that they can accumulate in mussels and oysters .
T. gondii has also been found in one mussel that was caught in the wild .
But for Massie and Black , that does not explain the parasite ’s infection of marine mammals .
“ Although the research on bivalves is very promising , it does not fully explain the global infestation of T. gondii in marine mammals , ” says Massie .
“ Many marine mammals do not eat bivalves nor do they live near areas of freshwater runoff and sewage runoff . ”
Based on the global distribution of the parasite , Massie and Black think that anchovies – a major source of food to many marine mammals – may be part of the problem .
They point out the anchovies move from estuaries , where they come into contact with sewage efflux , to the open ocean .
They also live anywhere from the top layer of the ocean down to the “ twilight ” boundary , which light from the surface only just manages to reach .
What ’s more , anchovies normally eat tiny particles roughly the same size as the T. gondii eggs .
Experimental infection
Black and Massie are in the early stages of their study .
To check the credibility of their hypothesis , they put northern anchovies ( Engraulis mordax ) in seawater containing parasite eggs .
Later they dissected the fish and looked in the gut tissue for T. gondii DNA .
The tests were positive , revealing that the fish do indeed filter and accumulate the eggs .
When the anchovies were placed in parasite - free water for six to eight hours after infection , the eggs remained in their tissue .
This suggests the fish could transport the parasite from infested estuaries to open water .
“ They ’re doing all the right experiments , ” says Grigg , but he adds that much remains to be done .
For starters , eight hours is probably not enough time for an anchovy to pick up eggs , carry them out to sea and be eaten by a whale .
It is also important to determine what parasite strain the anchovies can carry .
Grigg has identified a new strain , which he has called “ type X ” .
Type X is responsible for killing large numbers of Californian sea otters .
“ We ’re wondering if it is an emerging line that is poised to sweep the world . ”
Grigg ’s research suggests that the existence of different strains in part explains why T. gondii sometimes kills and other times goes unnoticed .
“ Once we know how it is being transmitted we can try to mitigate the threat , ” says Grigg .
“ If we find there are hotspots of transmission we can try to intervene there .
If Black is correct and anchovies are being infected downstream of sewage plants , clearly what is being done to treat the waste is not adequate . ”

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Nearly two - thirds of Egyptian men admit to having sexually harassed women in the most populous Arab country , and a majority say women themselves are to blame for their maltreatment , a survey showed Thursday .
The forms of harassment reported by Egyptian men , whose country attracts millions of foreign tourists each year , include touching or ogling women , shouting sexually explicit remarks , and exposing their genitals to women .
“ Sexual harassment has become an overwhelming and very real problem experienced by all women in Egyptian society , often on a daily basis , ” said the report by the Egyptian Center for Women ’s Rights .
Egyptian women and female visitors frequently complain of persistent sexual harassment on Egyptian streets , despite the socially conservative nature of this traditional Muslim society .
The behavior could have repercussions on Egypt ’s tourism industry , a major foreign income earner , with 98 percent of foreign women saying they had experienced harassment in the country , the survey said .
The survey of more than 2,000 Egyptian men and women and 109 foreign women said the vast majority of Egyptians believed that sexual harassment in Egypt was on the rise , citing a worsening economic situation and a lack of awareness or religious values .
It said 62 percent of Egyptian men reported perpetrating harassment , while 83 percent of Egyptian women reported having been sexually harassed .
Nearly half of women said the abuse occurred daily .
Only 2.4 percent of Egyptian women reported it to the police , with most saying they did not believe anyone would help .
Some feared reporting harassment would hurt their reputations .
“ The vast majority of women did nothing when confronted with sexual harassment , ” the survey said , adding that most Egyptian women believed the victim should “ remain silent . ”
Some 53 percent of men blamed women for bringing on sexual harassment , saying they enjoyed it or were dressed in a way deemed indecent .
Some women agreed .
“ Out of Egyptian women and men interviewed , most believe that women who wear tight clothes deserve to be harassed , ” the survey said .
It added most agreed women should be home by 8 p.m .
The survey said most of the Egyptian women who told of being harassed said they were dressed conservatively , with the majority wearing the Islamic headscarf .
The harassment took place on the streets or on public transport , as well as in tourist destinations and foreign educational institutions .
Nasa has completed a full panorama of the landing site
Nasa 's Phoenix lander spacecraft has for the first time identified water in a sample of soil collected from the planet 's surface .
Scientists will now be able to begin studying the sample to see whether the planet was ever , or is , habitable .
The craft previously had problems transferring samples from its robotic arm to the onboard lab for analysis .
The success and the good condition of the craft mean the mission will be extended until the end of September .
This is the first time Martian water has been touched and tasted
William Boynton , mission scientist Since it touched down on 25 May , the Phoenix lander has been studying the surface of Mars to investigate whether it has ever been capable of supporting life .
It has been studying soil with a chemistry laboratory , an oven called TEGA ( Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer instrument ) , a microscope , a probe and cameras .
Scientists told a press conference at the University of Arizona in Tucson that the planet had so far " proved itself to be interesting " .
" We 've seen evidence for this water - ice before in observations by the Mars Odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by Phoenix last month , but this is the first time Martian water has been touched and tasted , " William Boynton , one of the researchers on the mission , explained .
Full panorama Please turn on JavaScript .

Phoenix collected some ice samples last week but was unable to transfer them from the mechanical scoop to the onboard oven for heating and testing .
A dry soil sample was taken instead but the scientists found some ice had been collected too and tests were being conducted on it .
The scientists said they had yet to find organic materials in the sample and stressed that it would take three to four weeks for the data to be analysed .
The 90 - day extension to the mission means Nasa will be able to dig two new trenches between mounds where ice lasts for longer periods of time , giving it different characteristics .
" Phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good , " said scientist Michael Meyer .
" We want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on Mars . "
Mission chief Peter Smith said ice scooped up by Phoenix 's robotic digging arm was now being analysed to see if conditions on Mars could have supported life .
" We 're looking to understand the history of the ice , by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted , and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil , " he said .
" We 're just getting the data back .
Through this we also hope to resolve questions ; is this a habitable zone on Mars , meaning that we have periodic liquid water , materials that are the basic ingredients for life forms ? " he added .
Nasa also announced the completion of a full panoramic image of the arctic landing site in approximate true colour .
The panorama is made up of more than 400 individual images taken over several weeks and stitched together to form a mosaic .

Verizon , Sprint and Time Warner Cable have agreed to block access to Internet bulletin boards and Web sites nationwide that disseminate child pornography , Danny Hakim reports in a front - page article .
The move is part of a groundbreaking agreement with the New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , that will be formally announced today as a significant step by leading companies to curtail access to child pornography .
Many in the industry have previously resisted similar efforts , saying they could not be responsible for content online , given the decentralized and largely unmonitored nature of the Internet .
The companies have agreed to shut down access to newsgroups that traffic in pornographic images of children on one of the oldest outposts of the Internet , known as Usenet .
Usenet began nearly 30 years ago and was one of the earliest ways to swap information online , but as the World Wide Web blossomed , Usenet was largely supplanted by it , becoming a favored back alley for those who traffic in illicit material .
The providers will also cut off access to Web sites that traffic in child pornography .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Bush administration plan to bolster Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could cost U.S. taxpayers $ 25 billion , congressional analysts said on Tuesday in a report that triggered debate as Congress moved toward approving a major housing market rescue package .

Fannie and Freddie shares fell sharply on the report ’s release but later recovered , with Freddie stock ending higher and Fannie paring its losses .
Investors are concerned whether the two government - sponsored mortgage finance giants , which own or guarantee almost half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in outstanding residential mortgage debt and play an increasingly key role in the troubled American housing market , can weather a national housing slump .
New data on Tuesday showed home prices fell again in May , while Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson used a speech in New York and television interviews to push for passage of the plan as a way to restore financial stability to the markets .
“ Now more than ever , we need Fannie and Freddie out there , financing mortgages , ” said Paulson , who wants to give Fannie and Freddie access -- if they need it -- to cheap , government capital in the form of loans and possible equity investments by the government .
Congress was pushing ahead on a 600 - page housing bill that was expected to include Paulson ’s proposals , as well as measures to establish a new regulator for the companies and to help distressed homeowners refinance into new mortgages .
In estimating the potential cost exposure of taxpayers to Paulson ’s proposal , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) said there was no certainty on whether the capital line he wants to create for the companies would ever be tapped .
The CBO said there is a “ probably better than 50 percent ” chance that the proposed new Treasury authority would not be used before it expired at the end of December 2009 .
In that case , the proposed credit line and possible government equity investment would cost taxpayers nothing .
But the CBO said that a favorable “ scenario is far from the only possible result . ”
Any further worsening in the already steep housing market slump “ would increase the probability that this new authority would have to be used , ” it said .
The housing bill will go to the House of Representatives floor on Wednesday , Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank , the Financial Services Committee chairman , told reporters .
Frank said the bill would leave the type of any equity investment in Fannie and Freddie to the discretion of the U.S. Treasury .
It also would give a new regulator substantial authority over executive compensation at the companies , regardless of whether they tap the capital supports .
The bill also would include about $ 4 billion in grants to localities to buy and repair foreclosed properties in distressed neighborhoods .
House approval would send the bill to the Senate , where senior Republicans urged prompt legislative action .
MCCONNELL URGES ACTION
Fresh from a meeting with Paulson , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , of Kentucky , said the secretary underscored the importance of getting housing legislation finished .
McConnell told reporters after a luncheon meeting , “ Most of my members share his view that we need to wrap this up . ”
Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , said the CBO cost estimate was “ pretty good news .
A lot of people thought it ’d be much higher . ”
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , which regulates Fannie and Freddie , reported that home prices fell 0.3 percent in May , for a third straight monthly decline .
Shares in Fannie closed down 5.1 percent at $ 13.41 , while Freddie shares finished up 10.9 percent at $ 9.70 , on a day of broadly bullish trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
In related news , short sales in Fannie and Freddie shares , in which investors bet on a fall in the share price , have declined 90 percent since an emergency rule against abusive short sales took effect , a market data firm S3 Matching Technologies said .
Market regulators are cooperating on examining the GSEs , according to spokesmen for the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
“ The Federal Reserve is working with OFHEO to get a better understanding of the issues facing the GSEs , ” a Fed spokesman said , declining to provide further details .
WHITE HOUSE STUDIES REPORT
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the administration was studying the CBO report .
“ Our intention is not to need any sort of federal taxpayer monies in this regard , ” she told reporters .
“ I would consider this more of an insurance policy .
So no taxpayer dollars at this point are on the line . ”
She said that if Treasury capital were tapped by the GSEs under Paulson ’s plan , “ the president would make sure that terms and conditions would be in place to protect the taxpayer . ”
At least one Republican lawmaker was critical of Paulson ’s proposal .
Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling called it a “ bailout ” that would give “ Fannie and Freddie an unlimited line of credit from the U.S.
Treasury and force the taxpayer to buy equity in the companies to help further prop up their stock prices . ”
The CBO said in its report it was unclear how large the GSEs losses may ultimately be on existing mortgages it holds or guarantees .
The analysts said there was a more than 50 percent chance future losses would not top those already recognized .
But , they added , there is “ almost a five percent chance that the added losses would total more than $ 100 billion . ”
A Yale research team has engineered a system with the potential for making the Internet work more efficiently , in which Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) and Peer - to - Peer ( P2P ) software providers can work cooperatively to deliver data .
The way people use the Internet has changed significantly over the past 10 years , making computers seem to run less efficiently and putting strain on the available bandwidth for transmitting data .
Since 1998 , the percentage of Internet traffic devoted to the download and upload of large blocks of information using P2P software has increased from less than 10 percent to greater than 70 percent in many networks .
By contrast , Web browsing now accounts for 20 percent and e-mail less than 5 percent of total Internet traffic , down from 60 and 10 percent respectively , in 1998 .
Professors Avi Silberschatz , Y. Richard Yang , and Ph.D. candidate Haiyong Xie in Yale 's Department of Computer Science are part of a research team that is proposing an architecture called P4P -- which stands for " provider portal for P2P applications " -- to allow explicit and seamless communications between ISPs and P2P applications .
The P4P will both reduce the cost to ISPs and improve the performance of P2P applications according to a paper to be presented at ACM SIGCOMM 2008 , a premier computer networking conference in August 2008 in Seattle .
According to Silberschatz , current P2P information exchange schemes are " network - oblivious " and use intricate protocols for tapping the bandwidth of participating users to help move data .
He says , " The existing schemes are often both inefficient and costly -- like dialing long - distance to call your neighbor , and both of you paying for the call . "
The Yale team has played many roles in this project , ranging from naming and analyzing the architecture , to testing and to implementation of some key components of the system .
" Right now the ISPs and P2P companies are dancing with the problem -- but stepping on each other 's toes , " said Yang .
" Our objective is to have an open architecture that any ISP and any P2P can participate in .
Yale has facilitated this project behind the scenes and without direct financial interest through a working group called P4P that was formed in July 2007 to prompt collaboration on the project . "
The working group is hosted by DCIA [ Distributed Computing Industry Association ] and led by working group co-chairs Doug Pasko from Verizon , and Laird Popkin from Pando .
Currently , the group has more than 50 participating organizations .
" The P4P architecture extends the Internet architecture by providing servers , called iTrackers , to each ISP , " said Silberschatz .
" The servers provide portals to the operation of ISP networks . "
The new P4P architecture can operate in multiple modes .
In a simple mode , the ISPs will reveal their network status so that P2P applications can avoid hot - spots .
In another mode , P4P will operate much like a stock or commodities exchange -- it will let markets and providers interact freely to create the most efficient information and cost flow , so costs of operation drop and access to individual sites is less likely to overload .
" While ISPs like AT&T , Comcast , Telephonica and Verizon and the P2P software companies like Pando each maintains its independence , the value of the P4P architecture is significant , as demonstrated in recent field tests , " said Silberschatz .
For example , in a field test conducted using the Pando software in March 2008 , P4P reduced inter-ISP traffic by an average of 34 percent , and increased delivery speeds to end users by up to 235 percent across US networks and up to 898 percent across international networks .
The Indian government yesterday signalled that it would be imposing tougher sentences on doctors who illegally abort female foetuses - a tacit admission that the law was not working .
Experts estimate India has lost 10 million girls in the past 20 years .
Yet in the 14 years since selective abortion was outlawed only two doctors has been convicted of the crime - and officials admit one of those is back in business .
The reason , says the government , is that under the existing act doctors are only suspended , face a fine of 50,000 rupees ( £ 625 ) and a jail term of three months .
Instead the health minister wants doctors conducting illegal sex determination tests to be struck off permanently , face a fine of 700,000 rupees ( £ 8,750 ) and imprisonment for up to three years .
Manmohan Singh , the Indian prime minister , will issue a call next week to clamp down on female foeticide .
This comes after a campaign by the women and child development ministry to convince parents to give up girls for adoption rather than aborting them .
The idea appears to have been quietly abandoned after running into bureaucratic quicksand .
Indian parents are choosing to abort female foetuses in such large numbers that 900,000 girls are now being lost every year .
Campaigners said that the problem was not the penalties but the implementation of the present act .
Sabu George , a Delhi - based researcher who works on female foeticide , said : " Hundreds of thousands of sex selective abortions happen every year , yet only a few hundred doctors are caught .
Conviction rates are ridiculously low .
But the real problem is getting state police to catch these criminal doctors . "
The latest estimate of India 's sex ratio at birth ( SRB ) comes from a sample registration system that covers 1.3 m households .
For the two years up to 2004 India had 882 girls to each 1,000 boys .
George says that a preference for boys , who carry on the family bloodline and inherit wealth , has always existed in Indian society .
But more people can now afford the medical technology which makes it possible to tell the sex of a baby while it is still in the womb .
Richer parts of India are worst affected - with parents sometimes ordering online home - kits which claim to determine the sex of a baby in the womb .
In wealthy Haryana there are now just 770 girls being born for every 1,000 boys .
The fracture of a four - square - kilometre chunk of ice from the largest remaining ice shelf in the Arctic last week is a one - way change brought on by warming temperatures , says a scientist who has studied the process .
Derek Mueller , a polar scientist and research fellow at Trent University , in Peterborough , Ont. , said the ice breaking off from the Ward Hunt Island Ice Shelf , just north of Ellesmere Island , marks the continuation of a process that has been years in the making .
" Ice shelves do n't just break up .
There 's no karate chop , " he said .
" This is the result of a gradual weakening over time as a result of warming temperatures . "
Mueller said the changes in the shelf , which surrounds Ward Hunt Island off the north coast of Ellesmere , provide further evidence the planet , and in particular the North , is warming due to climate change .
An expedition by U.S. explorer Robert Peary in 1906 put the size of the Ellesmere Island Ice Shelf at just under 9,000 square kilometres .
The ice shelf has since broken up into smaller pieces , the largest of which is the Ward Hunt Island Shelf .
The total area of all of these pieces is now less than 900 square kilometres .
No winter renewal of ice shelf
Mueller said if year - to - year warming was n't occurring , Arctic researchers would have been able to detect some renewal of ice during the winter months , either through thickening of the ice or the spread of the shelves .
But researchers have n't seen any sign of renewal , he said .
" This is a one - way change , " he said .
Mueller was part of the team of polar researchers that first discovered in 2002 a large central crack in the ice shelf , which had occurred between 2000 and 2002 .
An expedition alongside Canadian Rangers on a patrol around Ellesmere Island in April 2008 found an 18 - kilometre crack along the shelf , a further sign that fragmentation was likely .
" Ice shelf integrity was lost in 2002 , " said Mueller .
The 2002 fissure was blamed for the draining of an epishelf lake in Disraeli Fjord .
Epishelf lakes are a unique ecosystem with both lighter freshwater and denser saltwater , with the freshwater component kept away from the ocean by the ice shelf while the bottom layer of seawater can mix with ocean water .
The ecosystem is home to a unique mix of zooplankton and other tiny life forms .
Mueller said the next major epishelf lake potentially under threat in the region is the Milne epishelf lake , which is bound in the Milne fjord by the Milne Ice Shelf , the second - largest remnant of the Ellesmere Island Ice Shelf .
The ice island that formed last week is the largest to form off Canada 's northern coast since the 2005 collapse of the Ayles Ice Shelf , which lay between the Milne and Ward Hunt Island shelves .
The ice island that subsequently formed had a surface area of about 66 square kilometres .
Majid Ahmed was convicted of burglary in 2005 A teenager has had an offer of a place to study medicine at London 's Imperial College withdrawn after it emerged he had a " spent " conviction for burglary .
Majid Ahmed , 18 , from Bradford , says he was told by the university he could not be trusted as a GP .
He described the decision as " totally unfair and unnecessary " and said he did not deserve the trouble he received .
Imperial College said the public " must have confidence in the integrity and probity of its doctors " .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement " Medical practitioners hold a position of responsibility within society . "
In a statement it added the university complied " fully " with the Criminal Records Bureau 's code of practice .
But it insisted it did not " unfairly discriminate against any applicant on the basis of a conviction " .
' Only human '
In November 2005 Mr Ahmed was convicted of burglary and given a four - month referral order specifying community service as a sentence .
For under - 18s in England the law considers such a conviction to be " spent " as soon as the community service is finished .
The Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act 1974 states anyone wishing to be employed in the medical profession must always declare a " spent " conviction in applications to work or study .
" They have to look at the whole bigger picture as well , " Mr Ahmed told BBC London .
" They can't just look at this one offence .
We 're only human and we 've made mistakes .
" If they look at all the other things I 've done as well , people are going to be more than happy to have me as their doctor . "
Imperial College conducted an assessment of whether Mr Ahmed could be considered a risk to patients , and decided he would .
He said he intended to take his case further to try to regain the offer of a place on the course .

A US air strike killed 47 civilians , including 39 women and children , as they were travelling to a wedding in Afghanistan , an official inquiry found today .
The bride was among the dead .
Another nine people were wounded in Sunday 's attack , the head of the Afghan government investigation , Burhanullah Shinwari , said .
Fighter aircraft attacked a group of militants near the village of Kacu in the eastern Nuristan province , but one missile went off course and hit the wedding party , said the provincial police chief spokesman , Ghafor Khan .
The US military initially denied any civilians had been killed .
Lieutenant Rumi Nielson - Green , a spokeswoman for the US - led coalition , told AFP today the military regretted the loss of any civilian life and was investigating the incident .
The US is facing similar charges over strikes two days earlier in another border area of Afghanistan .
The nine - member inquiry team appointed by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to look into the wedding party incident found only civilians had been killed in the attack .
" We found that 47 civilians , mostly women and children , were killed in the air strikes and another nine were wounded , " said Shinwari , who is also the deputy speaker of Afghanistan 's senate .
" They were all civilians and had no links with the Taliban or al - Qaida . "
Around 10 people were missing and believed to be still under rubble , he said .
The inquiry team were shown the bloodied clothes of women and children in a visit to the scene .
The Red Cross said 250 people had been killed or wounded in five days of military action and militant attacks in the past week .

This is my library .
I guess you would have to say all the rest of these books are books that did not change my life , although they tried .
Books still have the power to change lives .
Which ones have changed yours ?
I do n’t mean merely great books , or memorable ones , or favorite ones .
I mean books that altered your behavior , changed your mind , redirected the course of your life .
Books as levers .
Here ’s my list , in the order they entered my life .
( I ’m not the only one affected by these books because each of these titles has a Wikipedia entry , linked here , if you ’d like to know more . )
Childhood ’s End —
For a kid growing up without TV in the boring enclaves of suburbia in the 50s and early 60s , science fiction opened up my universe .
I devoured any and all science fiction our public library contained .
Arthur C. Clarke ’s stories in particular birthed a life - long interest in science , and a deep respect for the power of imagination .
This story of a singularity always stuck with me as something to prepare for .
Whole Earth Catalog —
When I was 17 this big catalog of choices gave me permission to have my own ideas , make my own tools , follow my two loves of art and science unabashedly , and invent my own life .
Decades later , I worked at the Catalog in my first real job .
Cool Tools is just the electronic version of this book .
The Fountainhead — I got sucked into reading this over - the - top manifesto of self - reliance during finals of my first year of college .
By the end of the book I decided to drop out of school .
I never returned .
It was the best decision of my life .
Leaves of Grass – While reading this classic poetic ode to America and possibilities ( “ I am multitude ! ” ) my gasket blew and I became seized with an unstoppable urge to travel .
I set the book down and bought a ticket to Asia .
I roamed there off and on for 8 years .
It was my university .
My Experiments with Truth —
This autobiography of Gandhi curiously led me to Jesus .
Gandhi ’s stance of radical honesty prompted me to attempt the same .
I was surprised it took a tough Hindu to make me a tender Christian .
The Bible — Reading this all the way through , beginning to end , shattered all expectations I had of such a foundational text .
It was weirder , stranger , more disturbing and more powerful than I was lead to believe .
I ’ve read through several times more and it never fails to disturb me .
Godel , Escher , Bach — I was amazed and impressed by the brilliance of GEB when I first read it , but it did n’t change my life .
However over the years I kept finding myself returning to its insights , and each time I would arrive at them at a deeper level .
Now I find them my own thoughts , and I realize I now see the world through a similar lens .
The Ultimate Resource — Another book whose influence took time to establish .
Simon ’s clarifying insight — that mind and intelligence can overcome any physical limitations , and is therefore the only scarce resource — has become a big idea that colors much of what I look at .
Finite and Infinite Games —
This small , short book provided me a vocabulary to think about the meaning of life — not just my life , but all life !
It gave me a mathematical framework for my own spirituality .
As it says , the game is to prolong the game , to rope all beings into playing infinite vs finite ( win-loose ) games , and to realize that there is only one infinite game .
What ’s your list of Books That Changed Your Life ?
It has to be more than a list .
A book cannot be said to change your life unless it can be annotated with the tangible consequences you made as a result of reading it .
Here are a few qualifying lists by others I have encountered in my clickage .

THE oil - rich state of Dubai has unveiled plans for a daring new skyscraper constructed entirely of Fanta .
The mile - high building will include 150,000 luxury apartments , 127 five - star hotels and 16 million gallons of the fizzy orange drink .
It will be designed by the German architect Jules Berghoff , who specialises in working with soft drinks and last year completed an office block in Bahrain based on the original Soda Stream machine .
Berghoff said : " Dubai is a very now , tomorrow kind of place .
There are no yesterdays here .
" That means using lots of very tomorrow materials , and what could be more tomorrow than a building made of Fanta ?
" The Fanta will form the walls and floors , but we will be able to pour the entire structure into a bottle in the event of high winds . "
Dubai is at the cutting edge of international architecture and has already outlined plans for the world 's first walking skyscraper .
The 20,000ft tall building will be able to move freely around the city , peering in the windows of other skyscrapers or posing for tourists next to their hotel .
If temperatures rise above 37 degrees centigrade the building will go and sit in the sea for half an hour , before having a nap under the world 's most gigantic palm tree .
Documents show Georgia 's Secretary of State knew of Diebold patch
Georgia complained to Diebold about patch after election
On Dec. 3 , 2002 , Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Coxs office faxed documents to the then - president of Diebold Election Systems Bob Urosevich listing a series of issues that occurred shortly before the November 2002 election .
Documents provided to RAW STORY by a whistleblower close to Coxs office show that one of the key problems Georgia officials were trying to resolve was related to an unauthorized patch installed on machines prior to the election .
In one document , Coxs office asked Urosevich for confirmation that a 0808 patch was applied to all systems ; confirmation that the patch was not grounds for requiring the system to be recertified at national and state level ; as well as verifiable analysis of the overall impact of the patch to the voting system 
( See attached pdf , p. 3 )
Cox didnt know prior to the election that a patch had been installed , the source said .
Cox , who is now president of Young Harris College in Georgia , returned phone calls but could not be reached for comment by press time .
 People working for Diebold were told to keep this quiet so Cox would not find out ,  the whistleblower said .
 They knew she was in over her head and had come to completely rely on Diebold .
They controlled the warehouse , the machines , and the certification .
There were no state employees . 
Diebold renamed itself Premier Election Solutions in 2007 .
The company has come under fire on numerous occasions for failing to protect its software from hackers , and its systems have been decertified in California .
Maryland 's House of Delegates voted to ban the company from its electronic voting in 2006 , though the law did n't pass the Senate and state is now considering Premier for their optical scan systems .
According to this individual , this was the patch that he then passed on to cyber - security expert Stephen Spoonamore .
Spoonamore , a highly regarded computer security specialist who has worked for US government agencies , has since come forward claiming that he took the Diebold patch to the Department of Justice -- specifically to the Cyber - Security / Cyber - Crime unit of the Computer and Intellectual Property Section -- after it was brought to his attention .
Calls to the Department of Justice seeking confirmation that Spoonamore had delivered the Diebold patch were not returned .
Initially , the whistleblower said , there were no concerns or questions regarding the $ 54 million contract , for which Diebold beat out eight other firms , to install a statewide electronic voting system .
It was only after certain red flag events occurred that people inside the Secretary of States office , as well as Diebold employees , began to have suspicions , he added .
What initially raised questions , according to the source , was the behavior of then - Diebold CEO , Bob Urosevich , who personally flew in from Texas and applied the patch in just two counties , DeKalb and Fulton , both Democratic strongholds .
Another flag went up , this person added , when it became apparent that the patch installed by Urosevich had failed to fix a problem with the computer clock -- which employees from Diebold and the Georgia Secretary of States office had been told the patch was designed specifically to address .
The Secretary of States office became aware of this installation during the month after the November 2002 election , as the documents are dated Dec. 3 .
It 's unclear how Cox handled the findings once she was made aware of the patch installation and other technical issues cited in the documents .
Questions raised about race and Diebold terminals
During the period between the election and the faxing of the documents to Diebold by Cox 's office on December 3 , critics of electronic voting had begun to raise questions about the Georgia race .
Incumbent Democratic Sen. Max Cleland , who was five percentage points ahead of Republican challenger Saxby Chambliss in polls taken only a week before the voting , lost 53 percent to 46 percent .
Roy Barnes , the incumbent Democratic Governor , who had been leading challenger Sonny Perdue by a fairly wide margin of eleven points , lost 51 percent to 46 percent .
Cleland could not be reached for comment .
Calls and emails to Premier Election Solutions were not returned .
According to Georgia Election Law Title 21-2-322.16 :  No voting machine shall be adopted or used unless it shall , at the time , satisfy the following requirements .
...
It shall , when properly operated , register or record correctly and accurately every vote cast . 
The last - minute patch installation and the lack of official recertification may have rendered the 2002 GA results invalid .
The whistle - blower , who was close to Coxs office at the time , says he was privy to the discussions surrounding the documents and was concerned by the electoral outcome .
That led him to approach Spoonamore and ask him to examine the Diebold patch .
Security issues have plagued Diebold 's software and machines .
In 2006 , researchers from the University of Connecticut demonstrated that the firm 's optical scan terminals could be compromised .
HBO 's " Hacking Democracy , " which studied the vulnerability of electronic voting machines -- with a particular focus on Diebold -- found that the terminals were subject to hacking and inaccurate vote totals .
In 2007 , Diebold posted the photograph of a key used to open their machines on the company 's website .
Hackers were able to produce a duplicate key based on the photo .

Hate crimes in Los Angeles County rose to their highest level in five years last year , led by attacks between Latinos and blacks , officials said Thursday .
The annual report by the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission showed hate crimes rose by 28 % , to 763 , with vandalism and assault leading the way .
In what commission Executive Director Robin Toma called an alarming trend , hate crimes based on race , religion and sexual orientation all rose , increasing against nearly all groups -- including blacks , gays , Jews , Mexicans , whites and Asians -- even as crime in general declined .
The largest number of racial hate crimes involved Latino suspects against black victims , followed by black suspects against Latino victims .
Latinos also made up the largest number of suspects in hate crimes based on sexual orientation .
Whites were the leading suspects in religion - based incidents .
Overall , blacks made up nearly half the hate crime victims , totaling 310 .

“ What we ’re seeing is the democratization of hate crimes , ” said Brian Levin , who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino .
“ We ’re not only seeing a diversification of victims but also increased diversification of offenders . ”
Police agencies report hate crimes to the county , but because departments vary on when they pursue hate - crime charges , variations in hate - crime numbers can stem from an actual increase in crimes or from changes in reporting .
In this case , experts said they believed that hate crimes themselves , not just the reporting of them , are rising .
Levin said other areas of the country have reported similar increases , including a 30 % increase in New York last year ; a 10 - year study published last fall found that hate crimes in New York began to increase two years ago after declining over several years .
Levin said several factors may be driving the rise , including deepening economic distress , growing ethnic diversity and population density in neighborhoods and what he called “ increasingly inflammatory rhetoric ” over illegal immigration .

Amanda F. Susskind , Pacific Southwest regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles , said hate rhetoric is rising online and is particularly targeting youth , perpetuated in part by as many as 110 white supremacist organizations nationwide .
The rhetoric appears to be influencing other groups , Toma said .
He cited law enforcement reports that some Latino gang members who targeted blacks in the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles were found with neo -Nazi material and some Latino gangs were forming alliances with white supremacists in prisons to prey on blacks .
Despite the intense national debate over illegal immigration , hate crimes against immigrants decreased slightly from 42 to 39 .
However , the report noted that some crimes may “ be inspired by anti-immigrant animus but it may not be explicitly verbalized . ”
The report noted , for instance , that as of last August , Pasadena police had investigated 69 crimes involving attacks against Latinos , many of them low - wage immigrant workers who were robbed and beaten , allegedly by African Americans .
But none of the cases were submitted to the county commission for inclusion in the hate crime report this year .
Advertisement
The report quoted a statement by acting Pasadena Police Chief Christopher Vicino that investigators had theorized the crimes were racially motivated , but it was “ impossible to meet the legal criteria required ” for hate crimes in many cases , such as concrete evidence that prejudice was a substantial factor in the attack .
Incidents against Muslims and people from the Middle East , which increased after the 2001 terrorist attacks and drove reported hate crimes to their highest level ever in Los Angeles County , also fell last year to seven from 25 the previous year .
Salam Al - Marayati of the Muslim Public Affairs Council welcomed the decline but said a recent Gallup Poll showed anti-Muslim hostility had increased by 16 % in the last two years , which he blamed in part on “ anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric ” by some presidential candidates and their supporters .
The county report found that the largest number of religion - based hate crimes was directed against Jews .
In its own survey released in March , the ADL found anti-Semitic incidents declined last year to 186 from 204 .
The incidents included the defacing of L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss ’ office in Sherman Oaks with swastikas .
One of the most worrisome findings , commissioners said , was the rising number of hate crimes between Latinos and blacks -- many of them driven by gang hostility .
Advertisement
The report found that a third of suspected Latino - on - black crimes and 42 % of suspected black - on - Latino crimes involved gangs .
The crimes were increasingly violent last year , including two attempted murders .
Asked what can prevent hate crimes , the Rev. Eric P. Lee of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles offered another answer .
“ Pray , ” he said .
“ How else do you change someone ’s heart ?
Hatred is a spiritual wickedness . ”

We already knew that Wachovia was / is in deep trouble .
And there is no way that this is a coincidence .
Ten counterfeit $ 100 bills in one transaction , from a struggling bank , in the middle of a banking crisis !?
No way .
I know .
I know .
People will say , “ If this was a conspiracy to keep a large , struggling bank alive for perception management purposes , they ’d use supernotes and those would be mixed in and nobody would know the difference .
It ’s just a coincidence that this couple got ten counterfeit $ 100 bills ( out of 36 ) in one transaction . ”
Maybe there are n’t enough supernotes available for the scale of the present crisis …
Just a guess .
If you ’re trying to talk yourself into believing that there ’s nothing to see here , do you remember Waiting for Clarity on the Brink of Oblivion ?
If not , you may want to review that one now , as we learn that , in the midst of a banking crisis , the forth largest U.S. bank , which also happens to be distressed , is distributing counterfeit money …
( Man , I knew it was going to get weird , but I never anticipated this one . )
I do n’t know how much more clarity a person would need , but I ’m afraid that it ’s about to become crystal clear to just about everyone .
UPDATE 1 : Florida Wachovia Distributed Counterfeit $ 20 Bills in June
POSTED : 7:51 am EDT June 26 , 2008
UPDATED : 8:49 am EDT June 26 , 2008
ORANGE COUNTY , Fla . —
An Orange County woman said she received counterfeit cash from a teller inside a bank .
The woman said she cashed a check at the Wachovia bank in Pine Hills .
She took the cash straight to a bank where she had a savings account , but that ’s where another teller recognized something wrong .
“ She was feeling it as she counted it , ” said the woman .
“ She pulled those two bills out of the bunch that was there and she asked another coworker to come over and he said ‘ yeah , those are counterfeit . ' ”
The Secret Service was called in to investigate and found a pair of fake $ 20 bills .
They ’re trying to determine how the money ended up at the bank .
— End Update —
Via : Local6 :
A couple has contacted the Secret Service claiming a Central Florida bank gave them 10 counterfeit bills during a transaction .
Ulises Garcia said he was withdrawing cash from a Wachovia Bank and depositing it into a Bank of America so he could pay his bills online .
However , the Bank of America teller noticed something funny about 10 of the 36 $ 100 bills Garcia said he received from Wachovia Bank — they were counterfeit , Local 6 ’s Tony Pipitone reported .
However , the bank has not given Garcia or his fiancé , Joann Rodriguez , any money .
“ We have big plans , ” Rodriguez said .
“ We were planning to get married in about two or three months . ”
“ And this money ’s pretty important ? ” Pipitone asked .
“ Very important , ” Rodrguez said .
“ It ’s a big part of our wedding . ”
“ It is really frustrating for us , ” Garcia said .
“ The bank is not doing anything about it .
( It ’s ) just not giving us any solutions at all . ”
A Wachovia representative said it will not refund any money because it ca n’t verify the $ 1,000 in counterfeit notes were the same bills Garcia was handed by their teller .
But weeks later , Wachovia did refund $ 40 to another customer with a similar story , Local 6 has learned .
Garcia said Wachovia is ripping him off and has alerted the sheriff ’s office , the Secret Service and the media .
“ Ten ( bills ) in one transaction to come from one bank , that is definitely unusual , ” U.S. Secret Service representative Jim Glendinning said .
“ But is it possible ? ” Pipitone asked .
“ Remotely , yes it is , ” Glendinning said .
Glendinning said he was not surprised the Bank of America caught the counterfeits but wondered how a Wachovia could pass the bills unless a bank employee was in on it , Pipitone reported .

* Do you know what the Round - Robin DNS is ?
Suggested article from our blog :
What is Round - Robin DNS and how to set it up ?
Round - Robin DNS explained
It is quite simple , really .
Round - Robin DNS is a method for load balancing .
It can handle incoming DNS requests and answer them differently , depending on the time of the requests .
If it is set with A records , it will show a different A record to each user , depending on the time of his or her query .
Here you can find Round - Robin example configuration !
How does it work ?
The end result is a point ( the Round - Robin DNS ) that redirects traffic to different hosts and lower the demand of a single host .
People usually use Round - Robin DNS with A or AAAA records , but it can also work with ALIAS DNS records .
You ca n’t use it with CNAME records , because you can have only one for a domain .
The setup process is very easy , so many people prefer to use it over other load balancing methods .

Veterinarians at the Smithsonian ’s National Zoo performed the first successful reverse vasectomy on a Przewalski ’s horse ( E. ferus przewalskii ; E. caballus przewalskii— classification debated ) , pronounced zshah - VAL - skeez .
Przewalksi’s horses are a horse species native to China and Mongolia that was declared extinct in the wild in 1970 .
Currently , there are approximately 1500 of these animals maintained at zoological institutions throughout the world and in several small reintroduced populations in Asia .
This is the first procedure of its kind to be performed on an endangered equid species .
The genes of Minnesota — the horse who underwent the surgery — are extremely valuable to the captive population of the species , which scientists manage through carefully planned pairings to ensure the most genetically diverse population possible .
The horse was vasectomized in 1999 at a previous institution so that he could be kept with female horses without reproducing .
He came to the National Zoo in 2006 .
While surveying the captive North American population of Przewalski ’s horses , scientists realized Minnesota ’s genetic value .
Based on his ancestry , he is the seventh most genetically valuable horse in the North American breeding program .
Zoo scientists were confident that if they could successfully reverse the vasectomy , Minnesota would be able to sire a foal through natural mating .
“ The major challenge we faced was that this procedure had never been performed on an equid , let alone a critically endangered species , ” said Dr. Budhan Pukazhenthi , a reproductive scientist at the National Zoo ’s Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal , Va .
“ We had to develop all new protocols ourselves . ”
The team sought the expertise of Dr. Sherman Silber , a St. Louis - based urologist who pioneered microsurgery for reverse vasectomies in humans and had been successful in vasectomizing and then subsequently reversing vasectomies in South American bush dogs at the St. Louis Zoo .
“ Although our team is very experienced in horse anesthesia and surgery , by using the specialized professional skills of Dr. Silber , we greatly increased the likelihood of success , ” said Dr. Luis Padilla , associate veterinarian at the Conservation and Research Center .
Silber , working with the Zoo ’s team of veterinarians and reproductive scientists , first performed the operation on Minnesota in March 2007 .
That procedure proved unsuccessful , possibly due to the presence of scar tissue or the fact that the horse was positioned on its side , making it difficult to perform the surgery .
Silber was confident that if the horse could be placed on its back , the procedure would be a success .
Laying an anesthetized horse on its back for a prolonged period of time can be challenging due to their size and physiology .
Veterinarians decided it could be done , but only if the surgery time was kept to a minimum .
In October 2007 , the team operated on Minnesota again — completing the procedure in an hour .
Six months later , the Zoo ’s veterinarians and reproductive scientists collected a semen sample from the horse that indicated the procedure had been a success .
“ I ’ve always dreamed of using my expertise to contribute in some way to wildlife survival , ” said Dr. Silber .
“ It also was exciting to pioneer a new procedure for which humans were the ‘ test animal . ’ ”
National Zoo scientists hope to pair Minnesota with a suitable female later in the coming months .
His genes will infuse genetic diversity in a Przewalski ’s horse population that is based on genes from only l4 original animals .
National Zoo scientists are researching ways to improve fertility and produce more offspring in the aging , captive population .
Bolstering the population translates into more horses for future reintroduction programs , essential for a critically endangered species .
Currently , National Zoo scientists are working in remote areas of China using radio collars and Geographic Information System technology to map the movements of Przewalski ’s horses reintroduced by Chinese colleagues into their former habitat .
This breakthrough also has important implications for how endangered species in captivity are managed .
The new knowledge could allow males and females of a species to be exhibited together but temporarily prevented from producing offspring if the Species Survival Plan — a cooperative breeding program among zoos — does not recommend them for breeding .
' The Google '
The first question at an excellent panel at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York today with top web folks from the leading campaign goes to McCain aide Mark Soohoo .
Moderator Andrew Rasiej asks for a show of hands on whether the panelists have had to tell the candidate not to say " The Google " or other flags of tech illiteracy , then turns to Soohoo .
" Is it proper to say I do n’t do raised hand questions ? "
Soohoo responds .
ALSO : Echoing an old Grunwald / Penn line -- though also making an accurate point -- Soohoo points out that the gap in things like Facebook " friends " does n't bear out offline .
" There is this community of people – they just may not be on Facebook , " he said of McCain 's supporters .
UPDATE : Soohoo is getting beat up a bit before what is n't exactly a McCain audience at the tech conference .
Pressed again on McCain 's tech savvy , he defends his candidate .
" You do n’t actually have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country , " he says .
" You actually do , " former Edwards blogger Tracy Russo responds , suggesting he try to explain Twitter to his grandmother and then ask her how that applies to governing .
" John McCain is aware of the Internet , " says Soohoo .
" This is a man who has a very long history of understanding on a range of issues . "
Mr. Obama ’s aides are confident that the passions of the primary season have given way to a more pragmatic view among Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters and that Mr. Obama would not risk a major backlash from women or other constituencies associated with her if the vice presidential slot goes to someone else .
But the Obama camp has done little in public to prepare Clinton supporters for the increasing likelihood that she will not be on the ticket .
There is no shortage of speculation among Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters that she is very much in the running as Mr. Obama begins closing in on a decision .
The list of potential candidates includes Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware , as well as Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia , and other names of varying degrees of plausibility .
The Democratic convention begins Aug. 25 in Denver , and Mr. Obama was said to be considering an announcement the week before , although aides said it could be earlier .
The arguments for picking Mrs. Clinton have always been highly pragmatic , based more on electoral politics than anything else , as Mr. McAuliffe suggested in pointing to the vote - getting power she had exhibited .
( For what it is worth , some of Mr. McCain ’s advisers said they viewed Mrs. Clinton as the single strongest candidate Mr. Obama could pick for those same reasons . )
Those arguments have not held much sway with Mr. Obama or his inner circle .
They have indicated that any political benefits gained by putting Mrs. Clinton on the ticket would be outweighed by the costs .
Mr. Obama ’s advisers say that a central message of his campaign  that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in Washington  would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated Democratic politics since Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 .
In addition , a campaign marked by tight control and few displays of infighting ( a structure that Mr. Obama ’s advisers would like to replicate in the White House should he win ) would , some of Mr. Obama ’s associates said , be undermined by trying to merge with the Clintons .
Several of his associates said they were particularly wary of trying to manage a campaign that included Mr. Clinton .

Millions of baby boomers are about to enter a health care system for seniors that not only is n't ready for them , but may even discourage them from getting quality care .
" We face an impending crisis as the growing number of older patients , who are living longer with more complex health needs , increasingly outpaces the number of health care providers with the knowledge and skills to care for them capably , " said John W. Rowe , professor of health policy and management at Columbia University .
Rowe headed an Institute of Medicine committee that released a report Monday on the health care outlook for the 78 million baby boomers about to begin turning 65 .
The report from the institute , an arm of the National Academy of Sciences , said : • There are n't enough specialists in geriatric medicine .
• Insufficient training is available .
• The specialists that do exist are underpaid .
• Medicare fails to provide for team care that many elderly patients need .
The study said Medicare may even hinder seniors from getting the best care because of its low reimbursement rates , a focus on treating short - term health problems rather than managing chronic conditions and lack of coverage for preventive services or for health care providers ' time spent collaborating with a patient 's other providers .
The American Medical Association responded that seniors ' access to Medicare in coming years " is threatened by looming Medicare physician payment cuts . "
" This July , the government will begin steep cuts in Medicare physician payments , and 60 % of physicians say this cut will force them to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can treat , " the AMA said in a statement .
The report found there are about 7,100 doctors certified in geriatrics in the United States , one per every 2,500 older Americans .
Turnover among nurse aides averages 71 % annually , and up to 90 % of home health aides leave their jobs within the first two years , the report said .
But while today 's elderly tend to be healthier and live longer than previous generations , people over 65 to have more complex conditions and health care needs than younger folks .
The report urged that all health care workers be trained in basic geriatric care and that schools increase training in the treatment of older patients .
The federally required minimum number of hours of training for direct - care workers should be raised from 75 to at least 120 , the report said , noting that more training is required for dog groomers and manicurists than direct - care workers in many parts of the country .
And it said pay for geriatric specialists , doctors , nurses and care workers needs to be increased .
A doctor specializing in elderly care earned $ 163,000 on average in 2005 compared with $ 175,000 for a general internist , even though the geriatric specialist required more training .
The report also urged training for family members and other informal caregivers who assist the elderly .
The study was sponsored by the John A. Hartford Foundation , Atlantic Philanthropies , Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation , Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , Retirement Research Foundation , California Endowment , Archstone Foundation , AARP , Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation and Commonwealth Fund .

So apparently , drugs do n't cause addiction , poor living conditions makes people seek relief however they can .
Often , they can buy drugs , and consume them .
The main argument proposed by the article 's author is that cocaine and heroin are themselves not inherently addictive .
Because these drugs are perceived to be the most addictive , he extrapolates his hypothesis to all drugs .
Claim A : All or most people who use heroin or cocaine beyond a certain minimum amount become addicted .
Claim B : No matter what proportion of the users of heroin and cocaine become addicted , their addiction is caused by exposure to the drug .
Claim A he refutes with a number of seemingly good studies , while Claim B proves itself hard to deny out - right , and still hard to endorse .
The article is an interesting read , if not particularly enlightening , it at least provides some food for thought .
The Rat Park experiments are particularly interesting .

The Cuilfail Hotel
Nestling at the foot of rolling hills , Cuilfail Hotel is a splendid former drovers inn and one of the oldest purpose built hotels on the west coast .
The hotel was originally built as a drovers ’ inn , however the majority of the hotel was built during the Victorian era and many features of that period have been preserved .
The name Cuilfail ( pronounced “ cool - fail ” ) in Gaelic appropriately means “ Sheltered Corner ” .
The main part of the hotel was built in the 1883 , the drovers inn is much older and part of it is now our cosy and unique bar .
The hotel was built to provide for the fishing in the many hill lochs of the area .

For the past few weeks I 've been working with a fellow developer on a project that required an all - out programming effort .
It 's done now , so we 're back to a regular schedule , but when people hear about the crazy hours they often say they 're sorry .
They really should n't be .
I would never do this often , or for long periods , or without proper compensation if done for an employer , but the truth is that these programming blitzkriegs are some of my favorite periods in life .
Under the right conditions , writing software is so intensely pleasurable it should be illegal .
Many programmers relate to this , but others are taken aback when they hear it .
I think it 's because institutions are so good at squeezing the fun out of everything .
It 's appalling for example how schools can take the most vibrant topics and mangle them into formulaic , mediocre slog .
And so it is for programming .
Many corporations turn an inherently rewarding experience into something people just barely stomach in exchange for a paycheck .
That 's too bad .
Few things are better than spending time in a creative haze , consumed by ideas , watching your work come to life , going to bed eager to wake up quickly and go try things out .
I am not suggesting that excessive hours are needed or even advisable ; a sane schedule is a must except for occasional binges .
The point is that programming is an intense creative pleasure , a perfect mixture of puzzles , writing , and craftsmanship .
Programming offers intriguing challenges and ample room for invention .
Some problems are investigative and reductionist :
Why is this code running slowly ?
What on earth is causing that bug ?
Others are constructive , like devising algorithms and architectures .
All of them are a delight if you enjoy analytical work , immersed in a world full of beasts like malware , routers , caches , protocols , databases , graphs , and numbers .
This analytical side is what most people associate with programming .
It does make it interesting , like a complex strategy game .
But in most software the primary challenge is communication : with fellow programmers via code and with users via interfaces .
By and large , writing code is more essay than puzzle .
It is shaping your ideas and schemes into a coherent body ; it is seeking clarity , simplicity and conciseness .
Both code and interfaces abound with the simple joy of creation .
Another source of pleasure is that under certain conditions , beauty arises in programming .
It may sound like bullshit but it 's real , the kind of thing that makes your day better .
Take for example Euclid 's 2 - line proof that prime numbers are infinite .
I think many would find it beautiful - so succint and such a fascinating result .
This is the beauty of math , cold and austere , and it pervades software .
It is in clever algorithms like quicksort , in the sources of kernels and compilers , in elegant exploits and in the tricks we pull to solve everyday problems .
When you see these solutions , be it famous algorithm or mundane trick , you smile and think " how smart " and it feels good .
How noble in reason !
A non-math sort of beauty also exists in code , analogous to eloquence in discourse .
It 's present in well - factored software that does a lot with little code , in short and crisp methods , in well - done architectures .
Some languages make this hard and not all programmers produce it , but it 's a joy to read and work on such code .
If you 're working in an expressive language with coworkers whose code you enjoy , it happens often enough to brighten things up .
Now for craftsmanship .
In a sense software is abstract - where does program behavior exist but in our minds ?
Yet we call it building software for a reason .
Programs are shaped feature by feature , architectures start out as scaffolds and grow , user interfaces come together , bugs are fixed and hotspots are optimized to make things run fast .
Software provides a deeply satisfying sense of craft .
We build stuff out of pure ideas and then get to watch it working to solve real problems and make people a little better off .
Or far better off , as the case may be .
Take Biology .
Despite nearly 400 years of scientific revolution , Biology has been unable to deliver on crucial problems like effective cures for viral infections or cancer .
Some of our best progress , like antibiotics , has been due to chance and random experimentation .
You start a clinical trial for a hypertension drug and suddenly - whoah - all your subjects have hard - ons !
Viagra is born .
To be sure , chance plays a role in all endeavours , but Physics and Chemistry have a comprehensive theoretical basis powering systematic improvements , whereas Biology has been largely confined to kludges .
Wanna treat cancer ?
Here , blast the patient with radiation and poison and hopefully the cancer will die first .
They 're brilliant kludges , and I 'm happy to have them , but it 's a far cry from the precision we 've had elsewhere .
Software is changing that .
Just barely 50 years ago the shape of DNA was being discovered , but now anyone can browse and download hundreds of complete genome sequences .
Or look up thousands of genes ( DLEC1 for a random example ) , complete with nucleotide sequence , amino - acid sequence for expressed proteins , literature mentioning the gene , you name it !
Or you can search vast gene and protein databases for nucleotide or amino - acid sequences , perhaps after sequencing something in ever - cheaper devices , and get a comprehensive report on the match .
It does n't matter if they 're exact , because the algorithm in BLAST , the standard sequence search tool , delivers partial maches across databases and species , scored by match likelihood .
These advances will enable massive breakthroughs in medicine .
Biology is entering a new era , like Physics in the 18th century , propelled by software .
Yea , sure , biologists have a minor role :P , but we in computing increasingly power major developments in science , culture , and business .
When a third - world kid looks up a Wikipedia entry , it 's our work too !
We wrote the RFCs and the networking stacks , the browser and MediaWiki , the OSes and the HTTP servers .
Not to mention a lot of the Wikipedia entries , but since a few were on company time I 'll leave them aside .
The influence of technologists goes beyond bits and bytes : it was a programmer who invented wikis and our community started blogs .
Henry Mencken pointed out correctly that " freedom of the press is limited to those who own one " .
It 's a pity he's not around to watch our creations break down the stifling conformity and cozy subservience of professional journalism .
Less glamorously but to great benefit our applications have delivered steep productivity gains to businesses across the economy .
These are a few examples in a long list .
Three years ago , when I finished my undergrad ( after being a programmer for many years ) , I was about to enter med school .
At that point , a couple of negative experiences had me somewhat burned out on computer work .
I 'm happy I stuck with it .
I 'm still interested in biomedical research , but if I were to get involved I 'd rather come in from the software angle , because frankly it 's too much fun to pass on .
My mom thinks I 'm a typist but oh well .
If you find yourself stuck in a place that 's killing your innate passion for technology , by all means , move the hell on !
Do n't stay put while your enthusiasm is slowly drained .
It 's hard to find motivated people to hire so you 've got a major asset already ; there are plenty of employers - and companies to be started - that will better suit you .
For people who think they might like programming , your mileage may vary , but I highly recommend it as a career .
Not only is the outlook bullish on the job front , but as the role of software grows in society we 'll see more exciting and beneficial changes delivered by technology .
I 'm delighted to be along for the ride as constantly my art and craft I try to master .
PS : thanks for putting up with the irregular posting schedule .
The plan is to stick to regular posting now that things have calmed down .

Sometimes you hear a stray sentence on the news that makes you realise you have been lied to .
Deliberately lied to ; systematically lied to ; lied to for a purpose .
If you listened closely over the past few days , you could have heard one such sentence passing in the night - time of news .
As Ingrid Betancourt emerged after six - and - a- half years – sunken and shrivelled but radiant with courage – one of the first people she thanked was Hugo Chavez .
What ?
If you follow the news coverage , you have been told that the Venezuelan President supports the Farc thugs who have been holding her hostage .
He paid them $ 300 m to keep killing and to buy uranium for a dirty bomb , in a rare break from dismantling democracy at home and dealing drugs .
So how can this moment of dissonance be explained ?
Yes : you have been lied to – about one of the most exciting and original experiments in economic redistribution and direct democracy anywhere on earth .
And the reason is crude : crude oil .
The ability of democracy and freedom to spread to poor countries may depend on whether we can unscramble these propaganda fictions .

Venezuela sits on one of the biggest pools of oil left anywhere .
If you find yourself in this position , the rich governments of the world – the US and EU – ask one thing of you : pump the petrol and the profits our way , using our corporations .
If you do that , we will whisk you up the Mall in a golden carriage , no matter what .
The " King " of Saudi Arabia oversees a torturing tyranny where half the population – women – are placed under house arrest , and jihadis are pumped out by the dozen to attack us .
It does n't matter .
He gives us the oil , so we hold his hand and whisper sweet crude - nothings in his ear .
It has always been the same with Venezuela – until now .
Back in 1908 , the US government set up its ideal Venezuelan regime : a dictator who handed the oil over fast and so freely that he did n't even bother to keep receipts , never mind ask for a cut .
But in 1998 the Venezuelan people finally said " enough " .
They elected Hugo Chavez .
The President followed their democratic demands : he increased the share of oil profits taken by the state from a pitiful one per cent to 33 per cent .
He used the money to build hospitals and schools and subsidised supermarkets in the tin-and - mud shanty towns where he grew up , and where most of his countrymen still live .
I can take you to any random barrio in the high hills that ring Caracas and show you the results .
You will meet women like Francisca Moreno , a gap - toothed 76 - year - old granny I found sitting in a tin shack , at the end of a long path across the mud made out of broken wooden planks .
From her doorway she looked down on the shining white marble of Caracas 's rich district .
" I went blind 15 years ago because of cataracts , " she explained , and in the old Venezuela people like her did n't see doctors .
" I am poor , " she said , " so that was that . "
But she voted for Chavez .
A free clinic appeared two years later in her barrio , and she was taken soon after for an operation that restored her sight .
" Once I was blind , but now I see ! " she said , laughing .
In 2003 , two distinguished Wall Street consulting firms conducted the most detailed study so far of economic change under Chavez .
They found that the poorest half of the country have seen their incomes soar by 130 per cent after inflation .
Today , there are 19,571 primary care doctors – an increase by a factor of 10 .
When Chavez came to power , just 35 per cent of Venezuelans told Latinobarometro , the Gallup of Latin America , they were happy with how their democracy worked .
Today it is 59 per cent , the second - highest in the hemisphere .
For the rich world 's governments – and especially for the oil companies , who pay for their political campaigns – this throws up a serious problem .
We are addicted to oil .
We need it .
We crave it .
And we want it on our terms .
The last time I saw Chavez , he told me he would like to sell oil differently in the future : while poor countries should get it for $ 10 a barrel , rich countries should pay much more – perhaps towards $ 200 .
And he has said that if the rich countries keep intimidating the rest he will shift to selling to China instead .
Start the sweating .
But Western governments cannot simply say : " We want the oil , our corporations need the profits , so let 's smash the elected leaders standing in our way . "
They know ordinary Americans and Europeans would gag .
So they had to invent lies .
They come in waves , each one swelling as the last crashes into incredulity .
First they announced Chavez was a dictator .
This ignored that he came to power in a totally free and open election , the Venezuelan press remains uncensored and in total opposition to him , and he has just accepted losing a referendum to extend his term and will stand down in 2013 .
When that tactic failed , the oil industry and the politicians they lubricate shifted strategy .
They announced that Chavez was a supporter of Terrorism ( it definitely has a capital T ) .
The Farc is a Colombian guerrilla group that started in the 1960s as a peasant defence network , but soon the pigs began to look like farmers and they became a foul , kidnapping mafia .
Where is the evidence Chavez funded them ?
On 1 March , the Colombian government invaded Ecuador and blew up a Farc training camp .
A few hours later , it announced it had found a pristine laptop in the rubble , and had already rummaged through the 39.5 million pages of Microsoft Word documents it contained to find cast - iron " proof " that Chavez was backing the Farc .
Ingrid 's sister , Astrid Betancourt , says it is plainly fake .
The camp had been totally burned to pieces and the computers had clearly , she says , been " in the hands of the Colombian government for a very long time " .
Far from fuelling the guerrillas , Chavez has repeatedly pleaded with the Farc to disarm .
He managed to negotiate the release of two high - profile hostages – hence Betancourt 's swift thanks .
He said : " The time of guns has passed .
Guerilla warfare is history . "
So what now ?
Now they claim he is a drug dealer , he funds Hezbollah , he is insane .
Sometimes they even stumble on some of the real non-fiction reasons to criticise Chavez and use them as propaganda tools .
( See our Open House blog later today for a discussion of this ) .
As the world 's oil supplies dry up , the desire to control Venezuela 's pools will only increase .
The US government is already funding separatist movements in Zulia province , along the border with Colombia , where Venezuela 's largest oilfields lie .
They hope they can break away this whiter - skinned , anti-Chavez province and then drink deep of the petrol there .
Until we break our addiction to oil , our governments will always try to snatch petro-profits away from women like Francisca Moreno .
And we – oil addicts all – will be tempted to ignore the strange , dissonant sentences we sometimes hear on the news and lie , blissed - out , in the lies .

Raw to cooked in 21 minutes .
Who said fast food can't be good food .
I had fun a few years ago with my friend 's oven to see how fast I could make roast potatoes with the desiree potatoes dug up from the garden .
After a few attempts I got it down to 21 minutes from raw potatoes to being crispy roast .
You need a combi oven / grill setting , but most new ovens have these .
Rosemary roast potatoes
Boil potatoes for 10 minutes .
While these are boiling set your oven to combination oven and grill on the top setting .
Place a baking tray under the grill to heat up .
When the potatoes have been boiling for 9 minutes , pour vegetable oil on to the tray , or goose fat if you prefer this , and place this under the grill to heat .
Drain the potatoes and let them sit back in the pan for 1 minute to steam ( they need to be dry on the outside to go crispy ) .
Then ( a Delia trick ) put the lid back on the pan and shake so they go fluffy on the outside .
Slide the potatoes on to the tray carefully as the hot fat splashes scar you for a few weeks - chefs wear long sleeved jackets for a reason , and this is the time when you roll the sleeves down .
You could wear oven gloves or roll a tea towel around your wrists .
Roll the potatoes in the hot oil / fat using a palette knife , and leave lots of space between them , otherwise they steam rather than roast .
I push the potatoes to the outside of the tray where all the heat goes - this means they cook more evenly and faster .
Keep turning to prevent burning .
This should take 8 - 9 minutes .
If you smell burning turn the heat down .
When they are almost finished roll in chopped rosemary and place back in oven for a minute so the rosemary sticks to the potatoes .
FAQ
What if I do n't have a combination oven / grill ?
If you do n't have a combination oven - a normal oven is fine they just take longer .
Can I grill roast potatoes ?
Yes - this works too .
Instead of putting them in the oven once parboiled , dried ( letting them steam for 10 mins ) and rolling in [ olive ] oil , put them under the grill .
You need to keep an eye on them though and keep turning them once they brown on each side .
Can I cook roast potatoes the day before ?
Yes !
This will make your Christmas cooking easy .
Cook them completely as above .
Let them cool and leave them in the fridge overnight .
Then re-heat in the oven at 200 oC for around 15 - 20 minutes .
See notes on dry heat below .
Can I freeze roast potatoes ?
You can of course freeze these - and heat them in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes when you cook your Sunday roast .
How do I make roast potatoes go crispy ?
DRY HEAT – Like yorkshire puddings , roast potatoes really like dry heat .
When you open your oven door with the roast beef & roast vegetables cooking you ’re likely to get a good head of steam escaping .
If you try and put the potatoes in with the roast they always have trouble crisping up because there is too much moisture .
There are two solutions -
1 - Pre-cook the potatoes on the day or the day before and leave them chilled in the fridge , then re-heat them in the oven after the roast meat has come out to rest .
Or you could freeze them ( see above ) .
2 - Use a seperate oven - most cookers have two ovens .
HIGH HEAT - Roast potatoes like high heat to get them crispy , about 240 oC + .
The high heat seems to work well - I cooked them at 240 oC the other day and they brown so well , as long as you remember to turn them .
FLOUR THE POTATOES - Another tip I picked up recently is to sprinkle a little flour over the par - boiled potatoes after being left to steam .
Then toss them gently in the flour so it just coats the potatoes - you do n't want a thick lump of flour - then add to the hot trays with hot oil , and roast as above .
What type of potato make the best roast potatoes ?
Each type of potato has different properties - everyone says maris pipers , but I find these too floury .
Personally in order of preference its :
i Desiree
ii King Edwards
iii Estima
Why do n't my potatoes go crispy ?
I read recently that if potatoes are kept too long the starch turns to sugar , so that obviously affects their browning / staying together properties .
I once ended up using some quite old estima potatoes from a veg shop and they fell apart before they even thought about browning - this is probably the reason .
Supermarkets love to keep things as long as possble in warehouses , so again , if yours do n't turn out so good this could be the reason .....
Also - see use of dry heat above , and remember it depends on what type of potato you use , again - see above .
The cheapest bag of non-descript type of potato wo n't neccessarily give you the results you were after .
Also see high heat above - 240 oC for 20 - 30 minutes when there is nothing else in the oven making steam ( e.g. your roast meat ) gives you a crisp result , as long as you remember to turn them to avoid burning .

@Lynn Peril :
So you 'll be doing " Car of Tomorrow " as well ?
Cool , love me some Tex !
May I humbly suggest " The Cat Who Hated People " ?
Scientists have determined how to fortify the cassava plant , a staple root crop in many developing countries , with enough vitamins , minerals and protein to provide the poor and malnourished with a day 's worth of nutrition in a single meal .
The researchers have further engineered the cassava plant so it can resist the crop 's most damaging viral threats and are refining methods to reduce cyanogens , substances that yield poisonous cyanide if they are not properly removed from the food before consumption .
The reduction of cyanogens also can shorten the time it takes to process the plant into food , which typically requires three to six days to complete .
Studies also are under way to extend the plant 's shelf life so it can be stored or shipped .
The international team of scientists hopes to translate the greenhouse research into a product that can be field tested in at least two African nations by 2010 .
Funded by more than $ 12.1 million in grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the group of researchers is led by Richard Sayre , a professor of plant cellular and molecular biology at Ohio State University .
Sayre presented an update on the BioCassava Plus project June 30 at the American Society of Plant Biologists meeting in Mérida , Mexico .
" This is the most ambitious plant genetic engineering project ever attempted , " Sayre said .
" Some biofortification strategies have the objective of providing only a third of the daily adult nutrition requirements since consumers typically get the rest of their nutritional requirements from other foods in their diet .
But global food prices have recently gone sky high , meaning that many of the poorest people are now eating just one meal a day , primarily their staple food .

" So what we 're working on has become even more important in the last year than it was when we started , not just in regions where people are malnourished , but across developing countries where food has gotten so expensive that people can't afford the diverse diet that they 're used to . "
Cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) is the primary source of calories for an estimated 800 million people worldwide , including 250 million people in sub-Saharan Africa , the current focus of the Gates - funded project .
But the plentiful crop has several drawbacks .
It is composed almost entirely of carbohydrates so it does not provide complete nutrition .
" So what we 're working on has become even more important in the last year than it was when we started , not just in regions where people are malnourished , but across developing countries where food has gotten so expensive that people can't afford the diverse diet that they 're used to . "
The roots can be banked in the ground for up to three years , providing food security , but the plant must undergo time - consuming processing immediately after harvest to remove compounds that generate cyanide .
Unprocessed roots also deteriorate within 48 hours after harvest , limiting the food 's shelf life .
And a plant disease caused by the geminivirus reduces yields by 30 percent to 50 percent in many areas in sub-Saharan Africa , a major blow to farm productivity .
Sayre and colleagues from multiple institutions set out to tackle virtually all of cassava 's problems to make the plant more nutritious and to increase the crop 's revenue - producing potential for farmers .

Sayre reported that the research team has been able to address each of the plant 's deficiencies in individual transgenic plants .
The next step will be to combine some or all of the bioengineered traits into a single , farmer - preferred cultivar , with the goal of eventually developing cassava varieties that carry all of the improvements developed by the researchers .
" We 've begun field trials in Puerto Rico to make sure the plants perform as well outside as they do in greenhouses , and we hope to start field trials in the target countries of Nigeria and Kenya by 2009 , " Sayre said .
The labs in the project have used a variety of techniques to improve on the model cassava plant used for the research .
They used genes that facilitate mineral transport to produce a cassava root that accumulates more iron and zinc from the soil .
To fortify the plants with a form of vitamin E and beta - carotene ( also called pro-vitamin A because it converts to vitamin A in the body ) , the scientists introduced genes into the plant that increase terpenoid and carotenoid production , the precursors for pro-vitamin A and vitamin E .
They achieved a 30 - fold increase in pro-vitamin A , which is critical for human vision , bone and skin health , metabolism and immune function .
Adding protein to the cassava plant has posed a challenge , Sayre said .
The scientists discovered that most of the nitrogen required to make the amino acids used for protein synthesis in roots is derived from the cyanogens that also cause cyanide toxicity .
So their strategy for increasing protein levels in roots focuses on accelerating the conversion of cyanide - containing compounds into protein rather than completely eliminating cyanogen production , which would hinder the efforts to increase protein production , Sayre explained .
To further address the cyanide problem , the scientists have also developed a way to accelerate the processing methods required to remove cyanide -- a days - long combination of peeling , soaking and drying the roots before they are eaten .
To strengthen the cassava plant 's resistance to viruses , the scientists introduced a protein and small interfering RNA molecules that interfere with the viruses ' ability to reproduce .
Prolonging cassava 's shelf life has involved the development of a hybrid species that crosses two related plants native to Texas and Brazil .
The strategy , still in development , will combine the properties of these plants and additional genes that function as antioxidants , slowing the rotting process that has been traced to the production of free radicals that damage and kill cells in newly harvested cassava roots .
The first cassava product the team plans to develop for investigations in the field will likely include the virus resistance , elevated protein , elevated beta - carotene ( pro-vitamin A ) and elevated minerals ( iron and zinc ) , Sayre said .
" These traits have been working the best in the greenhouse , and the virus resistance is critical to success in the field , " he said .
" The thinking behind starting with these four traits is driven by science and by the impact they can have . "
The BioCassava Plus project was launched with a $ 7.5 million grant from the Gates Foundation and recently received an additional $ 4.6 million in supplemental funding from the foundation to accelerate the application of this research in Africa by African scientists .
The supplemental funding will support the training of African scientists so they can produce the transgenic plants in African institutions for use on African farms .
" It will not only be an improved staple crop eaten as a main source of nutrition , but we 're also looking at the transformation of cassava from a staple crop to an income - generating crop , " Sayre said .
" That lifts people out of poverty , allows families to send kids to school and build infrastructure in their villages , so this is an important way to cross cultural barriers .
There are many different cultures and languages in Africa , but higher crop yield , productivity , longer shelf life and making money are things that everyone understands . "
The BioCassava Plus research team includes Claude Fauquet , Nigel Taylor , Dan Shachtman , Ed Cahoon and Paul Anderson of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis ; Willi Gruissem and Peng Zhang of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich ; John Beeching of the University of Bath in England ; John Fellman of Washington State University ; Martin Fregene and Hernan Ceballos of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia ; Ivan Ingelbrecht , Alfred Dixon and Bussie Maziya - Dixon of IITA - Nigeria ( an African research organization ) ; Caroline Herron of IITA - Kenya ; Simon Gichuki of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute ; Ada Mbanaso of the National Root Crops Research Institute in Nigeria ; Dimuth Siritunga of the University of Puerto Rico ; Mark Manary of Washington University ; and independent consultant Jeff Stein .

Four years after its athletes received a huge ovation at the first Olympics after the fall of Saddam Hussein , Iraq was told Thursday that its seven - member team would not be allowed to compete in Beijing because of a dispute with the International Olympic Committee .
Olympic officials informed Iraq that it was barring the team because the government had dismissed the country ’s Olympic committee and appointed a new body chaired by its youth and sports minister .
The IOC action two weeks before the Games ’ opening ceremony came after it had threatened in June to bar Iraq from participating .
Iraqi officials have charged that the IOC was misrepresenting their efforts to rebuild the country ’s executive Olympic body after a mass kidnapping two years ago .
They said the new panel was appointed because after the kidnapping , the executive committee had been beset by corruption and a shortage of members .

“ I am deeply saddened for the Iraqi athletes who did nothing wrong , ” said Anita DeFrantz , the senior American member of the IOC .
“ It is hard to understand how a government in today ’s world could purposely deny them their opportunity by fiat . ”
IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies laid out hope that last - minute talks could save the day .
“ If there can be some movement and if a resolution can be found , that ’s still an open door , ” she told CNN .
She estimated that Iraq had about a week to salvage the situation .
None of the seven Iraqi athletes , who were to compete in track and field , rowing , archery and weightlifting , were considered medal contenders .
The track and field athletes , both sprinters , stand the best chance of still being able to compete because the deadline for entries in that sport comes after the Aug. 8 opening ceremony , according to the IOC .
While the IOC accused Iraq ’s government of meddling in sports , Baghdad accused the IOC of failing to meet with Iraqi officials and of being under the thrall of favorites dating back to 2004 , when the first post - Hussein Olympic committee was set up under the sponsorship of the U.S. - led Coalition Provisional Authority .

“ It was an unfair decision against the Iraqi Olympic movement and Iraqi sports , ” said Basil Adel Mehdi , an advisor to the minister of youth and sports .
“ It is a punishment against Iraqi athletes . ”
The dispute is in part a legacy of Iraq ’s civil conflict .
More than 30 employees of the Iraqi Olympic organization were kidnapped by about 60 men dressed in Iraqi government security uniforms in July 2006 .
The chairman and three others on the 11 - member national committee were never found .
At the time , some sports observers suggested the abduction might have been linked to internal power struggles .
Star athletes in soccer , wrestling and martial arts also have been killed since 2006 .
After the abductions , the committee dwindled from 11 members to three .
In May 2007 , the government made its first attempt to fill the empty slots , adding three more members , Mehdi said .
A year later , the government disbanded that committee and appointed a new , temporary body .
Advertisement
Mehdi , who is the brother of Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi , said that the old executive committee had been beset by corruption and that former members of Hussein ’s Baath Party had continued to exert influence there .
He accused former Baathists of playing a role in sabotaging Iraq ’s relations with the IOC .
Mehdi accused the IOC of ignoring Iraqi government explanations and being evasive about planning a meeting to settle the dispute .
In turn , the IOC says the Iraqi government did not respond to invitations to meet with Olympic officials in Lausanne , Switzerland , after they were warned in June .
The predominance of Shiites in the Ministry of Youth and Sports had fanned concerns that sectarian issues were at play in the case .

But perhaps Iraq ’s greatest Olympic moment was in 2004 in Athens , where the men ’s soccer team reached the semifinals before finishing fourth .
The soccer team failed to qualify for this Olympics .
There had been some question about whether Iraq would be allowed to attend the Athens Games , as well .

Parker reported from Baghdad and Elliott from Los Angeles .
Times Sports Editor Randy Harvey in Los Angeles contributed to this report .
As John McCain continues to address the nation ’s economic woes , he ’s bound to have a few stumbles along the way .
After all , this is the man who has repeatedly professed his lack of mastery on economic issues ( despite his recent denials that he ever said such ridiculous things ) .
And even if he were an expert , this stuff can be damn confusing .
So it may not come as a surprise that his pledge earlier this week to eliminate the deficit by 2013 was met with skepticism and even outright derision .
Let ’s have a listen , shallwe ?
• Robert Gordon and James Kvaal write that McCain ’s “ fantastical pledge ” to balance the budget “ through massive tax cuts and unidentified budget reductions deserved the bad reviews it received . ”
But it ’s not an isolated incident :
His “ incoherent promise ” is “ representative of his policy agenda these days ” as he ’s been “ making diametrically opposed policy promises to different audiences at the same time . ” [ New Republic ]
• Someone at the Economist ( no bylines ) says McCain ’s pledge “ sounds all but impossible , especially given his need to appease ” both economic wings of his party , the “ deficit hawks and the supply - siders . ”
While all “ presidential campaigns run economic plans with heroic , if not downright delusional , assumptions at their core , ” McCain “ risks , in making too many promises , tarnishing his reputation as a straight talker . ” [ Economist ]
• The Boston Globe editorial board contends that “ McCain ’s strategy for the deficit may be his platform ’s weakest leg . ”
He ’s “ provided few details for how he proposed to eliminate what the Congressional Budget Office says will be a $ 443 billion deficit by 2013 , ” and “ [ g ] oing after ‘ pork - barrel spending ’ does n’t begin to cover it . ” [ Boston Globe ]
• Kevin Sack notes that McCain ’s plan to assist states ’ health - insurance plans for high - risk applicants will be further complicated by his budget promise this week , as the “ campaign has made only a rough calculation of how many billions would be needed and has not identified a source for the financing beyond savings from existing programs . ” [ NYT ]
• Nedra Pickler says that while Barack Obama has admitted he ’s not going to even try to match McCain ’s goal , “ fiscal experts ” generally agree that McCain ’s plan is “ overly ambitious . ” [ AP ]
• Josh Marshall claims that “ [ e] very sentient being who ’s looked at his spending and tax cut proposals knows he wo n’t come close to balancing the budget in four years . ”
[ Talking Points Memo ]
• Ed Morrissey believes that Obama ’s willingness to blithely ignore the deficit and propose “ massive expansions of federal spending ” will “ burden Americans even more than now . ”
After years of complaining that President Bush was running up the deficit , now Democrats are claiming that “ the deficit is of no consequence at all . ” [ Hot Air ]
• Alexander Burns and Avi Zenilman discover that many of the economists who have signed on to McCain ’s “ Jobs for America ” plan “ do n’t actually support the whole of McCain ’s economic agenda ” and “ many were unfamiliar with — or downright opposed to — key details . ”
One reason for the discrepancy is that the McCain campaign started collecting signatures months ago , and the statement contained “ no mention of the gas tax holiday or the deficit . ” [ Politico ]
• Matthew Yglesias criticizes McCain ’s “ preposterous ” claim that he can help to balance the budget in part through money saved from a victory in Iraq .
While “ it ’s true that securing some undefined victory through undefined methods at an unknown future date would be cheaper than continuing precisely as is forever , ” it ’s really only a question of “ how much additional deficit spending will take place . ” [ Atlantic ] — Dan Amira

She explained , as if to an enthusiastic but slightly dim child , that a waria who is hanging around on a street corner to be interviewed by a research team is a waria who is not with a client .
‘ You are talking to all the dogs , obviously ’ .
Not something I learned in the lecture halls of London … but Ines is quite right .
Our sample is biased towards the ‘ dogs , ’ who get picked up less than the cuter girls .
So the study results underestimate the true number of clients per seller …
Ines ’s comments … prodded us into changing the sampling strategy … now we work with the powers - that - be ( the mami , the pimps , the brothel owners ) to arrange off - hours time for data collection .
The principle ….is that you are not cutting into people ’s work time , so there is less chance of talking only to the remnant sex workers who ca n’t get a client .

The structure of blood vessels is complex Scientists have used human cells to grow new blood vessels in a mouse for the first time , a US journal reports .
It could eventually help patients who had suffered heart attacks , they said .
A mixture of " progenitor " cells , taken from blood and bone marrow , made cells lining the vessels , and also those surrounding the lining .
A UK expert said that the Harvard research was " promising " , and could eventually help lab - grown organs to be implanted successfully .
The ability to develop swiftly a new network of tiny blood vessels - known as capillaries - would be a prize for scientists .
There are dozens of potential applications in medicine , particularly in the treatment of conditions which involve damage to a tissue 's blood supply , such as that to the heart muscle following a heart attack .
However , the complex structure of these vessels has slowed progress .
What 's really significant about our study is that we are using human cells that can be obtained from blood or bone marrow rather than removing and using fully developed blood vessels
Dr Joyce Bischoff
Harvard Medical School
The latest study , published in the journal Circulation Research , uses two types of " progenitor " cells , which have the ability , like stem cells , to form different cell types .
In this case , " endothelial " progenitor cells have the ability to form the cells which line blood vessels , while " mesenchymal " progenitor cells can form the cells adjacent to this lining , which help to support it .
Unlike more controversial stem cell therapies , which might require cells taken from an embryo , these progenitor cells can be harvested from the blood or bone marrow of an adult , or from the umbilical cord .
They were mixed together in growth - promoting chemicals in the laboratory , then implanted into mice whose immune systems had been weakened to avoid rejection .
Pig progress
Within seven days , a " vigorous network " of new vessels formed , joined up with the host animal 's blood vessels and started transporting blood .
Dr Joyce Bischoff , who led the research team , said : " What 's really significant about our study is that we are using human cells that can be obtained from blood or bone marrow rather than removing and using fully developed blood vessels . "
Dr Nick Rhodes , from the UK Centre for Tissue Engineering at the University of Liverpool , said that the results were " interesting and promising " .
He said : " It could certainly assist in the connection of other engineered organs to the body 's blood supply .
" Although this approach is not yet suitable for clinical use , it is interesting that they have demonstrated you have all the elements you need to create a functional network of capillaries from a small amount of blood . "

NOTE FROM JOHN : Pig .
ANOTHER NOTE FROM JOHN : AP could only find one negative quote that Helms made ?
They ’re making him sound like Garrison Keillor .
One of the most hateful men in American politics is dead :
Former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms , a North Carolina Republican who became an icon to conservatives , died Friday at the age of 86 , a senior congressional source told CNN .
Ca n’t even begin to think of anything nice to say about this guy — but a lot of other people will start praising Helms as if none of the hateful stuff matters .
The hateful stuff matters .
Let ’s reminisce on the life of one of America ’s biggest bigots who ruined the lives of so many .
Jesse Helms on “ negroes ” :
As an aide to the 1950 Senate campaign of North Carolina Republican candidate Willis Smith , Helms reportedly helped create attack ads against Smith ’s opponent , including one which read : “ White people , wake up before it is too late .
Do you want Negroes working beside you , your wife and your daughters , in your mills and factories ?
Frank Graham favors mingling of the races . ”
Another ad featured photographs
Helms himself had doctored to illustrate the allegation that Graham ’s wife had danced with a black man .
( The News and Observer , 8/26/01 ; The New Republic , 6/19 / 95 ; The Observer , 5/5/96 ; Hard Right : The Rise of Jesse Helms , by Ernest B. Furgurson , Norton , 1986 ) The University of North Carolina was “ the University of Negroes and Communists . ” ( Capital Times , 11/22/94 )
Black civil rights activists were “ Communists and sex perverts . ” ( Copley News Service , 8/23/01 )
Of civil rights protests
Helms wrote , “ The Negro can not count forever on the kind of restraint that ’s thus far left him free to clog the streets , disrupt traffic , and interfere with other men ’s rights . ”
( WRAL - TV commentary , 1963 ) He also wrote , “ Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are a fact of life which must be faced . ” ( New York Times , 2/8/81 )
Helms on “ degenerate , weak , sick homosexuals ” :
Over the years Helms has declared homosexuality “ degenerate , ” and homosexuals “ weak , morally sick wretches . ”
( Newsweek , 12/5/94 )
In a tirade highlighting his routine opposition to AIDS research funding , Helms lashed out at the Kennedy - Hatch AIDS bill in 1988 : “ There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that can not be traced in origin to sodomy . ”
( States News Service , 5/17/88 )
Helms being a racist :
And the man ABC News now describes as a “ conservative icon ” ( 8/22/01 ) in 1993 sang “ Dixie ” in an elevator to Carol Moseley - Braun , the first African - American woman elected to the Senate , bragging , “ I ’m going to make her cry .
I ’m going to sing Dixie until she cries . ” ( Chicago Sun-Times , 8/5/93 )
Helms filibusters making Martin Luther King day a national holiday :
A year before the election , when public polls showed Helms trailing by 20 points , he launched a Senate filibuster against the bill making the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. a national holiday .
( David Broder , Washington Post , Aug , 29 , 2001 )
On cutting AIDS funding :
Sen .
Jesse Helms says the government should spend less money on people with AIDS because they got sick as a result of “ deliberate , disgusting , revolting conduct , ” The New York Times reported Wednesday … .
“ We ’ve got to have some common sense about a disease transmitted by people deliberately engaging in unnatural acts , ” Helms told the Times .
And before anyone says that Helms came around on AIDS in his later years .
No he did n’t .
He came around on AIDS in Africa .
Still did n’t want to help Americans with AIDS because , you know , they were homersexuals .

Radovan Karadzic is one of the world 's most wanted men Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic , one of the world 's most wanted men , has been arrested in Serbia after more than a decade on the run .
The Bosnian Serb wartime political leader disappeared in 1996 .
He has been indicted by the UN tribunal for war crimes and genocide over the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica .
The appointment of a new , pro-European government in Belgrade last month appears to have cleared the way for his arrest , says a BBC correspondent .
The European Union , which the new government hopes to join , has put Serbia under considerable pressure to hand over indicted war criminals to the UN tribunal in The Hague .
But Mr Karadzic 's wartime military leader , Ratko Mladic , remains at large .
' Located and arrested '
The arrest of Radovan Karadzic was welcomed by war crimes prosecutors in The Hague as a " milestone " .
He has been brought before Belgrade 's war crimes court , a legal procedure that indicates he may soon be extradited .
But it is not clear how soon he might be transferred to stand trial at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague , says the BBC's Bridget Kendall .
Serbian officials have suggested he will stay put for at least three days while his lawyer appeals against his extradition .
This is a very important day for the victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade
Serge Brammertz
ICTY chief prosecutor
Analysis : New directions in Belgrade
In pictures : Karadzic detained Send us your comments
Officials said no further information about his detention would be released until the action team of prosecutors , police and intelligence teams meet in Belgrade on Tuesday morning , the BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe says .
" Radovan Karadzic was located and arrested tonight [ Monday evening ] " by Serbian security officers , a statement by the office of President Boris Tadic said , without giving details .
" Karadzic was brought to the investigative judge of the War Crimes Court in Belgrade , in accordance with the law on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [ ICTY ] . "
Serbian government sources told Reuters news agency he had been under surveillance for several weeks , following a tip - off from a foreign intelligence service .
But his lawyer , Svetozar Vujacic , said Mr Karadzic had been detained " on Friday in a bus " and held till he was brought before the judge of Serbia 's war crimes court for questioning .
Mr Karadzic was said to have remained silent during questioning .
Heavily armed special forces were deployed around the war crimes court in Belgrade - apparently fearing a backlash from nationalists who consider Mr Karadzic a hero .
" He did not surrender , that is not his style , " his brother , Luka Karadzic , said outside the court .
' Milestone in co-operation ' Serge Brammertz , chief prosecutor of the ICTY , welcomed the arrest .
THE CHARGES
Eleven counts of genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity and other atrocities Charged for the killing of some 12,000 civilians during the siege of Sarajevo Allegedly organised the massacre of at least 7,500 Muslim men and youths in Srebrenica Targeted Bosnian Muslim and Croat political leaders , intellectuals and professionals Unlawfully deported and transferred civilians because of national or religious identity Destroyed homes , businesses and sacred sites " This is a very important day for the victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade , " he said in a statement in The Hague .
In the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , crowds spilt onto the streets to celebrate news of the arrest as cars streamed through the streets sounding their horns .
" This is the best thing that could ever happen , you see people celebrating everywhere .
I called and woke up my whole family , " Sarajevo resident Fadil Bico told Reuters .
Richard Holbrooke , the US diplomat who brokered the Dayton Peace Accord for Bosnia in 1995 , told the BBC that " a major , major thug has been removed from the public scene " .
" One of the worst men in the world , the Osama Bin Laden of Europe , has finally been captured , " Mr Holbrooke told BBC World News America .
Ljiljana Zelen - Karadzic , wife of Radovan Karadzic , said her daughter had called her to break news of the arrest to her .
" As the phone rang , I knew something was wrong .
I 'm shocked , confused .
At least now , we know he is alive , " she told the Associated Press .
The arrest of Mr Karadzic and other indicted war criminals is one of the main conditions of Serbian progress towards European Union membership .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , whose country holds the EU 's rotating presidency , said a major obstacle to Serbian membership had been lifted .
Karadzic denial Srebrenica was the scene of the worst massacre in the Bosnian war Mr Karadzic denied the charges against him soon after the first indictment and refused to recognise the legitimacy of the UN tribunal .
The UN says Mr Karadzic 's forces killed at least 7,500 Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica in July 1995 as part of a campaign to " terrorise and demoralise the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat population " .
He was also charged over the shelling of Sarajevo , and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in May and June 1995 .
After the Dayton accord that ended the Bosnian war in 1995 , the former nationalist president went into hiding .
International pressure to catch Mr Karadzic mounted in spring 2005 when several of his former generals surrendered and a video of Bosnian Serb soldiers shooting captives from Srebrenica shocked television viewers in former Yugoslavia .
He had been a close ally of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , who was himself extradited to The Hague tribunal in 2001 , but died in 2006 , shortly before a verdict was due to be delivered in his case .

Live Mesh connects devices and services online and offline Microsoft has lifted the lid on a new web service called Live Mesh , designed to connect a multiplicity of devices and applications online .
The service is seen by many as a key plank in the company 's vision for the future of the web .
Live Mesh is designed to blur the lines between running software and storing data on a desktop and " in the cloud " .
Microsoft 's Amit Mital said Live Mesh would " connect and bring devices together ... to work in concert " .
Live Mesh pits Microsoft against companies like Amazon , Google and Salesforce.com which are already offering different varieties of so - called software - as - a - service systems .
It comes as Microsoft is engaged in a bid to buy rival Yahoo and emphasises just how important the web has become to the firm .
From dot. life blog Microsoft has been torn between a business model which ties people to specific platforms , and a realisation that the web is turning everything on its head
Darren Waters , Technology editor , BBC News website
Read more on the dot. life blog " We may be seeing signs of a Microsoft that is newly focused , " Jonathan Yarmis , a vice president and analyst at AMR Research , told Reuters news agency .
He added : " This is exciting because it has as much to do with who is doing it as what Microsoft is doing . "
Microsoft has long been criticised for its unfocused efforts in the online space and for attempting to tie the use of Windows to the web .
While initially offered for Windows XP and Vista users , Microsoft has said Live Mesh will also be rolled out to Apple Macs and other platforms .
Mr Mital , general manager of Live Mesh , said : " Devices are how we interact in this new " web- connected " world and we use a variety of them , including PCs , laptops , media devices , phones , digital picture frames , game consoles , music players and the list grows at every CES .
Live Mesh is a web - based platform " However , as we discover , adopt and use more of these digital devices , it becomes increasingly difficult to keep the people , information and applications we depend on in sync . "
Microsoft says Live Mesh can be used to create an online network of devices , from your PC to your mobile phone .
Files and folders , such as documents , music and photos , on those devices can be synchronised online and accessed via a web browser .
Live Mesh is also designed to facilitate the sharing of media online between different users .
" This new software - plus - services platform enables PCs and other devices to ' come alive ' by making them aware of each other through the internet , " said Mr Mital .
" We aspire to bring together Windows , Windows Live , and Windows Mobile by creating seamless experiences that span these offerings , " Ray Ozzie , Microsoft 's chief software architect , wrote in a memo to staff this week .
Users will have 5GB of personal online storage and unlimited peer - to - peer data , for synchronising information between devices .

Hillary Clinton on Gun Control Democratic Jr Senator ( NY ) ; Secretary of State - Designee
Balance lawful gun ownership & keeping guns from criminals
CLINTON : I respect the Second Amendment .
I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns , to use their guns , but I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands .
And as president , I will work to try to bridge this divide , which I think has been polarizing and , frankly , does n’t reflect the common sense of the American people .
We will strike the right balance to protect the constitutional right but to give people the feeling & the reality that they will be protected from guns in the wrong hands .
Source : 2008 Philadelphia primary debate , on eve of PA primary Apr 16 , 2008
Give local police access to federal gun tracking info
I will also work to reinstate the assault weapons ban .
We had it during the 1990s .
It really was an aid to our police officers , who are now once again , because it has lapsed -- the Republicans will not reinstate it -- are being outgunned on our streets by these military - style weapons .
I will also work to make sure that police departments get access to the federal information that will enable them to track illegal guns , because the numbers are astounding .
Probably 80 % of the guns used in gun crimes got there illegally .
And under the Republicans , that information was kept from local law enforcement .

Let states & cities determine local gun laws
A : I want to give local communities the authority over determining how to keep their citizens safe .
This case you ’re referring to is before the Supreme Court .
Q : But what do you support ?
A : I support sensible regulation that is consistent with the constitutional right to own and bear arms .
Q : Is the DC ban consistent with that right ?
A : I think a total ban , with no exceptions under any circumstances , might be found by the court not to be .
But DC or anybody else [ should be able to\ come up with sensible regulations to protect their people .
Q : But do you still favor licensing and registration of handguns ?
A : What I favor is what works in NY .
We have one set of rules in NYC and a totally different set of rules in the rest of the state .
What might work in NYC is certainly not going to work in Montana .
So , for the federal government to be having any kind of blanket rules that they ’re going to try to impose , I think does n’t make sense .

Get assault weapons & guns off the street
A : I think it ’s important to remember that the crime rate was driven down , & gun violence was driven down in the 1990s because of a combination of policies , like 100,000 police on the street and getting assault weapons off the street , and because of a growing economy .
22 million new jobs gave people who were hopeless a better chance for a future .
So I want to get back to what works .
This administration has tried to kill the 100,000 police .
You ’ve got mayors whose police force is outgunned by the criminals and the gang - bangers .
Assault weapons are back on the street .
We ’ve got to go and do what works again .
In addition to having policies that will get guns off the street , we do have to give young men particularly a better chance of a future that includes educational & economic opportunities & second chances when they get caught up in the criminal justice system .

Background check system could prevent Virginia Tech massacre
A : Yes .
You know , I remember very well when I accompanied Bill to Columbine after that massacre and met with the family members of those who had been killed and talked with the students , and feeling that we had to do more to try to keep guns out of the hands of the criminal and of the mentally unstable .
And during the Clinton administration , that was a goal - - not to , in any way , violate people ’s Second Amendment rights , but to try to limit access to people who should not have guns .
Unfortunately , we saw the tragedy unfold at Virginia Tech .
We now know that the background check system did n’t work , because certainly this shooter , as he ’s called , had been involuntarily committed as a threat to himself and others .
And , yet , he could walk in and buy a gun .

FactCheck : VA
Tech shooter not declared a danger to others
That ’s only half true .
It ’s correct that Seung - hui Cho had a court - documented history of mental illness that should have precluded his purchase of a firearm .
And he was indeed found to present “ an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness “ in a ruling dated December 14 , 2005 .
But the Judge did not check a box that would have declared Cho ” an imminent danger to others . “
Moreover , the judge declined to involuntarily commit Cho and sent him to outpatient counseling .
Clinton ’s confusion on this might stem from bad reporting by some news outlets that said Cho was found to be a danger to himself and others .

Prevent unauthorized firearm use with " smart gun " technology .
Make America the “ Safest Big Country ” in the World
After climbing relentlessly for three decades , crime rates started to fall in the 1990s .
Nonetheless , the public remains deeply concerned about the prevalence of gun violence , especially among juveniles , and Americans still avoid public spaces like downtown retail areas , parks , and even sports facilities .
We need to keep policing “ smart ” and community - friendly , prohibiting unjust and counterproductive tactics such as racial profiling ; focus on preventing as well as punishing crime ; pay attention to what happens to inmates and their families after sentencing ; use mandatory testing and treatment to break the cycle of drugs and crime ; and enforce and strengthen laws against unsafe or illegal guns .
Moreover , we need a renewed commitment to equal justice for all , and we must reject a false choice between justice and safety .
Technology can help in many areas : giving police more information on criminal suspects so they do not rely on slipshod , random stop - and - search methods ; allowing lower - cost supervision of people on probation or parole ; and making it possible to disable and / or trace guns used by unauthorized persons .
Above all , we need to remember that public safety is the ultimate goal of crime policy .
Until Americans feel safe enough to walk their neighborhood streets , enjoy public spaces , and send their children to school without fear of violence , we have not achieved public safety .
Goals for 2010 Reduce violent crime rates another 25 percent .
Cut the rate of repeat offenses in half .
Develop and require “ smart gun ” technology to prevent use of firearms by unauthorized persons and implement sensible gun control measures .
Ban racial profiling by police but encourage criminal targeting through better information on actual suspects .
Require in - prison and post - prison drug testing and treatment of all drug offenders .

The Phoenix lander team revealed the latest images from the mission at a press briefing on Friday .
This first image shows an area dug by Phoenix ’s scoop , which disclosed a bright surface just a few inches down , which may be ice .
“ There ’s still some debate about the bright material , ” said Phoenix Principle Investigator Peter Smith .
“ Not everyone is sure that this is ice .
So there ’s been some debate on our team , centering around that perhaps there ’s a salt layer just under the soil that also would be bright .
Everyone does believe there ’s ice under the surface , and whether this is ice or not is the question .
The other question is , is this thick ice that goes down deep beneath the surface , or is this a thin layer and we ’ll be able to scrape through ?
So being able to scrape with our scoop is a high priority for us . ”
This pair of images taken by the Optical Microscope on NASA ’s Phoenix Mars Lander offers a side - by - side comparison of an airfall dust sample collected on a substrate exposed during landing ( left ) and a soil sample scooped up from the surface of the ground beside the lander .
In both cases the sample is collected on a silicone substrate , which provides a sticky surface holding sample particles for observation by the microscope .
Similar fine particles at the resolution limit of the microscope are seen in both samples , indicating that the soil has formed from settling of dust .
The microscope took the image on the left during Phoenix ’s Sol 9 ( June 3 , 2008 ) , or the ninth Martian day after landing .
It took the image on the right during Sol 17 ( June 11 , 2008 ) .
The scale bar is 1 millimeter ( 0.04 inch ) .
This is the latest color image of Phoenix , its surroundings and the scoop with soil .
While we ca n’t look inside the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) oven which will “ bake ” the Martian soil to test the type of gases that are released , we can see that some of the soil has gone into TEGA .
“ We were finally successful and some of the material has slid down over the screen ” said Smith , “ sort of like material going over a cheese grater , and some of the material has slid down and filled the oven .
We sent the commands for the first operation of TEGA last night , but we do n’t have our data back yet , so we ca n’t report on any results .
That will be coming later next week .
So this is a very exciting time for us .
We find the soil is very clumpy , it ’s sticky , it ’s an unusual soil not at all like the types of soils we used in our tests , which worked just fine with all the instruments .
So we ’ve developed another method of collecting samples , which is to tilt the scoop and vibrate it , and so it shakes down a small amount of material onto the instruments . ”
And finally , here ’s the latest weather report for Mars , on the 17th sol of Phoenix ’s stay on Mars .

Democrats introduce bill to outlaw Pentagon propaganda Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 9 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Last April , the New York Times revealed that retired officers serving as military analysts on television news shows had regularly been briefed by the Pentagon and supplied with pro-war and pro-administration talking points .
The program was " temporarily suspended " by the Pentagon a week later .
Now four senators have introduced legislation to prevent it from resuming .
Senators Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Bob Menendez ( D - NJ ) , and Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) have introduced S. 3099 , titled " A bill to prohibit the use of funds by the Department of Defense for propaganda purposes within the United States not otherwise specifically authorized by law . "
" This Administration has a history of pushing propaganda on the American public , " Sen. Lautenberg explained .
" The American people expect our federal government to tell the nation the truth . "
" There is no need for paid cheerleaders to support an argument , " added Sen. Menendez .
The bill is a companion measure to an amendment to the military authorization bill which passed the House of Representatives on May 23 .
The television networks , which avoided reporting on the original New York Times story , have also paid little notice to the House ban .
Following the House passage of the amendment , the inspector general 's office at the Department of Defense announced that it would be looking into the program , while the Government Accountability Office said it was already doing so .
The Senate bill mandates that both those offices report to Congress within 90 days .
" We 're going to make sure the public money is n't used for propaganda campaigns that undermine the public trust , " Sen .
Kerry stated .
" The American people should not have to wonder whether the purportedly non-partisan , expert analysis they see on television might have been shaped by a government propaganda campaign . "
India 's trade minister , Kamal Nath , yesterday accused the United States of putting the livelihoods of a billion of the world 's poorest people against " commercial interests " as each country blamed the other for the acrimonious collapse of world trade talks in Geneva .
As ministers from more than 30 countries prepared to leave the World Trade Organisation 's Swiss headquarters after nine fruitless and exhausting days of negotiations , the bitter atmosphere between leading players underlined fears that the Doha round could take years to revive .
Visibly angry , Nath told journalists : " The most important thing was the livelihood security , the vulnerability of poor farmers , which could not be traded off against the commercial interests of the developed countries . "
He said his position was supported by 100 countries , representing a billion subsistence farmers .
The talks - the latest attempt to complete the seven - year - long trade round - collapsed late on Tuesday , over India 's insistence that developing countries must be able to protect their agricultural sector against sudden surges of subsidised imports from the US and EU .
Susan Schwab , the US trade representative , said an outline agreement drafted by WTO director general Pascal Lamy had been , " negotiated to within an inch of its life " , and , " if you pulled one thread , you threatened to unravel the whole thing " .
" Every country in the room accepted it except one ; subsequently , all of us showed flexibility except one , " she added , in a clear jibe at India .
China , too , joined the frenzy of finger - pointing , weighing in to support India .
An editorial from the Chinese official news agency , Xinhua , lambasted the " selfishness and short - sighted behaviour " of wealthy nations for bringing down the negotiations at the 11th hour .
Less powerful developing countries also expressed concern that significant developments in the talks over the past week took place among an inner core of only seven major trading powers .
" Mr Lamy invited around 30 ministers , and then we had just seven countries involved in the process , " said a spokesman for the Indonesian delegation .
" We understand that maybe at times you need to have small group meetings for detailed discussion , but when our interests are at stake they should invite us . "
Some countries also expressed anger that a number of highly contentious issues , including America 's cotton subsidies , had not been brought to the table in Geneva .
Burkina Faso 's trade minister , Mamadou Sanou , warned that the cotton industry in his country faced " extinction " .
" We can hardly control our anger , " he said .
" They wanted me to be here to negotiate on cotton .
I have been here for 10 days and I have n't been able to discuss cotton .
There is a risk that the whole system will collapse in our country . "
Many smaller countries are anxious that they will now come under renewed pressure to sign generous bilateral trade agreements with rich countries , giving them less bargaining power than they can wield collectively within the WTO .
Amy Barry , a trade analyst at Oxfam , said : " The concern is that in bilateral and regional deals they have much less clout and that if the WTO is discredited then countries like the US and EU will pay even less attention to its rules than they already do . "
However , some anti-poverty campaigners insisted that developing countries should breathe a sigh of relief .
" No deal is better than a bad deal , " said Aftab Alam Khan , head of trade policy at ActionAid , arguing that the US and EU had made too many demands .
Business groups in Britain said an opportunity had been lost .
Richard Lambert , director general of the CBI , said : " It is particularly disappointing that India was unwilling to compromise , and was a catalyst for the breakdown of the talks .
The deal that was on the table offered promise for developing and developed countries alike . "
Mothering magazine ’s July / August edition cover article busts the falsehood that circumcision somehow lowers HIV infection rates reported by advocacy research performed in Africa .
“ This edition of Mothering does what we do best : challenge the status quo .
The spotlight is on “ The Truth about Circumcision and HIV ” ( page 42 ) .
Some recent studies claiming that circumcision protects against HIV have received a lot of media attention , but Gussie Fauntleroy explains why , under scrutiny , the research just does n’t hold up . ”

During election season , pundits and politicians are obsessed with polls .
But are they obsessed with the wrong thing ?
There is a growing academic literature on the role of prediction markets , particularly in political contests , and it has been shown routinely that these markets are excellent ( albeit not perfect ) predictors of outcomes .
With this we turn to the ever - increasing obsession with November ’s Presidential election .
I ’ve gotten a couple of emails recently comparing Obama and McCain on a number of issues , and to listen to most people in the media , the Presidential election is a two - horse race even though it is n’t .
The structure of the system has some interesting implications , though .
First , we know that a single vote will not make a difference to the outcome of the election .
A standard ( and interesting ) discussion to have in economics 101 is the question of whether it is “ rational ” to vote .
The stock answer is that it is n’t , but that is only true if your only goal is to actually influence the outcome of the contest .
I vote because it is a cheap way to let everyone know my preferences ( Friend : “ who are you voting for ? ” Me : “ Candidate X . ”
This exchange says a lot about the package of ideas I most agree with among those being debated in the public square .
With this in mind , voters should n’t let fear that “ the wrong guy will win ” influence their decision .
Voting “ against ” the major candidate one likes the least squanders an opportunity to cast a vote that means something .
It ’s the very essence of a wasted vote .
Armed with the knowledge that a single vote will not swing the election , the conscientious voter should refuse to hold his or her nose and pick the lesser of two evils — or whichever combination of electoral clichés you prefer — and should instead find a candidate who best represents his or her ideas .
Presidential candidates abound from across the political spectrum , and I would guess that most voters could , with little effort , find a candidate with a platform they find preferable to the platforms offered by Obama and McCain .
Extreme liberals would likely prefer Ralph Nader .
Extreme conservatives would likely prefer Chuck Baldwin .
Hardcore environmentalists would likely prefer Cynthia McKinney .
Libertarians would likely prefer Bob Barr .
And so on .
In my experience , a common voter complaint is that the major party candidates are usually uninspiring Washington insiders offering more of the same .
It does n’t have to be that way : by supporting candidates from outside the political establishment , people can move the debate away from personalities and posturing and toward substantive issues .
The debates between Obama and McCain will be polished affairs in which the candidates offer rehearsed answers memorable more for their cleverness than for anything of substance .
A debate featuring the other candidates would be a real debate about ideas .
Instead of debating whether to expand the welfare state by X billion dollars or X.1 billion dollars , a debate between ( say ) Baldwin , Nader , McKinney , and Barr would likely be an animated contest in which the combatants consider bigger issues , like the nature and role of the state .
According to the prediction markets at intrade.com , there is at least an 85 % chance that McCain will win Tennessee ( where my wife and I live ) and a greater than 90 % chance that McCain will win Alabama ( where our families live ) .
The market is predicting similar probabilities that Obama will win California , the largest electoral prize in the country .
In other words , it is virtually certain that McCain will carry Tennessee and Alabama and Obama will carry California in November .
The likelihood that a single vote will determine the outcome of a even a hotly - contested election is practically zero ; in cases like these where the outcome is virtually certain , a vote for a candidate with whom the voter does not identify is a vote wasted .
For better or for worse , presidential election season is a time when most people are paying attention to ideas of fundamental importance .
We sell ourselves short if we only focus on two candidates .
There are a lot of candidates out there with a lot of ideas .
I hope the 2008 election is an election that moves the discussion forward .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A coalition of unions , think tanks and other groups launched an advertising campaign on Tuesday saying they want to ensure that health - care reform tops the U.S. political agenda after the November elections .
A doctor checks the blood pressure of a patient at the J.W.C.H. safety - net clinic in the center of skid row in downtown Los Angeles July 30 , 2007 .

The group , Health Care for America Now , said it had the backing of 100 labor groups , community organizations , medical groups and activists .
The non-profit group is headquartered on Washington ’s K Street , known for its high - powered lobbyists , and said it was immediately starting a $ 1.5 million advertising campaign on television , newspapers and online , with an eventual spending goal of $ 40 million .
“ This is the human rights movement of our time , ” said Jeff Blum , executive director of USAction , a non-profit that campaigns for strengthening of Medicare , Social Security and other entitlements .
“ If there is one thing that our government should be guaranteeing each one of us , it is the basic , fundamental right to affordable and quality health care .
This must be the birthright of every American . ”
Some of the groups backing the organization include the National Education Association , the National Women ’s Law Center , Planned Parenthood Federation of America , and the Service Employees International Union , which represents health - care workers among others .
By any measure , health - care reform is among the top issues concerning American voters .
Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois say they are putting together health - care reform plans .
Other groups have too , including retailers , employers and labor unions .
The United States has no single health - care system but relies on a patchwork of private , public and employer - sponsored insurance plans -- and 47 million Americans lack any coverage .
The new group says it wants to keep the best of what already exists , without moving to a fully nationalized system .
“ Americans can keep the private insurance they have , join a new private insurance plan , or choose a public health insurance plan , ” the group said in a statement .
“ The campaign also calls for a government role in setting and enforcing rules on the insurance industry which consistently charges whatever it wants , sets high deductibles , denies coverage based on pre-existing conditions , and drops coverage when people get sick . ”
A new way to make greener asphalt for U.S. highways and byways is n't new at all .
They 've been doing it for decades in Africa and India .
Asphalt is the sticky byproduct left after fuel and lubricating oil are extracted from crude petroleum .
It 's too thick to be laid on roads as is , so in the United States it 's heated to as much as 300 degrees Fahrenheit to make it easy to pump and apply .
A new national research program called the Asphalt Research Consortium ( ARC ) aims to make asphalt cheaper and more environmentally friendly to produce .
That means it might , for example , last longer , or use recycled material , or be manufactured using less energy .
There 's good reason for the effort : America has more than 4 million miles of roads .
The only place you can be 22 miles away from a road in the contiguous states is a spot in the southeast corner of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming .
In other countries , so - called cold - mix asphalts save up to seven times the energy of the hot - mix counterparts , according to University of Wisconsin - Madison civil engineering professor Hussain Bahia .
" This is a no - brainer , " said Bahia , who has studied asphalt for more than 20 years .
" If any person involved in managing our infrastructure looks at the data , why would you spend more energy and money on something else ?
But the challenge will be to show through advanced design of these materials that the performance is equal . "
Which is to say :
There 's much research yet to do .
As part of the ARC consortium , Bahia got $ 5 million to figure out how to make a cold mix that could work here .
In South Africa , asphalt is made workable by shearing it into fine particles , and then mixing it with water and soap - like chemicals that harden after the stuff is laid down .
Studies by Canada 's Office of Energy Efficiency and others have found that paving with these cold mixes ( also called emulsions ) saves significant amounts of energy , especially when combined with recycling efforts .
These asphalts also cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases .
Bahia is looking into other stumbling blocks to any possible changeover .
" At U.S. refineries today , there are very mature , established specifications for hot binders — our paving grade asphalts , " he said in a statement this week .
" But for emulsions , there is no clear agreement on how to define the quality .
So , we have emulsions already , but we do n't produce them as much because the specifications are n't as clear . "
Bahia plans to experiment with adding polymers or plastics to the cold - mix process to make pavement more durable , safer and even quieter .
The big question :
Why did n't the United States switch to cold mixes long ago ?
We have n't had to , Bahia said , because we 've long had a wealth of resources that supported the less efficient hot - mix approach .
" In South Africa , they initially decided to go with the low - energy approach because it can save a lot of money , " says Bahia .
" Then as their economy grew , they had to build high - performance roads .
But instead of switching to hot mixes , they improved their knowledge to build better cold mixes . "
Google 's loss is the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's gain .
The EFF , based in San Francisco , said Monday it has snapped up Michael Kwun , the Mountain View - based search engine 's chief of litigation .
" I 've really been a big fan of EFF , " Kwun said in a brief telephone interview .
Kwun , 39 , graduated from Boalt School of Law at UC Berkeley in 1998 .
He was the lawyer responsible for managing Google 's ongoing defense against a copyright case brought by Viacom .
Other intellectual property courtroom disputes concern YouTube , Google Book Search , Google AdWords and Google Image Search .
" I 've always been interested in technology and its intersection with law , " Kwun said .
" I think that technology creates a whole wealth of issues . "
Obviously , he 'll be making less cash at the nonprofit , where he 'll focus on intellectual property .
" It 's rewarding in different ways , " he said .
Google has recently lost several top executives , including Elliot Schrage , VP of global communications , Sheryl Sandberg , vice president for global online sales and Douglas Merrill , chief information officer .

Over the last five years , a new generation of extreme kayakers has started plunging down increasingly large waterfalls in a bid to reach ever - greater adrenalin highs .
But what do experienced kayakers attempting such a stunt need to consider ?
CANOEIST
Professional photographer Lucas Gilman took this breathtaking picture of professional US kayaker Pat Keller plummeting straight over the cliff face at La Paz Waterfall in Costa Rica at high speed .
Mr Keller escaped with only a broken hand - fractured when he hit the water at the bottom of the 120ft ( 36.5 m ) fall .
Return LIP
For waterfalls bigger than 35ft ( 10.6 m ) , the critical issues are the line of trajectory and facing the right direction in the right position .
" If a kayaker leans backs on the lip , their spinal cord will take the impact at the bottom , " says Simon Westgarth , director of adventure kayaking specialists Gene17 .
Instead he teaches kayakers to lean forward as they brave the rush of raging rapids .
But it is a delicate balancing act - over - rotate and you are ejected into the falling froth .
Return POSITION IN SPOUT
In La Paz , Pat Keller rides the waterfall in the middle of its " spout " - which is about 3 m wide , so he has about 1.5 m of water either side of him .
But experts say where a kayaker positions himself depends on individual style and every drop is different .
Return CANOE
For the La Paz plunge , Pat Keller used a Dagger Nomad .
The curvy round - bow boat is about 2.5 m long , made of polyethylene plastic and buoyant enough to resurface quickly .
Return FREE FALL
Although kayakers are able to manipulate the path of their body in much the same way as skiers and mountain bikers , the constantly flowing water adds another dimension .
The key is to try to go with the water , rather than clear it .
" When these professionals are freefalling they want to be in the Oregon Tuck , with a curved back , " says Paul Robertson , brand manager of Dagger Europe .
The paddle presents another potential liability .
" It should be parallel to the kayak so that it is n't blown out of their hands - and does n't break their nose or dislocate their shoulder on impact . "
Return LANDING / IMPACT
The landing is the most important - and most risky - part of extreme kayaking .
Get it wrong and it could result in a broken back .
" A kayaker does n't want to land flatly , " says Mr Westgarth .
" He needs to lean forward , tuck in and make his shape as efficient as possible . "
Some experts advise a furious forward stroke of the paddle on plunging into the pool to get in the right position .
" The key is to follow , not fight , the flow of the water - because after falling 120 ft ( 36.5 m ) , a kayak can hit the plunge pool at about 50 - 60 km / h ( 31 - 37 mph ) , " says Mr Westgarth .
Return RESURFACING
A kayaker that rides a 120 ft ( 36.5 m ) waterfall into a lake will descend about five to 10 ft ( 1.5 - 3 m ) under water on impact - and take about two or three seconds to resurface - according to Mr Robertson .
But he says it depends on the volume of water cascading down the waterfall - the more water there is , the longer a kayaker will stay submerged .

If it was n't already perfectly clear by now that Monster Cable 's cables are n't really worth the price ( or any price above the cost of a coat - hanger ) , and that they 're only using those bloated markups to perpetuate their reputation as money - grubbing lawsuit - happy snakeoil peddlers , we 'd call your attention to their latest target : Monster Mini Golf , a chain of glow - in - the - dark mini - golf courses based out of Rhode Island .
Apparently Monster Cable claims that the Monster Mini Golf brand is confusing to the public and dilute their trademark .
Of course , this suit is n't really any more absurd than their suits against Monster.com , the Chicago Bears ( aka the " Monsters of the Midway " ) , or the Pixar film Monsters , Inc. -- that is to say , it 's equally and completely ridiculous .
But hey , when you 're making 1000 % + margin on merch , you can only swim in entire pools of liquid gold so long before seeking out the thrill only found in wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous lawsuits .
Hey , so here 's an idea : perhaps everyone should just stop buying anything made by Monster Cable .
That or set up a dummy corporation with the word " monster " in the name , since you 're basically guaranteed they 'll spin their wheels serving a summons for merely existing .

Oil Down $ 16 to $ 130 , Everything Wonderful Again : Not
( July 18 , 2008 )
I hate to pop the balloon about how everything 's wonderful again now that oil has collapsed from $ 146 to a mere $ 130 / barrel - - no , scratch that .
I delight in popping that nonsensical bubble .
Before we allow euphoria to lift us to a heady height so great we 're ready to believe Lehman and Merrill and all the other " players " are suddenly whole again , let 's look at a chart .
As a proxy for the oil sector , let 's use the XLE :
Here we see a number of interesting points : 1 . XLE just touched key support .
2 . Every time XLE pierces its 200 - day moving average and the Bollinger Band on the downside , a sharp rally to a new high has followed .
3 . The downside breaks are very sharp and very short .
The XLE can drop 20 + % in a few weeks , and then bounce back within 6 weeks as it extends to a new high .
4 . The MACD is at an extreme -- even lower than when the XLE touched a " death of the Oil Bull " low in January 2008 .
5 . The uptrend is still intact .
Based on this chart , I would expect a rally from 75 to 85 in short order .
Let 's just say the chart makes me skeptical of calls for the end of the Bull market in petroleum .
The " recession - Lite " scenario that 's getting a lot of airplay nowadays is based on the idea that demand for petroleum will plummet in a recession , leading to a collapse in oil prices .
I highlighted the fatal flaw in this fantasy in Saturday Quiz : Demand Destruction of Gasoline in the U.S. ( July 12 , 2008 ) : reducing demand for gasoline 3 - 5 % in the U.S. is supposed to deliver a crushing knockout blow to oil prices , but that works out to a meager 300 - 500,000 barrels a day in a world that produces 85 million barrels a day .
Meanwhile , what nobody mentions when recounting this rosy scenario is that oil exports to the U.S. from Mexico are falling at 30 % per year -- and the U.S. gets 20 % of its imported oil from Mexico and Venezuela .
Frequent contributor U. Doran sent in this link from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas- USA : Peak Oil Is A Done Deal .
Bottom line : Saudi Arabia and Russia , which together pump about 23 % of the world 's oil , are both in depletion decline .
So are Mexico , the North Sea , etc . Simply put : every time the " Oil Bull " is declared dead , as it was in January , it rises with extraordinary alacrity to new heights .
The reason is not gol - durned speculators but supply and demand -- even as demand inches downward , supply is declining even faster .
Let 's put " demand destruction " in the U.S. in its proper context .
300,000 barrels a day is chump - change in a nation which burns 21 million barrels a day .
if supply were increasing by leaps and bounds as it was in the 80s , fine , then you could have a huge demand - supply imbalance in favor of supply .
But by even the most optimistic estimates , " excess capacity " ( all in heavy crude few can refine ) is about 1.4 million barrels a day - - a razor - thin margin .
I have predicted one last " head - fake " decline in oil prices , but it 's going to take serious reduction in demand , on the order of 4 - 5 million barrels a day globally , to get that drop .
It takes a long time to locate , drill , pump and process new reserves of petroleum .
I was fortunate to receive a report from a working petroleum geophysicist , who due to the nature of the business , prefers to remain anonymous .
His report is a real eye - opener .
Read on : I am an exploration geophysicist working for a large oil company .
The quiet consensus in the industry is that yes , we are at peak oil .
( emphasis added , CHS )
Such an idea was not even discussed even a year ago , but now it is a silent consensus .
I also agree with your assessment that a serious downturn can cause the oil prices to go down temporarily for the last time .
Worrying thing is that it is a " perfect storm " coinciding with a large economic downturn and with the long - term trends of an aging population and of global warming .
Weakened immune systems from aging , stress and poorer nutrition and the disturbed ecosystems may also cause some super - virus to spread .
However , it is crucial to make the transition to the new world ( petroleum - less , older , changed climate ) as slow as possible so that we can adapt .
Otherwise it 's finally the day the guys at survivalblog.com have been yearning for :-)
I will do my best to prepare myself and my newly - started family , but ultimately it comes down to chance .
Was it you who posted the story about Aaron Schwartz , the smartest man in the 20th century , who foresaw Hitler 's rise and moved with his family to a quiet Pacific island called ... Guadalcanal ?
It 's possible to have a long career in petroleum as everyone either goes back to old wells to extract a bit more or drills a lot of dry holes looking for the elusive super - giant field which will save us all :-)
The strong job market for geophysicists has more to do with the fact that the oil industry downsized massively between 1983 and 2003 than with peak oil .
Why ?
Assume you own an oilfield or hold a long - term lease on one .
If you believe that the current price is just a cyclical high , then you will do all you can to explore the land to find oil , or to do extra surveys to find bypassed pockets in the reservoir , and get the oil to market before the price falls .
However , if you expect the price to keep rising , and rising , why would you work so hard today to find new oil / get some more now , when if you do the same amount of work a couple of years down the road , you will sell it for much more ?
And maybe more capacity will come on the market for drilling rigs and oilfield services , so you would not pay those outrageous prices to your service providers either .
Companies do have to replace reserves ( they usually have about 6 - 8 yrs of reserves in their portofolio ) , but they do n't do much more .
BTW re : the dramatic capacity cuts , they were indeed amazing .
In 1983 there were 730 land crews doing land seismic surveys in North America , and in 2003 there were only 37 .
These statistics were published by The Leading Edge ( TLE ) , the monthly magazine of the 25,000 - members Society for Exploration Geophysicists ( seg.org ) .
That 's 20 x reduction in capacity , for God 's sake !!
How does one expect to find more of something with 20 x less people ??
Technology did not make much of a difference , as for land seismic the crews still have to go and plant geophones by hand .
Companies were downsizing entire departments .
As late as 2004 you could read in " career advice " articles in TLE leading geophysicists saying that they are not advising their children to go into this field , that they should only do it if they really love it and they should expect to be out of a job half the time ...
Walter Lynn , SEG president 2001 - 02 , was downsized from his company ( PGS ) the day after his president mandate was over ( it 's visible in his CV at www.lynn-inc.com).
I spent the 2000 - 05 period working towards a PhD at a top U.S. university , and we were in contact with many companies .
2003 was the bottom ; out of about 15 graduate students , only 2 or 3 got internships although most tried .
That was in a leading research group in the field .
Unemployment in geosciences as measured by the Houston Geological Society was above 10 % .
In 2004 an American colleague of mine graduated after working for 7 years for a PhD and he only got a menial job warranting a BSc with a company in Houston .
You see , supply and demand .
In 2005 things turned around and I quit my PhD as soon as I got a job offer in hand , because I believed that by the time I would graduate ( the last of my cohort " got out " 1 month ago ) oil prices would be again at a low .
In the early 2000s US produced only about 100 ( yes , one hundred ) graduates with decent BSc degrees in geophysics .
China produced easily 20 x more , and well prepared too , not some junk diplomas .
In 2004 85 % of the graduate students in the Petroleum Engineering department at Stanford were foreign .
Now oil prices are high everywhere and they start to have good employment in their home countries as well ...

Things are not always what they seem , and the level of activity in the oil industry now is still FAR from a emergency - level , all - out effort , WWII kind of thing .
The industry is still recovering from 20 years of capacity cuts !
In other words : additional capacity might well come online , but it will take an entire new generation of geophysicists / geologists and an effort which dwarfs current exploration levels .
Oil insiders also note that there are no spare rigs or drilling platforms lying about ; every rig is already in use .
So we have to construct , at enormous expense , an entire new generation of equipment .
Let 's say this takes 10 - 15 years , which is what knowledgeable sources like Matt Simmons guesstimate .
That means we can look for new oil flowing in about 2021 .
All that new production will do , of course , is replace some of what 's been lost to depletion in the next 13 years .
Maybe I 'm wrong and oil is heading to $ 100 / brl or less .
If so , it 's the final head - fake before Peak Oil strikes with a vengence : Note : I will be away from my desk through next Tuesday , July 22 .

A former scavenger on the catwalk alongside a professional model
Walking down the catwalk in front of the great and the good in New York is a far cry from using your hands to clean up human excrement for a living .
But this week a group of such women - known in India as scavengers - have been doing just that .
They have been attending a United Nations conference here and doing some modelling at the same time .
In all , 36 scavengers from India have been invited by the UN to attend a conference to mark the UN's International Year of Sanitation .
The women were brought up from early childhood for the demeaning work .
Scavengers are invariably from the lower - caste , " untouchable " ( Dalit ) community .
They carry the human excrement in pots on their heads .
They can also be found clearing rubbish from the streets and open drains outside homes .
' Humilitation ' Usha Chomar is one of these women .
Walking along the corridors of the UN headquarters , she was ecstatic by the respect and honour showered on her by dignitaries and the movers and shakers of the world .
Thirty - year - old Chomar gave up scavenging in 2003 .
She says she finally feels like a human being .
" I have always done the work of scavenging and have faced humiliation all my life .
I tell all scavenging women that it is not impossible for them to change their lives
Usha Chomar
India 's sanitation struggle " So I had never imagined that I would ever have been honoured like this .
I am very happy at last to be treated like a normal person . "
The women got the opportunity to hit the catwalk during a fashion show called Mission Sanitation where they appeared alongside top models from India and other countries .
Some of the designer clothes worn by the models were embroidered by the women .
The ceremony was especially poignant for Usha Chomar , because she was unofficially crowned as princess of sanitation workers .
Among the various organisations taking part in the activities was the India non-governmental organisation , Sulabh International , which was invited by the UN to work with other groups around the world in the struggle to provide better sanitation .
" This is the dream coming true of Indian independence hero Gandhiji ( Mahatma Gandhi ) , " said Bindeshwar Pathak , the head of Sulabh International .
" In India scavengers have been looked down upon for centuries .
But those who have abandoned that work are ... being treated with respect which they deserve .
I am over the moon with happiness . "
Huge task Usha Chomar said that she hoped that other disadvantaged women could derive inspiration from her story .
" I tell all scavenging women that it is not impossible for them to change their lives and command just as much respect as any other human being . "
The Indian scavengers helped make some of the dresses Official statistics in India say that there are still around 340,000 scavengers working in villages and small towns .
The UN aims to reduce by half the number of people without basic sanitation by 2015 .
But in India alone they face a huge task .
It 's estimated that around 700 million Indians do not have access to safe and hygienic toilets .
Experts say that scavenging in India is most prevalent in the states of Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat .
They warn that because they work in such nasty conditions , many suffer from acute health problems .
They say that the stench that goes with the job forces many scavengers to hold their breath for long periods of time , which in turn causes respiratory problems .
The Indian government banned manual scavenging in 1993 , but the law is not widely implemented .

[ digg- reddit-me ] ” Eventually , the hard feelings will die down , ” the pundits say .
And I think they are mainly right .
I do n’t want to make a big deal of the still raw feelings on display by Clinton supporters – after all , we all should be on the same side come November .
But the overheated rhetoric , the deliberate attempts to undermine the legitimacy of Obama ’s nomination , and the incredible sense of entitlement on display among some of these Clinton supporters inspires some raw feelings in me as well .
RiverDaughter writes of those “ Democrats in Exile “ :
Any day now , Obama supporters will be knocking at my door and ask me to get a membership in their exclusive club .
I will be treated like a queen once they scan the voter ’s rolls in NJ and see my name .
It will be like , “ Oooo , Riverdaughter is a “ creative class ” unaffiliated .
Well , we must really ask her to do a round of golf with us or share a latte . ”
I will be pampered and courted and made to feel better than all of you losers who comment on this blog .
In another example , a Heidi Li ( seconded by RiverDaughter ) has written a very popular blogpost that asks her readers to “ slap the face of the DNC ” by donating to Hillary Clinton ’s campaign , instead of the cash - strapped DNC , which – through some form of black magic – is supposed to lead to Hillary becoming the nominee or regaining control over the Democratic party :
My view is that if the D.N.C. wants one lick of help from any supporter of Senator Clinton the first thing it should do is boot Howard Dean and make it clear that the new chair is somebody who Senator Clinton wants in that position .
In the meantime , we can help Senator Clinton AND tick off the D.N.C. at the same time ( smile a slightly naughty smile here ) .
If we very quickly raise a ton ‘o money to rid Senator Clinton of her debt , believe me , the D.N.C. will understand where the true power lies .
After we raise that money , we hold on to every penny we have unless and until Senator Clinton becomes the nominee for President or clearly takes control of the D.N.C .
It ’s unclear if Ms. Li is expecting that The Angry Clinton Supporters Brigade will outraise the legions of Obama supporters who have consistently been more generous .
And the idea that Clinton deserves to
control the DNC is ludicrous .
Just because the Clintons controlled the DNC from 1992 until when Howard Dean was selected does n’t mean that they should continue to control it .
Especially given Dean ’s role in paving the way for the 2006 Democratic takeover of Congress and Obama ’s 50 - state plan for the general election .
The Democratic Party is not a Clinton family property .
The Clintons have contributed and continue to contribute greatly to progressive causes and the Democratic party .
But it is not healthy for them to have a stranglehold on the organization because they alone are not the Democratic Party .
We are .
We Are the Democratic Party : We activists , we progressives , we liberals , we feminists , we wary libertarians , we blue - collar and white - collar workers , we blacks and Hispanics and whites and Asians and Native Americans , we students and professors , we union - workers and hedge fund managers , we who drink lattes and we who drink coffee ( black , no - sugar ) , we who down Manhattans and we who drink beer , we who bowl and we who do not , but most of all …we unlucky few who saw our nation going down the wrong path for all these years , yet were unable to stop it and we who only gradually realized the incredible cynicism that has taken over the Republican Party as it exploited and fanned our basest fears to win elections while pursuing policies which made our nation less safe .
The Democratic National Committee is struggling – and we Democrats , we Obama supporters , we Clinton supporters – will need a strong majority in Congress , in the Senate , and throughout the country if we are to achieve what we set out to do .
We must win this election .
And we can .
We need everyone to donate time – at your local DNC office , at the local Obama campaign office , with any get - out - the - vote operations .
We need everyone to think about the issues and the course that needs to be taken .
We need people to make sure the Democratic Party stays a party of ideas by voicing their individual opinions – on the web and elsewhere .
And we need money .
If you can , donate today to the “ We Are the Democratic Party ” at the Democratic National Committee .
And if you are a Hillary supporter who wants to show appreciation for her ground - breaking campaign , then certainly donate to help her retire her debt .
Donating to Hillary wo n’t be sticking a finger in anyone ’s eye or slapping anyone ’s face .
We who know how important this coming election is – as a choice between a neo -empire and a true democracy , a choice between a government that benefits the few and a government that helps the many , a choice between an aggressively conservative Court and a more moderate one , a choice between a health care system that is broken and attempting to fix it , a choice between staying in Iraq for 100 years or leaving as soon as possible – we who know how important this election is are the Democratic Party .
And that ’s why we all need to support the Democratic National Party as it prepares for this momentous election , perhaps the most important of our lifetime :
America , this is our moment .
This is our time .
Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past .
Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face .
Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love .

Apple has staked its reputation on tight control of a few carefully designed , faultlessly executed products .
Now , as Apple expands its reach from computers into music , video , consumer electronics and phones , it 's getting harder and harder for the company to make sure all of its products " just work , " as its marketing slogan goes .
Its growing army of customers is getting more difficult to satisfy , and they 're finding a host of new problems , ranging from tapeless camcorder issues to buggy iPhones .
" Apple has always seen that their benefit is being a closed environment , but they 've now put themselves in the position where a lot more people want to look at them , and those people are coming from domains where they 're more used to openness , flexibility and more open systems , " said Gartner analyst Ken Dulaney .
" That 's the crisis they 're going to have to face this coming year :
Am I going to continue being closed and controlled or am I going to open myself up ? "
The list of customers Apple needs to keep happy is ever - growing : iPhone users , iTunes shoppers , iPod owners , MobileMe subscribers and Mac users .
And the items all add up to one question : Has Apple bitten off more than it can chew ?
The company 's towering list of recent problems ( collected from reader e-mails , forums and media reports ) spell out deterioration of the general Apple user experience :
- MobileMe e-mail outage , web - app issues and inadvertent credit - card charges
- Compatibility issues with tapeless camcorders
- Problems staying on the 3 - G network with iPhone 3G
- A buggy iPhone 2.0 release
- OS X Leopard bugs
- Mac Pro sleep issues
- Poor MacBook
Air battery life
And on top of that , enraged Apple customers are uniting in Apple support forums – particularly in the MobileMe and iPhone 3G threads .
Some of the country 's most famous tech columnists are displeased with Apple 's recent behavior , too .
A quick [ Google search of " Apple + it just works " ] ( http://www.google.com/search?q=apple+just+works&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
" Google search of " Apple + it just works " " ) bring up mockeries of the slogan in top results with headlines reading , " It just works indeed , " and , " Will MobileMe ' just work ' for the rest of us ? "
Such remarks indicate an erosion in the pride that has often been associated with being an Apple customer .
And they spell trouble for a company that has long tried to distinguish itself from the buggy complexity of its chief competitor : Microsoft .
One reason more Apple customers are complaining is simply that there are more Apple customers than ever before .
And , while an angry minority may be particularly vocal , the majority of the company 's customers continue to be happy with its products .
That 's why some , like Crunchgear writer John Biggs , have called Apple 's success a curse .
As Apple has grown to absorb as much as 20 percent of the U.S .
computer market , its customers are getting more diverse and harder to satisfy .
" Apple , it seems , now has to deal with the average Joe and the average Joe is considerably more cranky than some turtle - necked fanboys in their loft in SoHo , " Biggs wrote .
And yet , Apple has n't changed any of its ways .
The corporation continues to operate behind closed doors .
When Apple makes mistakes , such as the MobileMe e-mail debacle , the company puts up a vague status message – while 20,000 users are left without e-mail access for a week .
To make matters worse , Apple downplays the problem as affecting a meager " 1 % "
of users .
And
Apple ignores the media , too .
Ordinarily , Steve Jobs only speaks to a small group of journalists .
The company wants to keep a lid on upcoming products , which is understandable , but even when journalists inquire about other matters , Apple can be famously unresponsive .
Apple did n't return Pogue 's phone calls regarding the MobileMe matter , nor did the company return Wired.
com's .
" Unfortunately , they are dropping the ball , not communicating , and adding to the problem by increasing the frustration of their users via their unwillingness to shoot straight with us , " MobileMe user Joe Holley wrote in the support forums .
He mentioned that the lack of mail access may have robbed him of a potential job opportunity__ .
__Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray , said he 's been in general very pleased as an Apple customer .
However , he noted a recent change :
In the past when he called Apple 's customer service , he did n't have to wait at all ; nowadays , he has to wait several minutes .
He added that the Genius Bars at Apple stores are becoming increasingly crowded .
These might appear to be trivial issues , but combined with the aforementioned list of user problems , they suggest that Apple is n't keeping up with its rapid growth .
If the company does n't address these problems quickly , it could wind up looking more and more like its Windows - based competitors .

Regular readers will remember parts one and two of our ongoing series about amazing art from ordinary objects , so get ready for a new batch featuring everything from Cell phone sculptures to push pin portraits .
Recently a number of readers have written in to submit their own works or works they have constructed from everyday materials .
Guido Daniele is an accomplished painter who transforms ordinary individual hands into art , Robert Pettit has assembled some strangely inspiring art from discarded cellular phones and Eric Daigh has created some rich and complex works from a simple push pins .
Guido Daniele ‘s art ranges from gigantic murals to minutely detailed hand painting .
This Italian - born artist started out as a sculptor but now primarily focuses on painting and illustration .
His designs have been used to create advertisements as well as to raise global awareness about environmental and other social justice issues .
He is perhaps most famous for his body painting works which range from full coverings to small pieces , often with a purpose ( commercial or good - cause ) and often stunningly realistic .
We all know that cell phones these days can call , text , surf the web and remind you to pick up your dry cleaning … but they can also be used for artistic purposes to create drawings , floor sculptures , light and sound installations and more .
Artist Robert Pettit has a show up at the SMFA in Boston featuring these and other creative uses of over 5,000 cellular phones he collected for artistic purposes .
As more and more cell phones fall by the wayside each and every day , scrapped for the latest model , one has to wonder if there are other things ( artistic and otherwise ) that these strangely ubiquitous objects could be used for .
Push pins are pretty unlikely candidates for an artist ’s toolbox but have become a staple for Eric Daigh .
Originally from Southern California Eric now works and displays his art in Northern Michigan .
As most artists know sometimes limitations in terms of materials and color palette can be assets .
Given the simple ( and fairly bold ) range of colors available for this type of tack work the range of results is impressive .
His process is just like a printing press sorting out valves in blue , red , black and yellow and the finished pieces involve 10,000 + pins .
“ It ’s always portraits .
I just do n’t think anything else would be compelling .
I think the faces are the interesting part , the method , the fact that I ’m using push pins , has to take a second place to them .
And the piece needs to convey something about the subject , which usually means no smiling .
I ’m looking for the most unaffected or unprojected gaze .
I want it to look more like a question than a statement .
A piece can take anywhere between 2 days and months and months , depending on how much time I can devote .
Technically , if I just sat in front of one and did n’t stop , I could do a big one in about 8 - 10 hours . ”
Eric ’s talent is his eye , and his technique is better defined as color , not push pins .
He intends to leave the pins behind when he finishes his current piece and begin a series in ( what else ? ) torn pieces of colored duct tape .
“ It could be anything , really . ” he says , “ colored thread even . ”
Well , that ’s true , it could be anything .

Police photo of Alex Shoumatoff , Vanity Fair editor and writer , after his arrest earlier this week for trespassing at Bohemian Grove .
Pat Murphy , San Francisco Sentinel editor and publisher , reports that Vanity Fair writer and editor Alex Shoumatoff was arrested earlier this week for trespassing at “ the world famous Bohemian Grove , the exclusive getaway of some of the world ’s most powerful men who gather there every year in July for two weeks . ”
Mr. Murphy pokes fun at Shoumatoff — making light of his weight and Pebble Beach sweater — and then tells us Shoumatoff was writing a story about “ the Club ’s plans to thin its Douglas fir and diseased oak trees to help prevent the type of forest fires that have swept Big Sur and Northern California , ” an assignment he apparently accepted at the behest of Jock Hooper , described by Murphy as “ a disgruntled former member of the Bohemian Club . ”
Mr. Murphy makes a big deal out of Hooper ’s “ eccentric ” concern for trees while completely ignoring a far larger story — the very existence of the “ Bohemian Club , ” who attends , and what happens there .
“ Bohemian Grove , a secluded campground in California ’s Sonoma County , is the site of an annual two - week gathering of a highly select , all - male club , whose members have included every Republican president since Calvin Coolidge .
Current participants include George Bush , Henry Kissinger , James Baker and David Rockefeller — a virtual who ’s who of the most powerful men in business and government , ” writes Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting .
“ Few journalists have gotten into the Grove and been allowed to tell the tale ( one exception is Philip Weiss , whose November 1989 Spy piece provides the most detailed inside account ) , and members maintain that the goings - on there are not newsworthy events , merely private fun .
In fact , official business is conducted there : Policy speeches are regularly made by members and guests , and the club privately boasts that the Manhattan Project was conceived on its grounds . ”
However , as Alex Jones has starkly revealed , far more sinister things other than “ policy speeches ” go on at the Grove and that is why journalists such as Dirk Mathison , San Francisco bureau chief for People magazine , are removed .
“ Mathison ’s entree into the secret world of the Grove was cut short on July 20 [ 1991 ] … when he was recognized by two of the participants in the festivities — executives from Time Warner , People ’s publisher .
More loyal to the Grove than to journalistic endeavor , they had the reporter removed from the premises … .
Time Warner is not the only media corporation with Bohemian connections .
The list of Fourth Estate bigwigs who have been members or guests is extensive : Franklin Murphy , the former CEO of the Times Mirror corporation ; William Randolph Hearst , Jr. ; Jack Howard and Charles Scripps of the Scripps - Howard newspaper chain ; Tom Johnson , president of CNN and former publisher of the Los Angeles Times . ”
Clip from Alex Jones ’ Dark Secrets : Inside Bohemian Grove
In other words , a wide array of corporate media bigwigs participate in the “ festivities ” — which include worship of Luciferianism , the sacrifice of human effigies , arcane Druid ceremonies held before a large stone owl , mystery religion incantations , and other rituals , apparently including sodomy — and that is why journalists are not allowed .
For a more in - depth examination of what happens at Bohemian Grove , see the clip here from Alex Jones ’ Dark Secrets : Inside Bohemian Grove .
Mathison , however , was lucky to have been simply removed .
Chris Jones , webmaster for radio talk show host Jack McLamb , was imprisoned after he infiltrated the Grove as an employee and filmed the facilities .
The film footage was used in Alex Jones ’ The Order of Death video .
“ Chris is currently in California jail for showing his neighbors the videos Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death by Alex Jones .
Some of the neighbors were minors which the court ruled as justification for imprisonment , ” notes a post on the Prison Planet forum .
“ Chris was sentenced for three years in the Theo Lacy jail in Orange California .
He has been transfered to the Wasco State Prison in California where his life could be in danger . ”
Obviously , the elite were not amused by Chris Jones ’ attempt to reveal the Grove from the inside out .
“ Outgoing President George W. Bush and both of his presumptive replacements John McCain and Barack Obama are rumored to be in attendance at this year ’s Bohemian Grove gathering , an annual get - together of the global elite staged inside a sprawling forest encampment which kicks off tonight and runs until July 27 , ” Paul Joseph Watson wrote earlier this week .
“ Tellingly , both McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama will be in California from Saturday to Tuesday . ”
You ’d think , as a supposed journalist , Pat Murphy of the San Francisco Sentinel would be interested in such bizarre activity going on in his backyard .
Instead , he finds it more useful to slander Alex Shoumatoff , who is no stranger to Bohemian Grove .
Of course , even if Murphy wanted to write about the real behavior going on at the Grove , he would n’t dare — that is if he wants to remain the editor and publisher of the San Francisco Sentinel .
No doubt he does not want to end up like Chris Jones .

New York state is in the process of replacing its lever voting machines with new voting equipment , but the state revealed recently that it has found problems with 50 percent of the roughly 1,500 ImageCast optical - scan machines ( shown in the video above ) that Sequoia Voting Systems has delivered to the state so far – machines that are slated to be used by dozens of counties in the state 's September 9 primary and November 4 presidential election .
Douglas Kellner , co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections , expressed frustration with the vendor , saying it appeared that Sequoia was using the state 's acceptance testing process to find problems with its machines in lieu of a sound quality - control process .
" There 's no way the vendor could be adequately reviewing the machines and having so many problems , " he told Threat Level .
" What it tells us is that the vendor just throws this stuff over the transom and does not do any alpha - or beta - testing of their own before they apply for certification testing .
Then they expect that we 'll identify technical glitches and then they 'll correct those glitches .
But correction of those glitches is an extraordinarily time - consuming process .
And its very disappointing that this equipment is not ready for prime time . "
One main problem with the machines has been the printers .
The ImageCast machines are special optical - scan machines that include an LCD screen , a printer and a ballot - marking device that allows disabled voters to use them .
Disabled voters view the ballot on screen or hear it read to them through headphones , then make their selection using special attachments ( a device with buttons or a sipping straw ) , after which the machine prints out a paper ballot that gets read by the optical scanner component .
The printer , Kellner noted , is a core component of the machine .
But they malfunction " if you do n't feed the paper exactly right or if the buttons are n't pushed just right , " he said .
They also have trouble handling write - in candidates .
If a voter 's writing exceeds a certain width , Kellner said the printer shuts down without indicating why it 's shutting down .
" These are serious glitches that should have been picked up in the vendor 's own quality - control process , " he said .
But Sequoia is n't the only problem , according to counties who have reported receiving problematic machines from the state Board of Elections after the board was supposed to have tested and certified the machines .
The Board of Elections is examining all of the new machines before sending them out to counties .
In Nassau County alone , the largest voting district outside of New York City , officials found problems with 85 percent of the 240 ImageCast machines it received so far – problems that the county characterized in a letter as " substantial operational flaws that render them unusable or that require major repairs . "
The problems include printers jamming , broken monitors and wheels , machines that would n't boot up , and misaligned printer covers that prevented the covers from closing completely , creating security concerns .
The county rejected 48 machines right at delivery , due to physical damage .
Another 58 machines exhibited problems during testing , according to William Biamonte , the Democratic elections commissioner for Nassau County .
[ New York counties have two election directors – one each from the Democratic and Republican parties – to avoid charges of unfair elections . ]
Some of the latter machines , he said , shook dramatically when they were running and workers either had to shut them down or the machines shut themselves down from the vibration .
Other machines had dead batteries or batteries that would n't hold a two - hour charge , as they were required to do .
Another 112 machines produced a " printer failure " error message .
Biamonte says this was the result of a change Sequoia made to its firmware .
He said that when he received his first batch of machines about a month ago , the machines had " horrific paper jams . "
To fix the problem , Sequoia loaded new firmware on the systems to speed up the printer , but in doing so disabled the USB port on machines , resulting in the " printer failure " error messages .
Biamonte , who blames the Board of Elections in part for not noticing the problems before forwarding the machines to counties , said a state worker told him he should instruct election workers to just ignore the error message .
" How is that acceptable ? " Biamonte asked .
" Say you buy a brand new car and it works good but the oil gauge is n't working .
They tell you , Just drive it anyway .
These are brand new machines .
$ 12,000 each .
We cannot in confidence send ( them ) out to a polling place knowing they have this printer error .
How do we know if we really do have a printer failure ? "
Nassau County , which has nearly 900,000 registered voters , is slated to receive 450 machines total , but has refused delivery on the remaining machines and has asked a federal court to order Sequoia to repair the machines .
It also requested a review of the state Board of Elections ' acceptance and testing procedures .
That review was completed Thursday by a quality - control firm hired by the Board of Elections .
The firm 's report found that the Board of Elections ' procedures for accepting and testing the machines were adequate , but acknowledged that some problems may have occurred due to a lack of communication between state election officials and county officials .
[ Read more info about this report after the jump . ]
Biamonte , who respects Kellner and thinks he feels as frustrated by Sequoia as he does , nonetheless called the report " ridiculous " and " disingenuous , " saying that cracked screens and jammed printers were n't the result of communication problems .
The ImageCast machines are not actually made by Sequoia but by a Canadian subcontractor named Dominion , which is based in Toronto , and a sub- subcontractor named Jaco Electronics , based in New York .
A press release on Sequoia 's site noted that Jaco won the contract to produce 4,500 optical - scan machines for Sequoia / Dominion only in April of this year and needed to add 40 to 50 people to its workforce to fulfill the contract .
Nassau County began receiving its machines from the state in June , which suggests that the machines may have been rushed through production too quickly .
A Sequoia spokeswoman would say only that the company is working with state officials " to identify and resolve any voting equipment concerns they may have . "
The Sequoia ImageCast machines were designed exclusively for New York and are not currently being used in any other state .
The machines have not yet been federally certified , though Kellner says Sequoia assured the state last January that federal testing and certification would be completed on the system by April or May , before the state began its own testing and certification of the equipment .
New York does n't have a choice about using the machines this year .
The state was sued by the Department of Justice for failing to meet a federal deadline for having accessible voting machines in place .
The Help America Vote
Act passed in 2002 requires every voting precinct to provide at least one accessible voting machine for disabled voters by 2006 .
New York is just now getting the machines in place .
Because the ImageCast machines are still undergoing certification testing by the state , only the ballot marking device – and not the scanning portion of the machine – will be used in New York this year .
The counties will continue to use lever machines for non-disabled voters until 2009 .
The printed paper ballots produced by the ballot - marking portion of the machine will be read by hand , rather than scanned .
One interesting tidbit turned up in the quality - control report that examined the state board of elections acceptance and testing process .
The report reveals that a voting machine vendor is the first to examine the machines when they arrive to the state 's voting machine warehouse from the manufacturer .
The vendor representative is supposed to examine the machines for missing or damaged parts .
Once the vendor representative has signed off on the equipment , it goes to temporary workers that the state has hired to test the machines .
Biamonte says the temp workers are college students , who work under the supervision of board of election employees .
After the testing is completed , a tamper - evident seal is placed on the machines and they 're passed back to the vendor representative who is responsible for shipping off the machines to counties .
This creates chain - of - custody concerns that Biamonte says are exacerbated by the fact that when he received his machines in Nassau County , a number of the tamper - evident seals on them were cracked .
" How do we know this was n't tampered with ? " he said .

Thursday , August 17 , 2005 Subject : NASA says " it 's too hard " Jerry , Regarding that NASA Marshall rocket engineer one of your correspondents reports as claiming X - 33 proved Single Stage To Orbit was too hard without oodles more expensive new technology development , well ...
That reaction was both predictable and predicted , over eight years ago .
From Space Access Update # 71 , May 6 1997 , I quote : " X - 33 we see as in real danger of failing - failing first flight , or turning into a " NASP II " technology playpen and never flying at all - in part because it was poorly - conceived ( too many new bleeding - edge technologies included , too many Shuttle - replacement expectations tacked on , more a premature operational prototype " Y " vehicle than an experimental " X " ship ) and in part because as best we can tell , the contractor top management has no urgent incentive to ensure that X - 33 succeeds .
Make no mistake , we 'd like to see X - 33 succeed .
But if it does fail , we do n't want to be hearing any nonsense about the failure proving SSTO can't work . "
Alas , we 've been hearing nothing but that from NASA since .
For far more about the history , technology , and politics of X - 33 going down the tubes , see Updates # 71 , 84 , 91 , and 98 .
( If www.space-access.org is still down , try googling the sci.space .policy newsgroup archives for them . )
Bottom line : NASA , predictably and predicted , screwed the pooch to the tune of nearly two billion dollars and most of a decade 's time wasted .
Worse , all they seem to have learned from the debacle is to give up even pretending to develop cheaper space transportation - their response to the President 's " Vision for Space Exploration " challenge seems to be to use surplus Shuttle components to essentially duplicate the Saturns 1 and 5 , forty years and much of a trillion dollars later .
Assuming , of course , they 're even capable of doing so .
This plan still has to get past the White House and Congress ; I suggest anyone with any influence there push for NASA * not* being allowed to develop their own space transportation ever again .

The obvious remedy for an outfit that wastes a trillion dollars then says the job was too hard is to give the job to someone who will do it .
How do you know if they can do it ?
Do not pay until it is done .
Announce a ten billion dollar prize for a lunar colony .
Announce a 5 billion dollar prize for true reusable space ships and engines .
Do n't award a nickel until the job is accomplished , then pay .
NASA says it can't be done : why do they opposed prizes for those who might do what NASA can't do ?
The scoundrels .

Jerry P : The UK speed zone thing is interesting .
Kind of reminds one of " Liars , damn liars , and statisticians " .
It would be interesting to see real information rather than summaries like that .
Who decided where to put the speed cameras ?
Maybe it was a place where there was a higher likelyhood of accidents anyway .
Etc .
Is the conclusion that the cameras cause accidents ?
Maybe the drivers were watching their speedometers too closely and rammed into the car ahead ?
Did they put cameras on lonely roads with little traffic ; and so on .
Taking anything printed in the news media as in anyway factual is always a mistake without corroboration .
Charles Simkins ================= w Subject : " This Will Make You Proud ! "
Sir , unfortunately , this web site did n't make me proud .
The actions of that young Lieutenant DID make me proud , but the base use of his actions the way that site did makes my skin crawl .
Just as I hate the use of casualties as a device for those who oppose the war ( I also oppose the war ) , I loathe this as well .
This is n't a " good news story " , even though it is a story of heroism .
That Lieutenant had to kill many people , up close and personal , and that is a tragedy .
The fact that that is his job , and he did it well does n't translate this into a " war success " story , just as the fact that soldiers are killed does n't translate into a " war failure " story .
The greatest generation had heroes , as we do now .
But , ask Audie Murphy about his heroics .
He lived his life suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder after the war , but no one can deny his heroism .
Celebrate the marine , his heroism .
But he was a hero before that happened , it 's just that more people know it now .
His heroic triumph is not " good news " about the war .
I see much made by the supporters of this war about Mrs. Cindy Sheehan , and how terrible it is that she is allegedly using her son's death as a political tool .
I have much sympathy for that woman and what she 's doing , but little patience for those that are using her as a tool .
I see this website in much the same way .
Proud ?
No , very little about our actions in Iraq make me proud , but I 'd serve beside that Captain any day , and I 'd give my life for him and his marines .
Of course , I knew that before .
bryan
Of course I get This while in an airport with pen .
It requires a longer reply than I can give here .
I do invite all to think on the proper attitude toward heroes & heroism in a faithless age .
A nation that cannot honor or take pride in deeds of glory will have other and more serious problems .
Those who have seen the elephant have their lives changed , some more than others ; but that is Not the essence of The problem .
Acts of war are done in the Name of us all .
We must take responsibility , for we sent them to do their Work .
Shall we eat the guilt yet have No share in the glory ?
Liberals would say yes .
There is No glory .
But can we live that way ??
For Some reason I am reminded of a line from Scott 's Bonnie Dundee .
" With sour - visaged Whigs the Grassmarket was crammed , as if half the South had set tryst to be hanged . "
The Joyless
Whigs were a well known feature of Revolutionary Scotland .
Dundee rode to glory with a Song , with trumpets and kettle drums .
Was this wrong ?
Should men fight and die with the sour visage of the true Whig ?
I ask but I have no final answer .

S ubject : Windows invulnerability >>
But while we are at it , it remains true that not one properly updated Windows system has been hit with an infection not requiring cooperation by the machine 's operator .
<< Jerry , that simply is n't true .
Fully - patched Windows machines by the millions have been infected by worms * before * Microsoft has even issued a patch .
But it 's worse that than , because merely issuing a patch does n't solve the problem .
Zotob is just the latest case .
Sure , Microsoft says they issued a patch and that all anyone had to do was apply it .
But issuing a patch one day for a worm that arrives the next is no solution .
Put yourself in the position of a corporate IT manager with a thousand ( or ten thousand ) WIndows boxes .
Are you going to apply the patch to all those systems immediately ?
Of course not .
In the first place , it takes time to get the patch rolled out to all your systems , even if you 're foolish enough to trust Microsoft that the patch wo n't break anything .
If you want to keep your job , you 're going to test the patch first , which again takes time .
Microsoft 's whole patch strategy is a bandaid solution .
The problem is that Windows is fundamentally insecure by design .
The only real solution would be for Microsoft to rewrite Windows from scratch , and that is n't going to happen .
Meanwhile , those of us running secure operating systems like Linux and OS X can only sympathize with those unfortunate enough to be running a piece of garbage like Windows .
-- Robert Bruce Thompson For
The first part of your statement Need to defer to Microsoft who say otherwise .
Apparently though , all those corporate it people are fools or crooks or very likely both , who waste their employer substance on worthless dross instead of buying ample , or teaching their minions Linux .
Such arrogance !
They do not listen !
or perhaps there is a case for Windows and it is valid ?
I use Windows because OS / 2 was worthless in actual use although great in theory .
I do not use Linux because much of the software does not integrate seamlessly .
I admit that my early experiences with Linux discouraged me .
On the other hand I see No great Advantage to using Linux here .
That may be because I have not been bitten by worms or viruses other than an e-mail vectored Melissa a long time ago .
.
IF all I did was to write books I might use a different system .
Joel Rosenberg has changed to Linux and loves it .
Apple is a different story .
We will see ; but I can afford any Thing I like .
Many readers cannot .
The security story is not over .
== Subject : Update Your Mac Dr. Pournelle : For the " My Mac is Better than yours ... " crowd , this notice at the Internet Storm Center http://isc.sans.org ( and other places ) , emphasis added : " Apple released patch set # 7 for this year : http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302163
" A number of critical issues are fixed by this patch sets .
Highlights include Apache2 , Bluetooth and zlib .
It is recommended that OS - X users apply these patches expeditiously .
For some of these issues , exploit code is available for other platforms and may be adapted to OS - X .
" Make sure you use version 1.1. of this patch set .
Initially , Apple released 1.0 but it was missing a critical 64 bit library and broke some applications . "
Does n't matter what OS you use , Windows , Linux , Mac , Sun , whatever ... updates , patches , firewalls are important .
" I tell you three times ... "
I go to a lot of places on the " Interweb " with my fully patched / virus protected / firewalled Windows XP system , and no problems with my computer .

= Subject : Latest Microsoft worm raises questions of support Jerry , ( First , thanks for your books , especially those that you and Larry Niven work together on .
I often get libraries and book stores to order them for me if they 're not already there in the English language sections .
I noticed one stocked up on all the ones currently in print after I ordered Gripping Hand from them .
However , the following is somewhat more related to your technology columns .
Something strikes me funny about the way the news has been reporting the lastest MS worms so it may not just be technology but politics . )
The latest Microsoft worm raises two questions of support again , but none of the main news sources are asking them yet .
I think the second question is far less controversial than the first and several magnitudes easier to solve : 1 ) Can MS simply not keep up or is it actually neglecting older products again to drive sales of newer ones ?
Though Windows 2000 is still supported , only XP and later where actually patched .
Why ?
All three use NT - based kernels and the service in question is available on all three .
Perhaps this is a possible preview of what current XP users will also experience a few years from now , just as their NT predecessors did .
More and more it appears that Microsoft is falling behind on patches even after going to a monthly cycle .
The question is , why ?
2 ) Why has MS chosen not to release actual security patches and instead used the opportunity to force unrelated changes ?
Though MS has generated a multitude of " service packs " , " patches " , " roll outs " and " upgrades " , none of these actually address security and security only .
Instead these have all been bundled with changes in both configuration and functionality , sometimes unpopular ones , creating a situation which often forces customers to choose between skipping the patch or breaking mission critical applications .
Competitors have long been able to separate upgrades in security from upgrades in functionality , in some cases for longer than MS has been on the Internet .
For some , that has even been their ongoing strength .
No one has called out MS for not providing actual * security * patches for its own products .
Why ?

Subject : NASA says " it 's too hard " Jerry , Substantial prizes for results ( not one cent for " but we tried real hard ! " ) is one good approach .
An alternative that might be a bit easier to sell to Congress is good old - fashioned competition .
From Space Access Update # 98 , March 8th , 2001 , written in the context of X - 33 finally getting a well - deserved stake through its heart while NASA 's chosen followon " Space Launch Initiative " ( SLI ) already looked like nothing but more of the same : " The real lesson here is NOT to give NASA massive new funding and another five years - that would be pouring money down the same old NASA RLV monopoly rathole .
The lesson of X - 33 is , next time give the job to people actually willing to go at the problem in a manner that gives them a chance of solving it with the wide array of advanced technology that 's already practical and available .
" This means letting multiple other agencies take a crack at the problem , in competition with each other , so " it was too hard " after a half - assed screwed up effort is no longer a safe excuse .
Multiple competing outfits , possibly inside NASA ( Ames and Dryden , Glenn , or Langley Centers come to mind ) but certainly outside ( DARPA , AFRL , NRL , NSF , and DOT are some possibilities ) should now get a chance .
" Slice up the SLI budget a half - dozen ways , set a half - dozen agencies loose on the problem , encourage them to take chances with streamlined procurement and non-traditional vendors , and tell them that every four years , the two most successful among them get 50 % of the budgets of the two least successful .
Then stand back and watch the RLV's fly ! "
Four years later , it 's still good advice .
I look at NASA 's current drunkard 's walk towards reinventing Apollo because they 've failed at all they 've tried since , and I wonder if we 'll ever learn .
Thirty years and most of a trillion dollars ...

Subject : William E. Odom :
What 's wrong with cutting and running ?
Hello , Jerry , " Everything that opponents of a pullout say would happen if the U.S. left Iraq is happening already , says retired Gen. William E. Odom , the head of the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration .
So why stay ? "
http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&askthisid=00129
Powerful arguments .
Regards , John Welch Actually , that 's a decision well above my pay grade .
Above General Odom 's for that matter .
The problem is this : if the enemy perceives that we will not stay the course , then that is a great incentive to continue , to throw in the last reserves , as the North did in Viet Nam .
Had they been convinced that the US would never leave , and that every invasion from the North would end as the 1972 invasion ended , with 100,000 casualties at small cost to the US , it is likely that the North would have given up ; or that the Soviet Union would write off Viet Nam as an expensive rat hole into which was poured the wealth that might have been used to build up the USSR .
But so long as the NV polit buro thought they could win , they were willing to sacrifice the lives of their young men to the fight .
I am not privy to the discussions among the terrorists and Islamic jihad councils , but I would guess that some of that logic prevails there .
The last struggle between the West and Islam took hundreds of years , and was not really ended until Suleiman was defeated at the gates of Vienna ; some would say it was not really decided until a hundred years after that .
The West was divided then , and endured the 30 Years War prior to the final defeat of the Turks .
From the Islamic point of view it was a near thing .
Is that the case here ?
I do n't know .
I would as soon declare victory and bring the forces home and use technology to make America safer ; let Europe look to its own defenses , such as they may be .
But again such decisions are made in places other than my study .
And the worst of it is , if enough in America waver , the effort is surely lost .
Does that mean one continues to throw two or three troopers a day into a meat grinder ?
But yet -- more die on the highways and we are not going to take the cars off the road .

Subject : Microsoft and Patches and Worms and Linux Dr. Pournelle : I respect Robert Thompson 's expertise in things computerish .
I 've been reading his blog for several years ( through the " Daynotes Gang " , of which I am proud to be a member ) .
But each time he mentions Microsoft , I just know he is going into another ' rant ' against them as the " evil empire " .
I take exception to many of his statements posted on your mail pages this week ( and similar rants on his pages ) .
For instance , " Fully patched Windows machines by the millions have been infected by worms * before * Microsoft has even issued a patch " .
I have previously stated that my computer , which is fully ( and timely ) patched , has * never * been infected with a virus / worm .
That is not only because of my policy of automatic updates , but because I practice " safe computing " ( even though I do , as part of my job , go to some ' dark places ' ) .
It 's my responsibility to compute safely .
But it 's not just my experience .
There is research that verifies that patching is important , even if you * do * go to ' dark places ' .
Example :
An interesting research paper from Microsoft and their " HoneyMonkey " project .
The paper is here ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/tr/TR-2005-72.pdf , and is described by Microsoft as : " Internet attacks that use Web servers to exploit browser vulnerabilities to install malware programs are on the rise .
Several recent reports suggested that some companies may actually be building a business model around such attacks .
Expensive , manual analyses for individually discovered malicious Web sites have recently emerged .
" In this paper , we introduce the concept of Automated Web Patrol , which aims at significantly reducing the cost for monitoring malicious Web sites to protect Internet users .
We describe the design and implementation of the Strider HoneyMonkey Exploit Detection System , which consists of a network of monkey programs running on virtual machines with different patch levels and constantly patrolling the Web to hunt for Web sites that exploit browser vulnerabilities .
" Within the first month of utilizing this new system , we identified 752 unique URLs that are operated by 287 Web sites and that can successfully exploit unpatched WinXP machines .
The system automatically constructs topology graphs that capture the connections between the exploit sites based on traffic redirection , which leads to the identification of several major players who are responsible for a large number of exploit pages . "
( For more information on the Strider Honeymonkey research project , visit http://research.microsoft.com/honeymonkey, including the PDF of the article here : ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/tr/TR-2005-72.pdf
.
It 's a bit technical , but interesting . )
Note that they tested various levels of unpatched WinXP systems .
They found that a patched system is much more protected .
From an article at SecurityFocus : " Among the researchers other findings is that even a partially patched version of Windows XP Service Pack 2 blocks the lion 's share of attacks , cutting the number of sites that could successfully compromise a system from 287 for an unpatched system to 10 for a partially patched Windows XP SP2 system .
A fully patched Windows XP SP2 systems could not be compromised by any [ of these ]
Web sites , according to the group 's May - June data .
( The zero - day exploit of javaprxy. dll happened after this data set . )
" [ See Table 1 in the Microsoft report . ]
*** No exploits on a fully patched XP system .***
And those systems went to very dark places .
Linux is not perfect , and needs to be regularly patched .
Does that make it a less secure product ?
Firefox / Mozillia has vulns that needs regular patching .
Open - source apps ( large and small ) have vulns that need patching .
Several open source blog / diary - type sites ( PHP - based ) have vulns that need patching .
One big exploit last year was the attack on web - based advertising servers running exploitable Linux OS .
Just by visiting a high - profile page ( news or entertainment sites ) and getting an ad from that compromised ad server infected computers .
So you say to " change to Linux " .
How are you going to keep your Linux computers updated ?
Should n't you ?
There are lots of vulns for Linux computers ; lots of patches to install .
I see dozens of Linux - based bug reports every week on the " BugTraq " mailing list for open - source software large and small .
I believe that Microsoft has made great progress in security .
You can see how the security folks at Microsoft are working hard to protect their systems ( there are lots of MS staff writing blogs related to security and malware ) .
A chef knows that he needs to keep his knives sharp , and the gas bill paid .
Without the proper tools , the chef is out of business ( a " Denial of Service " ) .
A responsible corporation knows that the tools they use have to kept current .
Or they can be out of business .
( Oops ... I did n't pay the phone bill .
So it 's the phone company 's fault my phones do n't work . )
A responsible corporation can keep their computer patched , and quite easily .
At my " large municipal government agency " , we use the * free * Microsoft Update Server ( now called " Windows Software Update Server ) to automatically keep the workstations and servers current .
MS releases a patch , a couple of checkmarks at the WSUS update interface , and workstations are updated .
Yeah , it requires a server .
Yeah , it took a bit of effort to set up the user 's computers ( we just pushed down registry settings ) .
Yeah , the user 's computer may restart .
But our 2500 +
Windows computers are protected and updated .
Responsible corporations ( and users ) with Windows computers can be protected against malware .
Automatically , with minimal effort once everything 's set up .
No matter which tool you use , you need to do updates .
If you do n't , then do n't complain when your tool does n't work .
And do n't blame the tool manufacturer .
It 's your fault .
* You have to take responsibility * .
( " I 'm sorry that you ejected through the windshield during the car crash .
The seat belt was there ; you chose not to wear it .
Must be the car 's fault . "
" Oops , cut yourself again , did n't you .
Must be the knife 's fault . "
" Phone does n't work ?
Did n't pay the bill ?
Must be the phone company 's fault . "
" Did n't change the oil as often as you should have ?
Must be the engine 's fault that it seized up . " )
( Sorry for the length ... thanks for your patience . )
Regards , Rick Hellewell , Security Guy Let 's all of you fight , it 's too late at night for me .

The Biggest Boom in the Universe
With the discovery of a bright , long - lived supernova , scientists believe they have found a spectacular new way for stars to die
Despite the anxieties of these times , happiness has been on the rise around the world in recent years , a new survey finds .
The upbeat outlook is attributed to economic growth in previously poor countries , democratization of others , and rising social tolerance for women and minority groups .
" It 's a surprising finding , " said University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart , who headed up the survey .
" It 's widely believed that it 's almost impossible to raise an entire country 's happiness level . "
Denmark is the happiest nation and Zimbabwe the the most glum , he found .
( Zimbabwe 's longtime ruler Robert Mugabe was sworn in as president for a sixth term Sunday after a widely discredited runoff in which he was the only candidate .
Observers said the runoff was marred by violence and intimidation . )
The United States ranks 16th .
The results of the survey , going back an average of 17 years in 52 countries and involving 350,000 people , will be published in the July 2008 issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science .
Researchers have asked the same two questions over the years : " Taking all things together , would you say you are very happy , rather happy , not very happy , not at all happy ? "
And , " All things considered , how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days ? "
A Happiness Index created from the answers rose in 40 countries between 1981 and 2007 , and it fell in the other 12 .
Scientists had thought happiness is stable over time when looking at entire societies .
" Most previous research suggests that people and nations are stuck on a ' hedonic treadmill , ' " Inglehart said .
" The belief has been that no matter what happens or what we do , basic happiness levels are stable and do n't really change . "
So Inglehart 's team was surprised that happiness " rose substantially . "
They speculate reasons for the sunny outlooks include societal shifts in recent decades : Low - income countries such as India and China have experienced unprecedented rates of economic growth ; dozens of medium - income countries have democratized ; and there has been a sharp rise of gender equality and tolerance of ethnic minorities and gays and lesbians in developed societies .
Previous research has found that happiness is partly inherited and that money does n't buy much of it .
Yet the new survey finds people of rich countries tend to be happier than those of poor countries .
And controlling for economic factors , certain types of societies are much happier than others .
" The results clearly show that the happiest societies are those that allow people the freedom to choose how to live their lives , " Inglehart said .
A survey released last week found one reason America does n't top the list : Baby Boomers are generally miserable compared to other generations .
Further , a public opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center in April found that 81 percent of Americans say they believe the country is on the " wrong track . "
The response is the most negative in the 25 years pollsters have asked the question .
The World Values Surveys , led by Inglehart , was funded by the National Science Foundation , the Swedish and Netherlands Foreign Ministries , and other institutions .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Flying Spaghetti Monster bless Dennis Kucinich .
He 's in the middle of an absolutely sisyphean task of trying to make Congress actually do their job -- one that far more Americans support than they did the impeachment of Bill Clinton -- and one that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is frustratingly and blindly ignoring , as evidenced by her stop - me - before - I - throw - something - at - the - screen appearance on The View .
JOY BEHAR : You ’ve ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney , and now Kucinich is trying to pass that .
Why do you insist on not impeaching these people , so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they ’ve committed ?
REP .
NANCY PELOSI : Well , I think that it — I think it was important , when I became Speaker — and it ’s , by the way , a very important position — President , Vice President , Speaker of the House — I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could .
I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country .
In terms of what we wanted — set out to do , we wanted to raise the minimum wage , give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy - seven - year history , then pass research for stem cell research , all of that .
This week , we ’re going to pass equal pay for equal work .
It has been a long time in coming — pay equity .
We ’re going to pass legislations for product safety , for toys that children put in their — there ’s an agenda that you have to get done .
You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way .
The President has to sign it .
If somebody had a crime that the President had committed , that would be a different story .
Have you not been paying fricking attention for the last eight years , Nancy ???
What do you mean , IF ????
Say it with me now : warrantless wiretapping ; waterboarding , lying to Congress and the American people to illegally invade and occupy a sovereign nation that posed no threat to us , firing US Attorneys for not pursuing partisan prosecutions , outing a covert CIA agent .
And those were just ones you knew about and did nothing to stop , Pelosi .
How dare she play stupid on national television and insult all our intelligence and what this country ( once ) stood for ?
How .
Dare .
She .
So it makes me love the undaunted Kucinich that much more .
He appeared on Democracy Now ! and tried to spin this in the best way possible .
( T) he reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this .
So , I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi , and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there 's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing .
Give 'em hell , Dennis .

JUAN GONZALEZ : We 're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums .
We 're joined from Washington , D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
And here in New York , we have Bettina Damiani , the project director of Good Jobs New York , and Neil deMause , author of Field of Schemes : How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .
But , Congressman Kucinich , you 've been leading the fight for impeachment , and I know you have to go very soon , so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week .
She was asked about impeachment .
JOY BEHAR : You 've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney , and now Kucinich is trying to pass that .
Why do you insist on not impeaching these people , so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they 've committed ?
REP .
NANCY PELOSI : Well , I think that it - I think it was important , when I became Speaker - and it's , by the way , a very important position - President , Vice President , Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could .
I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country .
In terms of what we wanted - set out to do , we wanted to raise the minimum wage , give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy - seven - year history , then pass research for stem cell research , all of that .
This week , we 're going to pass equal pay for equal work .
It has been a long time in coming - pay equity .
We 're going to pass legislations for product safety , for toys that children put in their - there 's an agenda that you have to get done .
You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way .
The President has to sign it .
If somebody had a crime that the President had committed , that would be a different story .
JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he 's out ?
BARBARA WALTERS :
When we - when I interviewed you last year , you had just begun , and you were going to clean up the mess , remember ?
REP .
NANCY PELOSI : And we did .
BARBARA WALTERS :
You look around this country , 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job .
ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it 's 91 percent now .
REP .
NANCY PELOSI : Well , I do n't disagree with that , because largely it 's predicated on ending the war in Iraq .
That 's the main question , and we were not successful .
In our House of Representatives , I 'm very proud of our members , because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end , bring the troops home safely and soon , sent it to the Senate , and it hits a dead end .
But in terms of that particular standard , I would say I disapprove , as well .
But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned , the energy bill .
We worked in a bipartisan way , Innovation Agenda .
We have to create jobs , expand healthcare , protect the American people and educate our children .
And you can't do that if you 're trying to impeach the President at the same time , unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes .
JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Congressman Kucinich , your response to her take on the situation with impeachment ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH :
Well , now that I 've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed , I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty - five articles of impeachment that I presented , which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed , including taking this nation into a war , an illegal war , based on lies ; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis , which constitute a war crime ; including wiretapping , rendition , torture , illegal detention .
There are many examples of laws that have been broken .
And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this .
So , I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi , and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there 's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing .
I just want to state this , that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday .
It was a six - hour hearing , over a dozen witnesses .
Twenty - four members of Congress attended .
It 's being taken seriously .
I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we 're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power .
If in fact we 're in a war that 's based on lies , and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day , we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record .
And then , whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter .
I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing , a war against Iran , a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack , much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq , it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio , thank you , once again , for joining us .

Obama up by five … in Montana
A few weeks ago , in its first general - election ad of the year , the Obama campaign hit the airwaves in 18 states , including 14 that supported Bush / Cheney four years ago .
Among the states was Montana .
Now , at first blush , this seemed like a rather foolish way to spend campaign money .
Four years ago , Bush beat Kerry in Montana by 21 points .
Eight years ago , Bush beat Gore in Montana by 25 points .
Did the Obama campaign know something we do n’t ?
As a matter of fact , yes .
Barack Obama is leading John McCain by five percentage points in Montana .
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey in the state shows Obama attracting 48 % of the vote while McCain earns 43 % .
In April , the numbers were reversed with McCain leading 48 % to 43 % .
That was before Obama clinched the Democratic nomination and defeated Hillary Clinton by fifteen points in Montana . [ … ]
Against McCain , Obama leads among voters under 50 , including a twenty - seven point lead among voters under 30 .
McCain leads among those over 50 .
Obama is supported by 89 % of Montana Democrats while McCain gets the vote from 85 % of Republicans .
Without more data , it ’s hard to know if these numbers are an outlier , but given that Rasmussen showed Montana as a competitive state in April , too , the results are n’t too hard to believe .
Indeed , Eric Kleefeld reminds us that as conservative as Montana ’s reputation is , this is a state that has a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators .
Talk about stretching the map — I suspect the McCain campaign did n’t expect to have to worry about Montana .
The Motion Picture Association of America is suing two websites accused of acting as a for - profit , " one- stop shop " for allegedly infringing copies of Hollywood 's copyrighted works .
The sites , fomd.com , known as " Free Online Movie DataBase , " and movierumor.com , post , organize , search for , identify , collect and index links to infringing material that is available on third - party websites .
According to the suits filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , the sites profit via advertising .
The language in the two lawsuits were nearly identical .
The so - called search engines go a step further than Google , for example .
To watch a flick on fomdb , " the user clicks on the title of a particular infringing work … from fomdb 's index .
A page then appears on the fomdb site in which the work is performed and displayed on an embedded video player . "
Similar allegations are made against Movierumor .
The suits , which seek unspecified damages and the removal of the sites from the internet , were filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles .
They claim the " fundamental purpose " of the two sites " is to further the illegal dissemination of infringing works " and to profit from those works .
The lawsuits claim fomdb's ( .pdf ) servers are located in Charlotte , North Carolina and movierumor 's ( .pdf ) are in Chicago .

" Rob Kall 's Bottom Up is a revaluation of values , not the empty mouthing of the word ' democracy ' that is so common , but the application of belief in popular wisdom to every aspect of life .
Actually believing that the views of more people is better , means a new way of thinking about the world that is democratic , feminist , localist , populist , and radically richer than the elitist perspectives that are more common even in the parts of the world that shout the word ' democracy ' the most .
Here we come to understand both the power of small groups and the upsides to internet crowd sourcing , the potential of nonviolent movements and ways in which the past has not been what we supposed .
Do n't just read this book ; get lots of people to read and talk about it . "
David Swanson , host , Talk Nation Radio , author of War No More : The Case for Abolition .
Ever since mankind has been roaming the Earth , people have been philosophizing on the role of religion in their existence and wondering if there was an “ intelligent being ” that put them here on this Earth .
Whether it was the Christian God , the Muslim Allah , the Supreme Being of Scientology , the Flying Spaghetti Monster of Pastafarianism , or the evolution of the Atheists , people will argue until they ’re blue in the face about their religion .
To me , only one thing is for sure , nobody really knows what happened because none of us were there .
But do n’t let that get you down , there are plenty of arguments for and against all sorts of different religious beliefs .
From the highly believable to the “ you ca n’t seriously believe that , can you ? ” and everywhere in between , CreateDebate presents to you the top 10 Religious Debates of All Time .
10 . Was Ra , the Egyptian Sun God , the father of all the Pharaohs ?
Ancient Egyptians believed that Ra was the Sun God , commander of the sky , earth , and underworld .
He is the most central god of the Egyptian pantheon .
Most Egyptians believed that Pharaohs were the sons of Ra and erected solar temples and obelisks in his honor .
However , some Egyptians did not believe that Ra created the Earth but did n’t have an appropriate outlet to vent their frustrations ( especially if they preferred their heads to remain attached to their body ) .
9 . Was Haile Sellasie I , the former Emperor of Ethiopa God incarnate ?
Rastafarians believe that Haile Sellasie I is the living God incarnate , or the Messiah , who will lead the people of Africa and African diaspora to freedom .
Rastafarians believe that exiled Africans will one day return to Ethiopa with the help of the Messiah to escape the oppression caused by Babylon .
The Rastafarians movement was started primarily in Jamaica , although the ranks of Rastafarians throughout the world is estimated to be near 1 million strong .
8 . Is Scientology a cult ?
The Church of Scientology , originally founded by L. Ron Hubbard , believes “ that Man is basically good , that he is seeking to survive , [ and ] that his survival depends on himself and upon his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe ” ( from Church of Scientology ’s statement of beliefs ) .
However , many people believe that this Church is a cult that was set up as a tax shelter for Hubbard ’s Dianetics book profits and that is primarily intended to extract large sums of money from their celebrity cult members .
7. Was Jesus married to Mary Magdalene ?
This debate was popularized by the highly successful ( and highly controversial ) book “ The DaVinci Code ” by Dan Brown .
The book claims that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene , had a child , and the Church covered it up through the years for self - serving reasons .
While Brown has stated that the book is fiction , it has caused much debate and controversy , especially within the Roman Catholic Church .
6. Are Mormons Christians ?
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was founded by Joseph Smith , Jr. in the Spring of 1820 after publishing the Book of Mormon , one of the faith ’s scriptures , which Joseph Smith said he translated from plates of gold that were buried near his home in a place shown to him by the angel Moroni .
Many traditional Christians reject Mormonism as a Christian religion , claiming that the story of Joseph Smith and the Golden Plates is fiction and that he was not a prophet .
5 . Was the Flying Spaghetti Monster responsible for intelligent design ?
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster ( CoFSM ) was founded in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to protest the teaching of intelligent design in school .
Bobby parodies the theory of an intelligent designer by professing belief in a supreme creator made of spaghetti and meatballs .
The CoFSM has gained a huge following , primarily on the Internet in response to the Christian movement to teach intelligent design in classrooms .
4 . Is Islam a religion of violence or a religion of peace ?
This debate has received much attention , not only on CreateDebate but throughout much of the mainstream media since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
While Islam ’s central tenets preach , several extremists have taken passages from the Qur’an such as , “ Make war on them until idolatry shall cease and God ’s religion shall reign supreme . ” ( 8:39 ) ” to mean that Muslims are called to kill any non-Muslim to ensure Islam is the supreme religion of the land .
3. Jesus Christ : Fact or Fiction ?
Christianity claims that Jesus Christ was the Son of God who was sacrificed to absolve believer ’s sins so that Christians could receive eternal life .
The Christian Bible teaches of many miracles performed by Jesus of Nazareth and of his resurrection from the dead .
However , many people dispute that he was the Son of God and that the writings of the Bible are embellished stories chosen by the Church to further their mission .
2. Was Mohammed a pedophile ?
The Qur’an ( Mohammed ’s testimonies ) and Hadiths ( other ’s reports on the life of Mohmmed ) depict Mohammed marrying a 6 year old girl for his third marriage .
Many people believe that this practice ( uncommon in present day ) should be viewed as pedophilia .
What do you think ?
1 . Do you believe in God ?
This debate still reigns as the Most Popular debate on CreateDebate thus far .
Many people define themselves by their religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) , which is why it deserves the spot as the number one religious debate of all time .
It seems to me that everyone , no matter what gender , nationality , ethnicity , or age has an opinion on this topic , and they love to share it .
At CreateDebate , we strive to offer an easy to use website to debate any topic that you want ; whether it be religious , political , sports , or any other topic you ’d like .
We are quickly building a strong community and are rolling out new features almost daily .

“ The first rule of Fight Club – We Do Not Talk About Fight Club . ”
Everyone who ’s seen the movie remembers that .
But what about something Tyler Durden , the anarchist extraordinaire , said very early on in the movie ?
It ’s something profound that stuck with me from the second I saw it in the movie theater to this very day .
And I think it should stick with you , too .
For those of you who have n’t seen Fight Club ( please see it ) , or read the excellent Chuck Palahniuk book , I wo n’t put any major spoilers in this article .
But to set the scene , at the beginning of the film Edward Norton ’s character , Jack , loses everything he owns in an explosion at his home .
The conversation that follows with Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt ) , a colorful free spirit he met on a plane prior to the incident , goes like this ( excuse the language , it ’s a direct lift from the screenplay ) :
JACK : There 's always that .
I do n't know , it 's just ... when you buy furniture , you tell yourself : that 's it , that 's the last sofa I 'm gonna need .
No matter what else happens , I 've got that sofa problem handled .
I had it all .
I had a stereo that was very decent , a wardrobe that was getting very respectable .
I was so close to being complete .
TYLER : S**t , man , now it 's all gone .
JACK : All gone .
TYLER : Do you know what a duvet it ?
JACK : Comforter .
TYLER : It 's a blanket , just a blanket .
Now why guys like you and I know what a duvet is ?
Is this essential to our survival ?
In the hunter - gathered sense of the word ?
No .
What are we then ?
JACK : You know , consumers .
TYLER : Right .
We 're consumers .
We 're by - products of a lifestyle obsession .
Murder , crime , poverty -- these things do n't concern me .
What concerns me is celebrity magazines , television with five hundred channels , some guy 's name on my underwear .
Rogaine , Viagra , Olestra .
JACK : Martha Stewart .
TYLER : F**k Martha Stewart .
Martha 's polishes on the brass of the Titanic .
It 's all going down , man !
So f**k off , with your sofa units and your green stripe patterns .
I say never be complete .
I say stop being perfect .
I say let 's evolve and let the chips fall where they may .
But that 's me , I could be wrong , maybe it 's a terrible tragedy .
JACK : No , it 's just stuff .
TYLER : Well , you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for a modern life .
JACK : F**k , you 're right .
Tyler offers Jack a cigarette .
JACK : No , I do n't smoke .
My insurance will probably cover it , so ...
Tyler stares at him JACK : What ?
TYLER : The things you own , end up owning you .
Let me repeat that for dramatic effect ; the things you own end up owning you .
The more I thought about that , the more it made perfect sense to me .
It also made me think hard about the purchases I have made that have , in fact , ended up owning me .
The first is a no -brainer .
My house owns me , no question .
Even though I bought a home very much within my reach , my mortgage is still a substantial part of my monthly income .
I figure , after taxes , I spend at least the first 10 days of every month just working to pay my mortgage .
If I do n’t pay it , we ’re homeless , I face foreclosure and the risk of a huge black stain on my credit report .
Then there are the cars .
Two of them .
I do n’t drive anything classy and super - expensive like a BMW or a Mercedes , but my humble VW Passat and my wife ’s Pacifica still take another huge chunk of my salary .
Again , defaulting on these loans means bad credit and , of course , no transportation .
We also have credit card payments , most of the bulk of those came from transferring my UK student loans to US credit cards ( the exchange rates and transfer fees were killing me ) .
I do n’t feel as bad about those .
But anything else we put on a credit card in the past , from a simple CD to a piece of furniture , is now owning me until I pay it off .
What ’s the solution then ?
In Fight Club , Tyler Durden took lack of ownership to the extreme .
He did n’t work ( other than his gross soap sideline ) , he lived in a house that had been abandoned , he had no real possesions and he bought nothing other than food and clothing ( and , well , ammo ) .
For most of us , owning nothing is not really an option .
But what we can do is make a determination between wants and needs .
Most of us need a car , but no one needs a $ 70 k BMW .
That ’s a want , and unless you throw down cash , that BMW will own a part of you for roughly 3 to 7 years .
You need a place to live .
But do you need a 6 - bedroom , 4 - car garage , media center home in 5000 square feet of luxury living ?
That , once again , is a want .
And unless you ’re Bill Gates or Warren Buffett , you wo n’t be bringing that kind of cold , hard cash to the table .
For most of us , that decision is a 15 to 30 year commitment .
And in that time , the house is owning you .
Even if you ’re just thinking about slapping a fancy meal or a new DVD onto a credit card , think again .
If you really want it ( no one needs either , they ’re wants ) then ask yourself if you can pay cash , or use the debit card .
You do n’t need to be paying anywhere from 6 % to 26 % interest on either of those things .
It ’s a fact of life that at least 95 % of us will end up being owned by the things we have .
It ’s unavoidable .
But just how much they own us , and for how long , that ’s a decision we can all make .
Thanks Chuck Palahniuk and David Fincher for a great , great film .

Fight Club
Another church shooting , this time in Knoxville .
By now you ’ve probably read the accounts and know that the shooter , Jim Adkisson , was motivated by , among other things , an apparent hatred of “ liberals . ”
Before diving too much deeper , there are a couple things we can probably safely say about Adkisson .
First , these were n’t the actions of a rational man .
Rational people do n’t wade into crowds of people attempting to kill as many as possible .
So whatever else may have been at play , and no doubt the causes were many and complex , let ’s be clear that we ’re dealing with a disturbed individual .
Second , Adkisson probably was n’t a terribly smart man .
Or , at the least , he was n’t a thoughtful one .
For instance :
he was upset that he could n’t find a job ;
he felt this was due in part to his age ;
his food stamps had recently been cut ;
A thoughtful man might have had a hard time looking at the economy of the past few years and concluding that “ liberals ” were responsible for shrinking job opportunities .
A thoughtful man would have realized that “ liberal ” policies on age discrimination would generally weigh in his favor .
And a man capable of mustering up one stray coherent thought in a month would certainly notice that food stamps are a “ liberal ” program – so being upset at them being cut would seem at least a little hypocritical .
There ’s a lot we do n’t yet know about Adkisson , and a lot we may never know .
We do n’t know , for instance , where he got his information about the world , its politics and its economics .
( Although , based on what we do know , we might hazard a guess or two . )
We do n’t know if he listened to Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage or Laura Ingraham or if he watched Bill O’Reilly .
We do n’t know if his views on personal and family issues were shaped by harpies like Laura Schlesinger .
We do n’t know how often the politicians he was aware of said things that a twisted mind might interpret as “ libruls are of the devil . ”
Or , for that matter , how often those politicians said those things in more or less those exact words .
We do n’t even know , when push comes to shove , if Adkisson could have articulated the meaning of the word “ liberal . ”
I ’m guessing not , honestly , because my experience of people whose hate is framed by labels is that their hatred is driven by knee - buckling ignorance , not knowledge .
There are things we do know , though .
We know that we live in a society where people have been encouraged , at every turn , to define those they do n’t understand with prefabricated labels like “ liberal . ”
They ’ve been encouraged to believe that these others are bad humans who are responsible for everything wrong in the world , even when the alleged responsibility is n’t even barely plausible .
They ’ve been taught that complex problems result from simple causes and that the solutions are simpler yet .
The always - insightful Sara Robinson has this to say :
After 25 years of right - wing eliminationist rhetoric about liberal hunting licenses and scaring us out of our treason and keeping a few of us alive as museum exhibits , it ’s natural that some of us would jump to the thought that maybe , at long last , somebody finally decided to grab a shotgun and go bag himself some libruls — and decided ( not unreasonably ) that down at the local UU church , they ’d be as thick on the ground as quail on one of Dick Cheney ’s private hunting trips .
It would be simplistic and wrong - headed of me to blame a particular person or institution for Adkisson ’s actions .
I do n’t know what Rush had to say last week – although I ’m sure it was hateful and stupid – but Rush did n’t load up the shotgun and pull the trigger .
However , Rush is one of the people who has helped poison the waters in the sea that is American culture .
FOX “ News ” and its hatefuck parade of gleefully toxic talking heads have dumped billions of gallons of rhetorical bile into the streams feeding the ocean of public opinion .
Karl Rove has taught a new generation of bright - eyed Typhoid Marys to bathe in the waters that the rest of us drink .
Jim Adkisson was an unbalanced man , and perhaps it was only a matter of time before he snapped .
But two questions to ponder : first , who created the conditions that hastened the snap ?
And second , when the train jumped the tracks , who created the bogeyman that the diseased brain latched onto as the cause of all the pain ?
I ca n’t tell you who to point to specifically if you need to blame somebody .
But I can tell you that yesterday ’s tragedy at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church occurred in a context , a known and knowable context .
His reasons strike us as familiar because they are .
Every day for the past 30 years we ’ve heard words like these – on talk radio , on right - wing propaganda outlets like FOX , on blogs aimed at dividing and conquering we the people , from the mouths of sub - human politicians who ’ll do anything to assure their spot at the trough .
And eventually , from the mouths of ordinary citizens who have been systematically denied the kinds of educational programs necessary to inoculate them against these obscenities , which to the genuinely critical mind are so transparent as to be invisible .
I can tell you that while there ’s no way to point at one person , it ’s easy to point at those who worked together to poison the well from which Jim Adkisson drank .
Limbaugh .
Rove .
Savage .
Schlesinger .
Murdoch .
Helms .
Falwell .
Robertson .
Dobson .
O’Reilly .
Phelps .
Matalin . Ingraham .
Coulter .
Hannity .
Beck .
Bush .
The list goes on for quite awhile , but these are some of the bigger names .
There ’s also ample blame for the dolts in charge at CBS , NBC , ABC , CNN , USA Today , and hundreds of local papers and stations around the country , because you ignorantly parroted their lies in the name of “ balance . ”
Adkisson is on you .
All of you .
And while yesterday might prove , mercifully , to be the last event of its kind that we ever see , only a moron would bet on it .
UPDATE : In other places around the ‘ sphere I ’m hearing this caution : we have to be careful – we ca n’t try and link the shooter with the right - wing hate machine until we know that he was listening to them .
As I think I indicate above , it ’s not about showing direct cause , it ’s about describing the context .
I ’m a culturalist , and we ’re not afraid of a little complexity .
However , if that approach fails to satisfy some simplistic need for “ proof , ” then check this :
Inside the house , officers found “ Liberalism is a Mental Health Disorder ” by radio talk show host Michael Savage , “ Let Freedom Ring ” by talk show host Sean Hannity , and “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” by television talk show host Bill O’Reilly .
Gee .
I ’m stunned .
From Roll Call …
Furthermore , during a Senate vote Wednesday , Obama dragged Lieberman by the hand to a far corner of the Senate chamber and engaged in what appeared to reporters in the gallery as an intense , three - minute conversation .
While it was unclear what the two were discussing , the body language suggested that Obama was trying to convince Lieberman of something and his stance appeared slightly intimidating .
Using forceful , but not angry , hand gestures , Obama literally backed up Lieberman against the wall , leaned in very close at times , and appeared to be trying to dominate the conversation , as the two talked over each other in a few instances .
Still , Obama and Lieberman seemed to be trying to keep the back - and - forth congenial as they both patted each other on the back during and after the exchange .
Afterwards , Obama smiled and pointed up at reporters peering over the edge of the press gallery for a better glimpse of their interaction .
Obama loyalists were quick to express their frustration with Lieberman ’s decision and warned that if he continues to take a lead role in attacking Obama it could complicate his professional relationship with the Caucus .
July 4 2008 : A Declaration For Our Times Posted by Pile ( 10193 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Activists ]
A group of so - called " rabble rousers " have placed an ad in today 's New York Times ... it 's well worth a read ...
“ We the people of the United States , ” the first words of the Constitution , make it clear that our government was established to serve the people .
Our Constitution contains checks and balances to prevent abuses of power , and our Bill of Rights limits government in order to guarantee fundamental rights and liberties .
Today the " War on Terror " undermines those crucial limits on power that our Constitution promises .
Congress 's complicity in this war has enabled constitutional violations of including warrantless surveillance , torture , indefinite detention , and preemptive war .
Fighting against one violation at a time fragments our movement .
It is time to unite to face the common source of these problems .
See the video and the actual ad placed .
INDEPENDENCE DAY
July 4 , 1776 - 2008
When in the course of human events the government becomes destructive of the ends for which it was established , it is the Right of the People to alter it and demand restoration of those Constitutional Principles that have so long assured their Liberty , Safety , and Happiness .
Therefore , on the anniversary of our Independence , we offer this new declaration for our times .
The history of this president is one of arbitrary usurpations of power , the effect of which is to establish tyranny through false promises of greater security .
He has created a multitude of secret programs and sent swarms of petty officers to spy on Americans in a misguided effort to combat foreign terrorism .
He has invested these agents with sweeping new powers to monitor our conversations and ransack our personal papers and effects without judicial supervision or any reason to believe -- as the Constitution requires -- that a crime has been committed .
He has further claimed the power to disregard legislation that Congress has passed .
He has suspended the laws and treaties against torture , authorized the kidnapping of mere suspects , and transported hundreds of prisoners beyond seas so that no independent judiciary could question the legality of their mistreatment .
He and his supporters in Congress have granted amnesty to the officials who unleashed torture and humiliation upon helpless prisoners , to the disgrace of our nation .
He has denied these prisoners access to attorneys , family , and friends and has claimed the right to try them before military tribunals specifically designed to disregard the most basic principles of law .
He has imprisoned thousands of lawful immigrants for months without charges , under brutal conditions , until his agents , rather than independent courts , decide that they posed no threat .
He has wrapped his usurpations of power and his deprivations of liberty in thick cloaks of secrecy , thereby showing contempt for the rule of law and the proper functions of Congress , the courts , and the press .
At every stage of these oppressions we have sought redress , but our petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
We , therefore , resolve to resist these usurpations by all lawful means at our disposal .
We insist that the powers of our national government be shared by all branches of that government and not concentrated in one alone .
And we call upon Congress , the courts , and the press to reassert their constitutional functions and restore the promise that is America .
To these ends , we mutually pledge our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor .
The declaration is read by leaders in the movement to preserve and protect the Constitution .
They are , in order of appearance :
* Buz EizenbergBuz Eisenberg is a civil rights attorney representing several Guantanamo detainees and the President of the International Justice Network , the only non-governmental organization currently providing legal representation to detainees held abroad in the “ War on Terror . ”
* Nancy Talanian is a co-founder and the founding director of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee .
Further , she is an experienced activist and professional writer who converted local successes in western Massachusetts into a national movement to restore Americans ’ civil liberties .
* William Newman is a civil rights attorney in Northampton , Massachusetts who is currently representing a detainee at Guantanamo .
He is the director of the Western Regional Office of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and a member of BORDC ’s Advisory Board .
* Christopher Pyle is the author of “ A Declaration for Our Times ” and a professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College .
* Barbara Haugen is the administrator of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee .
She has worked previously as a Unitarian Universalist minister and as a legal aid attorney .
* Ben Grosscup is a campaign coordinator for the Bill of Rights Defense Committee .
Before joining the BORDC , he worked for the Massachusetts chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Association .
* Mohamed ElgadiMohamed Elgadi is a torture survivor from Sudan , a global human rights advocate , and a board member for both the Liberty Center for Torture Survivors and the Group Against Torture in Sudan ( both of which are based out of Philadelphia ) .
* Juan Carlos Aguilar is the development officer for the National Priorities Project and a board member for the Commonwealth Center for Change .
Recently , he initiated a program to provide English language classes to immigrants working in the United States .
This subversive " Declaration for our times " was signed by several hundred people from all over the country and supported by groups with such suspicious names as the " People 's Campaign for the Constitution , " the " Bill of Rights Defense Committee , " the " Defending Dissent Foundation , " and the " Electronic Frontier Foundation .

THE HAGUE ( Reuters ) - The World Court ordered the United States on Wednesday to do all it could to halt the imminent executions of five Mexicans until the court makes a final judgment in a dispute over suspects ’ rights .
The row , which has strained relations between the neighbors , centers on the fact that the United States failed to inform 51 of its citizens sentenced to die in U.S. jails of their right to consular assistance .
One of the five Mexicans on death row , Jose Medellin , is due to die on August 5 in Texas .
In 2004 the World Court , or International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , ruled in favor of Mexico , finding the United States had violated international law .
It ordered the United States to review the 51 cases to see whether the lack of consular assistance had prejudiced the outcome of their trials .
A year later , U.S. President George W. Bush ordered Texas to review Medellin ’s case but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in March that Bush had no authority to do so , leading Texas to schedule Medellin ’s execution for August .
“ The court indicates that the United States of America shall take all measures necessary to ensure that five Mexican nationals are not executed pending its final judgment , ” Judge Rosalyn Higgins said .
Mexico , which had asked the court for an interpretation of its 2004 ruling , given U.S. assertions that its federal states have a large degree of legal autonomy and it cannot compel them to review the cases , welcomed Wednesday ’s ruling .
“ ( We ) hope the provisional measures will be duly observed , taking into account their legally binding nature , ” the foreign ministry said in a statement .
LOOMING EXECUTION
Representing Mexico at the court , the United Nations ’ highest legal body , Jorge Lomonaco Tonda said : “ The Mexican government is satisfied with the ruling of the court ... we have full confidence that the ruling will be applied . ”
A gang member , Medellin was denied the right to meet a consular official from Mexico after his arrest for the June 1993 rape and murder of two teenage girls in Houston .
The killings were linked to a gang initiation .
Under the Vienna Convention , foreign nationals have a right to talk to consular officers after their arrests .
John Bellinger , a legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , said the U.S. government had acknowledged it was obliged to review the cases and was talking to the state of Texas to try to get it to comply with the ICJ ruling .
But he added : “ This court ’s orders do not have direct technical effect in the United States . ”
If Texas executed Medellin it would violate the international legal obligations of the United States yet still be legal under Texan state laws , he said .
Texas has said Medellin was never told he could talk to Mexican officials .
But it has added that the claim cannot be made now because he never raised it at trial or sentencing .
Even if his treaty rights had been violated , it would not have made any difference in the outcome of the case , Texas said .
Thirty - eight U.S. states still have the death penalty , of which Texas has carried out the most executions .
Last year 42 people were put to death in the United States , but the number was artificially low because of a de facto moratorium issued by the Supreme Court , while it examined arguments that the cocktail of three drugs used in most U.S. executions inflicted unnecessary pain .
The ICJ is responsible for handling disputes between U.N. member states .
Its rulings -- which often take years -- are binding and not subject to appeal .
Photographing thugs ' is assault ' , police tell householder snapping proof of anti-social behaviour
A householder who took photographs of hooded teenagers as evidence of their anti-social behaviour says he was told he was breaking the law after they called the police .
David Green , 64 , and his neighbours had been plagued by the youths from a nearby comprehensive school for months , and was advised by their headmaster to identify them so action could be taken .
One of Mr Green 's pictures shows two hooded teenagers , one making an obscene gesture towards the camera
But when Mr Green left his £ 1 million London flat to take photographs of the gang , who were aged around 17 , he said one threatened to kill him while another called the police on his mobile .
And he claimed that a Police Community Support Officer sent to the scene promptly issued a warning that taking pictures of youths without permission was illegal , and could lead to a charge of assault .
Concern : David Green
Last night Mr Green , a television cameraman , said he was appalled that the legal system 's first priority seemed not to be stopping frightening anti-social behaviour by aggressive youths , but protecting them from being photographed by the concerned public .
Mr Green , a father - of - two , lives with his programme - maker wife Judy in a penthouse flat close to Waterloo station .
He said : ' We 've had problems with this group shouting abuse and throwing stones for months , and were asked to identify them .
' When I went to take photographs of eight of them throwing cans of Coke around , six of them ran away , one threatened to kill me , and another one started phoning the police .
' A couple of hours later , a Police Community Support Officer told me I had been accused of assault , though no such thing occurred , and told me I was not allowed to take photographs of teenagers on the street .
' I think it 's wrong that when teenagers are running riot and the police are called , it 's about me , and I 'm treated like a criminal .
' In South London we all know how many stabbings there have been , and I think the police should be busy catching the real bad people . '
Mr Green said he handed his pictures to a deputy headmaster at the nearby Nautical School , and was promised the matter would be investigated .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force had no record of the incident .
Last week , the Daily Mail reported that a father was told by a play equipment supervisor he was not allowed to take pictures of his own children on a slide .
Sitting in her little house near Tarbes , in the French Pyrenees , Marie - Pierre Manet - Beauzac is talking about her ancestry .
For most people this would be agreeable , perhaps even pleasurable .
For the 40 - something mother - of - three , the story of her bloodline is marked with a unique sadness : because she belongs to an extraordinary tribe of hidden pariahs , repressed in France for a thousand years .
Marie - Pierre is a Cagot .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
If the word " Cagot " means nothing to you , that is not surprising .
The history of the Cagot people is obscure ; some assert it has been deliberately erased .
Marie certainly believes that : " To talk about the Cagots is still a bad thing in the mountains .
The French are ashamed of what they did to us , the Cagots are ashamed of what they were .
That is why no one , these days , will confess they are of Cagot descent . "
Except , uniquely , for Marie - Pierre herself .
She is probably the only person in the world willing to admit she is of Cagot blood .
But it took her many years to realise what that meant .
" When I first had children , I wanted to know where they came from – which means where I came from .
And so I started researching , I traced my family tree back through the generations – through many villages and towns in the Pyrenees .
" And that 's when I noticed certain names and trades in my background , lots of humble carpenters , basket - makers , poor people , people who lived in the ' wrong ' parts of town .
Soon I realised I was a Cagot .
Though many argue what that really means . "
As Marie - Pierre avers , the truth about the Cagots is obscure .
The people first emerge in documents around the 13th century .
By then they are already regarded as an inferior caste , the " untouchables " of western France , or northern Spain .
In medieval times the Cagots – also knows as Agotes , Gahets , Capets , Caqueux , etc – were divided from the general peasantry in several ways .
They had their own urban districts : usually on the malarial side of the river .
These dismal ghettoes were known as Cagoteries ; traces of them can still be found in Pyrenean communities such as Campan or Hagetmau .
For hundreds of years , Cagots were treated as different and inferior .
In the churches , they had to use their own doors ( at least 60 Pyrenean churches still boast " Cagot " entrances ) ; they had their own fonts ; and they were given communion on the end of long wooden spoons .
Marie - Pierre adds : " When a Cagot came into a town , they had to report their presence by shaking a rattle .
Just like a leper , ringing his bell . "
Daily Cagot life was likewise marked by apartheid .
Cagots were forbidden to enter most trades or professions .
They were forced , in effect , to be the drawers of water and hewers of wood .
So they made barrels for wine and coffins for the dead .
They also became expert carpenters : ironically they built many of the Pyrenean churches from which they were partly excluded .
Some of the other prohibitions on the Cagots were bizarre .
They were not allowed to walk barefoot , like normal peasants , which gave rise to the legend that they had webbed toes .
Cagots could not use the same baths as other people .
They were not allowed to touch the parapets of bridges .
When they went about , they had to wear a goose 's foot conspicuously pinned to their clothes .
Marie - Pierre sighs .
" The Cagots were n't even allowed to eat alongside non-Cagots , nor share their dishes .
Some said the Cagots were psychotic , even cannibals . "
As for marriage between Cagots and non-Cagots , it was almost impossible .
Nonetheless , love affairs across the divide did occur – there are poignant songs from the 16th and 17th centuries lamenting these tragic misalliances .

On occasions , the bigotry was brutally enforced : in the early 18th century a prosperous Cagot in the Landes was caught using the font reserved for non-Cagots – his hand was chopped off and nailed to the church door .
Another Cagot who dared to farm his fields ( strictly verboten ) had his feet pierced with hot iron spikes .
" If there was any crime in a village , " says Marie - Pierre , " the Cagot was usually blamed .
Some were actually burned at the stake . "
Even in death , the discrimination persisted – the Cagots were buried in their own humble cemeteries ; there is still one in Bentayou - Sérée , a tiny village north of Pau .
So where did the Cagots originate ?
And why did they suffer such bigotry ?
Their provenance is opaque .
That is partly because the Cagots themselves have disappeared from view .
During the French Revolution , the laws against Cagots were formally abandoned – indeed many Cagots pillaged local archives and erased any record of their ancestry .
After 1789 , the Cagots slowly assimilated into the general populace ; many may have even emigrated .
Nonetheless , there are historical accounts that afford an intriguing glimpse .
Contemporary sources describe them as being short , dark and stocky .
Confusingly , some others saw them as blonde and blue eyed .
Francisque Michel 's Histoire des races maudites ( History of the cursed races , 1847 ) , was one of the first studies .
He found Cagots had " frizzy brown hair " .
He also found at least 10,000 Cagots still scattered across Gascony and Navarre , still suffering repression – nearly 70 years after the Cagot caste was " abolished " .
Since Michel 's pioneering work , various historians have tried to solve the Cagot mystery .
One theory is that they were lepers , or contagious cretins .
That would explain the rules against Cagots " touching " anything used by non-Cagots .
However , this theory falls down on the many descriptions of the Cagots being perfectly healthy , even sturdy .
Another idea , as Marie - Pierre implies , is that the Cagots were slaves of the Goths who inundated France in the Dark Ages .
From here , etymologists have deduced that " ca-got " comes from " cani Gothi " – " dogs of the Goths " .
But that idea fails to explain the many variants of the Cagot name , nor does it square with the geographical distribution .
In fact , the Cagot name probably derives from " cack " or " caca " , a term of abuse in itself .
Last year , a new theory emerged , propounded by the British writer Graham Robb in his book The Discovery of France .
Robb suggests that the Cagots were originally a guild of skilled medieval woodworkers ; in this light , the bigotry against them was commercial rivalry , which became fossilised and regimented over time .
So who is right ?
It 's a confusing picture .
But Marie - Pierre Manet - Beauzac , " the last Cagot in the world " , has no doubts where she comes from : " I believe the Cagots are descendants of Moorish soldiers left over from the 8th century Muslim invasion of Spain and France .
That 's why some people called them ' Saracens ' .
I am quite dark , and my daughter Sylvia is the darkest in her class . "
And her theory , of the Cagots being converted but still - distrusted Muslims , is supported by many French experts : because it neatly explains the religious disapproval of the Cagots .
As for the geographical spread , that 's probably linked to the St James pilgrim routes .
Marie - Pierre shows me a website where she is gathering information about Cagot life .
She points to a list of villages associated with Les Agotes .
" Some like to say Cagots have disappeared .
But this is not true .
If you travel near Campan , for instance , you can still see the short , swarthy people descended from the Cagots .
The ' pestiferous people ' . "
I ask Marie - Pierre if she will let me use a picture of Sylvia – and the rest of her children .
She shakes her head .
" I 'm sorry but no .
It is OK for me to admit where I come from .
But if people knew about my children 's background , it might be difficult for them . "
She gazes out of the window , at the distant green Pyrenees .
" In some places , the hatred lingers .
Even now .
The Cagots may be silent but I can still hear it . "
Other vanishing peoples
The Aromanians / the Vlachs
Whilst they date back to the Roman colonisation and its people are spread across much of the Southern Balkans , their language , Aromanian , closely related to Romanian , is believed to be almost extinct .
Evidence of the culture lives on ; with festivals celebrated in Greece today .
The Rusyns
1.2 million Rusyns are estimated to be living in Europe with over half the population in Ukraine .
Ethnically not recognized by the Ukraine due to Czechoslovakia 's communist regime of the 1950's , a time when their Greek Catholic Church was also eradicated .
The people are famed for their beautiful wooden churches and ethnic pride is on the rise in Slovakia where they also dwell .
The Sami
The indigenous population also known as Laps are spread across northern Sweden , Norway and Finland , the tribe have populated Scandinavia and Russia for at least 2,500 years .
Strongly associated with reindeer herding which continues today , with just under 3,000 still practising in Norway .
Hurtling through space 31 years after its launch , the Voyager 2 spacecraft has sent back the most detailed view yet of the shock wave that marks the thinning of the solar wind , the charged particles streaming from the sun .
Researchers say the crossing confirms that the heliosphere — the region swept out by the solar wind — is actually lopsided , perhaps due to a tilted magnetic field in local interstellar space .
The shock wave , or heliospheric termination shock , occurs when the supersonic wind thins to the point that it can no longer rebuff the denser haze of charged particles flowing through interstellar space .
Instead , the solar wind suddenly collapses in on itself .
Researchers say the phenomenon is sort of like the edge of a stream of tap water after it hits the sink [ see image ] .
Solar wind is swept along by the sun 's magnetic field , which means it cascades like a fluid instead of crashing like billiard balls .
Data from Voyager 2 , described in a series of papers today in Nature , show that the craft entered the termination shock on August 31 , 2007 , at a distance from the sun of about eight billion miles ( 13 billion kilometers ) and crossed it the next day .
That 's 10 percent closer to the sun than when the craft 's sister ship , Voyager 1 , passed through the same shock wave in late 2004 heading outbound from the solar system in a different direction .
That far from the sun , the density of solar wind is , at most , a couple of protons and electrons per gallon , astrophysicist J.R. Jokipii of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson says .
" It 's almost impossible to measure .
You have to give it to these experimenters , " he says .
Voyager 2 will now follow its twin into the heliosheath , the region of slower - moving wind beyond the termination shock .
Besides confirming earlier research that hinted at the lopsided heliosphere , the crossing provides new details , including the energy and speed of the solar wind , that Voyager 1 could not pick up because its plasma detection instrument had stopped functioning .
According to the new data , the wind downstream of the shock was cooler and faster moving than researchers had anticipated .
The interpretation , says Jokippi , who wrote an editorial accompanying the Nature reports , is that the solar wind is imparting energy to neutral atoms from the interstellar gas and causing them to ionize .
These " pickup " ions are then accelerated to speeds of hundreds of miles ( kilometers ) per second , exerting a strong effect on the structure of the shock , he says .
The twin Voyager craft set out for deep space in 1977 to study Jupiter and Saturn , but after their primary mission was completed , they kept on going .
In 10 to 20 years after reaching the termination shock , NASA expects the craft to cross the heliopause , the outer edge of the heliosheath .
That would mean they have exited the solar system and entered the interstellar medium .
NASA engineers estimate that both probes ' plutonium power packs have the potential to keep them broadcasting data until 2025 .
If we 're lucky , Jokippi says , they 'll let us know what they find .
Vista or Linux – Lookout before you decide your new home .
( source : Zopeuse )
Linux enthusiasts have always touted for Linux to be one of the best operating systems ever .
Their voice grew shriller with the advent of Microsoft Windows Vista in the market .
There have been quite a few times that a serious problem , posted in some of the forums by a Windows system admin is responded by some enthusiasts in a single phrase — “ Install Linux ” !
This may not be the right solution for the concerned person but it indicates the evangelism aura , Linux has in its periphery .
The reasons for such findings are legion – A high price tag for Vista , problems associated with the support of legacy applications on Vista , etc .
Without getting into much details , we shall today try and see 5 major reasons why people who prefer Linux over Windows Vista do so .
1. Hardware Requirements :
It ’s never too much for Vista !
Linux does n’t require a lot of memory or a good graphics card to get running .
However , Vista ’s system requirements are high .
This is evident for the fact that for bare minimum , it needs a processor which is at least a Pentium 4 with 512 MB of RAM .
However , you bet if you can run things seamlessly on a Vista machine with a RAM anywhere less than 1GB , which is recommended by Microsoft itself !
Vista needs at least 64 MB video RAM and takes up at least 6 GB of disk space .
Usually , a Linux distro with a graphical user interface takes up around 1.5 - 3 GB of disk space .
You may do the mathematics now !
Vista ’s Aero and the GUI as a whole looks pretty indeed , but somehow it fails to make things simple and easy .
Does it help find things any faster than Google Desktop Search app or other alternatives which are available for Windows and Linux both ?
Or does it make an application run any faster ?
On the other side , it consumes a lot of memory resources , hence slowing down the system , drastically at times .
Just to give you an example of resource utilization , Vista uses 256MB of memory just for screen rendering !
That is not a minuscule amount considering just graphics .
2. Rights & Limitations : Unlike Vista , Linux does n’t restrict how content is used on a system .
Windows Vista comes with an in - built digital rights management ( DRM ) feature that is absent on Linux machines .
The DRM features can cause a lot of problems like – technical support problems , sluggish behavior of the computer , conflict with the peripheral devices and software .
The fix for this may be as simple as an online upgrade or as complex as replacing the hardware !
A common example for his is Vista having copy protection technology for HD - DVD and Blu-ray disks .
High - quality output paths like audio and video are reserved for protected peripheral devices .
This means artificial degradation of the output quality .
On most of the Linux distributions , music and movies shall play seamlessly provided you have the correct encoders installed .
The software — free and open source — will get installed and run .
Linux follows a policy which does n’t interfere with legitimate fair - use rights for the content owned by users .
However , Vista ’s DRM can interfere with all kinds of computer use , including the ones that have nothing to do with digital rights .
This again costs the precious CPU resource as Vista is continually monitoring itself to ensure compliance .
3 . There is no Linux Genuine Advantage !
You ’d have surely co-related this to Windows Genuine Advantage and you ’ve got it right !
Linux shall continue to work and upgrade without bothering to know the origin of the software .
You may get it from some of the repositories or compile it from source , there is no risk of losing functionality .
Windows Vista , on the other hand , relies on Windows Genuine Advantage servers to verify the serial number of the product .
If the servers go down , as it did last year , Vista users worldwide are locked out of their computers running legitimate copies of Windows Vista .
This shall probably never happen with Linux !
4. Security Issues :
You can never miss out on this .
Anti-virus and anti-spyware applications are mandatory on Vista machines to prevent things getting worse , unlike Linux boxes where you essentially need not have one .
The prime reason for Linux being secure is because malware developers specifically target Windows operating systems ( Vista being the latest of them all ) and Windows based applications .
Hence , the Linux users do not have to worry about spyware or malware ( dll , exe ) which they would have downloaded inadvertently .
5 . You name it , you have it !
The increasing number of available applications for Linux have made it easier to get away from the propriety Windows applications .
Few examples include OpenOffice which offers standards - compliant document formats and is widely used today for it being free !
The next big thing is Firefox , which needs no introduction .
Most Linux distros come bundled with the latest stable release of Firefox .
How many Windows users actually use IE today ?
Vista is still shipped with a sole picture editor application – MS Paint .
Most of us were kids since we ’ve been seeing it the way it is today !
Contrary to this , most Linux distros come with GIMP , a powerful application which is far better than MS Paint and similar to Adobe Photoshop in terms of it features .
These were the few first hand differences you might consider before spending that hefty amount which Windows Vista comes with a tag of !
You may try out a distro based on Choice of Linux Distros or log -on to DistroWatch to have an in - depth knowledge about your favorite distros .

It 's quite possible to make your living from the internet without really considering how it 's constructed .
I came across this talking with my friend Aaron .
He 's a bright guy but like many people he assumes the net is done " with satellites or whatever " , or never think about it .
The general structure of the internet pretty similar to the global air network .
Picture those glowing arcs connecting cities on the back of airline magazines .
Then recall the hour you spent in line before boarding , the hour spent driving to the airport , the two hours from the big hub airport to the smaller city you really want to go to , and how relieved you are to be traveling now instead of last week when a storm in Chicago somehow messed up flights to Los Angeles .
That 's basically how your data feels , too .
The internet is , in fact , a series of tubes .
Very fragile tubes .
The long - haul cables that run the global economy are less than 2 inches in diameter , buried under railroad tracks , highways , or ocean sediment .
Within densely - settled areas the network is relatively redundant .
But between countries and across oceans and mountains , data flows through an uncomfortably small set of bottlenecks .
Any minor disaster can damage large portions of the 'net .
In 2004 the Miami / Sao Paulo traffic was suddenly re-routed through Washington DC , then New York , then across the ocean to Brussels ( ! ) , then back to SP .
As late as 1998 , a train wreck or wildfire in northern Florida could cut off large parts of Latin America for days .
This year Suez suffered multiple failures and re-routing flooded the already overloaded Europe - Asia network for several weeks .
Even on a good day you can see the problem .
Look at how a packet of data might travel from San Francisco to Hong Kong :
( start )
Folsom St , San Francisco ( 1 mile )
Pine St , San Francisco ( 2 miles )
Pine St , San Francisco
Oakland , CA ( 10 miles )
Sacramento , CA ( 80 miles )
San Jose , CA ( 120 miles )
Oakland , CA ( 40 miles )
San Jose , CA ( 40 miles )
Hong Kong ( 7,000 miles )
( finish )
That poor little packet of data rattled all around California , looking for an uncongested cable over the Pacific .
For each hop , a decision is made to send it on to some other place that may have better luck .
The system works pretty well under stress which is good because stress is there all of the time .
The internet is a map of trade volume between cities .
This is actually true for all forms of high - volume transport , so there is a lot of history to learn from .
Infrastructure is insanely expensive and slow to build even though it almost always pays off in the long run .
Short hops between financial / military / political / industrial hubs tend to get built up first .
Just look at how many ways there are to travel between New York , Boston , and DC , for example .
Or look at area codes .
At the time the precursor to the modern phone system was built , dialing a 1 took 1/9th the time of dialing a 9 .
Silly , but true .
So there was a premium on lower numbers .
New York 's area code was 212 , DC 202 , Los Angeles 310 , Chicago 312 .
El Paso , Texas ?
915 . Anchorage , Alaska ?
907 .
Miami was definitely not a hub at the time , but it was important to the Navy and Air Force .
Miami 's code is 305 .
So if several factors of demography , geography , and politics align , there may form a route of sufficient capacity between two points .
If not , too bad .
It takes years to build up demand , more years to begin the project , and more and more years to finish it .
There are bribes , labor riots , sabotage , political chicanery , etc .
The first trans - continental rail link in the US was completed in 1869 .
Twenty years earlier , people had been hijacking ships in Louisiana to sail around South America and crash - land ashore at San Francisco .
The same dramas play out when cables are planned and laid .
The connection between Seattle and Tokyo is excellent .
Ciudad Mexico and Dallas ?
Fairly new and really fast .
New York to London ?
World - class .
But try to get an email from Barcelona to Bangalore , and often you 'll find that it routes through America .
Companies are scrambling to build up Europe - Asia links .
They 've been scrambling since the late 1980's , and it will be some time before they get there .
The internet is not a magic leprechaun .
Even if there were n't these human problems there are still fundamental ones .
Let 's imagine a perfectly balanced world - wide network .
You have an internet business based in San Francisco .
Your people are in SF , your technology suppliers are in SF , most of your customers are in the United States .
You have a small but growing customer base in Hong Kong and China .
We have a perfect ' net , so there are no silly congestion problems and there is just as much bandwidth across oceans as between cities .
Rack space in HK is twice the price as in SF .
So what is the no-brainer place to put your next server farm , hire people to maintain it , set up office space , pay property and business taxes , etc ?
Correct .
Hong Kong .
No matter how good the internet gets it will never be faster than a small fraction of the speed of light .
Recently I was looking at the server logs of a site located in the US .
The response times had a very high variance , which indicates a severe bottleneck somewhere .
After a lot of poking around , trying to find the problem within the server farm , I had the bright idea to segment the logs by source country .
And there it was : the response times were all over the map because the users were all over the map .
From the perspective of the 'net , Stockholm and Singapore are just down the block while India and Sao Paulo are past the moon .
Rules of thumb :
- Light takes about 100 milliseconds to travel 10,000 miles and back .
- A network packet on a good route may take 3 to 10 times that long .
- A network packet has not " arrived " until a return acknowledgment has been sent all the way back .
- The longer and more complicated the route from here to there , the higher the chance ( often more than 10 % ! ) that a packet will get lost .
- The larger the file you send , the more packets it has to be chopped up into , the more likely one will be lost and have to be re-transmitted .
All else being equal the transit time of a file increases more than linearly to its size .
Forget Ben Stiller 's movie " Night at the Museum " with the gigantic CG T - Rex skeleton chasing him around .
This time there is adinosaur roaming the halls of the LA Museum of Natural History .
I believe this is the same method of costume and puppetry used by the folks at the " Walking With Dinosaurs " show with live actors in the dinosaurs giving it a more realistic feeling and puppet artists moving the arms , mouth , and eyes .
I wish more museums would have dinosaurs walking about because I used to love visiting the gigantic skeletons when I was a kid .
And whenever my family was traveling I would force them to take me to the city museum so I could see the dinosaur exhibition for myself .
And now the chance to see one walking around in real life would certainly make my day as an adult .
I love how the kids find it so believable that they are either so fascinated by it or terrified by such a giant creature with rows of sharp teeth in front of them .
Here 's hoping for the day when we can clone dinosaurs as pets ... until then visit your local museum and demand them to get puppet dinosaurs !
Not only will the kids will love them but it will also attract new visitors to see the cool exhibitions and provide much needed funding to museums .

The panda cub was rejected by its mother
Enlarge Image
A Dutch tabby cat has adopted a red panda cub , which was abandoned by its mother at a zoo in the Netherlands .
The adult panda , Gladys , rejected two cubs after they were born on 30 June .
The Artis zoo in Amsterdam initially kept them both on an incubator .
But the zookeeper 's cat had just given birth to four kittens , and allowed the pandas to join the litter .
One of the cubs died last week .
Red pandas are a rare species only distantly related to giant pandas .
When fully grown , they are not much bigger than a domestic cat .
" The young panda is doing well in the circumstances , " the zoo said in a statement .
" For it to survive , it is very important that it gets enough food and grows .
We will see if this is the case over the next few weeks . "
The cub does not have a name yet , but the zoo says that anyone willing to sponsor her will be allowed to name her .
The red panda is an endangered species that lives in Himalayan regions in China , Bhutan , Nepal , India , and Burma .
Newswise —
When it comes to the attractiveness of orthodontic braces , less metal is better , according to a recent survey .
The study of the public 's attitude about the attractiveness of various styles of braces indicates that the types of dental appliances with no visible metal were considered the most attractive .
Braces that combine clear ceramic brackets with thin metal or clear wires were a less desirable option , and braces with metal brackets and metal wires were rated as the least aesthetic combination .
" The paradox is that the more aesthetic these dental appliances are , the more difficult they are to manage for the orthodontist , " said senior study author Henry Fields , professor and division chair of orthodontics at Ohio State University .
" But those are what people like the most . "
The survey did not ask respondents about the attractiveness of decorative and colorful elastic modules that attach the wires to the braces , which have become popular among some teen - agers in the past few years .
The study findings were published in a recent issue of the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics .
Fields and colleagues questioned 200 adults using a computer - based survey that presented standardized images of teeth with a variety of orthodontic appliances .
The images did not show the patients ' faces , so the attractiveness of the person wearing the appliances was not a factor .
Respondents were asked to rate the appliances using a range from " extremely unattractive " to " extremely attractive " on a scale of 1 to 100 .
The responses fell into three clear categories , Fields said .
The stainless steel appliances were considered the least attractive , with average ratings hovering between about 25 and 40 on the 100 - point scale .
Ceramic appliances , which are often clear or tooth - colored and less visible than metal , received average ratings of between about 55 and 70 on the scale .
Ceramic brackets with clear or white wires were considered more attractive than ceramic brackets with metal wires .
Clear tooth trays and teeth with no visible appliances ranked as the most attractive , with the average of most scores exceeding 90 .
Appliances called lingual braces are invisible because they are applied behind the teeth , creating the appearance of appliance - free teeth .
The researchers collected demographic information on the adult respondents , but any differences in demographic influences were insignificant in the overall analysis .
" The general trends of appliance attractiveness are universal , " Fields said .
" The stainless steel that we like to use , which is the most durable and efficient , is often ranked the lowest in attractiveness .
These braces do n't wear out and you can get total control with them .
" The most aesthetic ones , the trays , have limitations on the types of movements you can make and forces you can deliver , and the efficiency .
And the ceramics sometimes have breakage problems , and they tend to just be a little bit more delicate . "
Standard braces consist of metal or ceramic brackets that are cemented to each tooth .
A metal wire is laced through each bracket to exert force on the teeth to correct their placement .
Braces are used to tip teeth in one direction or another , to rotate one or several teeth , or to shift the location of a tooth forward , backward , sideways , up or down in the mouth .
Each kind of correction requires specific manipulation of the wires in the brackets , and some require specially shaped wires to perform the task .
Fields said the ideal is to move teeth about 1 millimeter , a little less than the thickness of a dime , every four weeks .
The clear tray appliances reposition multiple teeth in tiny increments of about a quarter of a millimeter every two weeks , he said .
Patients receive an assortment of trays that they change every two weeks .
They wear the trays all day and night , removing them to eat and brush their teeth .
Adults make up about one in four patients being fitted with braces , Fields said .
And adults may be more concerned about aesthetics of braces than are adolescents , who , if they require braces , typically get them between the ages of 10 and 13 .
Fields said some kids tend to go a different route , thinking of their braces as accessories that should be enhanced rather than hidden .
" Some of the kids are going for braces made in the shape of a star , or have colors put on the ties that hold the wires to their brackets , " he said .
" Some people are decorating their braces . "
He and colleagues are also exploring attitudes about how much patients are willing to pay for more expensive dental appliances .
The more aesthetically pleasing options often are more costly , as well .
The group 's data suggest that adults are willing to pay several hundred dollars extra for more attractive appliances for themselves or their children .
Fields conducted the attractiveness survey with James Ziuchkovski , a former Ohio State dentistry resident now in private practice ; William Johnston of Ohio State 's Section of Restorative and Prosthodontics ; and Delwin Lindsey of Ohio State 's Department of Psychology .
This work was supported by Delta Dental , a dental benefits carrier .
KGBT4 :
BROWNSVILLE , TEXAS ( AP ) -- A Los Fresnos family is going to court to prevent a Cameron County justice of the peace from ordering spankings in his courtroom .
A lawsuit filed today alleges Justice of the Peace Gustavo " Gus " Garza told a 14 - year - old girl 's stepfather to strike her repeatedly on the buttocks in open court .
If he did n't , the judge said the girl would be found guilty and fined $ 500 for truancy .
The lawsuit by Mary Vasquez and her husband , Daniel Zurita , described the paddle provided by Garza as large and heavy and fashioned from a thick piece of lumber .
In an affidavit , Zurita says that when he was through , the judge told him he had not struck the girl hard enough .

A growing number of countries have bans on smoking in public places
A tobacco smoking ban has come into effect in cafes , bars and restaurants in the Netherlands .
The country is following a growing trend across Europe and the world of bans on smoking in public places .
Pro-smoking lobbyists say the ban will lead to a drop in business , but others say any losses will be made up by non-smokers going out more .
Patrons of cannabis cafes will still be allowed to smoke marijuana as long as it is not mixed with tobacco .
Possession of cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands , but holders of small amounts are not prosecuted .
Smoking cannabis is permitted in licensed cafes .
A Rotterdam cinema handed out free cigarettes on Monday night , hours before the ban came into force on Tuesday .
One hospitality industry forecast said there has been an increase in the number of businesses up for sale ahead of the ban , as owners anticipated slower business because of smokers staying away from restaurants , cafes and bars .
But other studies suggested that their numbers would be replaced by non-smokers going out more to enjoy a night out in a cleaner environment .
Any businesses caught allowing customers to smoke would be warned and repeat offenders would face escalating fines , Chris Krikken , a spokesman for the Food and Wares Authority charged with enforcing the ban , told the Associated Press .
DIGG THIS
There are some writers in politics whose prose seems to overcome the limits of the passage of time and the coldness of the printed word , writers whose thoughts are so scintillating that reading them causes you to lose track of where you are and who you are and become part of their very thought processes , and leave you changed .
Your heart races as you read , you see things a new way , and you marvel at their capacity for framing the debate in a way that has eluded the whole of the mainstream political culture .
I have to count Garet Garrett among those writers .
And I ’m reminded of this after having read Insatiable Government , the title essay of a new collection of some of Garrett ’s best writing , as edited by Bruce Ramsey .
Actually I ’m not entirely sure what it means to refer to his “ best writing , ” since that is just about everything he wrote between The Driver in 1922 and The Wild Wheel in 1954 should be considered classic .
And yet this essay , which has been unnoticed for three quarters of a century , should somehow stand out .
It was written in 1932 : as an attack on the Hoover administration .
You know President Hoover , the guy who the textbooks say did nothing to stop the worsening depression .
We are told that he did n’t take the problem seriously and instead trusted market forces to work themselves out .
We are told that he let the banks fall , the unemployment lines lengthen , the business sector collapse , and , stuck in his 19th century frame of mind , did nothing that he should have done .
It took the white knight named FDR to show up and take charge , using emergency powers and Keynesian theory to save the day .
Okay , if so , consider this from Garrett in 1932 .
He presumes that Hoover is using every power available to him to do precisely what the historians claim that FDR started .
More profoundly , Garrett observes that success in these endeavors would be far worse than failure , because it would establish the principle that government should grow without end .
I know that long quotes are not reader friendly but this is irresistible .
Thank goodness for Bruce Ramsey for highlighting it and bringing it back to public attention .
There is a crisis in the economics of human welfare .
The intention is to overcome it .
If truly it could be overcome by the use of public credit , no objection on the ground of precedent or political theory would long prevail .
Public credit belongs to the people as a whole and they may do anything with it they like .
Therefore , as to these ideas — any and all of them — there are only two questions :
First , will they work ?
Nobody can answer that .
Nobody knows what lies in the future .
Sometime the tide , of itself , will rise again .
We take that for granted .
Therefore these unprecedented uses of the public credit now being made , and proposed to be made , are to meet a crisis that must soon pass .
President Hoover says : " I have no taste for any such emergency powers in the Government .
But we are fighting the economic consequences of overliquidation and unjustified fear as to the future of the United States .
The battle to set our economic machine in motion in this emergency takes new forms and requires new tactics from time to time .
We used such emergency powers to win the war ; we can use them to fight the depression . "
But the risk is real .
If the natural level of economic recovery were long delayed , then all these measures would very soon fail in the total ruin of public credit .
Yet suppose differently .
Suppose they did work , the tide rising to save and redeem them , and that we should be able to perform the terrific gymnastic feat of getting back our equilibrium
What then ?
Well , in that case we should have established certain things in the way anything is established by the fact of its having once been done before , such as these :
That when the industrial rhythm breaks and there is a crisis in employment , it becomes a function of government to provide people with work ; thus responsibility for unemployment comes at rest not upon industry , where we had thought it belonged , but upon government the state — and must be charged to the public credit .
That when from bad banking , wild speculation , senseless credit inflation , or no matter from what cause , the private banking structure seems about to fall , it becomes a function of government to support it with public credit , not particularly to save the banks , but to save depositors .
Thus responsibility for the solvency of banking as a whole passes to the government .
That when railroads , in a crisis , are unable to meet their interest charges , it becomes a function of government to save them with loans of public credit , as through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , not for the sake of any railroad as such , but because if the railroads go bankrupt the savings banks , the insurance companies and many thousands of investors who hold railroad bonds will be hurt .
That when liquidation of commodities and securities has gone too far it becomes the business of government to stop it , using public credit by such means as it may think fit .
That when prices are too low — prices taken all together — it becomes a function of government to manipulate them back to where they belong .
This it will do by inflating money and credit .
And it follows by necessity that certain functions of government are assumed , as , for example , the wisdom to know when a crisis is such a crisis , to know when liquidation has gone far enough , when prices are too low , when they are high enough again , how many bank failures constitute a crisis in banking , how many railroad failures constitute a crisis in railroad credit , and so on .
Whether this would be all for the best , or otherwise , is not yet the point .
There cannot even be a discussion of it until we see clearly where we are going .
It may be that industry cannot accept responsibility for unemployment ; if so , perhaps the government must .
It may be that in a crisis finance cannot any longer be responsible for its own solvency , nor business for its own continuity .
It may be that we are done with the anarchy of prices which we have so long justified by supposing a law of supply and demand .
But if these things are true , and if now in any crisis such responsibilities must pass to the government , we have gone far unawares toward an experimental state we know nothing of by experience , almost nothing of by theory .
That is to say , we have not consciously intended it .
We have not considered what kind of state that would be , much less to decide if we want it .
It is clear , however , that in passing these responsibilities to government we should be exchanging freedom for something else as yet unnamed ….
There are many aspects of government .
The one least considered is what may be called the biological aspect , in which government is like an organism with such an instinct for growth and self - expression that if let alone it is bound to destroy human freedom — not that it might wish to do so but that it could not in nature do less .
No government ever wants less government … that is , less of itself .
No government ever surrenders power , even its emergency powers — not really .
It may mean to surrender them , but on the first new occasion it will take them all back .
One of the American Government ’s wartime powers was the War Finance Corporation .
The present Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a revival of that power in time of peace .
And so it goes .
Observe that in time of prosperity government is bound to extend itself because revenues are plenty and there is always a purblind demand for special benefits to be conferred by public credit .
If now it is established that in time of depression government must extend itself even faster , prodigiously , in order to meet the responsibilities which we are so willing to pass to it by default , then the growth of government will be uninterruptible , without time or season , and the last problem of all is how people shall defend themselves against it .
Already the cost of government is absorbing , roughly , one - quarter of the total national income .
One day ’s work in every four belongs to government .
We speak here of all government — national , state , city and local — from Washington above down to the counties , townships , boroughs and districts , all exercising the tax power .
As the total national income falls , the proportion of it absorbed by government will rise .
It must rise because government is the one thing that cannot be liquidated or deflated in time of economic depression .
To the contrary , as we have seen , it must extend itself to meet new responsibilities .
Therefore , taxes must be increased , first in order to provide as much public revenue as before , and then further increased to provide more revenue than before .
Thus , in bad times like these , the proportion of the total national income absorbed by government will rise in a special manner .
He continues to warn about what all this would mean in our future : Leviathan unchecked , killing the country and everything it has produced and stands for as a matter of principle .
Now , can you point to any other American writer of his then - prominence who spoke so presciently ?
No one .
They had to silence the great Garrett .
But he is silent no more !
