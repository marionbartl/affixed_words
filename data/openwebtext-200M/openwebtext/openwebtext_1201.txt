Der Moderator spricht von den „ Schäden , die das das Internet anrichtet “ ; eine „ Kinderschützerin “ behauptet , es gäbe vier Millionen Websites mit Kinderpornographie ; die Polizistin spricht von einer „ Schwarzen Liste “ mit 1400 Einträgen – und keiner merkt , dass da irgendetwas nicht stimmt .
Am Dienstag lief auf arte eine die Sendung „ Zur Sache “ , in der sich Persönlichkeiten mit „ aktuellen Fragen auseinandersetzen “ .
Thema war „ Die Rechte der Kinder “ ( hier als Videostream ) , anlässlich des 20 .
Jahrestags der UN - Kinderrechtskonvention am 20 .
November .
Im letzten Drittel geht es auch übers Internet : Der Moderator Patrick Poivre d'Arvor leitete den Teil ein mit der Behauptung , dass das Internet großen Schaden anrichten würde .
Offenbar bei denjenigen , die es selbst nicht kapieren – denn wie ist sonst die Behauptung von Valérie Wertheimer , der Präsidentin von Action Innocence , zu deuten ?
Sie behauptete , es gäbe 750.000 Pädophile , „ die jeden Tag ins Internet gehen “ – und es gäbe quasi für deren Befriedigung vier Millionen Websites , auf denen „ immer gewalttätigere “ Fotos und Filmaufnahmen von immer jüngeren Kindern dargestellt würden .
Woher sie ihre Zahlen hat sagt sie natürlich nicht .
Arte zeigt in einer Einblendung unter der Überschrift „ Die Gefahren des Internets “ : „ 480.000 Kinderpornografische Internetseiten “ .
Der Moderator wundert sich nicht über diesen Unterschied von fast Faktor zehn .
Anschließend berichtet kurz die Polizistin Adeline Champagnat über unterschiedliche Tätertypen um dann zu der französischen „ Schwarzen Liste “ umzuschwenken : „ unsere offizielle Blacklist in Frankreich umfasst 1400 Websites “ .
Warum fällt niemand die Diskrepanz zu den vier Millionen auf ?
Auf jeden Fall : Das passende Gesetz sei in Vorbereitung .
Während der ganzen Sendung verliert niemand auch nur ein Wort darüber , dass der eigentliche Skandal am Vorbild Deutschland darin liegt , dass Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen weiterhin die Verbreitung von kinderpornographischen Darstellungen duldet anstatt die Entfernung zu erleichtern .
Und wofür ?
Für ihre Wahlkampfshow .
Nun kann man sich aber gut vorstellen , wie diese ganzen Forderungen zustande kommen .
Da werden Zahlen aus dem luftleeren Raum hervorgezaubert von Leuten , deren Job der kommerzielle Kinderschutz ist .
Leute , die vom Internet keine Ahnung haben reden mit und haben große Angst vor dem unbekannten Wesen .
Zum Beispiel vor den hunderte Millionen Accounts , die bei Facebook angemeldet sein sollen .
„ Ich finde das ist schon angsteinflößend , was da alles passieren kann “ sagt Cecilia Weldone , eine dänische Immobilienmaklerin .
Und damit sie überprüfen kann was ihre Kinder machen wenn sie online sind , hat auch ihren eigenen Facebook - Account .
Es ist ein grausames Herumgestammel , und natürlich merken die Leute nicht , welchen Schaden sie anrichten .
Und alles wird in einen Topf geworfen .
Kinderpornographie , das ( angeblich ) massenhaft auftauchende Phänomen dass Erwachsene Kinderschänder sich ihre Opfer im Internet suchen , die Herausgabe persönlicher Daten , und die bulgarische Psychologin Vessela Banova hat noch etwas ganz furchtbares in Petto :
„ Man kann zum Beispiel neue Identitäten schaffen .
Ich hatte mit einer 13 - jährigen zusammen gearbeitet , die hatte im Internet sieben verschiedene Identitäten , um mit Jungs zu debattieren .
Und dann hat sie sich immer ausgesucht , als wer sie jetzt auftreten möchte . “
Das Fazit ist unüberhörbar : das Internet ist böse .
Auch ein bisschen toll , aber eher böse und eine große Gefahr .
Für die Kinder , weil deren Eltern nicht damit umgehen können .
Die Kinder müssen geschützt werden – und jeder vertritt das natürlich auf die eigene Weise , der eigene Job ist da natürlich der wichtigste .
Um sich vorzustellen , wer da geschützt werden soll , zum Abschluss noch ein Zitat von Valérie Wertheimer , der Frau mit den vier Millionen :

Fudged titanium could threaten next Mars rover
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : October 20 , 2009
An industry - wide concern over bad titanium could add more cost to the already over - budget $ 2.3 billion Mars Science Laboratory mission because engineers need to check the integrity of the metal used in the structure of the spacecraft , NASA officials told an agency advisory committee .
Artist 's concept of the Mars Science Laboratory , or Curiosity , rover .

" Everybody thought we were buying a ( military ) standard titanium that was properly treated for use .
It turns out it was n't worked properly , " said Doug McCuistion , director of NASA 's Mars exploration program .
The extent of the titanium inside the MSL spacecraft , also named Curiosity , is still unclear , but McCuistion said officials are taking inventory of parts to determine where the allegedly counterfeit titanium is located .
The titanium was provided by Western Titanium Inc. , a San Diego - based company that provides metals for military and space applications .
Metal believed to on MSL is apparently " improperly treated non-conforming titanium , " McCuistion told the Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council .
Most of the spacecraft is built with titanium components , according to McCuistion , and officials will have to spend the next one or two months tracking down what pieces are from the non-conforming lots .
Engineers already know an outlet elbow in a fuel tank and parts of a pressurant tank are made from the suspect titanium , but the problem could be much more widespread .
" We have to do some testing to determine what the risk of this material not being conforming is , whether it can still handle the pressures and the temperatures , whether is has the lifetime characteristics , whether it has the strength , " McCuistion said .
Western Titanium and four executives were indicted last December under eight counts of fraud involving aircraft or space vehicle parts and conspiracy to commit fraud , according to the local U.S. attorney 's office .
The indictment alleges the company and its managers issued false certifications claiming the titanium met stringent requirements specified by the government and contractors .
The suspect titanium was traced to Air Force F - 15 and F - 22 fighter jets and the C - 17 cargo plane , in addition to NASA 's Kepler telescope launched in March .
NASA officials found the titanium on Kepler met performance specifications and allowed the mission to launch as scheduled .
But extensive testing will be required to verify titanium on MSL can withstand the loads it will experience during its mission .
If the titanium is found to be unusable , ordering new parts could threaten the mission 's budget and schedule .
" This is being worked extremely hard because if we have significant pieces of equipment to replace and remanufacture , we need to find out if we have the time to do that or not , " McCuistion said .
Engineers may not finish testing on MSL 's titanium until the the middle of next year , leaving little time to replace the metal if it does not meet specifications .
" Western Titanium is one of the few providers of this material , so we know that we know that the majority of the titanium in the system comes from them , it 's just is the majority of the titanium of the lots that were non-conforming and apparently falsified .
That 's what we do n't know , " McCuistion said .
" The second step would be , OK , in those , which ones are carrying loads , which ones are not , which ones are critical applications , and then try to test that titanium to understand what it 's characteristics are and whether it 's usable in that application or not . "
Only then will officials know whether the titanium can fly with no changes .
" Just to be clear , the titanium could end up being a situation where we test the materials , we understand what they are and what the limitations of it are , and it 's all used as is .
That would be our best case , " McCuistion said .
" But right now the threat is there and it's a legal action as well , which makes it very uncomfortable . "
Jim Green , the director of NASA 's planetary science division , said the project needs additional money over the $ 400 million extra awarded earlier this year for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 .
In addition to the $ 400 million , about $ 32 million more has already been given to the mission , but up to $ 115 million in a second round of unexpected funding could be necessary over the next two years .
And that 's before accounting for the titanium , which is not currently quantifiable , officials said .
" We can accommodate additional funding beyond the $ 32 million up to a certain point before we have to consider delaying other missions , or cancellations , or other activities as we have talked about in the past , " Green said .
NASA was able to shift funding to cover MSL 's previous overrun by eliminating a technology development program for a Mars sample return mission and reducing money for a Mars lander in 2016 .
Officials did not have to cancel or delay any approved missions to give MSL the extra money earlier this year , but more overruns could force NASA to cut funding from missions under full development .
" That number is a few tens of millions beyond the $ 32 ( million ) , so if we get well into the upper range , then we will definitely have a difficult time accommodating the increase in costs , " Green said .
During a review earlier this month , senior agency managers approved plans to continue the mission .
More meetings in November and January will hopefully produce more meaningful cost estimates , officials said .
McCuistion said a recent project management shake - up has proven useful .
Peter Theisinger , former leader of the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions , replaced Richard Cook as MSL 's project manager this summer .
" I think they 're a much more disciplined , much more focused team than they were before .
They 've got a very strong systems engineering component to them that they did n't have before , " McCuistion said .
Other issues driving the rising cost include trouble with pumps inside the Curiosity rover 's sample analysis instrument and an investigation into a hard failure of a gearbox during testing .
Testing of actuators and avionics that caused the delay of MSL's launch until 2011 is also continuing , McCuistion said .
NASA has received enough actuators to launch the mission , but teams are still struggling with the motors after one unit caused the gearbox failure .
McCuistion and Green were confident MSL's other technical challenges could be resolved before its launch in the fall of 2011 .
" The titanium one is the only one that makes me a little nervous right now , " McCuistion said .
You 've probably already bought clothing with computer chips in it .
You know those big white tags that you 're supposed to cut out of the garment once you 've bought it ?
Hold one up to the light - if you see a very obvious pattern in it like the one above , then it 's got an RFID tag in it .
Now tech market research group ABI Research has released a new paper showing that three times as many clothing items will be tagged with RFIDs by the year 2014 .

RFID tags , sometimes called " smart tags , " hold a small amount of data and contain an antenna ( that 's the curly shape you see ) that allows RFID reading devices to read at that data remotely .
A reader can be a handheld device that people wave over the tag at the checkout counter , or a device hidden in a doorway that checks the tags on your clothing as you walk down the street .
According to a release about the ABI Research brief :
Previously limited to a small number of large - volume pilot tests , adoption of item - level RFID is beginning to permeate throughout the apparel sector and is increasingly evolving into full - scale implementations .
According to Liard , " While installations at Marks and Spencer in the UK , American Apparel in the US , and Charles Vögele in Switzerland remain the largest contributors to market growth , scores of companies are now in various stages of implementation .
RFID in fashion apparel is undoubtedly here and now . "

Just remember , kids , all your American Apparel clothes contain antennae that broadcast information about you .
And in 5 years , three times more " apparel items " will be likewise tagged .
Neat , right ?
Let the zombie infestation begin !

California to ban big screen tv’s
The “ guvernator ” is leading California where no state has dared before .
In a world first , big screen plasma televisions are to be banned in California because they use too much energy .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has given his backing to the move which would prohibit the sale of TV sets more than 40 inches wide .
California ’s utilities and environmental groups had urged state energy regulators to ban the most power - hungry televisions from stores as a way to lower electricity demand .
A rule before the California Energy Commission would impose the first energy - efficiency requirements for flat - screen televisions , a mandatory standard that is expected to be copied by other states .
“ The goal here is a simple one , ” Noah Horowitz , a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council , told commissioners at a hearing on Tuesday .
“ We want to ensure that every TV sold in California is an efficient one , ” Horowitz said .
A vote on the standard could come as early as next month .
Some manufacturers argue a mandatory power standard would hamper innovation , limit consumer choice and hurt California electronics retailers .
Energy commissioners say the rule could play a key role in reducing electricity use as consumers buy larger TVs .
Watching TV accounts for about 10 % of a home ’s electricity use and about 2 % of California ’s total electricity usage .
If left unchecked , the amount of electricity used by TVs is projected to rise by 8 % a year .
The LCD and plasma high definition sets can use as much as three times the power of smaller cathode ray models .
Under the rule , all TVs sold in California starting in 2013 would have to meet recently strengthened guidelines under the federal Energy Star program .
Doug Johnson , senior director of technology policy at the Consumer Electronics Association , said the commission ’s cost savings were overly optimistic and relied on data that fails to show the advancements made in TVs in recent years .

I grew up with a dog .
I remember talking with him as if he were a friend , getting happy when he wagged his tail , getting concerned when he looked bored , basically , I remember treating my dog as if he were a human , an equal .
People could tell me all day long that my dog did n’t understand what I meant when I asked how he was doing , but I knew that was n’t true .
I knew .
After all , he was a dog , a best friend .
He understood everything I said and asked , and when I punished him – “ Bad boy , Dino ! ” – for doing something inappropriate inside the house , he felt guilty for his screw up .
I had faith in my dog .
I believed he could learn and grow with me .
Together we would become better people .
Dogs are cool like that .
It ’s no wonder that with my kind of faith I have to take issue with this short write - up in the August 2009 issue of Smithsonian :
NAME : The domestic dog , Canis familiaris
LOOKS : Guilty ( e.g. , avoids eye contact , drops its tail , lies down , rolls onto its back , slinks off ) .
THINKS : Who knows ?
But a dog ’s guilty look is a reaction not to whatever the dog did , but to its owner ’s scolding , according to a study by psychologist Alexandra Horowitz of Barnard College .
One telltale bit of data : dogs gave the guilty look when their owners mistakenly thought the dogs had eaten a forbidden treat , even when the dogs were completely innocent .
More study – a lot more – is required to establish whether dogs have a conscience .
Science always tries to oust faith .
But what do you think ?
Can it be shown that dogs have a conscience ?

Larry David is a genius .
He ’s a grumpy old fart who takes sarcasm and humor to a whole new level ....
WASHINGTON -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s fat investment banking profit masks a dark underside of the U.S. recovery - the housing market is still a mess and homeowners are defaulting at an alarming rate .
Heralding what 's in store for other major banks , JPMorgan reported almost $ 3.6 - billion ( U.S. ) in profit in the third quarter - a stunning 580 - per-cent surge from the same quarter last year - cementing the perception that banks are emerging strong and healthy from the recession .
Citigroup , Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also report their results this week , and analysts expect more of the same .
Thanks to the cheap credit the Federal Reserve is flushing through the financial system , the major Wall Street banks are generating enormous bond - trading profits .
The remarkable rebound of the big U.S. banks cheered investors , who pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above the psychologically important 10,000 - point mark yesterday for the first time in nearly a year .
The Dow closed at 10,015.9 , up 144.8 points or nearly 1.5 per cent .
Look beyond Wall Street , however , and it's a different story .
Unemployment is rising , incomes are under pressure , credit is tight and Americans are still losing their homes in record numbers .
As a result , the housing market , where the recession began , continues to inflict a heavy toll on banks .
JPMorgan nearly doubled to $ 4 - billion the reserves it has set aside to cover current and future losses on home mortgages because homeowners continue to default .
The bank also boosted to nearly $ 5 - billion its reserves for credit card and retail banking losses , swelling total loan - loss reserves to $ 31.5 - billion .
That helps explain the cautious response to the bumper profits from chief executive officer Jamie Dimon .
" While we are seeing some initial signs of consumer credit stability , we are not yet certain that this trend will continue , " Mr. Dimon said .
And mortgage delinquencies remain far too high , according to chief financial officer Michael Cavanagh .
" We have to watch the economy and see where it heads , " he told reporters and analysts on a conference call .
JPMorgan is often seen as a bellwether for the banking industry .
It was among the first financial services companies to warn of an impending mortgage meltdown .
It was also the first bank to give back the U.S. government 's bailout cash .
And now it 's leading the profits comeback .
But beyond the shadow of Wall Street , there 's another banking industry , where there are no trading profits to paper over the core activity of lending to homeowners , commercial building owners and businesses .
Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo warned a congressional subcommittee yesterday that U.S. banks are still facing hefty additional credit losses , particularly in housing and commercial real estate .
" Nearly two years into a substantial recession , loan quality is poor across many asset classes and continues to deteriorate as lingering weakness in housing markets affects the performance of residential mortgages and construction loans , " Mr. Tarullo said .
" Higher loan losses are depleting loan - loss reserves at many banking organizations , necessitating large new provisions . "
U.S. consumers are increasingly late paying off mortgages on their primary home , as the highest unemployment in a quarter of a century pushes up delinquency rates on home loans and most other types of lending , according to a monthly report by the Equifax credit bureau .
Among U.S. homeowners with mortgages , a record 7.65 per cent were at least 30 days late on payments in September , up from 7.58 per cent the previous month .
The rate of delinquencies is more than double the 3.55 per cent rate in September , 2007 , according to Equifax .
For JPMorgan and the other major Wall Street banks , that 's okay because these losses are more than offset by impressive investment banking profits .
But it 's not true of many regional and second - tier banks , which do n't do bond trading or merger financing .
There is n't much of a hint of recovery yet in some of the hardest - hit real estate markets , such as South Florida .
Miami real estate agent Peter Zalewski of Condo Vultures LLC said foreclosures and home repossessions are continuing to rise , suggesting that the market still has n't hit bottom .
Speculators who bought Miami oceanfront condos were the first to run into trouble .
Now , average working Americans are in difficulty , Mr. Zalewski said .
" It 's the typical family of four with a dog who 's losing their home now , " he said .
Mr. Zalewski , who keeps an extensive database of real estate transactions , pointed out that foreclosures rose 25 per cent in the third quarter from the same period last year in south Florida .
And banks repossessed 16 per cent more properties .
" Short of government intervention or an immediate economic recovery , " that trend is likely to continue for some time , Mr. Zalewski said .
South Florida is n't the only market that 's still inflicting losses on the banks .
Economist Steve Cochrane of Moody's Economy.com said the pace of the recovery is being held back by " deeply correcting " housing markets in California , Florida and across the Southwest .
Home prices are still falling in most of the country and that 's filling the pipeline of foreclosures " nearly everywhere , " Mr. Cochrane remarked .
Where are the contrarians ?
They are the individuals who mange to ignore the herd and are able to make money in this environment , eventually , in this one directional play , the lemming LHS action !
Economic 101 is Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ adding up .
We continue to witness strong earning across the board from consumer goods , industrial and financial ’s ( Goldman reports today $ 5.25 vs. $ 4.18 ) .
With that , investor mania has been capable of pushing the Dow back through the psychological 10,000 mark and drag future oil prices above $ 75 a barrel .
There is a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœbutÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a big one !
The FOMC minutes yesterday stated that the economic recovery is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlikely to be restrainedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and that there is a strong need to keep rates low for period of time as the horizon looks uncertain .
Someone does not seem to be drinking the same Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcool aidÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Either Investors or speculators are so far offside or the Fed knows something we donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t again !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 11 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Yesterday we witnessed US retail sales declining the largest amount this year in Sept. ( - 1.5 % vs. +2.2 % , m /m ) as car sales plummeted ( - 10.4 % ) after the end of the government ’s popular Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœCash - for - ClunkersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ program .
However , ex-autos sales were better than expected ( +0.5 % vs. +0.3 % ) .
The Fed relies heavily on the consumer and who accounts for over 70 % of total consumption .
Analysts fear that with households ’ finances likely to remain constrained by falling employment , declining real incomes and tighter credit , future consumption is not considered to grow at these constant rates .
The - 1.5 % drop in retail sales in Sept. followed a + 2.2 % surge in Aug. , which was revised down from an initial estimate of + 2.7 % .
Digging deeper , ex- autos , demand at gas stations rose + 1.1 % , partially reflecting higher prices .
Excluding gas and auto sales , retail sales rose +0.4 percent in Sept .
The consumer continues to seek deep discounts before they purchase !
Other data showed that US business inventories also declined in Aug ( - 1.5 % , the largest this year ) , all on the back of sales climbing , and putting firms in a better position to increase orders going forward .
Inventory levels have been the scourge of this recession , but , companies seem to be putting themselves in a position where they can pickup production and investment after drawing down inventories at a record pace in the 1st - half of this year .
Of course the biggest factor to support sustainability is employment !
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.12 % , GBP +1.21 % , CHF +0.20 % and higher against JPY - 0.12 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.33 % and AUD +0.79 % .
The loonie is back on course and accelerating towards that psychological parity level vs. its largest trading partner .
Over the last 6 - trading sessions the currency has managed to appreciate 3.2 % vs. its southern neighbor ( the best performance of all the major trading currencies ) .
Despite stronger than expected Canadian fundamentals ( employment report last week where +31 k new jobs were created ) the demand for commodities continues to give the currency a leg up .
Yesterday , Canadian sales of new motor vehicles fell by a seasonally adjusted - 0.3 % in Aug. after a revised + 5.2 % the previous month .
Despite this , the negative dollar perception will allow the loonie to once again reach parity ( last time was in June 2008 ) , but not in a neat straight line , as this extension is somewhat technically overdone .
Option traders are pricing in a 62 % chance that this will be achieved by year end .
More bullish analysts believe it could be by the end of this month !
Technically and fundamentally there is no support for the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbig dollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Speculators believe that the pace of a global recovery may quicken .
This has risk takers coveting commodity and high yielding currencies on pull backs .
Canadian policy makers have been vocal of late expressing their reservations about a strong loonie and its implications on medium term growth .
Combing stronger commodity prices and a weak USD sentiment , achieving parity before Christmas is within speculators grasp !
The AUD managed to print new 14 - month highs in the O/N session after RBA Stevens said that policy makers Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcannot be too timid in raising its benchmark interest rate now that the threat of an economic crisis in the nation has passedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( 3.25 % ) .
A stronger business confidence print this year was one of the reasons why Governor Stevens at the RBA remains a firm hawk .
I guess he now will show rapid normalization of interest rates .
What about AUD at parity ?
( 0.9200 )
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 75.36 up +18 c ) .
With the USD lacking punch , the black - stuff remains better bid .
It even managed to break our $ 10 trading range of $ 65 - $ 75 yesterday .
Market analysts also believe that the upcoming US holiday season will put more vehicle on the road and create further drawdownÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s on inventories .
Remember , the height of the US holiday driving season was unable to do it !
The recent plunge in value by the greenback has convinced speculators to purchase crude and other commodities as a hedge against inflation .
Oil fundamentals do not warrant these actions , however , any signs of an uptick in demand for fuel and refiners will be shutting down facilities for that reason .
Dealers continue to speculate that demand will increase amid signs that the global economy is emerging from this recession .
Prices remain robust after the Asian region raised its 2009 economic forecast .
With that and following suit , OPEC revised its target objectives for 2010 on the back of these Asia revisions .
No matter what , the black stuff continues to get ahead of its own fundamentals .
Speculators are treating the commodity as an Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœinvestment asset rather than a consumption assetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Demand destruction remains , last weeks EIA report , while reporting a decline in crude , more importantly was a confirmation of still weak oil product demand in industrial fuels .
The EIA report should have been bearish for the commodity .
The market will take its lead from this weeks inventory reports .
Global output remains healthy .
Russia increased its production last month and has now surpassed Saudi Arabia as the largest produce .
They have just added to the global glut of the black - stuff .
However , at the end of the day itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the USD that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s pushing this asset class around !
Store of value , store of value !
Gold , like an unpredictable thoroughbred , has charged forward and managed to print new record highs yesterday .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the debate of deflation and inflation that spurring the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ higher as investors are concerned that an economic recovery will promote inflation .
Mind you a plummeting dollar is driving investors towards the yellow metal as alternative investment .
During this morningÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s session , this one way directional rally witnessed some dealers booking profits as a stalling USD curbed the demand temporarily for the yellow metal ( $ 1,056 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,238 up +178 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,856 up +3 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,250 down - 6 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 4 bp yesterday ( 3.42 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries managed to remain under pressure on the back of US retail sales declining last month less than anticipated ( see above ) , adding to stronger evidence that the US economy is emerging from its worst slump in over 50 - years .
The long end of the yield curve led the decline and 2Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s / 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s have managed to widen the most in 3 - weeks ( 247 ) .
Analysts believe that there is good technical support at 3.50 % the first time around .
However , looking at the big picture , Treasury buybacks are almost over .
MBS buybacks have about $ 250 b to go .
The US Treasury still had to raise $ 1.8t per year ( more pressure on the curve ) .
Despite the USD at a 14 month low , analysts foresee 4 % 10 - yr notes before the year - end and 4.5 % by middle of next year !

Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) unleashed another verbal tirade against Republicans on Thursday , calling the party a " lie factory " that hoped only to stall the healthcare debate .
Grayson also dismissed calls that he apologize for his remark earlier this week that Republicans ' healthcare plan was to " die quickly " -- an allegation that has since invoked the ire of the entire GOP .
" America is sick of you , Republican Party ; you 're a lie factory , that 's all you do , " he told MSNBC on Thursday .
" Why do n't you work together with the Democrats to solve America 's problems instead of making stuff up ? "
Grayson then called the party a bunch of " no- mongers , " and he chided GOP lawmakers for failing to come up with their own healthcare plan in the 48 hours since he first attacked their strategy .
" The people who should be apologizing are the Republicans , they 're the ones who should apologize for dragging us all through the mud here while we 're just trying to improve healthcare in America , " he said .
" That 's all we 're trying to do . "
The GOP has since dismissed Grayson 's remarks as partisan hackery , and some party members are now calling for Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) to sanction the congressman for his comments -- much as Democrats rebuked Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) for interrupting the president during his address to Congress .
But Democrats have grumbled at that suggestion , claiming it is little more than a distraction from the more important debates confronting Congress .
Grayson said Thursday he agreed with that perspective , but he also offered some tough words for his own party , which he said needed to work together to overcome Republicans ' stall tactics .
" We 've got to get past this point where everything is stalled ; where the Republicans are winning just through inertia , " he said .
" We have a majority , we have to use it . "
What Would Be Required For Full Employment
A friend of mine noted that the Fed is supposed to try and achieve both price stability and employment , and thus seems to believe that leaving interest rates low is something the Fed should do .
But monetary policy alone is n’t going to get the US to full employment .
It requires properly done fiscal policy combined with proper financial regulation to encourage lending to the real economy and real investment .
Right now what is happening is that banks have cheap money , but consumers and most businesses have expensive money .
They risk creating another financial bubble , minus the part where some ordinary people manage to get rich off flipping houses because banks are n’t lending their cheap money to companies or people who create any significan numbers of jobs , they ’re using that money for leveraged plays , buyouts and so on .
As usual , this was predicted by a number of people this time last year when TARP was formalized .
The Fed , Treasury , FDIC and federal regulators , under the direction of the President ( and yes , the Fed does do what the President wants right now , if Bernanke wants to keep his job , which he does ) could do a number of things to fix this , but doing so would require telling bankers who they ’re going to lend to and what interest rates they ’re going to charge , and / that / would require being willing to threaten them with ( and if necessary follow through with ) withdrawal of special facilities , real audits , and having the FDIC take over banks who absolutely refuse to play ball .
Which means a willingness to risk having those sweet sweet donation from the financial sector flip back to the Republicans .
The rest of what needs to be done rests in the combined hands of the President and Congress .
For a pittance compared to the full so - called stimulus bill , cash for clunkers produced noticeable growth .
If the government wants to pass a real stimulus bill , actually designed to create large numbers of jobs , it could get a lot of bang for only a few hundred billion dollars .
No one , not the Fed , nor Congress , nor the President , is serious about full employment .
If they were they would have done , would be doing , and would be planning on doing different things than they have done .
Employment will probably start picking up again in the spring , but employment as a percentage of America ’s population will not recover this economic cycle .
My suspicion is that it wo n’t recover within 20 years .
That is a policy choice , either deliberately , or through stupidity ( I suspect both . )
Fixing it requires all three of the Fed , President and Congress to decide to do the right things for the population as a whole , rather than for their friends , donors and cronies in the financial industry .
I leave it to others to decide how likely that is to occur .
( CNN ) -- Graphic details of bestiality , child rape and sodomy emerged in court documents filed Thursday in the case of a Missouri family accused of horrific crimes against their relatives .
One of the alleged victims was about 7 years old when she and her sisters attempted to run away in 1988 , after enduring years of sexual abuse at the hands of her male relatives , a complaint filed in Lafayette County Circuit Court states .
Before she left , she wrote down the alleged sex acts , put them in a jar and buried it , the complaint says .
The girls made it to a neighbor 's house before returning home , where , as punishment for running away , they were forced to watch a relative sodomize their brother , according to the complaint .
The incident is just one of many described in the complaint based on interviews with one of the alleged victims , now 28 , in support of charges against Burrell Mohler Sr. , 77 , and his sons Jared Mohler , 48 , and Burrell Mohler Jr. , 53 .
The three men were each charged with use of a child in a sexual performance for allegedly forcing two girls to engage in bestiality in summer 1986 .
Burrell Mohler Sr. is also accused of five counts of rape for incidents that allegedly occurred between May 1986 and December 1987 in several locations , including his former home in Bates City , Missouri .
The woman told police that " summers were the worst because the girls spent more time at their [ relative 's ] farm , " the complaint states .
During the summer of the alleged bestiality , the woman says she and three of her sisters were " married " to one of their relatives in a mock wedding ceremony conducted by Burrell Mohler Sr .
Two of the girl 's sisters also reported the ceremony in interviews with police , the complaint says .
Two other sons of Burrell Mohler Sr. , David Mohler and Roland Mohler , are also in custody on various charges related to the abuse allegations .
The men were arrested last week on charges of rape , deviate sexual assault and using a child in sexual performance , according to a Missouri state courts online system .
Fifteen charges were added Monday after another alleged victim came forward , CNN affiliate WDAF reported .
Dozens of family members attended a hearing for the suspects Tuesday , saying the allegations against the men have been fabricated , the station said .
Burrell Mohler Sr.'s younger brother , Darrel Mohler , was arrested in Florida on Friday , authorities said .
Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said he faces two counts of rape .
Burrell Mohler Sr. , David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ , the Independence , Missouri - based organization said in a statement .
None of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children , the group said .

The Romans never reused the numbers of the three legions , XVII , XVIII and XIX , which were lost in the battle
Three days of blood - soaked butchery in the unfamiliar forests of Germany culminated in one of the Roman Empire 's darkest moments , and may have helped shape the Europe of today .
As many as 30,000 Roman soldiers , along with countless slaves and families , died at the hands of people they regarded as barbarians , who were led by a man they regarded as a friend .
Did the Varian Disaster , which took place exactly 2,000 years ago and stunned the Roman Empire into a temporary paralysis , mark a turning point in its all - conquering mindset ?
Does the slaughter in the Teutoburger Forest still affect us today ?
Adrian Murdoch , author of a book on the battle , said the shockwaves were immense .
" The battle was not only the Roman Empire 's greatest defeat , but it definitely changed European history in ways which are being felt still now , " he said .
Varus was marching back to the Rhine when attacked and killed at Kalkriese
In 9AD the Romans believed the land they called Germania was all but conquered .
The man at the head of the army , Varus , was more civil servant than soldier .
Marching south at the end of the summer fighting season he was led into unfamiliar territory by a trusted native lieutenant , Arminius .
Arminius , a nobleman who had spent years in the Empire , had secretly organised an alliance of German tribes and as the three legions of Romans struggled through forest and storms , they were caught in an immense ambush .
" It should n't be thought of as a swift attack .
It went on for three days , " says Roman military expert Dr Jon Coulston , from the University of St Andrews .
Imperial nightmare " I compare it to the USS Indianapolis , which sank in the Second World War and sailors , in the sea for days , were attacked by sharks .
" The first attacks would have be short and sharp , only doing a little damage .
Then more tribesmen would have been attracted , hitting harder .
The normally ordered Roman marching column would have begun to break up , groups of soldiers being picked off .
" Eventually , exhausted and in disarray , the army was stopped by ditches and earth walls and was then overwhelmed in a final onslaught . "
But countless soldiers have died in endless battles .
Why is this one different ?
The stockades which finally trapped the Romans have been reconstructed Adrian Murdoch believes it was a decisive moment in the development of the West .
" The split along the Rhine across which the Romans were pushed remains significant today , " he said .
" But the battle certainly did affect the thinking of the Romans right away .
The Germans became almost revered as well as feared in the mentality of the Romans .
Early emperors kept Germans as their private bodyguards .
They were bogeymen .
He added : " Later there is of course the issue of the role of Arminius and the battle in fostering the idea of German nationalism .
This was helpful and arguably benign in the 19th Century especially in the wake of Napoleon 's imperialistic ambitions .
" It reached its lowest point during the Nazi era when Arminius pulled on jackboots .
During the nationalistic marches through Munich , Arminius and Cheruscan warriors marched alongside stormtroopers . "
Religious conflict
The importance of the battle to modern Germany is such that the anniversary has been marked by three separate exhibitions on the battle , opened by German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Sven Felix Kellerhoff , a journalist for Die Welt newspaper and specialist in German cultural history , believes its influence runs deep .
" European history is shaped by the differences between the Romanic western part , the so called Germanic part in the middle and the Slavic part in central Europe , " he says .
" Maybe without the Varian disaster there would never have been the separation of west and east Frankish kingdoms , never the confrontation between the German kings and the popes , never the Reformation , never the conflict between Germany and France .
More than 5,000 objects have been found at the site " If Europe to the Elbe had been shaped by Romanic culture and language , the roadmap of European history would have changed in many parts .
This does n't mean that it would all be better - other conflicts and other wars would have broken out .
But Europe would have had a very different history . "
But Dr Coulston feels that while the battle was significant , its long term effects have been overplayed .
" This was a defeat for Rome at its strongest under the rule of Augustus , the first true emperor , " he says .
" It probably affected him personally .
Roman historians have him banging his fists on walls and shouting for Varus to give him back his eagles .
He also told his successors to limit the Empire to the Rhine .
" But we have to recognise the Romans came back hard .
They smashed the German armies soon after , regaining the ground and driving Arminius to his death .
" They probably could have completed the conquest but the political will to spend the effort doing so had weakened .
" And after this Rome did not turn its back on Germany .
There was trade , there were treaties , and the later Roman army was substantially made up of German mercenaries .
" And it was mostly tribes from Germany which overwhelmed the Western Empire .
The cultures of Rome and the tribes north of the Rhine , even if they had not mixed before , must have done then . "

ESA is looking for European volunteers to take part .
The ‘ mission ’ is part of the Mars500 programme being conducted by ESA and Russia ’s Institute of Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) to study human psychological , medical and physical capabilities and limitations in space through fundamental and operational research .
ESA ’s Directorate of Human Spaceflight is undertaking Mars500 as part of its European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences ( ELIPS ) to prepare for future human missions to the Moon and Mars .
The Mars500 study takes place in a special isolation facility at the Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow .
The purpose of the Mars500 study is to gather data , knowledge and experience to help prepare for a real mission to Mars one day .
The participants are subjects in scientific investigations to assess the effect that isolation has on various psychological and physiological aspects , such as stress , hormone regulation and immunity , sleep quality , mood and the effectiveness of dietary supplements .

Following on from the successful 105 - day precursor study completed in July , ESA is now looking for two candidates and two backups for the full 520 - day study , which is due to get underway before mid-2010 after four months of training .
The crew will follow a programme designed to simulate a 250 - day journey to Mars , a 30 - day surface exploration phase and 240 days travelling back to Earth .
For the ‘ surface exploration ’ , half of the crew will move to the facility ’s martian simulation module and the hatch to the rest of the facility will be closed .
Candidates should be aged 20 - 50 , motivated , in good health and no taller than 185 cm .
They should speak one of the working languages : English and Russian .
Candidates must have a background and work experience in medicine , biology , life support systems engineering , computer engineering , electronic engineering or mechanical engineering .

Amazon has just gotten more competitive with iTunes on the desktop via a new release of doubleTwist for the Mac and Windows , which now offers an Amazon MP3 front - end as well as integrated media software and support for numerous handheld devices .
The software , which launched Wednesday , comes courtesy of Jon Lech Johansen ( " DVD Jon " ) , famed for his own personal war on DRM before dropping DRM in music became en vogue .
doubleTwist 's goal is clearly to offer a clean and very iTunes - like interface for playing media and buying from Amazon MP3 , though our initial experiences left us a little disappointed .
The software
The interface of the software itself is clean and easy to understand , especially if you have ever used iTunes before .
After you sign in with a doubleTwist account ( which you can create from the software itself if you do n't have one ) , the left - hand column allows you to choose between a variety of options .
These include the Music Store ( Amazon MP3 ) , your music library imported directly from iTunes , your Photos imported from iPhoto , and your Movies ( also imported from iTunes ) .
There 's a list of purchases you have made through doubleTwist , as well as any devices you currently have connected .
Because the software lets you access your music and photos from iTunes , it 's clear that double Twist is aimed at being an iTunes replacement and not just a supplement .
Though it does n't appear to recognize the iPhone on the Mac ( that 's the device I have plugged in that it can't seem to identify correctly ) , doubleTwist does support a number of BlackBerrys , the Palm Pre , the PSP , some Android phones , and " hundreds " of other devices .
( To be fair , the software does recognize the iPhone under Windows , but only firmware 2.0 for now . )
For the users of those devices , this could be a true blessing , since iTunes wo n't sync with any of those by default ( cat - and - mouse between Apple and Palm notwithstanding ) .
When browsing our music library brought in from iTunes , we noticed that there are no playlists imported along with it .
You can easily navigate through a list of artists or a giant list of songs , but if you are married to your previously - created playlists , this is a major downside .
Update : DVD Jon contacted Ars and said that the software does support playlists , so perhaps it was a bug that we ran into on our side .
Our other observation about the interface was that switching between items was often quite slow .
Clicking between Music and the Music Store , for example , frequently resulted in a beachball on a 2.4GHz iMac with 4GB of RAM — something that would never happen on iTunes itself .
The beachball came back many times while we were using the software , resulting in general slowness and annoyance .
The store
The main selling point for doubleTwist is its desktop front - end to Amazon MP3 where you can buy nearly every song you can dream of from the most - used alternative to the iTunes Store .
The home screen is extremely simplified , which many have praised compared to the clutter of the iTunes Store .
There 's a list of Top Albums , Top Songs , and a search box — and that 's pretty much it .
This is great if you know exactly what you 're looking for and can search for it , or if what you 're looking for can be found in the Top lists .
If you 're a browser ( like I am ) , however , this interface is less than ideal .
In fact , in order to find an album to purchase for this writeup , I had to use Amazon 's Web interface in order to make my selection — then I went back to doubleTwist to search for the album for purchase .
Jon tells us that browsing functionality is coming in the future , however , as well as a recommendation engine .
You can listen to previews without navigating to a new page — just click the little Play arrow on any song and it will begin playing .
The nice thing about this is that the preview will keep playing even as you navigate to other parts of the store , something you can't do when browsing the iTunes Store .
When you make a purchase , doubleTwist will ask you to log into your Amazon account and begin downloading the songs in its own little window .
Once the songs are downloaded , doubleTwist places them in your Purchases playlist .
Here 's where things get slightly confusing , only because doubleTwist uses the exact same behavior as iTunes when you make purchases , making veteran iTunes users believe that perhaps their purchases through doubleTwist might also be imported into their iTunes libraries .
This is not so — the music is saved to your home directory >
Music > doubleTwist > album name , and if you want it in iTunes , you have to drag it yourself .
No doubt this detail was left out because doubleTwist is meant to act as an iTunes replacement , but the Amazon MP3 downloader ( the one that comes from Amazon ) imports directly into iTunes when you buy music from the Web store , so if you 're looking for that functionality , you 're better off sticking with that instead of doubleTwist .
Once our music was purchased , we ( of course ) decided to listen to it .
Here 's where doubleTwist 's slowness came back into play — the software skipped every 10 seconds or so , pausing our music every time it decided to burp .
We confirmed this was n't a problem in the files themselves by playing them in iTunes with no hiccups .
If double Twist 's other issues are just annoyances , this is the dealbreaker — how can you possibly use a media player to listen to music if it skips your music all the way through ?
We 'll stick with the Web interface , thanks
It 's the cumulation of these issues — general interface slowness , difficulty in browsing Amazon 's selection , and constant song hiccups — that led us to decide that we prefer iTunes and the Web version of Amazon MP3 .
That does n't mean we hate doubleTwist , though .
The software is still useful for those using Android devices or BlackBerrys , and it has great potential if double Twist is able to rectify its performance issues .
For now , though , it 's just not for us .
The Department of Energy 's Advanced Research Projects Agency announced its first grant awards Monday morning , handing out more than $ 150 million for what the agency describes as " bold , transformational " energy projects .
The fledgling " Darpa for energy " bet between half a million and 9 million dollars on 37 companies and universities .
The lion 's share of the grant money went to energy - storage projects followed by biomass - energy technologies and then renewable power like wind and solar .
That said , the money was spread pretty evenly among the agency 's areas of interest .
Of the 10 technological categories , seven of them received more than $ 10 million , and none received more than $ 30 million .
Oil and gas received the least money with a sole project garnering $ 1 million .
The largest wards went to Foro Energy and DuPont , which received $ 9.1 and $ 9 million , respectively .
Foro , which does not appear to have a website , has a new geothermal drilling technique that could provide faster drilling with less wear on drill bits .
DuPont is trying to produce butanol from seaweed .
ARPA-E was created on paper in 2007 by George W. Bush , but had no actual funding until its budget was passed as part of President Barack Obama 's stimulus package , also known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .
The DOE was allocated $ 36.7 billion when Obama signed the bill into law in February .
Since then , energy industry watchers have eagerly waited to see where the agency would put its chips .
In August , 99 percent of applicants to the program received a rejection letter .
The winners are now detailed in this Wired.com Google Spreadsheet and at the Department of Energy .

The forgotten front
By Joshua Gross
Kashmir is a void in U.S. foreign policy , all the more noticeable for its absence in our diplomats ’ discourse .
Ashley Tellis , a former political adviser in the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , told journalist Steve Coll earlier this year that the best advice for the Obama administration was to “ keep hands off . ”
The conventional wisdom holds that prospects for peace are too fragile for a ham - fisted American mediation that pushes India and Pakistan too hard , too fast .
In a region where capitulating to the Americans is political suicide , our good intentions would surely backfire .
However , the “ hands off ” approach ensures the prolongation of a perilous status quo .
A perpetually unstable South Asia flooded with jihadi groups , with two combustible nuclear powers , undermines U.S. national security .
In the interim , American troops are caught in the web of a conflict dynamic that extends far beyond the borders of Afghanistan .
The Obama Administration must finalize the next steps for America ’s strategy in Afghanistan with a regional perspective .
In the quest to stabilize Afghanistan , breaking the diplomatic impasse over Kashmir is a necessity , not a luxury .
Twenty - four of Pakistan ’s 26 military divisions remain idling on the Indian border , waiting and watching .
They refuse to redeploy to the extremist heartland in the west , even as the country is wracked by brazen acts of terrorism .
Although bilateral negotiations have identified shared interests in a settlement on Kashmir , the much - trumpeted backchannel between the two governments remains dormant .
History and the high - stakes of domestic politics get in the way of a just and sustainable settlement .
( Read on )
Foreign policy experts are divided over the utility of U.S. mediation .
Both Indians and Pakistanis distrust American the motivation behind U.S. involvement .
Moderate Pakistanis blame the U.S. for opening the floodgates of extremism through their support of the Afghan mujahideen ’s jihad against the Soviets .
Furthermore , U.S. support of India ’s nuclear program , despite their flouting of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , reinforced the perception of a double standard that unfairly favored India .
Indians — proud of their ancient civilization and superpower status — have no desire to kowtow to an American babysitter .
Indian analysts argue that a U.S. envoy could not offer Pakistan a better deal than those already offered by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
In an October 29 interview , Indian Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna bristled at the notion that the United States would persuade India to restart talks with Pakistan .
“ India is an independent country , we take our own decisions … We are guided by ourselves and not by others , ” he said .
U.S. policy remains timid .
The Indian government successfully lobbied the Obama Administration to have Special Representative Holbrooke ’s overt responsibilities limited to AfPak .
Holbrooke has allegedly been pressured to avoid using the “ K - word ” : Kashmir .
Indian and Pakistani journalists are adept at baiting high - level U.S. officials into showing their cards on Kashmir , which only encourages the U.S. officials to calcify their poker faces .
When pressed this summer , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an Indian interviewer , “ [ O ] ur role is not to be involved … ”
Her insistence last week that the United States will not attempt to pilot a solution signals that Kashmir remains a low priority in Washington .
Now it is time for President Obama to demonstrate genuine faith in diplomacy through a tangible turnaround on Kashmir .
The presence of Holbrooke in the region can dramatically enhance the efficacy of U.S. statecraft .
In another promising development , Kashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has requested U.S. mediation .
President Obama should pave the way toward formal negotiations through close consultations with Prime Minister Singh .
The Prime Minister ’s upcoming visit to Washington will provide Obama with an ideal opportunity to propose a stronger U.S. - India relationship and greater support for more visible Indian leadership in international organizations like the G20 in exchange for reactivating negotiations with Pakistan .
A public track would explore water resource management , an attenuation of the Indian occupation , and the expansion of trade and transportation linkages .
Concurrently , a reopened backchannel would negotiate the intractable issues : establishing the borders and the final status of Kashmir ; a referendum of the Kashmiri people on independence ; counter terrorism cooperation to neutralize Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammed ; and a mutual troop drawdown along the Line of Control that separates the two armies .
Throughout this process the United States should not be in the spotlight , but it should have a seat at the table .
Past back channel negotiations have failed when negotiators did not prepare their domestic constituencies for the painful compromises ahead .
Political elites must manage expectations in both countries .
The U.S. could further bolster the process by employing a routine framework that keeps the parties at the table , especially when terrorists seek to disrupt reconciliation with more 11 / 26 - style attacks .
Even if American insistence on formalized negotiations is deemed imprudent , a change in tone is needed .
Holbrooke should be liberated from his narrow mandate .
Such a move would signal the Obama administration ’s preference for movement on Kashmir .
Secretary of State Clinton ’s trip to the region this week was yet another example of a missed opportunity to propose a more ambitious policy .
Clinton rebuffed Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani ’s request for U.S. mediation on October 28 , a rare demonstration of Pakistani political will .
Hopefully , Pakistan will continue to coax a U.S. about - face .
In his attempt to defuse the 1999 Kargil crisis — the last time Pakistan and India were eyeball - to - eyeball with their fingers on the nuclear button — President Clinton talked down then - Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by promising to “ take a personal interest in the Kashmir dispute . ”
Now is the time for another visionary U.S. leader to live up to that oft - broken promise .
Joshua Gross is a master ’s candidate at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University .
He formerly served as the director of media relations for the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington .

It ’s been decades since McDonald ’s introduced the blockbuster Egg McMuffin , and until recently , the breakfast sandwich has remained largely the province of the drive - thru and the Kraft Singles–slinging corner deli .
Lately , though , like other iconic American foodstuffs — the hamburger and the hot dog come to mind — the humble egg sandwich has been subject to ingredient upgrades and fancy - chef tweaks .
It only makes sense :
Why settle for an old kaiser roll and an industrial egg when today ’s painstakingly DIY locavore cooks are willing to bake their own biscuits , grind their own sausage , and procure their eggs from farms where pastured chickens have the run of the place ?

A breakfast sandwich worth waking up early for :

The church :
Benny Hinn Ministries , Royal Victoria Dock , East London .
The building :
The event which is the subject of this report took place at ExCeL London , a prestigious international exhibition and conference centre located in the Royal Docks area of the Borough of Newham in East London .
The venue may be reached by luxury yacht , train , four - wheels , on foot or even by air .
Built alongside the Royal Victoria Dock , ExCeL looks like a giant warehouse constructed of steel girders , suspended steel roofs and plain brick walls .
Cable and heating ducts and insulated pipework are all exposed .
The public reception area begins in an expansive covered walkway leading to a spacious internal boulevard where a reception desk was well manned .
An abundance of security staff was in evidence , all of whom were very pleasant and helpful .
In view of the construction of the building , some of the halls and public spaces are noisy , although today 's auditorium was acceptable , in spite of the lack of soft furnishings .
The church : Benny Hinn Ministries , a multi-million dollar organisation based in Texas , USA , is mainly dedicated to televangelism and mass conference and healing extravaganza .
Pastor Toufik Benedictus ( Benny )
Hinn , 56 years old , lives in Southern California and describes himself as a " statesman , author , broadcaster , bridge builder and evangelist . "
It is claimed that the organisation 's television station is seen daily in 200 countries .
It also provides crisis relief , children 's homes and feeding programmes , as well as hospital and emergency care , around the globe .
Their various websites and other media outlets emphasise the assumed gifts and successes of Pastor Benny Hinn .
The neighbourhood : Exciting and progressive !
The Royal London Docks , once a busy shipping heartland , have been reinvented as a place of learning , business , sport and leisure .
The developed area includes the University of East London , a floating hotel , listed heritage buildings and London City Airport .
There is limited housing provision with some gentrification of old poor working class housing estates .
Just a few miles away , in the same borough , are the sites of the 2012 Olympics .
Newham Borough includes a number of very large Pentecostal African congregations and branches of Britain 's major Caribbean - led denominations .
Many of the other churches are struggling or have closed their doors , with some having been converted into places of worship by people of other faiths .
Newham is a vibrant and exciting district : " A place where people choose to live , work and stay , " as the borough publicity claims .
The cast : " Pastor Jim " ( worship leader ) , a second unnamed worship leader , " Dr Todd " ( preacher and replacement for Benny Hinn ) , and Benny Hinn via trans -Atlantic telephone link .
Benny Hinn was scheduled to appear in person but was denied entry to Britain by the Border Agency for lack of " a valid certificate of sponsorship " .
A support party consisted of 10 men in dark suits sitting in two rows at the front of the platform , but all they did was to bow and shake the preacher 's hand when he sat down .
The date & time : Saturday , 3 October 2009 , 2.00 pm .
What was the name of the service ?
Miracle Service – which , according to the publicity for this three - day series of events , would strive " to equip you , as God 's child , for these last days " .
It was not clear whether " God 's children " are those already converted or those the organisation is seeking to save .
How full was the building ?
By my count , there was room for about 10,000 in the auditorium .
It was claimed that there were 7,000 present , and I think that was probably correct when latecomers were included .
The audience – oops , I mean congregation – were diverse , young and old , male and female , white and black ; perhaps there was a small majority of middle - aged black women .
When the representative of Benny Hinn Ministries asked " partners " to stand and be honoured and clapped , many hundreds of people did so .
Did anyone welcome you personally ?
A young man who was part of the ExCeL security team was very welcoming and answered my questions about the venue .
We chatted about the absence of Benny Hinn .
There were a very few ushers dotted about the auditorium .
When I sat down , a woman nearby was very friendly , although I had to start the conversation .
Then a ram 's horn arrived and sat next to me .
That is to say , a young couple with a two - year old in a pushchair came in , the man carrying a ram 's horn .
He warned me not to be surprised if he blew on the horn now and then .
Was your pew comfortable ?
It was a moulded plastic chair , one of a long row anchored to the floor .
It was OK for the first two hours but it then got a bit hard .
On the other hand , there was no time to become bored .
How would you describe the pre-service atmosphere ?
Very noisy .
The 200 voice choir was practising as I arrived an hour before kick - off ; this was followed by loud pre-recorded music .
People were talking to each other above the music and all the hard surfaces acted as echo boards .
Nearby , an usher and others were praying for a man in a wheelchair .
If the subsequent exuberance is anything to go by , I think that the majority of people were expecting to have a good time .
One very friendly woman told me that Hinn 's absence would n't make any difference .
" He 's only a man ; it 's all about Jesus . "
What were the exact opening words of the service ?
" Good afternoon .
All choir members take your seats .
Thank you . "
Later , when the service started : " How many of you know that God has got something tremendous for you today ? "
What books did the congregation use during the service ?
None .
No words at all , not even on the screen , which seemed to be used solely to highlight those leading the proceedings .
Those of us who did not know the songs were left feeling excluded , if not disappointed .
This is a strong indication that this meeting was aimed at " the converted " and , I suppose , they are the ones Benny Hinn calls " God 's children . "
What musical instruments were played ?
Keyboards , a large five manual organ ( played by the only woman on the platform ) ; bass guitar and full drum kit .
There may have been other women on the platform but , if so , they were hidden behind the dignitaries .
Oh , yes , and there was , of course , the ram 's horn next to me .
Keyboards , a large five manual organ ( played by the only woman on the platform ) ; bass guitar and full drum kit .

Oh , yes , and there was , of course , the ram 's horn next to me .
Did anything distract you ?
The meeting was fast - moving and held my attention throughout .
There were a few occasions when people screamed very loudly ; this caused others to look around .
And there was the ram 's horn .
This was blown at various points during the meeting , seemingly to indicate support for what was being said on the platform .
Was the worship stiff - upper - lip , happy clappy , or what ?
A swinging - from - the - chandeliers rave !
An ecstatic Pentecostal romp !
Leaders were prone to adulation of Benny Hinn and of themselves : " I am so thankful for our Pastor Benny , who has preached to thousands and thousands of people around the globe . "
" Benny loves you ; he is here in spirit . "
" There is a strong anointing on me here today . "
" God has anointed me as a financial deliverer . "
" I 've just had a picture of a meeting in hell that is taking place now ; there are 5,000 demons and the Devil is telling them to stop the events at ExCeL or he will fire them . "
" I have written 18 books although the teachers said I could n't write . "
" I have preached to thousands although I used to have a speech impediment . "
And so on .
Always , the people responded with applause and praise .
Benny Hinn appeared as a glossy picture on the screens and a voice down the telephone line .
His 40 minute telephone call to the meeting consisted of a lengthy explanation for being refused entry into Britain and other general messages of support and encouragement .
He blamed the Devil for attempting to stop the meeting .
The final 10 minutes of his talk focused on healing whilst team members " ministered " to the sick .
I observed that only four people fell ( or were pushed ) or stumbled to the floor as they were touched .
One woman joyfully danced across the platform .
Exactly how long was the sermon ?
47 minutes .
On a scale of 1 - 10 , how good was the preacher ?
As a Pentecostal orator : 6 . As an expositor : 1 . As an entertainer : 3 . As an evangelist : 1 . As a manipulator : 9 . How good a preacher was he ?
Zero !
I found myself wondering why God had not healed Dr Todd of the nervous twitch in his head and shoulders .
In a nutshell , what was the sermon about ?
Dr Todd made a start at John 12 ( Jesus enters Jerusalem ) but quite soon digressed ( or lost me , perhaps ) .
The main section of his sermon was about sowing seeds and reaping a harvest , which seemed to get bigger and bigger as he progressed .
Some time was spent in explaining to people that this seed of money was to be sown into Benny Hinn Ministries , with Benny Hinn sending an email to thank those who filled in the offering envelope and included some cash .
Sums of cash were suggested , although no amount below £ 100 was mentioned .
Someone present , Dr Todd said , was going to sow £ 100,000 and 70 people would sow £ 1,000 each .
The message was wealth prosperity promised in return for sending cash to Benny Hinn Ministries .
The sermon ended in an altar call answered by a group of about 300 to 400 people , who went to the front to " receive salvation . "
Having thus been saved , they were then invited to repeat a prayer after Dr Todd .
Which part of the service was like being in heaven ?
Nothing .
Nothing at all .
Except , perhaps , the smile of the two - year - old child next to me who did his own thing , totally oblivious to all that was going on around him .
And which part was like being in ... er... the other place ?
What was n't ?
Certainly not the shouting and screaming .
The manipulation .
The self - righteous puffery .
There was no reference to contemporary world events  that , for me , was the most hellish part of all .
And I do wish the family next to me had left their ram 's horn at home .
They were a youngish couple who appeared to be " working class poor " .
A very pleasant couple , obviously very devout .
When the offering envelope arrived , the man filled in the paper with his credit card details .
What happened when you hung around after the service looking lost ?
After nearly four hours , I felt that I had given enough of my life to this exercise .
I saw people leaving as soon as Benny Hinn had finished his telephone call , so I made a hasty exit before the stampede for the train .
There were no ushers or other personnel to be seen , but plenty of friendly ExCeL security people to guide us out .
As I left , I was told by an ExCeL steward that she expected to be there for another three hours .
Maybe this would include waves of people falling to the floor or people jumping out of their wheelchairs but , given Benny Hinn 's absence , I doubted it .
How would you describe the after - service coffee ?
I 'm sure that the many public cafés and stalls in ExCeL offer excellent fare , but Benny Hinn Ministries had nothing to offer me .
How would you feel about making this church your regular ( where 10 = ecstatic , 0 = terminal ) ?
0  " Membership " in Benny Hinn Ministries starts at £ 20 per month for covenant partners , payable every month for a year , and rises to " a first gift " of at least £ 500 plus £ 20 per month for global impact team partners .
Considerably more dear than what the " willing helpers " were charging in the Who 's rock opera Tommy : " Buy your way to heaven ; that comes to one pound seven .
[ Ring ]
Bless you , luv ! "
I neither wish to contribute nor have I the energy for such gatherings .
Did the service make you feel glad to be a Christian ?
I would be very embarrassed to be associated as a Christian with this organisation .
Mrs Wuntoo feared that the experience would kill or cure me ( cure my injured ankle ) .
She was relieved that it did neither .
If anything , I think my ankle may have gotten a bit worse !
What one thing will you remember about all this in seven days ' time ?
The ram 's horn blown with great feeling .
Hopefully , nothing more .

Congressional Leaders Fight Against Posting Bills Online ( Oct. 6 , 2009 )
As Congress lurches closer to a decision on an enormous overhaul of the American health care system , pressure is mounting on legislative leaders to make the final bill available online for citizens to read before a vote .
Lawmakers were given just hours to examine the $ 789 billion stimulus plan , sweeping climate change legislation and a $ 700 billion bailout package before final votes .
While most Americans normally ignore parliamentary detail , with health care looming , voters are suddenly paying attention .
The Senate is expected to vote on a health bill in the weeks to come , representing months of work and stretching to hundreds of pages .
And as of now , there is no assurance that members of the public , or even the senators themselves , will be given the chance to read the legislation before a vote .
" The American people are now suspicious of not only the lawmakers , but the process they hide behind to do their work , " said Michael Franc , president of government relations for the Heritage Foundation , a
conservative think tank .
At town hall meetings across the country this past summer , the main topic was health care , but there was a strong undercurrent of anger over the way Congress rushed through passage of the stimulus , global warming and bank bailout bills without seeming to understand the consequences .
The stimulus bill , for example , was 1,100 pages long and made available to Congress and the public just 13 hours before lawmakers voted on it .
The bill has failed to provide the promised help to the job market , and there was outrage when it was discovered that the legislation included an amendment allowing American International Group , a bailout recipient , to give out millions in employee bonuses .
"
If someone had a chance to look at the bill , they would have found that out , " said Lisa Rosenberg , who lobbies Congress on behalf of the Sunlight Foundation to bring more transparency to government .
The foundation has begun an effort to get Congress to post bills online , for all to see , 72 hours before lawmakers vote on them .
" It would give the public a chance to really digest and understand what is in the bill , " Rosenberg said , " and communicate whether that is a good or a bad thing while there is still time to fix it . "
What you do n't know can hurt you :
» House energy and global warming bill , passed June 26 , 2009 .
1,200 pages .
Available online 15 hours before vote .
» $ 789 billion stimulus bill , passed Feb. 14 , 2009 .
1,100 pages .
Available online 13 hours before debate .
» $ 700 billion financial sector rescue package , passed Oct. 3 , 2008 . 169 pages .
Available online 29 hours before vote .
» USA Patriot domestic surveillance bill , passed Oct. 23 , 2001 .
Unavailable to the public before debate .
A similar effort is under way in Congress .
Reps. Brian Baird , D‐Wash . , and Greg Walden , R‐Ore. , are circulating a petition among House lawmakers that would force a vote on the 72 hour rule .
Nearly every Republican has signed on , but the Democratic leadership is unwilling to cede control over when bills are brought to the floor for votes and are discouraging their rank and file from signing the petition .
Senate Democrats voted down a similar measure last week for the health care bill .
The reluctance to implement a three day rule is not unique to the Democrats .
The Republican majority rushed through the controversial Patriot Act in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as well as a massive Medicare prescription drug bill in 2003 that added hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit .
For the majority party , legislative timing plays a big role in whether a bill will pass because support can be fleeting .
" The leaders use it as a tool to get votes or to keep amendments off a bill , " said one top Senate Democratic aide .
But Baird warned of public backlash .
" Democrats know politically it 's difficult to defend not doing this , " he said .
" The public gets this .
They say we entrust you with the profound responsibility of making decisions that affect our lives , and we expect you to exercise due diligence in carrying out that responsibility . "
AT&T said on Tuesday that it would no longer prevent customers with the Apple iPhone from using Internet telephone services that bypass its own voice network .
Until now , AT&T would not let users of voice services like Skype connect over its wireless data network .
The Skype application on the iPhone could make calls only when connected to a Wi -Fi network .
The issue of what sorts of services wireless carriers should allow has become the subject of scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission , which is considering a proposal to formalize its network neutrality principles and extend them to cellphones .
Those principles prohibit carriers from blocking competitors ’ services and applications .
Skype , which eBay is selling , made a formal complaint to the commission two years ago , saying it was being blocked on AT&T ’s iPhone .
But the issue did not get much attention until Julius Genachowski was appointed commission chairman by President Obama .

Australia is a land where games are late and cost twice as much , so it 's hardly surprising that the over - expensive PSPgo is n't doing so well over there .
A number of Australian retailers have even refused to stock it , due to its price and all - digital format , and the impact has been felt , with Sony downplaying reports that the system has sold fewer than 1,000 copies in the country .
Michael Ephraim , managing director of Sony Computer Entertainment Australia and New Zealand , has denied that the PSPgo sold under 1,000 units , although he did have to admit that his own figures are n't much better , claiming that " it 's slightly over 1,000 . "
Oh ... that 's much better , then .
A source from sales tracker GfK told Australian press outlet The Age : " [ The PSPgo has ] a nice design and I think it 's quieter [ than the original PSP ] and uses a little less power but those things are not worth the extra cost , they 're pretty cosmetic .
It 's $ 450 and you can get a decent PSP - 3000 package for sub -$ 300 , so it 's hard to see who it was aimed at . "
You'd think that , following the PS3 price cut , Sony would drop its hubris and attitude that people will pay any amount of money just to own a PlayStation product .
Unfortunately , Sony has refused to get the message , and the PSPgo is starting to look like one of the company 's worst ideas yet .
Maybe one day they 'll get it through their thick skulls , eh ? <
Oracle is grabbing huge attraction on it ’s annual event : OpenWorld .
This year ’s OpenWorld means more to Oracle than it , possibly , ever did .
This time the hottest Sun-Oracle deal has grabbed whole Industry ’s attraction , which many IT professionals , hope to be a Killer Deal for Open source and Hardware Industry .
Larry Ellison took the stage during the keynote , kick - started by clarifying the common questions - Hardware Business Strategies : Sun SPARC and Open source strategies : Solaris , MySQL , Java .
As known earlier , all of them will continue to innovate and evolve , better than what we have seen in the past .
“ We are not selling the hardware business , ” he said .
“ No part of the hardware business are we selling . ”
So , all the myths created by IBM , also known as , “ Sunset ” are totally phased - out .
Sunset had been telling
Sun ’s customers that Oracle is going to get out of the hardware business and therefore customers should start moving to IBM .
Then started something that grabbed attention : Oracle hit hard on it ’s Rival , IBM .
He played some of the IBM ’s ads ( a bold move ) , before ripping them apart in the dark .
Ellison quoted that IBM deploys more servers in data centers than necessary , their servers are Power Hogs ( though IBM talks alot about being energy - friendly ) , and Sun-Oracle combination does a better on the benchmark as compared to IBM , already .
Ellison revealed a new benchmark that reports that Sun-Oracle server configuration :
Uses 8 x less hardware than IBM .
Runs 26 % faster than IBM .
( on lesser Hardware )
Consumes 4 x less energy than IBM .
Record - breaking 7.7 million tpmC at $ 2.34/tpmC .
16 x better response time than IBM — 1.22 seconds for IBM and 0.08 for Sun-Oracle
Of course , these benchmarks can be biased for a platform , making the Rival look ugly .
But his next statement removed any such allegations .
Ellison said that he is so confident about this benchmark that he ’s launching a New Program under which Oracle will pay it ’s Customers $ 10 Million , if a Sun - Oracle configuration fails to be least 2 x as fast as a comparable IBM solution .
Looks promising !
Oracle continued to Hit on IBM with the eco-friendly Green Tech “ smarter world ” campaign — Pointing things out , he said ,
“ I do n’t know what building a smarter world means .
We ’re going to focus on building smarter computers …
Sun ’s processor is called SPARC … IBM ’s processor is called Power .
Now we know why ! ”
In addition to all that , other Key Take - away Ellison quotes were :
“ There are limits to how far you can go if you just do software . ” …
“ We will integrate Hardware and software better ” … “ That ’s our goal , to tackle problems that are even Bigger ” .
“ Whatever you think of Apple , I think they ’ve done a great job of tackling the hardware problem while tackling the software problem . ”
“ Solaris is the number one enterprise operating system in the world . ” and “ We will continue to invest , innovate . ”
“ We ’re going to spend more , not less , on MySQL …
We ’re going to increase our rate of contribution . ”
So the question Will Oracle kill MySQL ? is phased out .
Watch the highlights of the Keynote :
What about Java ?
Then came the person who could tell us the future of Java , none other than Father of Java : James Gosling .
He had one liner that left everyone in a deep trust for the Future of Java and JavaFX .
“ I have never worked in a Software company before , So it will be an adventure ”
Left everyone amazed and in joy .

We 've researched and written dozens of Truth - O - Meter items on health care reform , so we chose our 10 Greatest Hits , the ones we consider most significant :
• Sarah Palin : Seniors and the disabled " will have to stand in front of Obama 's ' death panel ' so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ' level of productivity in society , ' whether they are worthy of health care . "
Pants on Fire !
' Death panels ' are not part of Obama 's health plan .
It 's not clear where Palin , the former Republican governor of Alaska , came up with this idea .
A " comparative effectiveness " board in the health care bill evaluates treatments , not patients .
And the board 's conclusions are n't binding .
And the bill allows Medicare to pay for counseling sessions on end - of - life care , but it 's not required ( and it does n't require euthenasia ! ) .
• John Boehner :
The Democrat - backed health care reform plan " will require ( Americans ) to subsidize abortion with their hard - earned tax dollars . "
False
In the first go - round , health bills did n't mention abortion .
A recent amendment , though , seeks to broker a neutral compromise .
People can choose a health plan with coverage for abortions , though not subsidized by tax dollars .
Another option will allow people to choose a plan with no abortion .
Boehner , the House Republican leader , is wrong that subsidies for abortion are required .
• Betsy McCaughey :
The health care reform bill " would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner . "
Pants on Fire !
There are no mandatory sessions .
Instead , for the first time , Medicare will cover doctor appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end - of - life issues .
These appointments are optional , and the AARP supports the measure .
McCaughey , a conservative commentator on health , misses the mark .
• Chain e-mail : " All non -US citizens , illegal or not , will be provided with free health care services . "
Pants on Fire !
Nobody gets completely free health care in the bill , and certainly not illegal immigrants .
The basis for this rumor is a generic nondiscrimination clause that says that insurers may not discriminate with regard to " personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services . "
But the e-mail leaps to an incorrect conclusion .
• Chain e-mail :
In the health care bill , " The ' Health Choices Commissioner ' will decide health benefits for you .
You will have no choice .
None . "
Pants on Fire !
The Health Choices Commissioner oversees a health insurance exchange where people shop for individual policies .
People will choose from several different offerings , so this statement is just wrong .
• Barack Obama : " If you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan . "
Half True
Obama was trying to make the point that employer - provided health insurance will stay in place under his plan .
But the truth is , employers will be free to change policies , just like they can now .
So you can only keep your health plan if your employer decided to keep it .
• Russ Carnahan : " The Congressional Budget Office most recently came out and analyzed the current ( health care ) plan and said that it was not only deficit - neutral , but also that over 10 years it would create a $ 6 billion surplus . "
False
The CBO has not scored the plan as deficit neutral .
In fact , they found that it would add $ 239 billion to the deficit over 10 years .
Democrats hope new pay - go legislation will help the CBO score , but the CBO has n't confirmed that .
Carnahan is a Democratic congressman from Missouri .
• Barack Obama : " Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin . "
Mostly True
Not in the short term .
But over the long haul , Medicare and Medicaid will consume the federal budget .
• Karl Rove :
Under a public health care option , 120 million Americans will " lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government - run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost - effective for them to drop coverage . "
False
Rove , a Republican strategist , cites a study that actually says that many people would select the cheapest health insurance plan if given a choice .
People would not be forced onto a government - run plan .
• Roy Blunt : " Democrats have failed to answer the most basic question of how they want to pay for the more than $ 1 trillion of health care spending . "
Mostly True
Blunt , a Republican congressman from Missouri , said this back in May , but it 's still Mostly True .
Democrats have different ideas on how to pay for health care , and it's one of the great unanswered questions in the debate so far .

Detectives in Scotland are pursuing " several potential lines of inquiry " as they renew the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing case .
Prosecutors said Libyan Abdelbasset al - Megrahi , who was convicted in 2001 of the murder of 270 people but freed in August , was not working alone .
The fresh investigation is possible because Megrahi dropped his second appeal before being returned to Libya .
Victims ' relatives welcomed the move but renewed calls for a public inquiry .
Forensic evidence Families of British victims were told in e-mails from the Crown Office - Scotland 's prosecuting authority - that a police review of the case had started .
Lindsey Miller , a senior Procurator Fiscal , wrote that police were following several new lines of inquiry , including a review of forensic evidence into the 1988 bombing .
The Crown Office in Scotland stressed there was " no question " of re-opening the case against Megrahi .
The Libyan , who remains the only person convicted of the atrocity , has terminal prostate cancer and was released from jail on compassionate grounds this summer .
But victims ' families are keen to bring to light evidence that was likely to emerge in Megrahi 's now - abandoned appeal case .
They have urged investigators to make the renewed probe " meaningful " .
Megrahi , who is terminally ill , was convicted of the bombing in 2001 Some 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York were killed in the bombing on 21 December 1988 , along with 11 people on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie .
Members of campaign group UK Families Flight 103 have delivered a letter to the UK prime minister asking for a full independent inquiry , and requesting a meeting with him .
In it they write : " We have waited patiently for almost 21 years to learn the full truth of what happened .
" Now we await Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's response to our renewed calls for a full inquiry into all the circumstances of the bombing . "
A spokeswoman said that since 1989 a succession of senior political figures had agreed in principle to an inquiry , but said it could not take place while a criminal investigation was ongoing .
" With the abandonment of Mr Megrahi 's appeal against his conviction , there has been no resolution to any aspect of responsibility for the bombing , " they said .
If [ the investigation ] is just a dodge to prevent an investigation into why the lives of those killed were not protected ...
I would be livid
Dr Jim Swire , relative and campaigner UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme he had not spoken to Libya about the decision to review the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing .
On a public inquiry , Mr Miliband said : " We have always said that this was something that happened over Scottish soil , it was investigated by the Scottish authorities , it is right that they pursue the investigation on a criminal basis and if there is any suggestion of an inquiry that should be a matter for the Scots , because that 's the way our system works . "
A Scottish government statement said it would welcome a wide - ranging inquiry into the circumstances of the Lockerbie atrocity .
However , it said : " Given the international dimensions to this issue , the remit of any such inquiry goes well beyond the restricted remit and responsibilities of the Scottish government or Scottish Parliament , and would therefore have to be convened by those with the required powers .
" Scottish authorities would cooperate in full in any such inquiry , and our police and prosecution services have done an excellent job throughout the Lockerbie investigation . "
Prosecutors have always believed Megrahi did not act alone Pamela Dix , whose brother Peter was killed in the bombing , said the announcement of the police review should be interpreted as a " good thing " but should not be used to replace a full public inquiry .
" Expectations around Megrahi 's appeal were really quite high but hopes were profoundly dashed when the appeal was abandoned .
The situation is unresolved and it is unfinished business , " she said .
She added : " We do not know what the motivation for the bombing was , who ordered it , why was it carried out , how was it allowed to happen with the amount of information that the intelligence services had ... concerning threats against American aviation .
" So not only do we not know what was the ultimate motivation for the bombing ... but we know really very little about what was actively done to try and prevent [ it ] . "
Dr Jim Swire , who has campaigned for a full inquiry into the bombing since his daughter Flora died in the atrocity , said : " I think that if they are really going to a meaningful investigation then that is all well and good and long overdue .
" But if it is just a dodge to prevent an investigation into why the lives of those killed were not protected then I would be livid . "

The final destination of the storm once known as Typhoon Parma is set .
The Parma forecast track takes it into Vietnam , south of Hanoi .
It regained intensity to tropical storm status over the past few days and moved across Hainan , which is a island province in China .
Bloomberg reports that 3 were killed there .
Parma has fallen back to a depression and will remain so as it moves into Vietnam .
The problem with this storm will be heavy rainfall .
The Vietnamese authorities are expecting a 4 meter ( 13 feet ) surge and with the storm moving along at just 7 kph ( 10 mph ) I would expect that big rainfall totals can be expected in parts of Vietnam .
3 weeks ago , Tropical Storm Ketsana produced flooding and landslides in the Philippines that killed some 337 people .
It then went and killed scores more with more flooding in Vietnam and Southeast Asia .
At least 163 died in Vietnam alone .
Then Typhoon Parma came to the Philippines a week later and destroyed crops as it moved northwest and then returned as a tropical storm and then a depression .
The resulting rains produced more devastating flooding and killed well over 200 more .
China View reports more than 600 have perished in the Philippines as a result of Ketsana and Parma .
Parts of the Philippines have been under deep , standing water for 3 weeks and officials are now concerned about the potential for disease .
Meanwhile , as they continue to find bodies in towns that had been buried in landslides , there is a shortage of coffins and at least 200 have had to be imported .
I ’ve reported on this calamity fairly frequently but the world seems to be more interested in other things .
The UN had made an appeal for $ 74 million in aid .
That is equivalent to about 1/4 of Alex Rodriguez total contract with the New York Yankees .
Yet , the BBC reports that the UN has only been able to secure $ 19 million of the $ 74 million in aid requested .

1. FOR METEOROLOGISTS .
2. 12 HOUR SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS .
A. OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS PARMA HAS CONTINUED TO SLOWLY DRIFT TO
THE WEST - NORTHWEST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ( STR )
TO THE NORTH OF PARMA .
CONVECTION REMAINS DEEPEST IN A SINGLE BAND ,
WRAPPING COMPLETELY AROUND THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER ( LLCC ) .
THE LLCC HAS REMAINED FREE OF CONVECTION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS , WITH
A RECENT DECREASE IN DEEP CONVECTION ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE
BAND , LIKELY DUE TO INCREASED LAND INTERACTION AFFECTING THE LOW
LEVEL INFLOW .
CURRENT INTENSITY IS BASED ON DVORAK ESTIMATES OF 35
KNOTS FROM PGTW AND RJTD .
3. FORECAST REASONING .
A. THE CURRENT FORECAST DEVIATES FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST IN
REGARDS TO TRACK , WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST TAKING PARMA FURTHER
NORTH .
THIS IS BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON PERSISTENCE AS MODEL GUIDANCE
HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW A SOUTHERN TURN WHILE PARMA HAS CONTINUED TO
TRACK WEST - NORTHWESTWARD .
BASED ON THIS THE FORECAST HAS BEEN SHIFTED
TO THE NORTH OF THE MODEL CONSENSUS .
B. PARMA WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK WEST - NORTHWESTWARD UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF THE STR , UNTIL IT MAKES LANDFALL IN VIETNAM .
AS PARMA
TRACKS INLAND , THE TRACK WILL FLATTEN IN A MORE WESTWARD DIRECTION ,
AND IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE QUICKLY OVER VIETNAM .
MODEL GUIDANCE ,
AS MENTIONED IN PARA 3.A. , HAS NOT SHOWN SKILL IN FORECASTING THIS
SYSTEM OVER THE PAST 12 TO 24 HOURS .
BASED ON THIS FACT , THE CURRENT

Sandoz Pharmaceuticals – the company who first synthesised LSD – sent this letter to ‘ Captain ’ Alfred Hubbard in 1955 along with forms enabling him to clear 43 boxes of LSD - 25 ampules through customs .
Hubbard ( a.k.a. The Johnny Appleseed of LSD ) was an intriguingly mysterious man who , due to his relentless promotion of the drug , is considered by some to be one of the most important figures in the history of LSD .
It is thought he owned the second largest stockpile of LSD on earth , behind Sandoz themselves , and was responsible for introducing many high - profile people to the drug before it was banned .
When this letter was written , Hubbard was Canada ’s sole licensed importer of Sandoz LSD .
Many thanks to Mansour for the tip .

In a San Francisco courtroom two weeks ago , a prominent lawyer opposed to same - sex marriage made a concession that could mark a turning point in the legal wars over the purpose and meaning of marriage .
The lawyer , Charles J. Cooper , has studied the matter deeply , and his erudite briefs are steeped in history .
He cannot have been blindsided by the question Judge Vaughn R. Walker asked him :
What would be the harm of permitting gay men and lesbians to marry ?
“ Your honor , my answer is : I do n’t know , ” Mr. Cooper said .
“ I do n’t know . ”
A couple of hours later , Judge Walker denied Mr. Cooper ’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to establish a constitutional right to same - sex marriage .
The concession and the ruling that followed it have transformed a federal lawsuit that had been viewed with suspicion by many gay rights advocates into something with the scent of promise .
The suit , filed in May by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies , made the bold claim that California ’s voters violated the federal Constitution last year when they overrode a decision of the state ’s Supreme Court allowing same - sex marriages .

In the wake of the crisis after a Swedish newspaper revealed the heinous , and criminal activity , of Israel which has been harvesting organs and body parts from murdered Palestinians and selling them on to the USA it seems that Israel is facing another crisis , this time with Norway .
The Norwegian Government Pension Fund , which has $ 400 billion in assets under management , has sold its $ 5.4 million holding in Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems Ltd .
The Israeli company Elbit systems Ltd provide a monitoring system which is the key contribution to the construction of the racist wall .
The Norwegian finance minister Kristin Halvorsen from the social democrat party the alliance of the labor party in the current government supported earlier wider boycott against the state of Israel due to its apartheid policy .
Halvorsen made it clear that Norway will not fund companies , which contribute in violations of international humanitarian law .
It must be mentioned here that the Norwegian Petroleum Fund 's Council on Ethics has concluded that an investment in the Israeli company leads to " unacceptable risk of contributing to the particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms " .
According to the Norwegian paper Dagbladet the Council on Ethics for the Norwegian Petroleum Fund came with his recommendation in May , and the fund has already sold out of the company .
The Hague Tribunal court in The Hague in 2004 recommended the states that are parties in the Geneva Convention to stand against the wall construction .
Norwegian authorities have the same vision and will provide support for this , says the finance minister .
In doing so the Norwegian Petroleum Fund 's Council on Ethics is implementing the recommendation of the International Court in The Hague from 2004 which clearly stated that the construction of security wall along the chosen route is a violation of international law .
The Hague court found out that than 90 percent of the wall goes over occupied territory in the West Bank .
The question of boycotting the apartheid state of Israel has been one of the questions raised in various academic and political circles in Europe because Israel has a long history in disrespecting the international law .
This question is often linked with the international boycott campaign of the apartheid South Africa which many think it has greatly contributed in the fall of that regime .
Therefore many think that imposing sanctions on the state of Israel would weaken the far right and the religious fascism which is in power in Israel .
Sweden ’s exposure of what can only be described as the Israeli body - organ harvest industry has crossed all lines of human decency toward occupied Palestinians .
Although these revelations has left all decent minded people reeling with disgust there has been very little international reaction to roundly condemn Israel and call for sanctions against them .
Norway is to be applauded for leading the way in taking positive steps to boycott Israel – the unanswered question remains .
Will the rest of the European community follow suit ?
My view is that we forfeit our own humanity if we allow this kind of heinous practice to go unchecked .
The EU and the European Human Rights organizations must put this issue on its list of priorities .
Likewise , the Palestinian authority needs to stop all political contacts with the apartheid regime in Israel which has been investing these contacts for its own benefit .
In the shadow of farcical , and often theatrical , negotiations between the Israel and the Palestinian authority Israel has constructed the racist wall which has ripped through the landscape destroying rural life , uprooting trees and families and causing immeasurable damage to the ecological system .
This has been deliberate vandalism – its aim is to drive people from their land and destroy Palestinian culture .
Israel ’s anti occupation activists have themselves concluded that nothing has worked to compel , or even encourage , Israel to stop the occupation .
Neve Gordon , an Israeli intellectual concluded that : ‘ It is therefore clear to me that the only way to counter the apartheid trend in Israel is through massive international pressure .
The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results , not even a settlement freeze , let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories . ’
It is time that the Europe takes a firm stand .
Words need to be wed with deeds because words alone are having no impact .
The injustice toward Palestinians not only continues , but as evidenced by the organ harvest scandal , it has plummeted to greater depths of depravity .
Describing Israel as an apartheid state and doing nothing to stop it makes the world an accessory to the crime .
Passivity in the face of such atrocities as the organ harvest from murdered Palestinians emboldens the Zionists – who are encouraged to keep moving the goal posts of evil doing .
The Norwegian boycott of Israel has made a bold statement that it will not condone its continued occupation of Palestine and violation of human rights .
Other foreign governments , companies , academics , art and entertainment communities as well as faith - based organizations , unions and citizens need to make the same ethical stand against Israel as it did against the former apartheid government of South Africa .
Boycotts worked then and they would work now .
Europe must disregard accusations of being called anti-Semitic .
This is empty rhetoric and an attempt by the Zionist regime to intimidate and discourage opposition to the criminal behavior of Israel .
A strong , united European stand against the crimes of Israel with an international boycott would send a clear message that the silence of its critics is over .
To do nothing would not only encourage Israel to commit more crimes it will intensify the culture of violence and revenge which ripped Europe apart in the first half of the last century .
While the Jewish communities around the world tell us ‘ never again ’ we watch the same atrocities being committed by Israeli ’s against Palestinians that the Nazi ’s stood accused of at Nuremburg .

I personally am one of the people who is extremely excited about the fact that the Chrome OS is now out in the hands of the community .
What this means to me is that as early as next year we could start seeing devices running the Chrome OS , which I personally can’t wait for .
I ’ve been in the market for a good netbook for over a year now , the problem is there is nothing out there that seems perfect for what I want .
I want something lightweight , fast and very portable with a slick interface and preferably touch screen .
The problem with the majority of netbooks out in the market right now is they are running off of a windows based operating system .
While there is nothing wrong with the Windows OS it seems more suited towards desktop computers and full fledged laptops as it is a heavily bloated OS .
This is where the Google Chrome OS comes into play .
Most people do n’t realize the role this operating system is trying to fill and it is causing a lot of confusion out there .
The Chrome OS is designed solely for internet - only devices .
The purpose is to provide users with a fast way to get connected to the internet to do a number of different tasks that can be completed online .
Google ’s goal seems to be driving your everyday activities to the cloud , further supported by Chrome OS ’s design .
This is what is difficult for people to grasp about Chrome , it ’s being designed to fill a gap that currently exist .
There are no operating System currently designed solely to get you online and manage your online applications .
Chrome OS is a large step forward for cloud computing , it is opening the doors for device manufacturers to easily create internet - only devices and for a lower cost .
I really do n’t believe that Microsoft has anything to be worried about in regards to the Chrome OS .
If they keep trying to put pressure into making Windows 7 viable for the netbook market I do n’t feel they are going to accomplish anything other than loosing money in the long run .
I already feel that Microsoft as a corperation spreads themselves to thin as it is and continuing to do so is going to bring them a lot more trouble than they are already in .
If they focused on building a stable desktop / laptop operating system and pushed that with their full effort I feel that they would be better off than trying to go toe to toe in the new market that Google is pushing .
Unfortunately , I can already see them competing directly with Chrome OS and coming out with their own even slimmer version of Windows 7 time that could be better spent improving on it ’s functionality and ease of use .
To get back on topic , I am pleased where Google is going with the Chrome OS and look forward to getting a device that is running it as soon as possible .
It will fit my needs perfectly , as all I need is something that will connect online and allow me to use all the online applications that I currently do already .
I will end with a video that I encourage you to watch that demonstrates why you would use the Chrome OS .
It 's the technology that brought us high - speed wireless and and now , one of Australia 's most significant scientific breakthroughs is set to fund future discoveries .
A team of CSIRO researchers has been the toast of the industry after finding the key to fast wireless networks and making $ 205 million in the process .
The technology has put the CSIRO well in the black for the first time in five years and now the peak science body wants to put back .
It has injected $ 150 million from the proceeds of its wi-fi technology to the once - defunct science and industry endowment fund , originally established by parliament in 1926 .
Work has already begun , with three initial grants having been set up , including $ 12 million for two wireless research projects and $ 7.5 million for up to 120 fellowships and scholarships .
What is SFINAE and why do we care ?
SFINAE ( Substitution Failure Is Not An Error ) is an acronym that was first introduced by David Vandevoorde to describe the compiler ’s process of eliding from the overload resolution set any template where a type substitution error would occur .
Let ’s take a look at the following program I shamelessly stole from boost ’s documentation :
int negate ( int i ) { return - i ; } template < typename T > typename T:: result_type negate ( T const &t ) { return - t ( ) ; }
Let ’s suppose you call negate ( 10 ) , even though the first negate would be a good match , the compiler has to also take into consideration the second templated version and try to instantiate it with int , generating the following code :
int :: result_type negate ( int const &t ) { return - t( ) ; }
Without SFINAE , the generated code would cause a compiler error since “ int ” does n’t have a “ result_type ” member but fortunately we do , so the problematic overload is silently ignored by the compiler .
As you will see , there are a few interesting and unexpected ways to use SFINAE .
In the following example , we ’ll check if a type is a container by checking if it has a iterator member with SFINAE via a technique called “ the sizeof trick ” .
First we need a type of some size , let ’s take char :
typedef char true_type ;
Then we need a type of some other size , it could be anything as long as its size is greater than the other we chosen before .
An easy way to ensure it is to simply make a structure containing an array of more than one of the other type .
struct false_type{ true_type _ [ 2 ] ; } ;
Now , we need a function with two overloads , one that will be called if the type passed contains an iterator , returning our true_type and another one that will be called when it does n’t , obviously returning our false_type .
template < typename T > true_type has_iterator_checker ( typename T::iterator *) ; template < typename T> false_type has_iterator_checker (... ) ;
In the preceding code snippet , our good match is a function taking a iterator pointer as parameter and returning our true_type .
Our worst match is the last match possible by the C++ conversion rules , the evil ellipsis , returning our false_type .
As you probably already remarked , you just need the function signatures because those functions are actually never going to be called since everything is done at compilation .
Now , it ’s time to assemble the parts of the puzzle :
# include < iostream > # include < vector > typedef char true_type ; struct false_type{ true_type _ [ 2 ] ; } ; template < typename T > true_type has_iterator_checker ( typename T::iterator *) ; template < typename T> false_type has_iterator_checker (... ) ; # define IS_CONTAINER(x ) ( sizeof ( has_iterator_checker < x > ( 0 ) ) == sizeof ( true_type ) ) int main ( ) { std::cout << " Is container ( int ) : " << IS_CONTAINER ( int ) << std::endl ; std::cout << " Is container ( std::vector <int > ) : " << IS_CONTAINER( std::vector<int >) << std::endl ; }
The only thing we have n’t seen yet in this code is the IS_CONTAINER macro .
It compares the size of the type returned by the most compatible overload chosen by the compiler to our true_type .
If the chosen overload returns true_type then our type is a container .
We can now check if a type is a container at compile time .
Our current solution is nice and functional but could really use better packaging .
I ’ll spare you the details and simply paste the code below :
template < typename T > class is_container { typedef char true_type ; struct false_type{ true_type _ [ 2 ] ; } ; template < typename U > static true_type has_iterator_checker ( typename U::iterator *) ; template < typename U > static false_type has_iterator_checker ( ... ) ; public : enum { value = ( sizeof ( has_iterator_checker < T > ( 0 ) ) == sizeof ( true_type ) ) } ; } ;
Hurray !
No more macros and we can easily check if a type is a container by simply doing is_container < my_type >:: value .
We ’re now the proud owners of a nice little is_container class and of a bit more knowledge about SFINAE .
Time to put that class to good use , but before , we will need another SFINAE trick to enable or disable code based on a condition .
A very simple code that opens up a lot of possibilities :
template < bool Cond , class T = void > struct enable_if { typedef T type ; } ; template < class T > struct enable_if < false , T > {} ;
To help explaining how it works , here ’s a small usage example :
template < typename T> typename enable_if < some_boolean_condition >:: type foo( T const &t ) { std::cout << t << std::endl ; }
The enable_if template takes two parameters , a boolean condition and a return type , which is “ void ” by default , that is simply the one the function would return if we did n’t use the template .
What ’s important in that template and where the magic happens is the :: type part .
If “ some_boolean_condition ” is true , then :: type returns the return type specified and the function is instantiated normally .
If “ some_boolean_condition ” is false , the specialization enable_if < false , T > will be used and since it does n’t have a :: type member , a substitution failure will occur causing the compiler to silently ignore the function .
With these new SFINAE based tools in our toolbox , we can easily make static dispatching based on the property of a type as you will see in the next example :
#include < algorithm > # include < iostream > # include < iterator > # include < vector >
/*enable_if and is_container should be here */ template < typename T > typename enable_if<!is_container<T>:: value >:: type super_print ( T const &t ) { std::cout << t << std::endl ; } template < typename T > typename enable_if < is_container <T>:: value >:: type super_print ( T const &t ) { typedef typename T::value_type value_type ; std::copy ( t.begin( ) , t.end ( ) , std::ostream_iterator<value_type>(std::cout , " , " ) ) ; std:: cout << std::endl ; } int main ( ) { super_print ( 10 ) ; std::vector<int > b ; b.push_back ( 1 ) ; b.push_back ( 2 ) ; b.push_back ( 3 ) ; super_print ( b ) ; }
That simple code resumes everything we learned so far to allow easy printing of variables and containers .
Without using enable_if , there would be an ambiguity since they both have the signature “ void ( T const & ) ” but having enable_if , we can enable or disable either template overload depending on the fact that it contains an “ iterator ” member or not , solving the issue .
That ’s it for today , as you saw , SFINAE is yet another of C++’s hidden powers giving you the opportunity to make things that the language was n’t designed for .
Written by Alice Taylor , commissioning editor for education at Channel 4 , the essay flies in the face of Westminster ’s Digital Britain report , which recommended that persistent file - sharers should have their internet access restricted or even barred .
Taylor argues that enforcing out - dated attitudes on how information is shared – ie , paying for it – is “ a dying behemoth ” .
She writes : “ We must not let these dying behemoths take away someone ’s internet access – and connection to the world – for some accusatory , unprovable ‘ piracy ’ claim , ever . ”
Taylor was commissioned to write the essay for Perspectives , a website designed to engage with Scotland ’s creative industries and practitioners , ahead of the establishment of Creative Scotland , the body being formed by the merging of Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council .
The essay is aimed at provoking debate about intellectual property , copyright and accessibility .
The issue has vexed bands from Metallica to Radiohead and is one which Creative Scotland will form a policy on when it comes into being next spring .
Taylor said that “ copyright maximalists ” like the former Undertones singer and head of UK Music Fergal Sharkey were wrong in wanting people to go back to buying music and “ respecting copyright ” .
UK Music is the umbrella organisation for the music industry .
Access is key to success , and piracy was “ simply demand where supply does not exist , ” said Taylor .
She added that using “ pointless protection mechanisms ” and regulation , “ restricts a person ’s ability , as a creator , to be discovered ” .
One of Scotland ’s most respected authorities on intellectual property believes Taylor has a point about the way the creative industries talk about internet piracy .
It should not be about individuals , said Professor Hector MacQueen , from the University of Edinburgh ’s Law School .
“ The creative industries do go on about piracy in a way that is incorrect , ” he said .
“ Some of the rhetoric that rights - holders use is legally illiterate .
Piracy is defined as commercial counterfeiters rather than being about individuals . ”
Alison Butchart , from the Intellectual Assets Centre in Glasgow , said the ideal way forward , balancing a youthful generation ’s reluctance to pay for anything online with the commercial needs of the artist , would be to follow the Spotify and YouTube models , where artists get a share of the site ’s advertising revenue when their song or video gets played for free .
Despite being an issue reserved to Westminster , Creative Scotland will draw up a policy on intellectual property and copyright .
Ewan Brown , chairman of Creative Scotland 09 Ltd , said : “ Essentially , there is a balance to be struck between the right of the creator to be rewarded for their talent and the benefits to creative development that the widest accessibility offers .
“ Creative Scotland , when established , will aim to support artists and creative practitioners to recognise the benefits and implications of protecting , selling and sharing their work and talent . ”
The energy use by the agricultural sector of the economy has been widely discussed and debated in the peak oil community .
The amount of energy used directly at farms is not very large ; typical claims for the fuel required to cover a field with a plow or other implement are in the range of one gallon of diesel per acre per pass .
Assuming seeding , harvesting and 3 other passes per year , the total comes to approximately 750 MJ per acre per year .
Nitrogen fertilizer applied at 200 pounds of nitrogen per acre would account for another 4600 MJ per acre 1 .
Residues from many crops such as corn can supply over 20 GJ per acre and energy sources such as wood chips and fuel grasses are even more productive .
Farming operations such as dairies have already become net exporters of energy as electricity .
This suggests that even a mechanized farm can be self - sufficient in energy , and " fast crash " doom scenarios involving the collapse of farming are not very likely .
1 Farming before powered machinery
Before self - powered farm machinery , there were draft animals .
They were slow to reproduce and train , and often dangerous to work .
They were fed using the one quarter to one third of land fallowed as pasture at any given time .
Some grain ( such as oats ) was also needed as supplemental feed .
Despite use of animal manures as fertilizer , the yields of the time were not very high .
40 bushels of corn ( maize ) per acre were typical .
Combined with fallowed acreage , net productivity was a fraction of today 's averages .
Productivity was also low ; a double - furrow plow pulled by 3 or 4 horses could only plow 2.5 acres per day .
2 The transition to modern practices : steam tractors
The change to steam gave several major improvements .
Steam engines could use any fuel which would burn in the fire box ; it did not have to be suitable for animal food .
They also did not have to be " fed " when not working .
Last , the productivity went up radically ; one man on a steam tractor could plow 25 to 40 acres per day .
The thermal efficiency of open - cycle steam engines is quite low , roughly 5 % .
Guessing from the efficiency of modern diesel engines , it would have taken perhaps 1.2 GJ of fuel to make one pass over an acre .
This is about 180 pounds of firewood , or a considerably smaller amount of coal .
Being able to plow several acres with the wood from one tree was a huge improvement over draft animals .
3 Internal combustion engines ( ICEs ) and their efficiency
Internal combustion engines are much more efficient than piston steam engines , as well as much more convenient to operate .
Thermal efficiency of medium - speed diesel engines runs upwards of 40 % , and low - speed marine diesels can top 50 % .
Internal combustion engines can also operate on biofuels , with handicaps which depend on the exact fuel fed to the engine .
4 Homegrown ICE fuel supplies
While current vehicles and farm equipment are fairly finicky about their fuel , the generic ICE is quite adaptable .
Spark - ignition ICEs can be run on everything from petroleum to ammonia to carbon monoxide made from partial combustion of charcoal .
Diesel engines are somewhat fussier , but they can be " co- fueled " with some amount of liquid used to ignite a charge of air and a high - octane gaseous fuel .
The addition of gaseous fuel to diesel intake air is called fumigation .
Kits are available to fumigate propane into diesels to improve their power and reduce their smoke emissions .
Most current farm equipment has diesel engines .
One of the features of the fast - crash doom scenario is that there will be little or no time to make major adaptations for different fuel supplies , so the most interesting possibilities are those which can be
built from common materials and
retrofitted to existing engines .
Are there significant possibilities out there ?
I believe there are .
Here 's a short list off the top of my head :
Straight vegetable oil ( SVO ) .
SVO is one step removed from biodiesel , but requires no methanol or other processing .
It can be used directly after pressing so long as it is filtered so as not to clog pumps and injectors .
SVO must be kept hot to thin it enough to atomize , so engines must be fully warm before using it .
This can be accomplished by heating the fuel and coolant externally , or starting and warming up on petroleum diesel or biodiesel .
The fuel system must be flushed of SVO before the engine is allowed to cool off again .
Supplies of SVO are likely to be limited , but if SVO is used for a " pilot injection " to ignite a charge of another fuel it can be stretched considerably .
Fumigated bio-gas .
Bio -gas can be produced from animal wastes and stored in tanks .
Introducing gas into diesel intake air creates a fuel - air charge which ignites and burns when oil is injected by the conventional fuel system .
It is not usable as the sole fuel in a diesel engine , but it can stretch the supply of liquid fuel .
A dual - fuel biomethane bus in the UK expects biomethane to supply 60 - 80 % of its fuel .
As no biomethane is used when the engine is at idle , agricultural equipment could expect to use a higher fraction of biogas than a bus .
The downside of biogas is that it is a gas , and storage cylinders are heavy and bulky .
Materials likely to be on - hand would leave a a great deal to be desired : low - pressure cylinders such as propane tanks can contain biogas but would hold relatively little fuel even if it is purified to remove CO2 .
A 250 - gallon propane " pig " pressurized to 250 PSI would hold the equivalent of about 4 gallons of diesel fuel .
It might be possible to get work done this way , but refueling would be very frequent and take a great deal of time away from work .
Fumigated producer gas .
Gas does not have to be delivered to the vehicle ; it can be produced on board from solid or liquid fuels .
The technology for using gasogenes to produce fuel gas for a combustion engine was brought to a high level of refinement during previous periods of oil rationing ( such as WWII ) .
Gasogenes were revisited by the USDA during the 70's oil price shocks , and designs created which could be built out of available materials to power tractors in the event of fuel shortages .
Gasogenes can use most any dry combustible matter as fuel .
Wood chips and charcoal are conventional feedstocks .
Dried grass pellets and torrefied biomass are other possibilities .
Combustible liquids may be used also ; a liquid fuel which is not suitable for an engine 's fuel system may be turned into a gas for fumigation .
5 Biofuel energy requirements
For the sake of argument , let 's start with a sub - optimal energy system .
Dried biomass loses very little of the original energy ( though biomass may not remain dry unless it is stored correctly ) .
Torrefaction retains roughly 90 % of the energy of the original biomass in the product .
Pyrolysis oil retains about 70 % .
Production of charcoal may yield about 50 % in the solid product ( the remainder comes off as gas and heat ) .
Therefore , let 's assume the use of charcoal as the fuel product .
Next , let 's assume conversion of charcoal to producer gas in a gasogene .
The fuel portion of charcoal is almost entirely carbon .
Carbon has a heat of combustion of 93960 cal / mol , while carbon monoxide has 68560 cal / mol ; 73 % of the energy of carbon is retained in the gas product of the gasogene , not including any CO 2 from the exhaust gas recycled to CO using excess heat .
The hypothetical conversion efficiency from biomass through charcoal to fuel gas in the vehicle is thus 37 % ( not including any productive use of heat or off - gas created in the production of the charcoal ) .
If the vehicle is a farm tractor or combine which requires 1 gallon - equivalent of energy per acre per pass , of which 90 % is coming from fuel gas produced from charcoal , 5 passes per season requires 1.7 million BTU of biomass .
A further 10 % of liquid fuel , or 700 kBTU / ac / year , is needed for pilot ignition ; since this is relatively small I 'll just count it at volume parity with petroleum diesel .
This comes to 0.5 gallon per acre per year .
6 Biofuel feedstock availability
The amount of available feedstock depends on the productivity of the crop and the fraction which winds up as byproducts , but we can get some estimates .
At a yield of 150 bushels per acre , corn ( maize ) produces roughly 1.5 dry tons of excess stover ( not needed for erosion control ) per acre , of which 15 - 20 % ( 0.22 - 0.3 tons ) is cobs .
At 17.4 million BTU per ton , the actual fuel requirement is less than 0.1 tons of biomass .
Corn would in fact yield a very large excess of biomass energy beyond the needs for farm machinery working the field .
Oil for ignition can also come from corn .
At 0.5 gal / ac / yr , the ignition requirements can be met by the oil from about 2.5 bushels / acre of corn ( 0.2 gal / bu ) .
The byproduct of pressing is also usable as food .
Other crops also appear to produce sufficient byproduct biomass .
The yield of wheat straw from winter wheat is over 2 tons per acre .
If the main crop does not yield oil , some small amount of land can be devoted to oilseeds .
Sunflowers or canola will do for this .
At a yield of 77 gallons per acre , one acre of canola would supply ignition fuel to till and harvest 150 acres .
Such a modest amount of oil would be easy to produce locally .
These figures suggest that the energy situation of most farms is not nearly as bad as some paint it .
Even assuming the least - efficient pathway for converting biomass to vehicle fuel ( charcoal ) , farms still appear to generate much more energy as non-food biomass than they need to run machinery .
Machinery has the virtues of not having to be bred up from small initial stocks , requires no animal training and no major changes in farm practices and skills , and certainly is not going to be stolen and eaten .
6 Biofuel energy excess and nitrogen fixation
The amount of excess energy from crop byproducts suggests that they might be exchanged for other necessary farm inputs .
For instance , bio-oil ( pyrolysis oil ) can be produced from almost any finely - divided dry biomass .
It preserves about 70 % of the energy of the biomass , and is a relatively dense liquid which seems fairly easy to handle .
One ton per acre of corn stover would yield about 12.2 million BTU of bio-oil .
If this were used as a natural gas substitute in an ammonia plant , it would suffice to produce roughly 680 pounds of ammonia , containing 560 pounds of nitrogen .
Most nitrogen application rates for corn are under 200 pounds per acre ( some recommendations as little as ~ 50 lb / ac ) , so corn would be enough to provide a large excess of nitrogen fertilizer also .
This analysis does not look at the energy economy of livestock operations .
Anaerobic digestion of manure from cattle , chickens and swine produces more fuel gas than many of them can use ; already many farms have turned into net producers of electricity generated from biogas .
While the excess is small on the scale of society , it does suggest that rural farming areas may be able to keep the lights on without purchasing energy .
Conclusions
Some have suggested that shortages of petroleum could produce a collapse of mechanized farming in the near term , with all that implies .
This scenario does not appear to be realistic .
Known methods appear to be able to keep farm machinery operational using only the energy produced on farms themselves , mostly using food byproducts rather than dedicated fuel crops ; this is considerably better than the food requirements of draft animals .
The superiority of machinery over animal power , both for productivity and economy and reliability of energy supply , guarantees that it would continue to be maintained and used for some time even if the " fast crash " scenarios come to pass .

A wit said to me ‘ people think population is like a party – the more the better ’ .
But what if the beer runs out ?
What if the empties start piling up round our chin ?
What if the queue for the toilet gets so long people are busting ?
When Easter Island was discovered by Westerners it was treeless , but contained evidence that it had hosted not only forests but an advanced Polynesian civilisation , by then nearly extinct .
An extra 2 to 3 billion people will be living on the planet in five decades time .
There ’s already 6.8 billion of us .
Will 9 and a bit billion be a problem ?
None of these are likely in the short term : a shortage of food ; of space ; of water ; of oxygen ; of fuel .
Space remains abundant .
Particular types of fuel may dry up , but the sun and the tides will replenish us .
Water could be problematic , but rationing means it is unlikely to ever get critical .
Beware extrapolation – humans are good at solving problems .
Soylent Green remains fiction .
Nevertheless , the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates we would need 3 planets if the world ’s entire population had European living standards .
The problems of the global population may not be shortages but abundances .
Humankind is , for the first time , dragging hundreds of millions out of poverty , and catapulting a proportion of those toward the kind of first - world affluence we take for granted .
This is exciting .
But simultaneous explosions in growth and wealth might create an abundance of waste :
Carbon pollution , sewage , rubbish , nuclear waste , and particle pollution .
One reason for being cautious about the environmental effects of population growth is explained by the concept of ecology – the interlinkages of natural systems .
It was influential when it was developed .
Regrettably , we have survived enough extinctions and environmental degradation by now that the fear of accidentally making our environment uninhabitable has less traction .
But our dependence on air , soil and water mean conserving health of seas , rivers and forests is important .
We are as isolated in space as Easter Island is in the Pacific .
It would be tragic to see the example but not heed it .
We can and should act from a diversity of angles .
Regulations , regulated markets for ‘ bads ’ ( e.g. tradable carbon permits ) and technical progress will all be important in capping the environmental impact of simultaneous explosions in growth and wealth .
No solution should countenance leaving individuals in dire poverty .
If there is a limit to how many people may enjoy wealth , it is better that there be fewer individuals .
The only way to cut population is by influencing the birth rate .
This raises a question of whether people have a right to have children .
The answer must be yes .
But not an unlimited right .
If we agree there is a limit to growth ( or a reasonable probability of a limit ) , then beyond a certain number , making babies will ( or is likely to ) inhibit someone else from enjoying their rights to clean air , water , a functioning ecology , etc .
Conflicting rights mean action can justifiably be taken to try to shape people ’s behaviour .
RESPONSES
Assume we think that the problems described are plausible , and the reasons to tackle them sound .
What then ?
China ’s one - child policy is too harsh .
It has been linked to forced abortion and infanticide .
It reportedly applies to about 35 percent of the population and has brought the fertility rate to 1.8 , from 2.9 in 1979 .
It would likely not work outside a repressive dictatorship , but , surprisingly , it is not a leading source of social discontent in that country , with 76 percent support .
Many couples with exemptions from the policy have only one child for social reasons .
Will development do it ?
“ For the world as a whole , the number of children born per woman decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005 ”
and
“ The population of 51 countries or areas , including Germany , Italy , Japan and most of the successor States of the former Soviet Union , is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005 . ”
The problem for population control may not lack of incentive but lack of means :
The lack of access to contraception and abortion ; and lack of power of women in much of the world means family planning is difficult or impossible .
If these problems were tractable , population growth could be curbed without application of further incentives , at the same time as fostering self - determination in women .
PROBLEMS
Migration .
Sadly , overpopulation may be addressed not for the reasons described above , but because the first world fears the migration flows that third world population growth could spark .
The population of Pakistan will go from 169 million now to 295 million in 2050 .
While many developed countries will stabilise , the poorest countries will grow fastest :
National population growth rates .
Coordination – Individual countries may not see the problem .
Countries are individually stronger with more people .
But the aggregate effect is to burden the globe , which is the ultimate closed system .
Any meaningful population policy will have to be instituted globally .
This means relying on the UN .
hmm .
Benefits of many children
In many poor countries , children are a source of material security for the family .
They tend the crops and provide for their parents in their old age .
Any global population policy could be seen as de facto discrimination .
It ’s easy for the first world to suggest such a policy , as it is less likely to affect their reproductive intentions .
The benefits of this policy flow widely , but the majority of the change must be made by the poor .
Any implementation would have to be broadly agreed and matched by targeted compensation , perhaps in the form of aid .
Too many Boys In China , all manner of social ills are predicted as a result of the gender imbalance that the one - child policy has produced .
Including global war .
… and finally … .
‘ Making predictions is hard .
Especially about the future . ’
Malthus was considered quite the visionary in the eighteenth century .
He was worried about the global population when it rested at a mere billion , and predicted pereptual cycles of famine .
He said :
“ The constant effort towards population … increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased . ”
Then he married his cousin .
More recently , Stanford population Professor Paul Ehrlich “ predicted , in the late 1960s , that hundreds of millions would die from a coming overpopulation - crisis in the 1970s , and that by 1980 inhabitants of the United States would have a life - expectancy of only 42 years . ”
Yeah , well .

Was Newton right and Einstein wrong ?
It seems that unzipping the fabric of spacetime and harking back to 19th - century notions of time could lead to a theory of quantum gravity .
Physicists have struggled to marry quantum mechanics with gravity for decades .
In contrast , the other forces of nature have obediently fallen into line .
For instance , the electromagnetic force can be described quantum - mechanically by the motion of photons .
Try and work out the gravitational force between two objects in terms of a quantum graviton , however , and you quickly run into trouble — the answer to every calculation is infinity .
But now Petr Hoava , a physicist at the University of California , Berkeley , thinks he understands the problem .
It ’s all , he says , a matter of time .
More specifically , the problem is the way that time is tied up with space in Einstein ’s theory of gravity : general relativity .
Einstein famously overturned the Newtonian notion that time is absolute — steadily ticking away in the background .
Instead he argued that time is another dimension , woven together with space to form a malleable fabric that is distorted by matter .
The snag is that in quantum mechanics , time retains its Newtonian aloofness , providing the stage against which matter dances but never being affected by its presence .
These two conceptions of time do n’t gel .
The solution , Hoava says , is to snip threads that bind time to space at very high energies , such as those found in the early universe where quantum gravity rules .
“ I ’m going back to Newton ’s idea that time and space are not equivalent , ” Hoava says .
At low energies , general relativity emerges from this underlying framework , and the fabric of spacetime restitches , he explains .
Hoava likens this emergence to the way some exotic substances change phase .
For instance , at low temperatures liquid helium ’s properties change dramatically , becoming a “ superfluid ” that can overcome friction .
In fact , he has co-opted the mathematics of exotic phase transitions to build his theory of gravity .
So far it seems to be working : the infinities that plague other theories of quantum gravity have been tamed , and the theory spits out a well - behaved graviton .
It also seems to match with computer simulations of quantum gravity .
Hoava ’s theory has been generating excitement since he proposed it in January , and physicists met to discuss it at a meeting in November at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario .
In particular , physicists have been checking if the model correctly describes the universe we see today .
General relativity scored a knockout blow when Einstein predicted the motion of Mercury with greater accuracy than Newton ’s theory of gravity could .
Can Hoava gravity claim the same success ?
The first tentative answers coming in say “ yes . ” Francisco Lobo , now at the University of Lisbon , and his colleagues have found a good match with the movement of planets .
Others have made even bolder claims for Hoava gravity , especially when it comes to explaining cosmic conundrums such as the singularity of the big bang , where the laws of physics break down .
If Hoava gravity is true , argues cosmologist Robert Brandenberger of McGill University in a paper published in the August Physical Review D , then the universe did n’t bang — it bounced .
“ A universe filled with matter will contract down to a small — but finite — size and then bounce out again , giving us the expanding cosmos we see today , ” he says .
Brandenberger ’s calculations show that ripples produced by the bounce match those already detected by satellites measuring the cosmic microwave background , and he is now looking for signatures that could distinguish the bounce from the big bang scenario .
Hoava gravity may also create the “ illusion of dark matter , ” says cosmologist Shinji Mukohyama of Tokyo University .
In the September Physical Review D , he explains that in certain circumstances Hoava ’s graviton fluctuates as it interacts with normal matter , making gravity pull a bit more strongly than expected in general relativity .
The effect could make galaxies appear to contain more matter than can be seen .
If that ’s not enough , cosmologist Mu- In Park of Chonbuk National University in South Korea believes that Hoava gravity may also be behind the accelerated expansion of the universe , currently attributed to a mysterious dark energy .
One of the leading explanations for its origin is that empty space contains some intrinsic energy that pushes the universe outward .
This intrinsic energy cannot be accounted for by general relativity but pops naturally out of the equations of Hoava gravity , according to Park .
Hoava ’s theory , however , is far from perfect .
Diego Blas , a quantum gravity researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( EPFL ) in Lausanne has found a “ hidden sickness ” in the theory when double - checking calculations for the solar system .
Most physicists examined ideal cases , assuming , for instance , that Earth and the sun are spheres , Blas explains : “ We checked the more realistic case , where the sun is almost a sphere , but not quite . ”
General relativity pretty much gives the same answer in both the scenarios .
But in Hoava gravity , the realistic case gives a wildly different result .
Along with Sergei M. Sibiryakov , also at EPFL , and Oriol Pujolas of CERN near Geneva , Blas has reformulated Hoava gravity to bring it back into line with general relativity .
Sibiryakov presented the group ’s model in September at a meeting in Talloires , France .
Hoava welcomes the modifications .
“ When I proposed this , I did n’t claim I had the final theory , ” he says .
“ I want other people to examine it and improve it . ”
Gia Dvali , a quantum gravity expert at CERN , remains cautious .
A few years ago he tried a similar trick , breaking apart space and time in an attempt to explain dark energy .
But he abandoned his model because it allowed information to be communicated faster than the speed of light .
“ My intuition is that any such models will have unwanted side effects , ” Dvali thinks .
“ But if they find a version that does n’t , then that theory must be taken very seriously . ”

You may have read the widely - reported news that The Walt Disney Company is paying refunds to all people who purchased their Baby Einstein , Baby Shakespeare , or Baby Mozart videos since 2004 “ that did not make children into geniuses . ”
Here are a couple of sample Customer Service Line complaints recently received by the company at their Burbank , CA headquarters …
Phone rings at the Customer Service Department , The Walt Disney Company .
“ Good morning , Customer Service .
How may I help you today ? ”
“ Yeah .
I want to return these Baby Einstein videos of yours for a full refund . ”
“ What seems to be the problem , sir ? ”
“ The problem ?
The problem ??
The problem is , I feel like I ’m stuck in a pre-Einsteinian time warp when the Universe was static and governed only by Newton ’s Law of Gravity and Maxwell ’s Law of Electromagnetism .
Only the problem is , it ’s my Universe that ’s static , my Universe with my kid !
I bought your videos because I had this kid who I suspected was a bit of a dud when he popped out , just kind of lying there uninterested in anything , y’know ?
I mean , rattles , keys , everything , and nothing cranked his cranium !
So I parked him in front of your videos to make him into a genius just like you said and you know what ?
After months and months of watching , even after I offered him ice cream if he could tell me that Newton said mass and separation distance was what determined gravity and that there was a force called Action at a Distance that made everything attract and that Einstein came along with a new theory of gravity which posited that space gets bent by energy and how that changed our whole conception of the Universe – even for ice cream , he still could n’t get any of it !
None of it !!
Nothing , man !!!
Nada !!!
He ’s a dud !!!
Still !!!
In fact , I think he ’s actually more of a dud now than the dud he was before we watched your stupid videos !
He ’s duddier !
Yeah , that ’s right !
Duddier !
Is that even possible ???
I mean , really !
Look , I want my money back !
All of it ! ”
“ Sir , how old is your child now ? ”
“ Two . ”
“ That ’s a lot to expect of a two - year - old , do n’t you think , sir ? ”
“ Hey , genius , it ’s a do - it - yourself home genius maker product , is n’t it ?
That ’s what you guys pretty much advertised , did n’t you ?
If you ’d advertised cake making videos and we bought them and could n’t make a goddamn angel food cake you ’d give me my money back , right ?
You gotta watch Baby Einstein to make Baby Einstein , right ?
That ’s what you said and that ’s what we did !
And now my little ‘ genius ’ ca n’t even account for those 0.011 degrees that Newton ’s Theory of Gravity neglected !
My little ‘ genius ’ can’t predict , or even begin to understand , even as a simple solution , the entire existence of black holes !
So yeah , I ’m pissed !!! ”
“ We ’ll provide you with a full refund right away , sir . ”
“ Good .
You should .
And you should change the name of your product to Baby Dudstein while you ’re at it ! ”

How may I help you today ? ”
“ I bought your Baby Mozart series of videos ?
I ’m afraid my baby is a musical moron . ”
“ A musical moron ?
Are you sure , ma’am ? ”
“ Well , I ’ve tried everything .
Humming to her , singing to her , playing the accordion to her – ”
“ Ma’am , do n’t you think the accordion would turn anybody off music ? ”
“ Oh ?
You really think so ? ”
“ Oh yes , ma’am .
I think the only thing worse than the actual accordion itself is actual accordion music .
And the only thing worse than actual accordion music is polka music .
Now , you did n’t play polka music on an accordion for your baby now , did you ma’am ? ”
“ But , but … there is n’t much else you can play on the accordion ! ”
“ Oh my God !
You ’ve done the musical equivalent of feeding your baby raw mercury for breakfast !
This is terrible , ma’am !
Your baby could be damaged beyond saving ! ”
“ No ! Noooo !!
Oh , please do n’t say that !
Ca n’t you do something ?!! ”
“ Oh , jeez , ma’am , I do n’t know .
These accordion cases are never good . ”
“ Please , oh please !
I ’m begging you !
This is my baby !! ”
“ I do n’t know .
Accordions and polkas are like virulent invasive pathogens – once past the myelin sheath protecting the nerves of the brain , the affliction is nearly irreversible !
I ’ve seen grown men move and spin around like weird dancing puppets , legs uncontrollably akimbo , once exposed !
It ’s an awful thing to see , ma’am , truly awful .
A tragedy . ”
“ Oh , what have I done ??
I ’ll never forgive myself ! ”
“ Okay , okay , I ’ll try to help her , ma’am .
Let ’s look on the bright side – this is definitely the answer !
This is why your baby appears to be so moronic ! ”
“ Oh , thank God !!!
Please help us !
Please ! ”
“ For sure !
Now , stay with me on this : we call it Baby Mozart for a reason , ma’am .
We did n’t call it Baby Accordy - on Moron , now did we ?
“ No … ”
“ And we did n’t call it Baby Beer Barrel Polka , now did we ? ”
“ No … ”
“ Good .
Stay with me now and maybe your baby can be saved .
First , get her off that accordion and polka stuff right away !
Place her immediately in a sterile and isolated barium chamber until her brainwaves return to normal . ”
“ Got it .
I ’m doing that right now . ”
“ Excellent !
Now , start her on a daily regimen of Mozart ’s Jupiter Symphony along with his Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute operas now !
Once every hour , around the clock , you must expose her to something wonderfully Mozartean !
With fluids and rest in between , she may , I repeat , may , recover , so long as the damage is n’t permanent .
If so , she could be fully musical in a few days ! ”
“ Oh , thank you so much ! ”
“ I have to ask – why ’d you do it , ma’am ?
The accordion , I mean .
And the polka music .
It ’s… it ’s… borderline …
I hate to say it , but … torture . ”
“ You do n’t understand .
I live on the Upper East Side .
The Upper East Side for a young Jewish mother like me is a viciously competitive jungle of savagery and early death .
I ’m just trying to get her into Fieldston or Trevor or the 92nd St. Y Preschool , the top top top preschools , and the most fiercely competitive .
I just want her to have a chance !
You ’ve given us that chance to survive the entry requirements !
I ca n’t thank you enough !
I– I ’ll… never forget you ! ”
“ You are most welcome , ma’am !
Any way we can help , we will ! ”
“ Any chance I can still get that refund ? ”
“ None . ”

News in Science
Dust storm triggers ocean bloom
The red dust storm that dumped thousands of tonnes of soil across eastern Australia two weeks ago has caused an explosion in microscopic life in Sydney Harbour and beyond .
Researchers analysing the impact say the finding validates plans to increase fish stocks to feed some of the world 's poorest people using ocean fertilisation .
Professor Ian Jones , director of the Ocean Technology Group at University of Sydney , says enriching oceans with nitrogen will also aid the fight against climate change .
Jones ' comments follow an analysis of the impact on the sea of the 23 September dust storm that swept across New South Wales and southeast Queensland .
At its peak the storm carried about 140,000 tonnes of soil an hour from central Australia .
Tripling in size
An estimated 4000 tonnes of dust settled on Sydney , while Jones and his colleagues calculate about three million tonnes landed in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand .
Measurements taken at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science on the harbour 's north shore show a tripling of microscopic plant life , or phytoplankton , at the Chowder Bay site and in samples taken 10 kilometres off shore .
The scientists measure the presence of phytoplankton using remote sensing technology that can detect chlorophyll in the plants , which form the base of the ocean food chain .
Jones says phytoplankton needs nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate to grow , nutrients that are scarce in what he calls Australia 's " desert " ocean waters , but were abundant in the topsoil that blew across the country .
Like all plants , phytoplankton take in carbon dioxide from the air , which is carried to the bottom of the ocean when the plants die .
Jones says it is estimated eight million tonnes of CO2 was captured by the extra two million tonnes of phytoplankton that grew in the Tasman Sea , the equivalent of a month 's emissions from a coal - fired power station .
He says the dust storm was a natural experiment that supports their work in fertilising the ocean by adding nitrogen - rich urea to the sea .
According to Jones this promotes the growth of phytoplankton near the surface of the ocean , which then leads to an increase in fish numbers .
Further tests
Jones and colleague Associate Professor Rob Wheen , also of Sydney University , are waiting for approval to test the approach in Australian sea waters .
They want to inject 2.5 tonnes of urea into the ocean to increase the amount of phytoplankton in a controlled area .
" More phytoplankton growth means more stocks of fish .
I see much promise in ocean nourishment being able to provide economical protein for vast numbers of malnourished people , " says Jones .
He says a continuously nourished patch of water about 20 kilometres in diameter could double the income of artisan fishermen in countries such as Morocco , and provide a constant source of protein to local people .
" All this while storing 10 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean , " he says .
A Nature paper earlier this year questioned the amount of CO2 captured through ocean fertilisation and raised concerns about increases in algal blooms .
Jones says these criticisms were directed at research that used iron to enrich the ocean , rather than nitrogen .
He says the harbour findings show there is little danger to the environment from enriching the sea with nitrogen - five days after the dust storm phytoplankton levels were back to normal .
Fort Hood shooting : Pentagon ' to investigate mental health in military '
Worried that the US Army may have missed warning signs about the mental state of the alleged shooter in the Fort Hood massacre , the Pentagon is likely to open an inquiry into how all the military services keep watch on other volatile soldiers hidden in their ranks .
Who are these people ?
I am not referring to the pathetic parents of “ Balloon Boy , ” whose fake drama I have been unable to escape while on the treadmill this week , thanks to my gym ’s insistence on tuning its flat - screen TVs to Wolf Blitzer ’s nonstop self - parody .
The Colorado incident was significant only in the tawdriness of those who perpetrated the made - for - TV scam and their allies in the mindless media who covered this sham “ reality ” so relentlessly .
But even so , it was enough to push aside most consideration of the true hoax reported last week with far less fervor : the obscene rewards that Wall Street bankers bestowed upon themselves for ripping off our economy .
The people I want to know more about are the superrich who expect to be rewarded for their failures , like the folks at Goldman Sachs who will receive $ 16.71 billion in bonuses — an average of $ 530,000 per employee — this year after their company did as much as any to bring the world economy to the brink of disaster .
“ The Guys from Government Sachs ” is what The New York Times once called them in recognition of their chokehold on the federal government .
Their power is marked by the two treasury secretaries who led the fight to legally enable and then reward Wall Street for its obscene excesses .
Why was n’t there a CNN stakeout at the homes of former Goldman - execs - turned - treasury - chiefs Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson aimed at finding out how they feel about the almost $ 7 billion profit that Goldman Sachs made in the last two quarters in the wake of the government ’s bailout of the firm ?
They were both deeply involved last fall , along with Rubin protégé and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , then head of the New York Fed , in saving Goldman as archrival Lehman Brothers was forced to go belly up .
As opposed to Lehman , Goldman was allowed to change its status and become a commercial bank qualifying for Federal Reserve and TARP funding .
Goldman received $ 10 billion in immediate bailout funds , and we are supposed to be grateful that the company has paid it back in return for an end to any pretense of government control over its executive compensation .
The additional cool $ 12.9 billion that Goldman received from the government as a pass - through from the bailout of AIG to cover Goldman ’s toxic paper is money the investment bank has no intention of ever paying back .
The rationale for saving Goldman and the other too - big - to - fail usurers was that the rescue would increase lending to businesses and consumers and thus revive the economy .
But Goldman made money last quarter by shunning such loans and instead putting the government - guaranteed low - interest money it now can borrow toward acquisitions and bond and stock trading .
As The New York Times reported : “ Titans like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are making fortunes in hot areas like trading stocks and bonds , rather than the ho - hum business of lending people money . ”
Under the headline “ Bailout Helps Fuel a New Era of Wall Street Wealth , ” Times reporter Graham Bowley detailed many of the enabling favors that the government , under two presidents , extended to Goldman , like clearing the way for the company to issue bonds guaranteed by the FDIC .
“ It may come as a surprise that one of the most powerful forces driving the resurgence on Wall Street , ” the Times reported , “ is not the banks but Washington .
Many of the steps that policy makers took last year to stabilize the financial system — reducing interest rates to near zero , bolstering big banks with taxpayer money , guaranteeing billions of dollars of financial institution debts — helped set the stage for this new era of Wall Street wealth . ”
It should not come as a surprise to Timothy Geithner , who , as The Wall Street Journal reported last week , talks to the honchos of Goldman more often than to members of Congress ostensibly in charge of banking legislation .
Nor will it shock the lobbyists for Wall Street — augmented , as The Nation reported last week , by the pro-Goldman efforts of former Democratic congressman and faux populist Dick Gephardt — that the rich will emerge richer from this deep recession in which so many Americans have lost everything .
The die is cast : People working in finance grabbed two - thirds of the growth in GDP over the last decade , with the rest of us scrambling for the other third .
Nor will the situation change anytime soon .
The House Financial Services Committee is in charge of writing new rules to protect consumers , but as the respected Sunlight Foundation reports , 27 of the 71 members of that committee receive at least one - fourth of their campaign funds from the financial industry , with the rest of the committee members not far behind .
Now if we could get one of the banking lobbyists to float a duct - taped flying saucer balloon , Wolf Blitzer might cover the real hoax .

According to a recent study released by NAVTEQ , the average U.S. driver that uses a GPS system with real - time traffic updates is able to cut nearly 4 days off of their annual commute as well as decrease their carbon footprint by over 21 % .
Both of these data points should be reason enough for you to go out and pick up a new GPS with real - time traffic updates .
Â
Think about it : how much would you be willing to pay to cut four days off of your annual commute AND reduce your emissions by 21 % ?
Â
That would probably be worth a couple hundred bucks a year to you , right ?
Well , funny , because that ’s about how much a new Garmin Nuvi GPS with real - time traffic updates costs .
As the late Billy Mays would say , “ But wait ! Â
There ’s more ! ”
Even if the $ 200 outlay for the GPS is a problem – and considering this economy , it very well may be – the fact that not only will you be reducing your carbon footprint , but you ’ll be saving lots of money on gasoline means you ’ll probably be able to pay off the expense after using the GPS just a couple of months .
In looking around Amazon.com , I was able to find a brand new Garmin Nuvi GPS with traffic updates on sale for just $ 199.99 – which is a 71 % discount from its list price .
As someone who recently picked up a GPS , based on the 1.5 hours it saved me on my drive to and from the beach , I think the system is worth its weight in gold .
Â
However , when you couple it with the fact I ’ll shave days off my commute and reduce my car ’s carbon footprint by nearly a quarter , it looks like one of the best purchases I ’ve ever made .
What are your thoughts ?

Rivers Cuomo had never seen an episode of the surreal kid ’s show Yo Gabba Gabba !
before , but that did n’t stop the Weezer frontman from sporting a giant purple Spider costume and jumping around a stage filled with overgrown grass and giant acorns for his band ’s performance of the original Gabba song “ All My Friends Are Insects . ”
“ It ’s awesome here , ” Cuomo told us during the recent taping ( the show will air next year on Nick Jr. ) .
“ I love giant open rooms with tall ceilings .
But here they have all this foam scenery and interestingly painted backdrops .
It ’s a cool fantasy land I ’d like to inhabit . ”
After the jump , check out our exclusive behind - the - scenes footage of the band taping their performance , then let us know what you think about the band ’s new tune ( and costumes ! ) .
Google Chrome with it ’s latest dev version 4.0.220.1 is loaded with a number of expected fixes and surprisingly new innovative feature : the Native Client on x86 Windows OS .
The Native Client called NaCl is an open source initiative that targets on running x86 native code in web apps .
Now Google has taken a step further by integrating NaCl into Chrome .
Google has blessed the browser space with a unique feature that could pave future of Chrome OS , by running applications on the net .
Typically , Web browsers run applications written in JavaScript or perhaps Flash , both of them running on a programming foundation that makes those programs slower than native software .
But , the next new step , Native Client , lets programmers write software that directly taps into x86 chip models such as AMD ’s Athlon or Intel ’s Core .
Special programming tools and a screening mechanism in the Native Client software itself are designed to provide security for what has historically been the risky process of downloading executable programs from the Net .
Google intends to align web apps closer to native apps on a typical x86 operating system – Sincerely , I see this as the first step to Chrome OS
Google gets dual benefit from this -
Developers can play around with the code and possibly add their contributions as new ideas , bug fixes .
On the other side , they form the root of their OS that is already being innovated by the internal team .
All in all , they get best of the worlds , the true spirit of Open Source .
Currently , the Dev preview version of the Chrome browser comes witht this functionality which is switched off by default , and needs a command - line switch added to enable NaCl when Chrome is launched .
How To Enable :
Navigate to the chrome folder and run chrome.exe with following arguments :
Windows 7 : C: \Users\taranfx \AppData\Local\Google \Chrome\Application
XP : C : \Documents and Settings\taranfx \Local Settings \Application Data\Google \Chrome \Application

China ’s national ambition to build a blue water navy inevitably led to the need for naval air power .
For years there have been rumors of a Chinese aircraft carrier .
Several purchases involving foreign ships only resulted in the creation of military theme parks ( or scrapped altogether ) .
When it was discovered that a building made out to look like the Soviet aircraft carrier Varyarg was found in Wuhan , it fueled speculation that it could be a training platform for the future carrier force .
But given China ’s track record it could just be another “ white elephant ” used to attract attention .
From Tiexue :
Starting from a few days ago , many sites nationwide posted a set of pictures entitled “ Mystery appears in Wuhan , has flight deck ” .
Yesterday , reporters went to investigate .
At Wuhan ’s Ship Research Center , from far away , a building with nearly the same proportions as a real aircraft carrier is being furnished .
The carrier - style building has a bridge and flight deck similar to that of the Varyarg .
On the top of the building rests two covered aircraft , it is not clear if those are models or actual planes .
The aircraft carrier building is clearly meant to be used as an office building , the first two floors are concrete structure offices , and parts of it are already in use .
Comments from Tiexue :
迷 离2046 :
This better not be some theme park .
blue - bao :
From the looks of it , it is an aircraft carrier style building , look at the deck , if it is really used for aircraft training , you would never use limestone tiles on the roof .
李子浪 :
It ca n’t be a training center , if it is then the whole world would know ~ ~
圣殿骑士团团长 :
It ca n’t be a training center for carrier borne planes ~
Aircraft carriers are not so simple , it is not just any ship with a deck that can be a carrier .
圣殿骑士团团长 :
First of all , the structural strength of this thing is not enough , the force of an airplane weighing several tons would collapse the building while landing .
In addition , does anyone see arrest wires ?
Arresting wires are a system with internal buffer mechanism , its not something a couple of ropes can replace .
Furthermore , it is impossible for the Varyarg to be recommissioned , a ship with a heavily damaged propulsion system , where the effort of repairing it would rival building a new one altogether !
Do you honestly think Russians are that kind ?

Concrete Aircraft Carrier
阿 杨1980 :
Aye !
Faint .
I thought this was the country ’s secret aircraft carrier training facility , but it is just an aircraft carrier shaped building or theme park , Some people can really dream up things .

It is a training platform , looks like the real aircraft carrier is in construction …

What is the point of building this ?
Why not build a real one if you have the materials to do so .

Scientists are trying to figure out to what extent a new theory of quantum gravity will reproduce general relativity -- the theory that currently explains , to very high accuracy , how masses curve spacetime and create the influence of gravity .

Does an exciting but controversial new model of quantum gravity reproduce Einstein 's theory of general relativity ?
Scientists at Texas A&M University in the US explore this question in a paper appearing in Physical Review Letters and highlighted with a Viewpoint in the August 24th issue of Physics .
" If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , " sums up fairly well how many scientists have viewed Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
The theory , which Einstein developed in the early 20th century , says that matter curves spacetime , and it is this curvature which deflects massive bodies - an effect that we interpret as the influence of gravity .
The theory has been tested to extremely high accuracy and without it , our satellite global positioning system would be off by about 10 km per day .
Despite the success of general relativity , one of the most important problems in modern physics is finding a theory of quantum gravity that reconciles the continuous nature of gravitational fields with the inherent ' graininess ' of quantum mechanics .
Recently , Petr Hořava at Lawrence Berkeley Lab proposed such a model for quantum gravity that has received widespread interest , in no small part because it is one of the few models that could be experimentally tested .
In Hořava 's model , Lorentz symmetry , which says that physics is the same regardless of the reference frame , is violated at small distance scales , but remerges over longer distance scales
The team at Texas A&M , which includes Hong Lu , Jianwei Mei and Christopher Pope , report their investigations into how the modifications proposed in Hořava 's theory will broadly affect the solutions of general relativity .
One aspect of their study is that it leads to an important caveat , described by Horatiu Nastase in a Viewpoint commentary in Physics .
Lu et al . 's calculations , explains Nastase , suggest that Hořava 's model only reproduces general relativity on unobservable scales , " larger than the size of the Universe " .
Lu et al . 's paper is an important contribution to testing the Hořava model and shows that a good deal of work remains to understand its full implications .

A mysterious bright area on the surface of Mercury is seen near the top center of this 2009 image .
The MESSENGER probe also imaged this spot in its second flyby of the planet on Oct. 6 , 2008 .
Color images from MESSENGER 's Wide Angle Camera reveal that the irregular depression and bright halo have distinctive color .
During its most recent flyby of Mercury , NASA ?s MESSENGERspacecraft caught another glimpse of the innermost planet ?s mysterious brightspot .
The MESSENGERprobe skimmed just 142 miles ( 228 km ) above Mercury at its closest approachas it whipped around the planet during the flyby , the last of three designed toguide the spacecraft into orbit around the planet in 2011 .
The $ 446 million probe snapped several new images of Mercuryduring the flyby , despite a minordata hiccup that delayed the downlink of some of the images .
One of the new images shows a bright spot on the planet ' ssurface , a feature that scientists cannotyet explain .
The new view was the third of the spot , which was first seenin telescopic images of Mercury obtained from Earth by astronomer RonaldDantowitz .
The second view was obtained by the MESSENGER Narrow Angle Cameraduring the spacecraft 's second Mercury flyby Oct. 6 , 2008 .
At that time , thebright feature was just on the planet 's limb ( edge ) as seen from MESSENGER .
Surprisingly , at the center of the bright halo is anirregular depression , which may have formed through volcanic processes .
Theobject will be further investigated when MESSENGER arrives at its final orbitaround Mercury .
In the new images were also pictures of impact basins , including a double - ring impact basin , with another large impact crater on itssouth - southwestern side .
Double - ring basins are formed when a large meteoroidstrikes the surface of a rocky planet .
The floor within the inner or peak ring appears to besmoother than the floor between the peak ring and the outer rim , possibly theresult of lava flows that partially flooded the basin some time after impact .
Some of these craters are relatively fresh , formed by morerecent impacts .
On Mercury , like the Earth 's moon , even ancient impact craterscan be preserved on the surface because there is no atmosphere to cause erosionand no plate tectonics to recycle the rock , as there are on Earth .
One set of impact craters even coincidentally resemble a pawprint .
MESSENGER was also able to image some of the same terrain asit did in its second flyby , but this time with slightly different lightningconditions .
Different angles of sunlight can better show the topography of theplanet 's surface .
MESSENGER made its closest approach to Mercury at about 5:55 p.m. EDT ( 2155 GMT ) when it sped by at about 12,000 mph ( 19,312 kph ) .
The probethen flew behind Mercury , passing out of communications with Earth for about anhour before restoring contact .
The spacecraft is the first probe to visit Mercury sinceNASA 's Mariner 10 mission in the mid-1970s .
NASA launched MESSENGER - short for MErcury Surface , SpaceENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging - in 2004 .
The probe swung past Earthonce and Venus twice before beginning its three Mercury flybys .

The Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart tore into Fox News Channel Thursday , highlighting the extent to which he believes it serves as a communications arm for the Republican Party , and alleging that the line between Fox ’s “ opinion ” programming and “ news ” programming are n’t as disparate as the channel claims .

“ According to Fox , the weekday news programming — and this is according to Fox — runs from 9:00 to 4:00 p.m. and from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. for a total of nine newsy hours a day , ” Stewart notes .
“ Let me , for the audience here , help you out .
“ The three hours you spend in the morning with Fox and Friends , not news , ” Stewart continues .
“ Your 4:00 to 5:00 post tea Neil Cavuto break , not news .

“ This is according to Fox News , ” Stewart adds .
“ Those people , the ones featured in promos about how fair and balanced Fox News is are not news .
These people , otherwise known as the only people you ever think of when you think about Fox News , are not news .
They are Fox opinutainment . ”
Stewart posits that Fox ’s opinion programs thus become a jumping off point for its newcasts .
“ The Fox opinion guy ’s outrage becomes the ‘ some say ’ source for the news side , ” Stewart opines .
“ It ’s a perpetual re-revulsion machine . ”

The two men at the centre of Scotland 's largest known child abuse network have been jailed for life .
Neil Strachan , 41 , attempted to rape an 18 - month - old boy while 38 - year - old James Rennie sexually assaulted a three - month - old .
Strachan was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years in prison , while Rennie was ordered to serve at least 13 years .
Police said the operation had led to more than 200 suspected paedophiles , 70 of them in the UK , being identified .
Six other men had already been sentenced for their involvement in the network .
Strachan and Rennie , both from Edinburgh , were also found guilty after a 10 - week trial of conspiring to get access to children in order to abuse them , while Strachan was convicted of a further charge of sexually assaulting a six - year - old boy .
This , in my judgment , can be properly described as a dreadful crime
Lord Bannatyne
Judge
' Pain and turmoil ' of victim 's family How abuse network was smashed Strachan , who is HIV positive , has already served a three - year prison sentence in 1997 for abusing a boy .
Rennie was the chief executive of LGBT Youth Scotland , which offers advice to young gay and lesbian people .
Passing sentence on the pair , judge Lord Bannatyne referred to Strachan 's abuse of the 18 - month - old boy , which was captured in a photograph known as the " Hogmanay image " because it was taken on New Year 's Eve in 2005 .
The judge told Strachan : " By its very nature , what is shown in that photograph is utterly appalling and would shock to the core any right - minded person who has had to see it .
" Over and above that , this offence involves the most gross level of breach of trust .
You were invited into a house , treated as a friend of the family , and then entrusted with their child .
" You then breached that trust in the way shown in the ' Hogmanay image ' in order to satisfy your base sexual interests .
This , in my judgment , can be properly described as a dreadful crime . "
Lord Bannatyne said Rennie had also betrayed the trust of the parents of his victim to a " truly appalling " extent .
More suspects
The judge said Rennie , a trained teacher who was found guilty of 14 charges , was at the heart of the conspiracy to abuse youngsters , and likened him to a spider weaving an electronic web to bring about his crime .
The mother of Rennie 's victim , known as Child F , told BBC Scotland of the " pain and torment " the case had put their family through .
She called for a " global strategy " between internet providers and government to prevent the distribution of abuse images .
" However , for those involved in paedophile behaviour to identify it in themselves and know where to seek help , society must be prepared to discuss this issue " , she added .

" We need to allow an openness within society of where to seek help , just as alcoholics go to AA and gamblers go to GA .
" Clearly the protection of children must take precedence , but if individuals could have been stopped or deterred , we as a family may not have found ourselves in this situation . "
Rennie had circulated pictures of the abuse and offered a boy to other paedophiles - an offer taken up by Strachan .
Both will remain under close supervision for the rest of their lives after the parole board sees fit to free them .
Defence counsel Mark Stewart QC said Rennie , who has no previous convictions , wanted to make a formal apology and place on public record his " shame and sorrow " at what happened .
Co-accused Colin Slaven , 23 , from Edinburgh ; Neil Campbell , 46 , John Milligan , 40 , and John Murphy , 44 , all from Glasgow ; Ross Webber , 27 , from North Berwick in East Lothian ; and Craig Boath , 24 , from Dundee , were also convicted of various offences .
They were given prison sentences of between two and 17 years .
The men had been arrested during the Operation Algebra police investigation , which uncovered nearly 125,000 indecent images of children .
It is clear from the evidence in this case that the accused saw no limits on how far they would share , exploit and abuse children
Morag McLaughlin
Procurator fiscal Operation Algebra also uncovered dozens more suspects around the country and worldwide , many of whom have already been charged .
The investigation was sparked by a single indecent image of a naked 11 - year - old which was found on paint company engineer Strachan 's computer when it was sent for repair .
Detectives discovered that Strachan and Rennie had filmed themselves sexually abusing children before distributing the images over the internet .
The two paedophiles had been trusted by the children 's parents to look after the children .
Lothian and Borders Police said their inquiry had led to more than 200 suspected paedophiles being identified internationally , and at least 70 in the UK .
Detectives have said there were further suspects in Scotland as well as Avon and Somerset ; Devon and Cornwall ; Merseyside ; South Wales ; West Midlands ; Sussex ; Essex ; London ; Thames Valley ; and Hampshire .
Speaking after the sentencing , Morag McLaughlin , procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders , said recent advances in technology were making it easier for the police to bring child abusers to justice .
She added : " It is clear from the evidence in this case that the accused saw no limits on how far they would share , exploit and abuse children in order to satisfy their own horrific sexual gratification .
" However , our specialist prosecutors will use the constantly improving technology available to the police to stop and bring to court those who think they are hidden by the anonymity of the internet . "

Kucinich Wants His Amendment Back
Created : October 30 , 2009 16:44 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) was none too happy when House leaders stripped his single - payer provision from their $ 894 billion health reform proposal .
Today , he ’s urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) to reinstate it .
“ Like many other important reforms included in the underlying bill , the Kucinich amendment is the object of attack by the insurance industry , ” Kucinich wrote in a letter .
“ Unlike other reform measures , Leadership has chosen to strip the Kucinich amendment of the protection it deserves . ”
Kucinich ’s provision , which would allow states to set up single - payer health care systems modeled after Medicare , passed the House Education and Labor Committee in July , but was stripped out by Democratic leaders as they pieced together their final bill from the various committee proposals .
Kucinich concedes that the provision represents “ incremental reform . ”
“ But , ” he adds , “ it allows the country to move incrementally in the direction that is needed . ”
If Education and Labor Chairman George Miller ( D - Calif . ) is right about there being no floor amendments , this plea could be Kucinich ’s last shot .
Update ( 4:46 p.m. ) : Democratic Reps John Conyers ( Mich . ) , Eric Massa ( N.Y. ) , Neil Abercrombie ( Hawaii ) , Janice Schakowsky ( Ill. ) , Lynn Woolsey ( Calif . ) and Raúl Grijalva ( Ariz . ) have also signed the letter .
They Would n’t be Caught Dead Without it
Most experts agree that makeup originated in the Middle East ; cosmetics are mentioned frequently in the Old Testament and other ancient documents from a wide variety of cultures .
A great deal of evidence about the use of makeup may be found in the pyramids of ancient Egypt — primarily because of their burial rituals , which included entombing people with both the necessities and luxuries of life .
Because ancient Egyptian tombs are often well –sealed , archeologists have an unprecedented look at ancient makeup .
For example , when King Tut ’s tomb was opened in 1922 , cosmetics were found inside that were still fragrant and perfectly usable .
Palettes are also often found in pyramids , dating as far back as 10,0000 B.C. ; these were originally used for grinding and mixing face and eye powders .
Both Egyptian men and women applied makeup ; rouge and lip ointments were considered essentials , as was and henna for giving a red tinge to the nails .
Women traced the veins in their temples and breasts with blue paint and tipped their nipples with liquid gold .
Eye shadow was important to both sexes ; it was usually green and applied to both the top and the bottom lids .
Eyelash and brow enhancers consisting of carbon , black oxide , and other ( often toxic ) substances were also applied to give wearers that dark , painted–on look so associated with the culture .
Eyebrows of Ox and a Little Imagination
Some of the earliest evidence of modern beauty equipment has been found in Babylon ruins .
Tools such as tweezers , brow brushes , and toothpicks were common .
Both the men and women of Babylon also curled their hair and make up their eyes with eye shadow , eyeliner , and eyelash and brow enhancers .
They frequently painted their faces with white lead and used henna to color their nails .
In ancient Greece , a more “ natural ” effect was usually preferred , but in the 4th century B.C. , Grecian women painted their faces with white lead and used crushed mulberries for rouge .
The application of fake eyebrows , often made of oxen hair , was also fashionable .
In the Roman Empire , women applied pastes of narcissus , lentils , honey , wheat , and eggs to achieve pale complexions .
For evening wear , chalk and white lead were applied to the skin , along with rouge .
The old Egyptian trick of using blue paint to enhance prominent veins was also popular .
Some people — men and women — rubbed their teeth with a pumice stone .
Wealthy women had at least one slave assigned the role of cosmetician .
“ I ca n ’t ; I have to be Bled Tonight ”
With the rise of Christianity , the heavy use of makeup gradually diminished in many cultures .
However , by the Middle Ages , women were still striving for the fashionably pale look .
Staying out of the sun was one way to stay pale ( if you were rich enough to have servants ) , but women also often painted their faces with water –soluble paints and white powder , or bled themselves on a regular basis .
Makeup being taboo , “ reconstruction ” gained much popularity among fashionable ladies .
Such treatment included using chin straps under headdresses and plucking eyebrows to a thin line — in a kind of Marlene Dietrich ( before Marlene Dietrich ) fashion .
The Great Cover Up
In the 17th century , men and women used makeup to limited degree ; ceruse was used as a base , and a cheek and lip reddeners were sometimes applied .
From the late 1600s forward , makeup began to get heavier .
First , white paint was applied , then white powder , then a brownish rouge , and red lip color .
“ Beauty patches ” — pieces of velvet or silk cut into the shape of stars , moons , hearts , and similar figures — were frequently applied to the face and body to cover smallpox scars , and similar marks .
A “ secret language ” even developed through their use : A patch near the mouth meant you were flirtatious ; one next to the right cheek signaled you were married ; one on the left cheek announced you were engaged ; one at the corner of the eye meant you were somebody ’s mistress .
For Those Special Occasions , Apply Toxins to the Breast
Makeup was heavier during the 18th century .
Likewise , a rise in medical complications occurred — tooth decay , adverse skin conditions , and poisonings were often caused by the use of dangerous makeup .
Lead and sulfur ( for enhancing the cleavage ) , mercury ( for covering blemishes ) , and white lead ( for whitening the complexion ) were frequent hindrances of the medical world .
Men , women , and even children wore makeup to some extent in order to achieve the fashionable white face with flaming red cheeks and lips .
Eyebrows were accentuated with pencils , or concealed beneath false eyebrows made of mouse fur .
You Are What You Eat
In the late 18th to mid–19th century , the ultra–pale look persisted .
A “ lady ” did n’t need to work in the sun , and therefore should be pale ... translucent , even .
Some historians even speculate that consumption was so common , it became fashionable to look as though you were suffering from TB .
Indeed , the white skin , flushed cheek , and luminous eye of the illness was frequently imitated with white lead and rouge
To make they eyes bright , some women ate small amounts of arsenic or washed their eyes with orange and lemon juice — or , worse yet , rinsed them with belladonna , the juice of the poisonous nightshade .
In the 19th century , “ natural ” makeup became fashionable .
Victorian propriety denounced excessive makeup as the mark of “ loose ” women .
Naively , most men believed their ladies wore no makeup , but cosmetic vendors abounded and beauty books of the era recount how carefully Victorian women used their concoctions .
Above all , lip and cheek rouge were considered scandalous ; instead of their use , beauty books of the era suggested women bite their lips and pinch their cheeks vigorously before entering a room .
Some commercial makeup , mostly manufactured in France , was also becoming available ; these included powders , bases , and waxes containing light , “ natural ” color .
To help scrape off all this makeup , fashion magazines proclaimed cold cream a must for every woman ’s beauty regime .
Also heavily advertised were anti–aging creams and wrinkle cures .
( One suggestion aging women should sleep with their face bound in strips of raw beef . )
Despite growing medical knowledge , dangerous cosmetics continued to be used .
Whiteners , still quite popular , contained substances such as zinc oxide , mercury , lead , nitrate of silver , and acids ; some women even ate chalk or drank iodine to achieve whiteness .
Freedom to Choose and Safer To Use
The 20th century finally brought about the use of safer cosmetics ; doctors began working with cosmetic companies to ensure safer standards , and “ safety ” became a popular selling point in advertisements .
The turn of the century also brought about a new freedom of choice to wear “ excessive ” or “ natural ” makeup , as the wearer desired .
Both were generally considered acceptable — although flappers were condemned by some for wearing heavy eyeliners and bright lip and cheek colors .
The 1920s and 30s also saw the lipsticks ( including the “ kiss proof ” kind ) , the first liquid nail polish , several forms of modern base , powdery blushes , and the powder compact .
Cosmetics were now a booming business , and few modern women would be without .
The 1920s also brought about another revolution : the Tan .
No longer did women strive for the pale look en masse .
Why the sudden shift ?
While the wealthy prided themselves on not working , and therefore staying indoors ( resulting in a pale complexion ) , the wealthy of the 1920s prided themselves on not working — and going outside to play .
The rich now laid about in the sun , making their skin golden .
Suddenly , everyone longed for that “ healthy ” bronzed look .

Oregon Court of Appeals Upholds Claim of Negligent Failure to Investigate
by P.K. Runkles - Pearson
Stoel Rives LLP , Attorneys at Law
In Steele v. Mayoral et al. , the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that a plaintiff could take to the jury her claim that her employer had failed to prevent sexual harassment by her supervisor by not investigating earlier incidents about the supervisor ’s relationships with other employees .
The plaintiff , a high school guidance counselor , was dating her supervisor , the principal .
She complained that the supervisor had sexually assaulted her during a date .
The school district investigated the complaint and recommended the supervisor be terminated .
The plaintiff sued .
In addition to alleging sexual harassment and retaliation , she also alleged that the school district had been negligent by not terminating her supervisor before the incident had even occurred .
She based that allegation on three earlier incidents involving the principal ’s relationships with other school district employees .
The juicy allegations involve ( 1 ) the principal ’s affair with the wife of another principal in the same school district , ( 2 ) the principal ’s complaint that another district employee was “ stalking ” him after he “ rebuffed her advances , ” and ( 3 ) yet another employee ’s allegation that she was dating the principal when he slept with yet another employee .
The plaintiff alleged that the school district should have investigated those incidents – and that if it had , it would have terminated her supervisor years before .
The trial court dismissed the plaintiff ’s negligence claim , but the Court of Appeals reversed , ruling that a jury should be able to decide whether or not the school district ’s failure to investigate had caused the sexual harassment .
We do n’t know what a jury would say about liability in this case , but it is a sobering reminder to employers to investigate all incidents of potential misconduct involving the workplace .
" Jeff , ca n't we at least celebrate the holiday before you eat the decorations ? "
I 've heard that more than once from my long - suffering wife during our 26 - year marriage .
You see , cheapskates like to celebrate Halloween and other holidays just like everyone else .
But we grimace at wasteful rituals like throwing away a perfectly good pumpkin after using it for only a few days as a decoration .
Americans buy more than one billion pounds of pumpkins at Halloween , and the vast majority of those end up in the trash .
But at the Green Cheapskate 's house , we eat our jack - o - lantern , every last bit of it .
While some particularly meaty varieties of pumpkins are specifically grown to be eaten ( including Sweet Jack - be - Littles , Cheese Pumpkins , Sugar Pumpkins and some delicious heirloom varieties ) , any commonly available pumpkin is perfectly edible .
Best of all , at Halloween ( and immediately after Halloween ) you can usually buy pumpkins for less than half a buck a pound .
At that price , why not pick up a couple extra just to eat ?
Pumpkins are a true American vegetable , a favorite of the Aztec , Inca and Mayan people before becoming a staple of early European explorers and settlers in the New World .
Pumpkins belong to the same family ( Cucurbitacae ) as gourds , melons and cucumbers .
And , according to the American Institute for Cancer Research , pumpkins are packed with beta carotene , a powerful antioxidant that fights cancer .
If you 're buying a pumpkin specifically for eating , the smaller ones are usually the best .
If you 're going to use it as a jack - o'- lantern as well , you can eat or freeze some of the pumpkin when you carve it , and then pickle the remaining rind when Halloween is over , provided that it 's still in good shape .
So , here 's how to eat your jack - o - lantern :
Seeds First
Toasted pumpkin seeds are a healthy snack filled with zinc , magnesium , manganese , iron , copper and protein .
They 're also great in salads , muffins , bread , and in other recipes as a nut substitute .
Remove the seeds , rinse them in water to get rid of the stringy inner membrane , and dry them out a little on a towel .
Flavor with coarse salt for a traditional taste , or let your imagination and spice rack run wild .
Some options for flavoring designer seeds include : pumpkin pie spice ; Cajun seasonings ; ginger powder ; garlic salt ; curry powder ; Tabasco ; cinnamon ; vinegar and salt .
Once seasoned , bake the seeds on a lightly oiled cookie sheet ( single layer thick ) in a 250 - degree oven for about an hour , stirring every 20 minutes .
Or , my preferred method is to cook them in a spray - oiled skillet over medium heat on the stove top , stirring and shaking ( the skillet , not your booty ) constantly .
On the stove top , they 'll be toasted nicely brown in only about five minutes .
Store in air - tight containers .
The Meat of the Matter
The thick , bright orange pulp lining the inside of the pumpkin is the real meat of the matter when it comes to making pies , cakes , bread , soups and most other pumpkin delicacies .
Using a large spoon or other sharp - edged instrument , scrape and scoop the pulp from inside the pumpkin , working it down about an inch or so , to the whitish - colored layer beneath the skin .
This will leave you with the outer shell to carve as a jack - o'- lantern .
If you 're not going to get double duty out of your pumpkin as a lantern , then it 's easier to slice it as you would a melon and use a knife to peel away the outer skin and white layer .
Once you 've extracted the pulp , steam it over a pot of water until it 's tender ( about 30 minutes or more ) .
Run it through a food processor to puree or mash by hand ( add a dash of lemon juice to prevent freezer burn ) , and freeze it in plastic bags or containers to use later in your favorite recipes .
You can also eat the cooked pulp just like squash , but it 's even better than squash .
Here are some of my favorite pumpkin recipes :
Pumpkin Cider Bisque :
Make a cream soup by melting two tablespoons butter and mixing in 2 tablespoon flour , and then slowly stir in 2 cups of whole milk .
Stir constantly over medium heat until thickened .
Add one cup pumpkin puree ( see above ) , and heat through .
Slowly add 2 cups cider .
Correct seasonings with salt and pepper .
Serve hot , with a dollop of sour cream , or cold with apple slices to garnish .
( 4 servings / approx .
cost per serving = 30 cents )
Pumpkin Milk Shake :
Try this one as soon as the pulp cools .
In a blender , mix 1 cup vanilla ice cream , 1 / 4 cup milk , 4 tablespoons pumpkin puree , and a dash of any or all of the following : pumpkin pie spice , vanilla , nutmeg , rum extract .
( 1 serving / approx .
cost per serving = 35 cents )
Jack - o- Lantern Casserole :
The Green Cheapskate 's salute to cosmetic surgery -- truly tongue AND cheek , but pretty tasty .
Save the cut - out nose , mouth , eyes , etc. from your jack - o'- lantern carving to decorate this face - shaped casserole .
Fry one pound of sausage and one cup of chopped onion on the stovetop until brown .
Add two cups of cubed , raw pumpkin pulp ( you can get about that much by cutting the pulp off from the bottom of your jack - o' - lantern lid ) .
Cook it for about 5 minutes , until the pumpkin starts to soften .
Stir in one can of condensed Cheddar cheese soup and 1 /4 cup milk , and remove from heat .
Grease a round or oval casserole baking dish ( about face size ) .
In the empty dish , mix two cups Bisquick mix with 3 / 4 cup water , spreading the dough evenly on the bottom of the dish .
Pour meat mixture on top of dough .
Sprinkle one cup shredded Cheddar cheese on top of casserole .
Spray " face parts " lightly with spray oil , and arrange on top of casserole .
Bake in a preheated 400 - degree oven , uncovered , for about 30 minutes , until face parts are lightly brown and the dough has cooked through .
( 6 servings / approx .
cost per serving = 60 cents )
Truly Smashing Pickled Pumpkin Rinds :
If your lantern survives the night of hell - raising by neighborhood teens and shows no signs of worrisome rot , inordinate candle scorching , or excessive wax buildup , real cheapskates separate themselves from the rest by pickling the rind of their jack - o'- lanterns the day after Halloween .
I 'm told by Miser Adviser Doris Sharp that this dish is particularly popular in Northern Germany .
Here 's how :
Peel off the outer skin and cut the white - colored rind ( about 1 inch thick ) into two inch squares .
For each pound of pumpkin , use 3/ 4 lb sugar , 2 cups vinegar and a piece of fresh ginger .
Use a stick of cinnamon for the whole batch of several pounds .
Put pumpkin in vinegar and let it soak overnight .
Remove the pumpkin from vinegar ( discard * ) and let it dry on a towel .
Bring fresh vinegar to a boil with sugar , ginger and a stick of cinnamon .
Add pumpkin and simmer until pieces are translucent and golden yellow , about 3 hours on low heat .
Never stir with a spoon ; just shake the pot occasionally so the pumpkin does n't fall apart .
Can and seal , or store in the refrigerator for up to a few weeks .

Millions of asteroids are on orbits that come close to Earth ’s , including asteroid Eros , shown here ( Image : NASA / JPL / JHUAPL )
As the US government ponders a strategy to deal with threatening asteroids , a dramatic explosion over Indonesia has underscored how blind we still are to hurtling space rocks .
On 8 October an asteroid detonated high in the atmosphere above South Sulawesi , Indonesia , releasing about as much energy as 50,000 tons of TNT , according to a NASA estimate released on Friday .
That ’s about three times more powerful than the atomic bomb that levelled Hiroshima , making it one of the largest asteroid explosions ever observed .
However , the blast caused no damage on the ground because of the high altitude , 15 to 20 kilometres above Earth ’s surface , says astronomer Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario ( UWO ) , Canada .
Advertisement
Brown and Elizabeth Silber , also of UWO , estimated the explosion energy from infrasound waves that rippled halfway around the world and were recorded by an international network of instruments that listens for nuclear explosions .
The explosion was heard by witnesses in Indonesia .
Video images of the sky following the event show a dust trail characteristic of an exploding asteroid .
Sudden impact
The amount of energy released suggests the object was about 10 metres across , the researchers say .
Such objects are thought to hit Earth about once per decade .
No telescope spotted the asteroid ahead of its impact .
That is not surprising , given that only a tiny fraction of asteroids smaller than 100 metres across have been catalogued , says Tim Spahr , director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Yet objects as small as 20 or 30 metres across may be capable of doing damage on the ground , he says .
“ If you want to find the smallest objects you have to build more , larger telescopes , ” says Spahr .
“ A survey that finds all of the 20 - metre objects will cost probably multiple billions of dollars . ”
The US Office of Science and Technology Policy , which advises the White House , must develop a policy to address the asteroid hazard by October 2010 under a deadline imposed by 2008 legislation .
It is likely to be influenced by a report from the National Research Council on the asteroid problem , which is expected by year ’s end .
Gwyneth Jones won the Arthur C Clarke award in 2002 for Bold as Love , the first book in a near - future rock 'n 'roll retelling of the Arthurian myth .
The third instalment in the series , Midnight Lamp , is published by Gollancz .
1. The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin
This famous novel about sex and society is a politically sophisticated adventure story , in which the non-gendered Gethenians ( who may take on either sex in their fertile period ) are as morally complex and recalcitrantly various as the nations of the earth .
What sticks in my mind , aside from the sheer beauty of this book , is the winter journey across the Gobrin Ice at the heart of it , and the elegy for an impossible friendship between Genly Ai , the human male , and Estraven , whose sexual nature Ai cannot accept .
2. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang by Kate Wilhelm
A bleak fairytale account of human cloning which has since been overtaken by science and coloured by the disappointment and alienation of the post- radical 70s .
It will seem dated in terms of social mores but nothing else has changed .
This is still a chilling , gripping and heartbreaking landmark science fiction novel , one of the greatest of its time , about the death of the living world : an SF writer 's response to Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring .
3 . Up the Walls of the World by James Tiptree Jr
James Tiptree Jr ( Alice Sheldon in real life ) was famous , or notorious , for very smart , harsh , and daring psychosexual stories ( Love is the Plan , the Plan is Death ; And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hillside ) that were hailed as ' ineluctably masculine ' before she was unmasked .
You can find some of them in the collection Warm Worlds and Otherwise .
Up the Walls of the World is in a far different mode : this is joyous and positively starry - eyed SF , with great characters and my kind of SF outlaws handling the ethics , instead of the smug might - is - righters .
In the Tyree fliers , it features the most convincing non-humanoid aliens I 've ever met .
4. The Female Man by Joanna Russ
I must have walked past this book about 20 times before I bought it .
What was she talking about ?
I did n't want to be a man !
The futuristic dominatrix on the original cover , with her naked toyboy crouching on a leash , did n't impress me much , either .
Eventually , I was sufficiently bothered to hand over my cash .
It was a revelation .
The Female Man is experimental , clever , funny , violent and startlingly prophetic .
Also a great source of ideas for techno - green utopia .
5. Cyteen by CJ Cherryh
CJ Cherryh is one of the major space opera authors , always impressive for the realism of her great ships , the fiendish complexity of the intrigue on board and planetside , and for her bizarre , changed human characters of the future .
Cyteen is the magnum opus of a series about a clash of empires , both human in origin , differing in their methods but identical in their lust for control .
It 's about domination and slavery , the monsters power makes and the twisted lives of the children born to perpetuate the dynasties .
A dark mirror for the cold war era and a horrific science fiction boardroom drama , it will suck you in .
6. Grass by Sheri Tepper
Sheri Tepper 's novels are a big hit with the punters but can be alarmingly didactic : this one 's different .
Grass is set on a stunning pampas world , not a million miles from the oceanic vastness of the Great Plains where Tepper was raised .
It 's about a diplomat , horse - lover , passionate human being whose engagement with the alien uncovers horror and takes over her life .
The examination of the callous , destructive and aggressive culture of human colonial expansion points the moral , but the centre of this book lies in the character of Marjorie Westriding and her encounter with the sublime .
Fabulously enjoyable .
7. Synners by Pat Cadigan
The queen of cyberpunk takes on the west coast entertainment industry in a prescient investigation of the unholy marriage between digital technology and the profit motive .
What if we can grab consumers directly by going straight to a centre in their brains ?
A ragged band of music video - makers , hackers , slackers and tattoo artists must race against time to save humanity ( well , the USA - the rest of us are relegated to a paragraph ) from an awesome virus which has ' corrupted ' - irony fully intentional - this brilliant scheme .
Some techno-SF dates quickly ; Synners seems newer and hotter now than in 1991 .
8. Sarah Canary by Karen Joy Fowler
A white woman , seemingly deformed and mute except for her strange ' singing ' , wanders into a Chinese railway workers ' camp in Washington Territory , 1873 .
A young man called Chin - Ah - Kin gets the job of returning her to her own community - and so begins a mystical journey , by turns brutal , weird and lyric .
True - life news snippets between the chapters reveal that the real north - west of 1873 was every bit as surreal as the events of the story .
Profound , disturbing and mysterious , this is a novel about the first encounter with an alien intelligence that goes far beyond genre .
9. Light Music by Kathleen Ann Goonan
In some ways , Light Music is a post - catastrophe novel , where an ensemble of characters discovers how shockingly the world has been changed by a bizarre cosmic plague .
But more than that , it 's a tour of the consequences of Lynn Margulis 's radical thinking on evolution .
This is how we could see ourselves if we were n't Darwin 's slaves : every self a community , every human being a symbiote city , a node in the richly permeable network of life on Earth .
But there 's also a vision of a perfectly possible and daunting future .
What happens when our organic , wireless , data / DNA information networks are so pervasive , so interpenetrative with the solid world , that we 're just part of the software ?
10 . Natural History by Justina Robson
There was a time , not so long ago , when I was about the only British woman novelist active in science fiction .
In spite of Mary Shelley we 're extremely rare birds , and always have been .
But it 's not for want of talent .
Look out for Molly Brown , Liz Williams , Stephanie Swainston ( and excuse me for any names I 've missed ) .
Justina Robson is almost a veteran now with two nominations for the Arthur C Clarke award , for her near - future Silver Screen and Mappa Mundi .
Her latest novel is a departure into deep space and esoteric hard science , leavened by acerbic humour and leftwing politics .
It 's one of the big UK SF books of the year , and an optimistic conclusion for my top 10 .
I delivered a keynote yesterday at BlogWorld Expo ( Dave Thomas from SAS has great notes here ) .
In it , I called for us bloggers that have been around for a bit to step up our game , to get to work , to bring this all up a level .
The speech was one part arrogance , nine parts passion .
For what I think happens next is this : companies either do or do n’t get into these tools .
We , however , have to consider the tools and the business and what we ’re going to do with it all , whether or not the mother ships in our lives are ready to come along .
Here ’s some of what I pointed out in my presentation .
Set Up
Shop – if you ’re an independent business and you ’re blogging to make content marketing for your business , be sure you ’ve built “ how to do business with me ” into your site .
Do you have a “ work with me ” page ?
Do you have a “ contact me ” page ?
Are you putting out obvious calls to action ?
Take it from blogging about what you know is cool into blogging about ways to help the customers you hope to attract .
Think Like a Business – if you ’re in this for business , always ask yourself how this work ties to more sales ( and if you ’re not trying to make money , think of “ sale ” as whatever you hope to convert .
Hint : it ’s not “ more audience . ” ) .
If you ’re just writing to write , shooting video to get it up there , tweeting because people said you should , rethink all that .
Decide what ’s going to ring your register and work on that .
Use this as marketing if you want , but be sure to have a call to action , then , so that it ’s really marketing and not just words .
Be a Consistent Brand – make sure that everything coming out of you syncs with your brand .
It ’s okay to talk business and personal ( without the personal touch , you ’ll miss some of the beauty of the human web ) , but make sure all that you ’re doing is as consistent as possible .
If you ’re positioning yourself as a luxury expert , do you have all kinds of junk ads on your site ?
If you ’re saying that you ’re into relationships and quality human contact , are you spamming people with a newsletter they did n’t opt into ?
If you have other people working with you , are they representing the feel you ’re hoping to portray with the EXPERIENCE of working with you ?
Extend Your Platform – get beyond the blog .
I do n’t mean to just tweet , either .
Get out into physical space and start meeting people from time to time .
Do n’t go to social media events , only .
Go to the events where clients are , instead of the events where the cool kids hang out .
Move your voice into as many places as you can .
Consider video .
Write speeches and things you ’d love to say on a stage on your blog ( it ’s how I got my start speaking professionally ) .
Build Small Powerful Networks – go beyond using social media tools just to chat and keep up .
Stop playing Farmville and start building networks of people you feel are important , energizing , uplifting , and potentially useful to your future business plans .
Get into collaborative efforts with people who share your thoughts .
There are lots of people going solo when they could team up and have even more power from the small organization .
Do n’t overthink this one .
Just build networks that extend beyond having a “ groups ” tab in Tweetdeck .
Equip Your Customers – instead of writing about your stuff , write about your customers .
Give them ideas on how they can improve their world , and for a REAL strong effect , do n’t even mention your product every post .
Your customers need much more than your product to succeed .
How else can you equip them ?
Giving people useful information , useful things , a step up on the world is a powerful way to build new relationships and deliver potential sales .
Focus on the Relationship – to me , the new unit of business should be relationships .
You get more fruit from an apple tree if you nurture it and pick apples when it ’s ripe , instead of uprooting the tree and forcefully shaking the apples into your barrel .
It takes a bit longer , but you ’re a farmer and a steward , not a machinist .
( This is a great part of why I feel many businesses failed over the last two years )
Make Trust a Must –
If you ’re in this for the long haul , work to earn trust .
People want to trust you .
It ’s a matter of giving them signs of trust , including being there , being consistent , being everywhere they need you to be , and being authentic to your internal and external needs .
People are n’t stupid .
They need to feel your conviction and your support all the way throughout the experience with you .
Beyond that , I ’ll save the rest for another post .
Does this make sense ?
Are you ready to get to work ?
Can you see what should come next from this ?

Today is Carl Sagan 's 75th birthday .
It would be nice if he were still around to send him the greeting personally , but sadly , he died too young : in 1996 he succumbed to complications of myleodysplasia .
As he himself noted , though , the progress of science -- medical science in this case -- kept him alive far longer than would otherwise have been possible .
Up to the end , he was an evangelist of science .
And his legacy continues .
His TV show " Cosmos " continues to inspire people , and the generation of astronomers who took up the cause due to Sagan 's exhortations are still looking up , looking out , and seeking what 's around the next corner .
Because of Carl Sagan , we have many more scientists who not only love the field itself , but strive to express it to others .
I include myself among the latter .
That 's why we celebrated Carl Sagan Day on Saturday , to honor the man and , in my opinion just as if not more importantly , to continue his work .
James Randi knew Sagan personally ; they were friends for many years , and so at the celebration Randi was the keynote speaker , relating stories about the man whom Randi knew as simply Carl .
Below is video of Randi 's talk .
It 's an hour long , but it 's more than worth your time .
This was recorded off a live stream , so go ahead and click forward to about the 9:00 minute mark to get started .
This first Carl Sagan Day was a great success .
We had a great audience at every talk , kids playing outside in the inflatable rocket ship bounce room , pictures from Hubble adorning the windows and walls of Broward College , and an overall sense that there is great work that has been done , with still a vast amount yet to do .
But that 's where the fun is .
Sagan knew that , and I hope that you do too .
And if you do n't -- if you think science is stodgy , uninteresting , and does n't affect your life -- then hopefully you have an amazing moment lying in wait for you .
Maybe it'll be a Cassini image of Saturn , or a tiny cell undergoing mitosis under your scrutiny through a microscope , or the sudden understanding from a news article about the Large Hadron Collider .
There 's no way to know what precisely that trigger will be .
But at some point there will come something that will jolt you , will shake you out of your complacence , and the scales will fall from your eyes .
At that moment you 'll experience what Carl Sagan did every moment of his life , that same sense of wonder and pure , undiluted joy about the Universe .
I feel it too .
It 's the blood in my veins , the calcium in my bones , the electricity of my eyes and ears as they relay what they detect to my brain .
It 's the sense of connectedness with everything , and it 's real .
That 's what Carl Sagan taught us .
Somewhere , something incredible is waiting to be known .
-- Carl Sagan , 1934 - 1996

Former Renault boss Flavio Briatore will begin his fightback against a lifetime ban from motor racing on Monday when he takes the matter to the French courts .
Briatore is set to lodge papers at the Tribunal de Grand Instance in Paris to try and cancel the lifetime ban that was handed to him by the FIA as the result of his involvement in Renault 's race - fix controversy at last year 's Singapore Grand Prix .
In a statement issued on Sunday , Briatore stated that he believes the FIA had acted incorrectly in the way it dealt with its hearing into the race - fix case , and the punishment handed down .
" In this case , the FIA has been used as a tool to exact vengeance on behalf of one man , " said Briatore in the statement .
" This decision is a legal absurdity and I have every confidence that the French courts will resolve the matter justly and impartially . "
Briatore has stated that the grounds for his action were that there was a delay in the issue of the summons , a failure to state the charges in advance and a lack of access provided to prosecution document and to the key witness .
Briatore also stated that there had been a ' breach of the natural rules of justice ' including a lack of impartiality of the body passing judgement , the secret negotiation of the decision before the hearing and the granting of selective immunities .
He also claims that the FIA has abused its power by imposing a penalty on a non-licensee of the FIA , the disproportionate and illegal nature of an indefinite ban and the threat to refuse to renew FIA licences to any driver or entity involved with Briatore .
As well as trying to overthrow his punishment , Briatore is also demanding compensation for the damage caused to his reputation - with a report in the Journal du Dimanche suggesting he is seeking as much as one million euros .
If the judges in Paris rule that there is a valid case , then the matter could go to trial in around one month 's time , with a decision possible before the end of the year .
RIGHT FALLS FOR ‘ THESIS ’ HOAX ….
Right - wing pundit Michael Ledeen published an item this week on Barack Obama ’s “ college thesis , ” which Obama allegedly wrote as a student at Columbia 25 years ago .
Leeden cited some website , which ran a piece in August .
The paper was called “ Aristocracy Reborn , ” and in the first ten pages ( which were all that reporter Joe Klein — who wrote about it for Time — was permitted to see ) , the young Obama wrote : “ … the Constitution allows for many things , but what it does not allow is the most revealing .
The so - called Founders did not allow for economic freedom .
While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document , the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned .
While many believed that the new Constitution gave them liberty , it instead fitted them with the shackles of hypocrisy . ”
That ’s quite an indictment , even for an Ivy League undergraduate … .
Maybe instead of fuming about words that Rush Limbaugh never uttered , the paladins of the free press might ask the president about words that he did write .
Yesterday , Rush Limbaugh picked up on Leeden ’s report , blasting Obama for the alleged paper .
The first sign of trouble was when Joe Klein noted that he ’s never seen or written about Obama ’s college thesis , and has “ no idea where this report comes from . ”
The second sign of trouble was when one stopped to notice that Obama did n’t write a senior thesis ( though he did write a thesis - length paper on Soviet nuclear disarmament ) .
The third sign of trouble was when one clicked on the link that Leeden provided as support and found the word “ satire . ”
Yes , Leeden and Limbaugh got all worked up , trashing the president for a paper he did n’t write in college 25 years ago , relying on a satirical blog post .
And for real entertainment value , notice what Leeden and Limbaugh did when they realized they ’d fallen for a dumb joke — they blamed Obama anyway .
Leeden conceded he was wrong and apologized , but added , “ It worked because it ’s plausible . ”
Limbaugh said the text he touted was fake , but it did n’t matter because , “ I know Obama thinks it . ”
Yep , even when they ’re wrong , it ’s only because the president makes it easy for them to be confused .
Remember , the Washington Post and New York Times are committed to paying much closer attention to what ’s generating buzz among far - right talk - show hosts and bloggers .
Here ’s hoping the dailies noticed the Leeden / Limbaugh journalistic breakthrough .
When asked by CNN's John King about the Republican Party in - fighting in the NY - 23 race and if the party can survive in the Northeast region of the country if there is no room for moderates in their ranks , John Boehner tries to blame the “ rebellion ” going on now on “ people who really have not been actively involved in the political process ” .
Oh really ?
While that may be true of those out protesting , it ’s certainly not true of the ones organizing them .
Dick Armey and Tim Phillips are hardly people that could be called “ not active in the political process ” .
Quite the opposite .
And Sarah Palin who has interjected herself into that race was the Republican Vice - Presidential nominee the last election .
John Boehner has a bigger mess on his hands than he ’s willing to admit which is evident by his response at the end of the segment when he says this :
What 's the point of having a party if people in your party will attack your own nominees ?
I mean , where do you draw that line ?
KING : Let me ask you , lastly , though , but sometimes does the party need to draw a line ?
Yes and so do the rest of us who have been watching this John .
Transcript below the fold .
KING : I want to talk to you about politics .
You would like to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives .
And while much of the attention on this year 's elections are on the governor 's races in New Jersey and Virginia , there 's a special election in New York state .
I 'm going to hold up the newspaper .
This is the Syracuse newspaper .
You see " One out , two left in battle for 23rd . "
It 's the 23rd district and the Republican Party 's endorsed candidate , Dede Scozzafava yesterday withdrew from the race .
You endorsed her .
She was the party 's nominee .
But she withdrew from the race after Sarah Palin , Tim Pawlenty , the former governor of Alaska , the current governor of Minnesota , two people who might want to run for president some day , and other conservatives jumped in and said she 's not good enough , she 's not pure enough to be a Republican .
Can you be the speaker of the House , can your party survive in this part of the country if things like this happen ?
BOEHNER : Well this is a pretty unusual situation .
You had seven county chairmen who chose Dede to be our nominee .
And clearly , she would be on the left side of our party , a conservative decided to leave the Republican Party and sign up on the conservative party ticket , which is allowed in New York .
And what 's happened over the last several weeks is her numbers have continued to slide .
Hoffman , Doug Hoffman , the conservative party candidate , his numbers continue to grow .
And so Dede yesterday decided to withdraw from the race .
This is a pretty unusual circumstance .
BOEHNER : That we see in New York .
KING : But does it not send a signal ?
Your friend and former House speaker , Republican Newt Gingrich , said , if this happened , it would be a purge of the Republican Party .
This is what Chris Van Hollen -- obviously , he 's a Democrat and your colleague in the House .
He 's chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
He says , " The far - right tea - bag party is leading the Republican Party around by the nose . "
BOEHNER : Now , listen , we accept moderates in our party and we want moderates in our party .
We cover a wide range of Americans .
I 've -- I was at the tea party in Bakersfield , California on April 15th .
I answered questions in front of 18,000 tea-party people , Labor Day weekend in West Chester , Ohio .
I 've worked with these people .
And what they 're concerned about is the growing size of government .
They want someone who 's really going to actively reduce spending and reduce control here in Washington .
They 're scared to death .
And in this particular case , they think that Mr. Hoffman was a better candidate than the Republican .
KING : If you were a pro-choice Republican , say in the Northeast part of the country -- maybe you support same - sex marriage as well , but you 're a fiscal conservative and you think you 're a New England moderate Republican , Northeast moderate Republican -- would you enter a race , now , for Congress next year , seek the Republican nomination , knowing that something like this might happen ?
BOEHNER : I -- I would hope so .
I would hope so .
Because what we need is we need a broad group of people in our party .
KING : Does n't this send a pretty stern signal to those people ...
BOEHNER : No , this is a very unusual circumstance .
KING : You do n't think the people who went after Dede are going to think , " We can go after other Republicans now , " now that they 've succeed here ?
BOEHNER : Well , I think that going after Republicans is one thing .
Having a party standing on fiscal responsibility , like we have all year ; standing on principle against the crazy policies that we see out of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid -- the American people want to see us take these principled stands .
And they want to see us continue to offer what we think are better solutions .
If we can continue to do that , we 'll have a broad cross-section of people in our party .
KING : As the House Republican leader and the man who would like to be speaker , how do you -- looking at what happened here , you think it 's isolated ; you hope it 's isolated .
What do you do when you 're in a room with a Sarah Palin , a Governor Pawlenty , the Club for Growth , the people who attacked your party 's nominee there ?
What message do you send to them about -- I assume you 'd want them to pick and choose future battles pretty carefully .
You do n't have much room for error in next year 's elections if you want to get your ultimate goal .
BOEHNER : Well , we 're in the middle of , I think , of a political rebellion going on in America .
And this rebellion are by people who really have not been actively involved in the political process .
And they do n't really care whether you 're a Democrat or a Republican .
They want to see people who are going to stand up and protect the future for our kids and grandkids .
And so it 's going to be a difficult road to walk , to work with relative -- relatively new entrants into the political system and to work with them to show them that , by and large , we are the party who represents their interests .
KING : Let me ask you , lastly , though , but sometimes does the party need to draw a line ?
What 's the point of having a party if people in your party will attack your own nominees ?
I mean , where do you draw that line ?
BOEHNER : Listen , I 'm a big believer in Ronald Reagan 's 11 commandment -- 11th commandment .
Never talk ill about another Republican .
KING : That was not followed in this race .
BOEHNER : I know .
KING : John Boehner , the House Republican leader , the man who hopes to be speaker , we appreciate your coming in here today .
Police Raid at the Atlanta Eagle
On September 10 , 2009 , a paramilitary , SWAT - type force of Atlanta police officers stormed into a gay bar called the Atlanta Eagle without a warrant .
The police immediately forced dozens of innocent customers to lie face - down on the floor , which was covered with spilled beer , dirt , and broken glass , simply because they were patrons of the bar .
Patrons who were not suspected of any criminal activity were illegally searched ; police officers emptied their pockets , confiscated their ID ’s , and entered every patron ’s name into a police computer .
The Police detained all of the patrons between thirty and ninety minutes , handcuffed some of them , and forced them to remain face - down on the floor long after they had been searched and found to be unarmed .
The police never explained why they were there , and when patrons asked questions , they were told to “ shut the fuck up . ”
Some patrons were told they would be hit in the head with a barstool if they asked any questions , and some were shoved to the ground and kicked by the officers .
Several patrons report that some officers made racist and anti-gay slurs .
At the end of the raid , not a single patron was charged with any crime .
On behalf of the Atlanta Eagle and many of its patrons , Atlanta attorney Dan Grossman , the Southern Center for Human Rights , and Lambda Legal have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Atlanta , Police Chief Richard Pennington , and the individual police officers involved in the raid .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
More than 200 Afghan election officials implicated in Afghanistan 's tainted presidential election will be replaced before the runoff election in less than three weeks , U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon speaks to reporters about the run-off in Afghanistan .
" We will make sure that first of all , the Independent Election Commission will have to visit all the polling stations throughout Afghanistan , " Ban said Tuesday .
" And we will make sure that those polling stations from which we have received complaints will be reviewed .
" And we will try to replace , out of 380 electoral districts in Afghanistan , more than 200 district officials who have been implicated . "
The U.N. leader 's comments came hours after Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai agreed to a runoff with his main challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , on November 7 .
Karzai 's decision follows a report by a U.N. - backed panel of election monitors saying there was widespread fraud in the August 20 election .
Independent analysis of that report shows Karzai 's tally of votes is now below the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff .
The 200 election officials the U.N. wants to replace were recruited by Afghanistan 's Independent Electoral Commission .
Ban has that the U.N. would advise the IEC not to re-recruit those officials who were implicated in fraud .
The U.N. has said some flouted or ignored electoral procedures , and others were complicit in attempted fraud .
Asked by Amanpour whether it was feasible to cancel or eliminate those areas from the runoff vote where fraud was detected , Ban replied : " That would be amount to depriving the rights of vote of many Afghan people .
Therefore , we cannot accept that methodology . "
" We have to provide an opportunity where all the Afghan people can express of their own free will , without any intimidation , without any threat .
That 's the commitment of the United Nations and the international community , " he said .

The main challenger to Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Abdullah Abdullah , said Wednesday that certain conditions must be met to ensure a safe and fair runoff race , but he did not spell them out .
Abdullah Abdullah , speaking to reporters , said he would outline the conditions in coming days .
At the news conference , Abdullah repeated much of what he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday .

He said he was prepared to participate in the runoff election set for November 7 .
And he left open the door to unspecified alternatives .
If the election is not held by early November , winter would make voting impossible in some areas and force a delay until spring 2010 , Afghan officials have said .
Abdullah spoke a day after Karzai bowed to Western pressure and agreed to participate in the runoff .
Western powers , notably the United States , had pushed Karzai to accept the final election results .
They want to ensure that Afghanistan has a legitimate government , particularly as Washington considers beefing up its military presence there .

Several million Italians were today voting to elect the man whose unenviable job will be to try to unseat Silvio Berlusconi .
True to its name , the Democratic party ( PD ) , Italy 's biggest opposition group , chooses its leader by popular ballot .
Anyone of 16 or more who is legally resident in Italy can pay € 2 to take part .
The election was held against a background of scandal .
Piero Marrazzo , the PD governor of Lazio , the region around Rome , resigned on yesterday after it emerged that Carabinieri officers had been planning to blackmail him with a video reportedly showing the married governor with a transsexual .
It was the latest blow to a party that lags Berlusconi's in the polls , despite a string of sex scandals involving the prime minister .
In February , the PD 's former secretary , Walter Veltroni , stepped down after a heavy defeat in a regional poll .
Dario Franceschini , a former Christian Democrat who was chosen as stopgap leader , is one of the two main contenders for the succession .
But the favourite is Pierluigi Bersani , a tough ex-communist and former minister in the centre - left government which lost office last year .
Bersani emerged from a ballot of party members with more than half the vote .
Franceschini was hoping that vigorous attacks on Berlusconi would enable him to outflank his rival in the popular vote .
Not for the first time , Italy 's prime minister succeeded in wrapping himself in an air of mystery at the weekend .
His return from a " private " visit to his friend , the Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin , was delayed until yesterday , officially because of a snow storm .
However , weather conditions in St Petersburg were reported normal for the time of year .

Case 1
A while ago , I happened to be driving home from a conference held in another part of the country , quite far from everything else .
I had been driving for some time and felt ravenously hungry , as people are wont to do after wasting their weekend with brainless group dynamics exercises .
So quite naturally , I drove to the nearest gas station in search of a decent sandwich
Once inside , I scanned the selection available .
Uh - oh , I thought , they all have ham or beef in them .
I 'm a vegetarian , so I asked the woman behind the counter whether they had any non-meat options .
" Weeelll . . . "
She said , " those ones on the left are filled with sausages .
Would you like one ? "
Case 2
Three weeks afterwards , I participated in another conference .
This time the organiser s had arranged a meal for us , prepared and served by a professional catering manager .
I had asked beforehand whether they would prefer me to bring my own food , and was replied along the lines of " Do n't worry , Be happy " .
The catering manager was informed about my dietary requirements and would act accordingly , the organisers assured me cheerful ly .
Of course , when it actually came to eating , I was left standing before two vats filled with chili con carne and chicken sauce .
" But , " I whined , " where is my vegetarian option ? "
The catering manager smiled at me and pointed towards the vats .
" Vegetarians eat chicken , do n't they ? " he replied .
Case 3
Another day , another conference , this time a very formal one , with people seated around the table and servants handing us our portions on silver plate s.
When it was my turn , I politely declined the offer of smoked salmon and asked for a special vegetarian option , which I had made a point of ordering beforehand .
The waiter 's face was perplexed .
" Miss , it seems we have no vegetarian options prepared .
Would you like roast duck instead ? "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A New York police officer pleaded not guilty to charges that he used his gun while off duty to menace unruly train passengers over the weekend .
Officer David Hendrick was suspended without pay after being arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and menacing , the New York Police Department said .
Hendrick , 38 and a 16 - year veteran of the police force , is accused of brandishing his weapon in an attempt to quiet two disorderly hockey fans riding on a Long Island Railroad train Sunday night .
Hendrick , however , said the rowdy New York Rangers fans started " coming at me " after he warned them to calm down or be escorted off the train .
The officer and the hockey fans boarded a Ronkonkoma bound train at Penn Station shortly after 9 p.m. , according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority .
The two men were allegedly boisterous , drinking and harassing other passengers , the authority said , and Hendrick pulled his weapon hoping the sight of the gun would persuade them to settle down .
Instead , police met the train in Mineola , New York , and removed Hendrick .
Speaking to New York 's News 12 cable station , Hendrick said that he pulled his weapon after identifying himself as a police officer and gave the two men two warnings to calm down .
When the warnings failed , he said he told the men , " You have two choices .
Stop the drinking , stop the cursing , stop the smoking , the disrespect by everybody , or I escort you off the train . "
" A rumble ensued , " he said .
" I had my gun on me .
They were coming at me .
We were fighting , throwing blows .
I pulled out my gun , pointed it at the subjects .
It was two against one .
They were out for blood , and that 's why I pulled out my gun on the subjects . "
Hendrick was held on $ 2,500 bond .
He entered his plea Monday and is expected back in court on October 14 .
Calls to Hendrick 's attorney , Steve Worth , were not returned .

Thirty - nine living relatives of Adolf Hitler have been discovered by a customs official and a journalist who claim to have decoded the Nazi dictator 's DNA .
Analysing forgotten cigarette butts in a small village in lower Austria , a used paper serviette in a New York fast food restaurant and the seals of letters sent over 30 years ago from northern France , Marc Vermeeren and Jean - Paul Mulders said they had traced all known living relatives of the Fuehrer for the first time .
As well as three living in America , whose existence has been reported previously , they claim to have tracked down 36 others who still live in the wooded area of Austria where Hitler was born .
Mr Vermeeren , a Belgian customs official , and Mulders , a journalist for Belgian newspaper Het Laaste Nieuws , said three great - grandchildren of Hitler 's father , Alois , lived on Long Island , outside New York , under the false name Stuart - Houston .
They are descendants who left Germany to escape the Nazis .
Louis and Brian Stuart - Houston share a little wooden house in East Patchogue , where they work as gardeners , while Alexander is a retired psychologist who helps Vietnam veterans .
The Belgians said they had watched them for seven days and nights , following 60 - year - old Alexander to a fast - food restaurant where he disposed of a paper serviette after eating fried chicken that they retrieved and later matched with '' DNA of Hitler that we keep in a sealed , armoured chest ' ' , according to Mulders .
The cigarette butts came from Hitler relatives in Austria , they said .
'' The American relatives have agreed not to have children to extinguish the saga of Hitler and stop living in fear , but have promised to publish a book before they die , '' said Mulders .
The incident is being investigated by the police Computer hackers have targeted the Guardian newspaper 's jobs website in a " sophisticated and deliberate " move , the company has said .
The breach put the personal details of some of the site 's users at risk , and those who may have been affected have been identified and e-mailed .
The Guardian said it had since been " assured " by the supplier that runs the site that the system was now secure .
Officers from the Metropolitan Police 's e-crime unit are investigating .
The Guardian says its jobs site attracts more than two million unique users a month .
The company e-mailed those affected , saying : " You have used the site to make one or more job applications and we believe your personal data , relating to those applications , may have been accessed . "
It 's very disconcerting to think that some very important details with regards to my identity could be in the wrong hands
Paul Rocks , Guardian jobs site user
It said there was " no reason to believe " financial or banking data was compromised , but passed on police advice about taking precautions , such as contacting creditors and asking them to monitor users ' accounts .
Recipients of the e-mail were also given the details of several organisations offering advice and services on identity fraud .
A Guardian technology director said : " Not all users are affected by any means . "
' Utmost seriousness '
But one user Paul Rocks said he was angry about what had happened .
" It 's very disconcerting to think that some very important details with regards to my identity could be in the wrong hands .
These include my past employment details , date of birth and my current address .
" I 'm also annoyed that the responsibility for doing something about this seems to have been passed on to me . "
Mr Rocks , 40 , who is a freelance journalist in London , said the details a hacker could have obtained would be enough for an identity thief to apply for a loan or credit card .
He has contacted his bank , who told him they would pass on a note of the incident to a credit reference agency .
The hack does not affect the separate US site , which is independent of the UK operation .
A subsequent statement on the jobs website said : " We would like to assure you that we are absolutely committed to protecting the privacy of our users and we are treating this situation with the utmost seriousness . "

Ontario's Legislature ground to a halt Monday afternoon because of a protest over Premier Dalton McGuinty 's controversial 13 per cent harmonized sales tax .
Owen Sound - area MPP
Bill Murdoch of the Progressive Conservatives refused to leave the chamber after being ordered out for using unparliamentary language , with fellow MPPs Randy Hillier and Toby Barret blocking the sergeant - at - arms from escorting him out .
The Tories repeatedly chanted " call public hearings " in a bid to force the Liberals to hold province - wide hearings into the tax – taking effect next July 1 – all as Speaker of the Legislature Steve Peters threatened to eject other Conservatives .
" I 'm proud to stand up for the taxpayer , " said Murdoch , who was wearing a kilt in Ontario 's official tartan .
The incident reminded politicos of a similar protest by former Liberal MPP Alvin Curling in the 1990s , who stayed overnight in the House with a blanket on his lap to cover him as he was believed to have urinated in a bottle .
MPPs joked that the kilt would be convenient for Murdoch if he plans a long vigil .
Both Murdoch and Hillier were suspended from the Legislature for the rest of the session – which means until the government decides to prorogue the House and return with a throne speech in a new session .
That could be months or even until after the next election in 2011 .
In the interim , the 25 - member Conservative caucus would lose two votes on issues in the House .
" It is a big deal but the reality is the government is n't listening to us , " said Conservative house leader Bob Runciman .
" The calculation is we are prepared to lose a number of members . "
He said voters should n't be turned off by the rambunctiouness .
" People realize the Progressive Conservative caucus is fighting as hard as we can on this tax . "

Public hearings will be held in Toronto only on Thursday and next Monday .

Europe ’s Obama Fatigue
U.S. President Barack Obama is so beloved in Europe that he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize ( which he later won ) just 12 days after taking office for his " extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples . "
A Pew survey this summer found that 93 percent of Germans , 91 percent of French people , and 86 percent of Brits believed Obama " will do the right thing in world affairs , " a stunning turnaround from their views on the last administration .
Yet , this perception belies the reality that Obama has done much less for Europe than his predecessor .
Despite George W. Bush ’s defiant " you ’re with us or you ’re against us " public stance , he actively solicited advice and input from his NATO partners .
Obama , by contrast , is saying all the right things in public about transatlantic relations and NATO but adopting a high - handed policy and paying little attention to Europe .
And Europe is taking a hint .
The signs are telling , the most important but least reported of which are Obama ’s choice of staffing .
To be sure , there are some very prominent Atlanticists in the administration .
Gen. James Jones , the previous chairman of the Atlantic Council and former supreme allied commander , is national security advisor .
And current Atlantic Council Chairman Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) has just been appointed as co-chair of the President ’s Intelligence Advisory Board .
But many important working - level posts in both the State Department and the National Security Council ( NSC ) are unfilled .
Most notably , the EU portfolio at the State Department has been treated as a political hot potato , currently being handled as an additional duty by the Balkans director .
With such a dreadfully weak human infrastructure at home , it ’s no wonder next week ’s U.S. - EU summit is expected to be a non-event .
The preparations have thus far mostly focused on protocol rather than policy .
The Europeans are particularly irritated that the luncheon will be hosted by Vice President Joseph Biden rather than the U.S. president himself .
Under the previous administration , Bush regularly presided .
On Afghanistan , which all agree is the alliance ’s most critical mission , the Europeans are also feeling a bit lorded over .
As Jackson Diehl put it , the region ’s leaders are " frustrated that they must watch and wait — and wait and wait — for the [ U.S. ] president to make up his mind . "
Mark Mardell , BBC ’s North America editor , reported " a growing sense of frustration " at the NATO defense ministers meeting in Slovakia last week over being held in limbo .
Even in Britain , where the public loves Obama , the government has been obsessed , after repeated slights — the infamous CD set gifted to Prime Minister Gordon Brown , a press conference canceled due to light snow ( or was it fatigue ? ) , being denied a private meeting with Obama at the Pittsburgh summit , etc. — with the notion that the two countries ’ " special relationship " is over .
To be sure , some of this is overblown — and hardly new — but Obama has been less solicitous of his country ’s most natural ally than any U.S. president in memory .
America ’s relationship with France bounced back markedly after Nicolas Sarkozy was elected to replace Jacques Chirac .
But there have been more than a few bumps since Obama took office .
" Obama ’s policies are not the Atlanticism that Sarkozy was expecting , " Macleans quotes Hall Gardner , a professor of international politics at the American University of Paris , as saying .
" There ’ve been several elements of disagreement between the two . "
Some of this can surely be attributed to Sarkozy ’s personal pique over upstart Obama stealing some of his thunder — what the press has dubbed his " Obama complex " — as the U.S. president did by swooping in to take credit for China ’s concessions at the G - 20 , for example .
But there is legitimate frustration over the handling of issues as well .
Most famously , of course , Sarkozy complained at the United Nations that " President Obama dreams of a world without weapons but right in front of us two countries [ Iran and North Korea ] are doing the exact opposite . "
There are also sharp differences over troop levels and strategic objectives in Afghanistan , Turkey ’s candidacy for the European Union , and the future of the French nuclear arsenal .
But if Obama ’s ratings are slowly falling on the continent , one place where they are already low — lower than Bush ’s , certainly — is in the countries that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld dubbed " New Europe . "
While Bush made Eastern and Central Europe a top priority — as evidenced by the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic and the push for NATO expansion for Georgia and Ukraine — his successor is clearly more concerned about relations with Russia , the very country whose influence New Europe is trying to avoid .
Obama ’s handling of the policy reversal on missile defense , in particular , has drawn sharp rebukes from the region , mostly on the execution rather than the policy itself .
A Polish official was quoted by United Press International proclaiming that , " Waking Czech Prime Minister Fisher at midnight European time , and calling President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Tusk — who refused to take the call — 70 years to the day that Russia invaded Poland — is politically inept and very offensive . "
Another official added , " this simply confirms how unimportant Europe is to the U.S. , despite President Obama ’s words to the contrary . "
To be sure , this criticism is somewhat overstated .
But , as Bush learned to his chagrin , perception can become reality .
And indeed , while most European heads of state dutifully congratulated Obama after the surprise announcement of his Nobel win , the European press was as stunned as their American counterparts .
The Independent ‘s Ian Birrell assessed that Obama was being " once again lauded for his symbolism and potential rather than his actual deeds . "
Peter Beaumont of The Guardian equally snarked , " The reality is that the prize appears to have been awarded to Barack Obama for what he is not .
For not being George W. Bush .
Or rather being less like the last president . "
It would be ironic , indeed , if the Europeans started longing for the good old days of the Bush administration .
But that nostalgia is closer than you might think .
The BlackBerry Storm2 is slated to go on sale Wednesday online and at Verizon Wireless stores for $ 180 , after a rebate and a new two year voice and data plan , Verizon and Research in Motion Ltd. announced today .
The companies confirmed that the new model includes new SurePress " clickable " display technology and built - in Wi-Fi capabilities .
Some early reviewers lauded the upgrades , noting the touchscreen problems with the original Storm device .
One reviewer , Walter Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal , said he found " typing was much improved " with Storm2 , though he added , " I doubt it will satisfy lovers of physical keyboards . "
Customers buying the BlackBerry Tour at a Verizon store last July also reported concerns with the original Storm 's touchscreen , and converted to a physical keyboard a result .
The Storm2 has a 3.25 inch display , with 3G connectivity that will allow phone calls in more than 220 countries and data access in more than 185 countries , the carrier said .
The device includes 2GB onboard storage and a microSD / SDHD memory card slot with a 16GB card included .
The Storm2 also runs BlackBerry OS 5.0 , which the companies said will provide typing accuracy improvements and more uses of animation .
There is a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus and video recording ability .
A removable , rechargeable battery is designed for 5.5 hours of talk time and 11.2 days of standby time .
He continued : " If you put in more troops we can achieve the objectives laid upon us more quickly and with less casualties .
We can start winning the psychological battle which is broadly wrapped around the Taliban saying " the west and the Afghan government is doing very little for you " – we ( the Taliban ) will offer you an austere future but at least it will be secure " .
What we need to demonstrate is that we , Nato and the Afghan government , offer a much brighter future which is more secure , with jobs , and education and better health . "

Lily Hixon flung open her kitchen cupboards with pride .
“ Look , ” she said , doing a Vanna White impression as she gestured to boxes of cereal and crackers .
“ I like everything organized . ”
The one - bedroom Monrovia apartment decked out in Ikea has been Hixon ’s introduction to independent living , a privilege the 25 - year - old born with Down syndrome still can’t believe is hers .
Built on an old rail yard , Regency Court Apartments is a quiet , mini-neighborhood of sage - green apartments and bungalows where Hixon greets neighbors with a wave .
But last month , she and about 20 other physically or developmentally disabled tenants , some of whom have lived in the affordable housing complex for more than a decade , were notified that their leases were being terminated .
The management firm that took over the facility two years ago told the tenants there had been a mistake and they never should have been allowed to move in .
Regency Court , the letter said , was always meant to be a senior apartment community , and those under age 62 would have to leave .
It offered a brief apology .

Located among a row of houses in a quiet neighborhood , Regency Court is close to bus lines , within walking distance of jobs that people with disabilities might land and accepts Section 8 housing vouchers .
It seemed a perfect fit for people who want to live on their own but are susceptible to predators .
Parents of the disabled say part of the complex ’s allure is the symbiotic relationship between the senior and disabled communities where both move a little slower than the outside world and neither presents a threat .
“ If we ’d sat down years ago and tried to dream up this package , we would n’t have gotten it half as good as this , ” said Hixon ’s father , Ken .
“ That ’s part of the parents ’ anguish right now -- that now we ’re back to zero .
How do we replicate this ? ”
Upset and unsure of what to do , residents and family members contacted the Housing Rights Center , which has filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging discrimination based on age and disability .

Regency Court has failed to provide proof that its funding restricts the complex to seniors , said Michelle Uzeta of the Housing Rights Center .
“ This is a complex that since it opened in 1995 has advertised to and served a disabled and senior client base , ” Uzeta said .
“ Even if they are supposed to be senior housing and have been acting inappropriately for the last 15 years , the answer would not be terminating everybody ’s residency . ”
Craig Diamond , an attorney who represents the owner and the management firm , said Regency Court is clearly defined as senior apartment housing , and a resolution in the matter will be determined by the state and county agencies that help fund the property .
He declined to identify the agencies .
“ Until I heard from the lawyer for the tenants , I had no clue as to the special circumstances surrounding these individuals , ” said Diamond , who wrote the lease termination letters .
“ It should also be said that the regulators , management and owners are working really hard to try to get this matter resolved . ”

Regency Court is owned by Star - Holdings of Illinois and managed by Professional Property Management , both of which are headquartered in Rockford , Ill .
Many of the residents at risk of being forced out are graduates of Taft College near Bakersfield , which has placed developmentally disabled graduates of its adult life skills program at Regency for 10 years .
“ What ’s interesting is we talk about what gets you evicted in one of our class components , ” said Jeff Ross , director of student support services at Taft .
“ But these guys did n’t trash their apartments .
They paid their rent on time .
They have done everything right .
They graduated from high school , went to college to learn how to live independently , got a job .
Then the rug started to be pulled out from underneath them . ”
Ross said that before the school ’s first students were placed at Regency Court , staff members verified that the complex accepted both senior citizens and disabled residents .

For Taft graduates Matt and Laura Fosbury , both 29 , the upstairs apartment they share has been a newlywed nest .
Framed photos of the two kissing and laughing cover the walls , and cards congratulating them on their recent one - year anniversary sit on the counter .
During the day , Matt works as a cart collector at Target and Laura clears tables at a hospital cafeteria .
They take pleasure in simple things like making a dinner of enchiladas , balancing the family finances or going out for an ice cream shake .
If the couple ca n’t live at Regency Court , they worry they ’ll be forced to return to their families ’ homes and lose their independence .
“ My dream was to have my own apartment , and that dream came true , ” Laura said .
“ I do not want to go back to living with my parents . ”
Some , like Frankie Mae Platt , do n’t even have that option .
Platt wo n’t turn 62 until next year and has been asked to leave .

Suffering from lupus and rheumatoid arthritis when she signed the lease 14 years ago , Platt is unable to work and worries that she wo n’t be able to find safe , low - income housing in the area .
For the time being , Uzeta said Regency Court had verbally agreed to hold off on revoking the leases but offered nothing in writing .
Until a decision is made , tenants worry about losing the home life they ’ve created .
Hixon said an eviction would force her to leave the neighborhood and her job bagging groceries at a nearby market .
But she said she ’s more concerned about losing neighbors who take time to understand a young woman whose facial expressions say what her sometimes garbled speech does not .
“ Here I can go slow with words and take my time , and people around me understand , ” she said .
“ They ’re like my family . ”

For more young adults , there is no place like home for the holidays , and for the rest of the year , too .
Ten percent of adults younger than 35 told the Pew Research Center that they had moved back in with their parents because of the recession .
They also blamed the economy for other lifestyle decisions .
Twelve percent had gotten a roommate to share expenses .
Fifteen percent said they had postponed getting married , and 14 percent said they had delayed having a baby .
In the Pew study , 13 percent of parents with grown children said one of their adult sons or daughters had moved back home in the past year .
According to Pew , of all grown children who lived with their parents , 2 in 10 were full - time students , one - quarter were unemployed and about one - third said they had lived on their own before returning home .
According to the census , 56 percent of men 18 to 24 years old and 48 percent of women were either still under the same roof as their parents or had moved back home .
In a live interview on CNBC , Mishkin disagreed strongly with a plan being pushed by Rep. Ron Paul , a Texas Republican and leading Fed critic .
" This is I think the most serious attack that I 've seen on the Federal Reserve in the many , many years that I 've studied it as a scholar , " said Mishkin , an economist at Columbia Business School who was affiliated with the Fed in various capacities from 1994 - 2006 .
" This is really dangerous stuff . "
See the full video of Mishkin 's comments here
Paul 's plan would require the General Accounting Office to audit Fed decisions within a year of the bill 's enactments .
He has said the move would ensure the central bank is being held accountable for its decisions but rejected notions that the audits would compromise Fed independence .
See video of Paul discussing his plan with CNBC
Mishkin said history has shown that when lawmakers try to inject politics into the Fed , bad decisions are made and inflation often occurs as governors are pressured to keep interest rates low .
Former Fed governor Randall Kroszner appeared on CNBC Monday and voiced similar concerns .
" Many of the sponsors of this legislation are very worried about inflation , " Mishkin said .
" This kind of legislation will do just the opposite ( of controlling inflation ) .
It is an outright attack on the Fed 's independence . "
Mishkin said he agrees that the Fed needs to be as transparent as possible but said " second - guessing them is going to be extremely problematic . "
" We 're going to get bad outcomes , " he said .
" It 's not I think what the Congress wants . "

Almost 10 % of the World 's mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish are at risk of extinction , says an Australian report .
The animals face threats including habitat loss and climate change .
The report comes from Australia 's Biological Resources Study , a project aiming to document all of the planet 's known animal and plant species .
The study found that almost 1 % of the World 's 1.9 million classified species were threatened .
This included 9.2 % of major vertebrate species .
The publication , Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World , is part of a major effort to document the entire planet 's animal and plant life .
The study underlines the unique biodiversity in Australia
It said that 20 % of mammals were endangered , as were 12 % percent of birds and 29 % of amphibians .
Almost 5 % of reptiles were considered threatened , along with 4 % of fish species .
Peter Garrett , Australian Minister for the Environment , Heritage and the Arts , said : " We need this essential information to do a better job of managing our biodiversity against the threats of invasive species , habitat loss and climate change . "
Mr Garrett also announced a partnership between the the Australian Biological Resources Study , and the mining company BHP Billiton to name and describe 500 reef species over the next three years .
Fred Crzybowski , a 20 - year - old from Los Angeles , is known as “ the Tony Hawk of the pogo world ” for the extreme pogo - stick jumps he can perform .
Fred , who started using a pogo - stick at the age of eight , is the current record holder for the most consecutive backflips , which stands at nine .
He has appeared in motion pictures like Mister Magorium ’s Wonder Emporium and hopes he will get new gigs in television and movies .
This young pogo - stick master ’s dream is to bring pogo - stick jumping at the same level as other extreme sports like skateboarding or rollerblading .
He says technology has made significant improvements and pogo - sticks are no longer just toys , but powerful tools that can help jumpers perform serious stunts .
He uses a Flybar pogo- stick , designed by SBI Enterprises , that can lift a 250 - pound man five feet in the air , but he gets way more out of it .
Like all extreme performers he has had his share of accidents , including a split lip that took 30 stitches to repair .
But that wo n’t stop him from jumping over cars , staircases or other obstacles , any time soon .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The pandemic H1N1 influenza virus has been found for the first time in a commercial swine herd , the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday .

The sick herd was found in Indiana , the USDA said , noting both the pigs and their caretakers have fully recovered from the virus , commonly called swine flu .
USDA said the Indiana facility has continued its routine processing practices because it is safe for swine that recover from influenza viruses to be slaughtered .
A USDA spokesman said it could not release the city , name of the facility or the size of the herd where the pandemic H1N1 virus was found “ in order to ensure continued high levels of participation in swine surveillance efforts , and because this is not a food safety or public health risk . ”
The human form of the new H1N1 virus , which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June , is circulating the globe .
Researchers at The Centers for Disease Control estimated last week that as many as 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected so far , with at least 1,300 deaths .
Last week , USDA said six pigs shown at the Minnesota State Fair in September had been confirmed as having had the pandemic H1N1 flu virus .
The USDA found the virus in the first U.S. hog on October 19 -- one of the six positives from the fair .
“ It ’s expected that pigs will get this particular flu strain just like pigs every year get the flu , ” said Dave Warner of the National Pork Producers Council , who added he would not be surprised to see more cases of pandemic H1N1 in U.S. hogs .
“ It ’s just not an issue .
It ’s not unexpected , ” he said .
World health officials have stressed the flu cannot be contracted from eating pork .
But the virus has affected pork trade , most notably to China , which has banned U.S. pork since May because of the outbreak in humans .
Chinese officials said last Thursday they plan to lift the ban .
The USDA ’s finding appeared to have little impact on hog markets on Monday as analysts had forecast for some time that humans could transmit the flu to hogs .
Hog futures were higher in afternoon electronic trading following USDA ’s announcement before drifting back to near unchanged from the pit close .
Also , shares of Smithfield Foods Inc , the largest U.S. hog and pork producer , were up on the New York Stock Exchange .
Hog futures have sped higher recently as investment funds have poured money into the market .
“ This may stall the rally for a moment , but I do n’t think it ’s over , ” Rich Nelson , analyst at Allendale Inc , said of Monday ’s news .
Jim Clarkson , livestock analyst with A&A Trading Inc , added that he does n’t expect any market reaction until all the facts become available regarding the size of the herd and what is being done to keep it in check .
“ I do n’t know that anybody is going to react to something like that until it ’s confirmed and you know what kind of size it ( hog operation ) is , ” said Clarkson .
The new strain of H1N1 virus , which has genetics from swine , birds and humans , likely circulated undetected in pigs for at least a decade before jumping to humans , according to an expert at the University of Arizona .
Swine flu , common in hogs around the world , causes fever and coughing in pigs , which usually recover from the illness .
The virus has been found in several herds in Canada .
USDA said it would post all future suspected and confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza detections on a spreadsheet at www.usda.gov/H1N1flu.

childcare needed
looking for a responsible and dedicated person to babysit my two children during the week .
you will be needed monday through friday , from 7 AM to 4:30 PM .
email me at ***********@comcast.net and we can talk about pay .
DO NOT EMAIL ME UNLESS YOU HAVE REFERENCES From Me to **********@comcast.net :
Hi there !
Are you still looking for someone to fill your babysitter position ?
Mike
From **********@comcast.net to Me :
yes i am .
please send your info and any past expereince you have .
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
Actually , I am not the one applying for the position .
I run a rehabilitation program for good people who are trying to enter society again , and have a few candidates who I think would be able to watch your kids .
They will work for a much cheaper rate than a professional babysitter , but will still deliver professional service .
Mike
From **********@comcast.net to Me :
what kind of rehab program do you run ?
injured people or something like that ?
if you are talking about drug addicts than forget it .
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
Absolutely not !
Do n't worry , I would never even dare consider having drug addicts watch your children .
They are children for pete 's sake !
My rehabilitation program is called Kons For Kids .
We help get ex-convicts back on the right track again , by giving them second chances that they deserve .
We help them experience the joy of working with children and helping the community .
It is often difficult for these ex-cons to get jobs after being released from a correctional facility , but it is a requirement while being on parole .
We have seen lots of success with the program .
Most of our clients are extremely satisfied with their ex-con .
Despite the negative image that people like to give to ex-cons , they really are loving , caring people .
I have two potential clients in your area , if you are interested .
Here is a little info about them :
Derek Schillinger - Derek is a 43 - year - old male from the Delaware County area .
Just released after serving 17 of 25 years for two counts of third - degree murder .
Derek loves to laugh , read , and enjoys long walks on the beach .
Timothy Beecher - Tim is a 36 - year - old male who was just released after serving 12 years of his 15 year sentence for armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon .
Tim was released on good behavior and is ready to get back into the real world .
Tim enjoys working with kids , and has six kids of his own with various women in the tri-state area .
Before his conviction , Tim was a mid-level cocaine dealer .
He knows a lot about economics and business , and would be able to give your children a great education while watching them .
I look forward to working with you .
Please let me know which person you were interested in , and I will give their parole officer a call .
Thanks !
Mike
From **********@comcast.net to Me :
wow .
kons for kids ?
that is the stupidest thing ive ever heard !!!
who the fuck would let a murderer watch their kids !
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
KFK is a very respectable program .
I 'm guessing from your apparent issues with murderers , you are n't interested in Derek .
Before you completely rule him out , I would like to point out that he was convicted of third degree murder , which is the most harmless kind of murder .
Third degree murder is n't premeditated murder , and it usually just accidental murder .
I talked to Derek , and he said he did n't mean to kill the guy , he just wanted to hurt him .
Please give him another chance .
If you do n't want him watching your kids , I 'll understand .
Should I tell Tim you are interested instead ?
Mike
From **********@comcast.net to Me :
i dont want tim or derek or any of the other lunatics you try to pass off as babysitters !
murder is murder it doesnt matter which way you put it now leave me the fuck alone !
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
I already told Tim that he got the job .
Please do n't make me have to give him the bad news .
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
Are you still there ?
It has been three days , and Tim wants to know when he can start working again .
From Me to **********@comcast.net :
Well , I hope you are happy .
I had to tell Tim that you were n't willing to give him a second chance .
Tim got so angry that he tried to stab me with a fountain pen .
Needless to say , that was considered a violation of his parole and he has been sent back to his correctional facility to serve the remainder of his sentence .
You essentially ruined Tim 's life , after he was ready to get back on the right track .
You are a horrible person .

Oracle has released an FAQ that describes its plans for the future of popular Sun technologies like GlassFish , NetBeans , MySQL and more .
In some cases Oracle ’s announcement is unclear and raises concerns about product viability .
The announcement makes clear that the Oracle will continue to invest in Sun hardware , in Solaris , SPARC , GlassFish and OpenOffice .
There are some things on the other hand that will be merging like Oracle ’s Enterprise Manager and Sun Ops Center that are expected to combine in order to deliver acomplete top - down application and systems management environment .
Similarly Sun ’s Identity Management and SOA products are expected to be integrated into the Oracle Fusion Middleware product family .
Oracle ’s actual statement on this issue seems too vague for Gartner ’s analyst Earl Perkins :
I read the pdf , and it is tied up in discussions about technical and application architecture , not the disposition of products , the markets which they will serve , and the configurations of those solutions .
it merely says something that would be intuitively obvious in almost all acquistions : we ’re going to realize efficiencies of scale by having two groups of people that use to do different things become one group of people do those different things .
there is also no timeframe on when this vision will be realized , whether it ’s before the end of this year or this decade .
Other than that , it ’s pretty clear . :-/.
And if this is an answer , why do we keep getting clients coming to us asking us the same type of questions over and over that are n’t be answered with this ?
Likewise Oracle ’s statement about NetBeans is unclear and does n’t guarantee that the company will continue to invest in this IDE :
Oracle has a strong track record of demonstrating commitment to choice for Java developers .
As such , NetBeans is expected to provide an additional open source option and complement to the two free tools Oracle already offers for enterprise Java development : Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse .
While Oracle JDeveloper remains Oracle ’s strategic development tool for the broad portfolio of Oracle Fusion Middleware products and for Oracle ’s next generation of enterprise applications , developers will be able to use whichever free tool they are most comfortable with for pure Java and Java EE development : JDeveloper , Enterprise Pack for Eclipse , or NetBeans .
Tor Norbye , a principal engineer at Sun Microsystems and former member of the NetBeans teams thinks that Sun ’s IDE can be a valuable asset for Oracle , but also expressed hope that it will continue to get funded [ audio link ] :
… I think NetBeans is the best IDE out there .
I really hope that it continues to be a viable choice .
Right now it ’s as good as anything else , but of course 5 years down the road , if Oracle does n’t invest in it and the community does n’t step up , it could fall behind and I hope that wo n’t happen .
Similarly Fabrizio Giudici seems to think that the Oracle statement carries little information about its plans for NetBeans :
Sounds good at first glance , but after you read it you discover that ... basically there 's zero information . :-)
While JDeveloper remains strategic , NetBeans “ is expected to provide another option ” , but there 's no indication on whether Oracle is going to invest on it or not .
…
So , my opinion is that no decision on NetBeans has been taken .
In the meantime , the best thing the NetBeans community can do is to be vocal about the best IDE and Platform around !
Charles Ditzel is even more pessimistic and suggests that Oracle has missed its opportunity to profit from the NetBenas platform :
Deep packet inspection ( DPI ) hardware can identify an astonishing array of protocols passing across the Internet — up to and including protocols that are rare even to us in the Orbiting HQ ( Gadu - Gadu ? Manolito ?
Feidian ? ) .
But if you 've ever wondered just how this can be done , and done at wire speed , wonder no more : Europe 's leading DPI vendor has open - sourced a version of its traffic detection engine .
OpenDPI.org is the new home for ipoque 's open source project ; anyone interested can take a look at the code or contribute patches .
The goal in this case , though , is n't so much about crowdsourcing product development but about easing consumer fears about DPI technology .
Klaus Mochalski , CEO of ipoque , explains that " transparency was important for us from the beginning .
The lack of transparency from the vendors ' side is widespread in the DPI business .
Our thoughts are a bit different and that is why we decided to push this project . "
The OpenDPI engine , released under the LGPL license , differs from ipoque 's commercial scanning engine in its high - priced DPI hardware .
The open - source version is much slower and ( more importantly ) does n't reveal ipoque 's methods for identifying encrypted transmissions .
DPI vendors all claim high levels of success at identifying such traffic based on the flow patterns and handshake signatures common to protocols like BitTorrent and Skype , even if they cannot crack the encryption and examine the content of those transmissions .
The OpenDPI engine will identify a huge list of non-encrypted protocols , however :
P2P File Sharing : BitTorrent , eDonkey , KaZaa / Fasttrack , Gnutella , WinMX , DirectConnect , AppleJuice , Soulseek , XDCC , Filetopia , Manolito , iMesh , Pando

ipoque apparently wants to convince people that its detection code does n't store or examine the actual content being transmitted .
The company made the same point in a white paper released last week .
" DPI as such has no negative impact on online privacy , " it says .
" It is , again , only the applications that may have this impact .
Prohibiting DPI as a technology would be just as naive as prohibiting automatic speech recognition because it can be used to eavesdrop on conversations based on content .
Although DPI can be used as a base technology to look at and evaluate the actual content of a network communication , this goes beyond what we understand as DPI as it is used by Internet bandwidth management — the classification of network protocols and applications . "
DPI can ( and does ) go much further than this , of course ; it is used by law enforcement to grab complete copies of particular users '
Internet datastreams in investigations , and companies like NebuAd ( now defunct ) and Phorm ( still funct ) use it to examine the URLs being visited by users in order to better target advertising to them .
ipoque 's paper admits to such uses , but calls them " beyond the scope of this paper . "
Releasing its detection engine for analysis is meant to allay fears that ipoque 's traffic management DPI is a " bad " application of the technology .
" By giving the general public access to parts of our DPI engine , we want to demonstrate that many of the alleged privacy violations simply do not happen in DPI bandwidth management systems , " says the company , though plenty of Internet users dislike DPI for reasons that have little to do with privacy and have much more to do with concerns over things like network neutrality ( however one defines that idea ) .
But at least we now know how to identify a Second Life connection :
> if (( ntohs ( packet ->udp -> dest ) == 12035 || ntohs ( packet ->udp ->dest ) == 12036 || ( ntohs ( packet ->udp -> dest ) >= 13000 && ntohs ( packet ->udp ->dest ) <= 13050 ) ) // port && packet->payload_packet_len > 6 // min length with no extra header , high frequency and 1 byte message body && get_u8 ( packet -> payload , 0 ) == 0x40 // reliable packet && ntohl ( get_u32 ( packet -> payload , 1 ) ) == 0x00000001 // sequence number equals 1 // ntohl ( get_u32 ( packet -> payload , 5 ) ) == 0x00 FFFF00 // no extra header , low frequency message - can't use , message may have higher frequency ) { IPQ_LOG ( IPOQUE_PROTOCOL_SECONDLIFE , ipoque_struct , IPQ_LOG_DEBUG , " Second Life detected . n " ) ; ipoque_int_secondlife_add_connection(ipoque_struct ) ; return ;
A few days later , the trial collaborators began to brief researchers privately about additional data , including a second type of analysis that indicated the vaccine regimen had been slightly less effective than the first analysis suggested .
This second analysis was not statistically significant , meaning that chance , rather than the protective effect of the vaccine candidate , might explain why fewer volunteers in the vaccinated group than in the placebo group were infected with H.I.V .
Some researchers questioned why both analyses were n’t announced at the same time  which certainly would have been preferable  and suggested to reporters that the second analysis called the first one into doubt .
The trial sponsors say they thought the complexities of the second analysis and all additional data were best explored in a peer - reviewed paper in a scientific journal and at a presentation at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in Paris this week .
But with news outlets reporting that the trial results may be a fluke , there is a risk that they will be forever tainted , whatever the final analyses show .
What ’s more , the stain of dubiousness may remain on all AIDS vaccine research and development .
That would be a shame .
Although the candidate duo tested in the Thai trial did not prove to be a vaccine ready for the market , it may provide an unprecedented opportunity to learn how an AIDS vaccine can work .
A comparison of blood samples from volunteers could indicate what specific immune responses the combination may have activated to provide protection .
If so , this knowledge could help scientists improve upon the more promising candidates that have emerged since the trial candidates were designed a decade ago , and determine which ones are most likely to work .
This illustrates why the controversy over statistical significance is exaggerated .
Whether you consider the first or second analysis , the observed effect of the Thai candidates was either just above or below the level of statistical significance .
Statisticians will tell you it is possible to observe an effect and have reason to think it ’s real even if it ’s not statistically significant .
And if you think it ’s real , you ought to examine it carefully .
Even if the Thai vaccine regimen turns out , on examination , to have had no real benefit , researchers will still learn from the trial , as they do from every study .
Moreover , other noteworthy advances featured at the Paris conference this week will offer fresh hope for an AIDS vaccine .
Years of investment and dogged science are providing leads for solving one of today ’s most pressing research challenges .
Some 7,400 new H.I.V. infections occur daily throughout the world .
Clearly we need better methods of preventing the spread of H.I.V. , and no public health intervention is more powerful or cost - effective against infectious disease than a vaccine .
There ’s an old joke that you know you 're in heaven if the cooks are Italian and the engineering is German .
If it 's the other way around you 're in hell .
In an attempt to conjure up a perfect city , I imagine a place that is a mash - up of the best qualities of a host of cities .
The permutations are endless .
Maybe I 'd take the nightlife of New York in a setting like Sydney 's with bars like those in Barcelona and cuisine from Singapore served in outdoor restaurants like those in Mexico City .
Or I could layer the sense of humor in Spain over the civic accommodation and elegance of Kyoto .
Of course , it 's not really possible to cherry pick like this — mainly because a city 's qualities cannot thrive out of context .
A place 's cuisine and architecture and language are all somehow interwoven .
But one can dream .
As someone who has used a bicycle to get around New York for about 30 years I 've watched the city — mainly Manhattan , where I live — change for better and for worse .
During this time I started to take a full - size folding bike with me when I traveled so I got to experience other cities as a cyclist as well .
Seeing cities from on top of a bike is both pleasurable and instructive .
On a bike one sees a lot more than from a freeway , and often it 's just as fast as car traffic in many towns .
A " livable city " means vastly different things for many people .
In Hong Kong it might mean that your family is in a comfortable apartment while you play in the exciting mercantile world in a glass tower overlooking the harbor .
In Dallas livability might mean that you live near an expressway that is n't jammed up , at least not all the time , and your car runs most days .
For some it might mean super fast Wi - Fi , the possibility of lucky and lucrative business opportunities and plenty of strip clubs .
If that 's what rocks your boat then try Houston , though to me that city , oil money made physically manifest , is my worst nightmare .
Here are some things that make a city livable for me :
Size
A city can't be too small .
Size guarantees anonymity — if you make an embarrassing mistake in a large city , and it's not on the cover of the Post , you can probably try again .
The generous attitude towards failure that big cities afford is invaluable — it 's how things get created .
In a small town everyone knows about your failures , so you are more careful about what you might attempt .
Every time I visit San Francisco I ask out loud " Why do n't I live here ?
Why do I choose to live in a place that is harder , tougher and , well , not as beautiful ? "
The locals often reply , " You do n't want to live here .
It looks like a city , but it 's really a small village .
Everyone knows what you 're doing "
Oh , OK .
If you say so .
It 's still beautiful .
Not exactly subtle .

On Wednesday , August 5 , the Human Spaceflight Review Committee , popularly called the Augustine Commission , held a public meeting in Washington , DC .
Robert Zubrin spoke to the committee .
Somebody , probably a Mars Society member but probably not Zubrin himself , left several of these bumper - sticker - sized placards around the building .
I found this one in the men ’s room .
Surprisingly , the Mars Society has limited influence on American space policy .
States are backing big energy - efficiency programs , spurred by the belief that they could hold down heating and electricity bills , as well as cut greenhouse - gas emissions .
The programs , usually funded by surcharges on utility bills , help customers weatherize their homes and install new lighting systems , among other things .

Lars von Trier : " I think working with actors is a little bit how a chef would work with a potato ... "
It is well known that Danish director Lars von Trier has not visited America , though many of his films are set here , including his latest feature , “ Antichrist , ” starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg .
While his films are not generally known for being light viewing , the current film , which debuted earlier this year in Cannes and screened at the recent Toronto and New York film festivals , is especially layered with disturbing ( yet beautiful ) imagery and psychological trauma .
Seeing the expressions on people ’s faces as they exited screenings in Cannes gave a slight hint that , no matter what one ultimately thought of it , “ Antichrist ” certainly would not be forgettable .
Screenings in North America have also been polarizing with critics falling strongly on both ends of the love / hate scale .
For an exclusive clip from the film , click here .
The only two characters in the film , Dafoe and Gainsbourg play a grieving couple who retreat to “ Eden , ” their isolated cabin in the woods , where they hope to repair their troubled marriage and broken hearts following the accidental death of their young son .
Despite their effort , things go from bad to worse , with a surreal degeneration into madness .
It debuts on VOD tomorrow ( October 21st ) and in theaters this Friday ( October 23rd ) from IFC Films .
“ Two years ago , I suffered from depression .
It was a new experience for me .
Everything , no matter what , seemed unimportant , trivial , ” von Trier wrote in a statement .
“ I could n’t work .
Six months later , just as an exercise , I wrote a script .
It was a kind of therapy , but also a search , a test to see if I would ever make another film . ”
While von Trier does not travel to America , he nevertheless manages to make a presence , and insists on seeing his interviewers .
So with the miracle Skype video , indieWIRE spoke with him from his Zentropa offices in Copenhagen last week .
Though he speaks openly of debilitating depression and dishes out dark humor , von Trier is surprisingly funny and even jovial – at least during our 20 minutes with him .
In anticipation of speaking with him , indieWIRE solicited questions from our readers .
We also threw in a few of our own for good measure .
In the interview , von Trier speaks of his depression , airplanes , working with actors , and not wearing pants .
Lars von Trier : Sorry you can only see the top half of me , but I ’m not wearing any pants .
Brian Brooks : ( Laughs ) Neither am I. I ’m Brian and this is my colleague Eugene .
This is my second time seeing you on video , talking about [ “ Antichrist ” ] .
The first was at the Toronto [ International Film Festival in September ] , and I know you did the same at the New York Film Festival .
I ’m just wondering what you think of the reactions in North America to “ Antichrist ” so far ?
Lars von Trier :
They are much more positive than I would have thought .
Actually , I ’m quite fine with any reaction , but I think they ’ve seemed a bit more interested in the film .
There was a tendency in Cannes , I think , to go a little bit after the man instead of after the ball — that it was very important , what I meant and what I felt — which is , you know , maybe not the best way to see a film .
Brian Brooks :
So , as you may know , we solicited our readers for questions to ask you .
So I ’m gonna go ahead and start that …
Lars von Trier : Okay , so let ’s see what happens … [ laughs ]
Brian Brooks :
This is from a film student .
His name is Jason Cooper .
He said , “ I felt that ‘ Antichrist ’ was very reminiscent of your early work , ‘ The Element of Crime , ’ and I was wondering if , at least stylistically , you were consciously moving away from your more stripped - down methods that were used in ‘ The Idiots ’ and ‘ Breaking the Waves ’ ? ”
Lars von Trier : Yes , I must say I am .
You know , doing “ Dogville ” and “ Mandalay ” kind of was an example of , you know , going to an extreme where you could n’t go any further .
So I had to kind of went one step back and used only some of the techniques I ’ve used before .
Brian Brooks :
This was a follow - up question from Jason .
“ Are you aware of the undercurrent of themes in your work ( specifically in ‘ Antichrist ’ ) , such as nature and its relationship with sexuality , as you write your scripts ?
Or is this something that comes about after the script ? ”
Lars von Trier :
Yes , I am aware of that , but what I ’m not aware of is that suddenly something turns out very simple .
Brian Brooks :
Finally , was there a purpose behind only having two actors with this film thematically , or was this the ideal option because you know you would have to direct this film while suffering from depression ?
Lars von Trier :
No no no .
It had nothing to do with that .
But I think that any director at a certain time has a dream of making a film with only two persons in it .
It ’s almost a mini-Dogme thing .
It ’s interesting to see if you can make it work somehow .
It ’s egoistic .
Brian Brooks : Alright , different person .
From Luke Moses —
“ Death takes grief and depression to an entirely new level .
Knowing your portrayal of what a mother will do to save her child ( as shown in ‘ Dancer in the Dark ’ ) , is ‘ Antichrist ’ your view on what a mother can be capable of once these incredibly strong and forceful feelings become displaced ? ”
Lars von Trier :
That ’s a very good question .
I can only say yes , I think so .
Yeah , I have thought about that , but she was also in the same situation .
Yeah , I can only apologize .
Eugene Hernandez : What do you mean by that ?
Lars von Trier :
When you put it like that , the film has the tendency to be more banal than it really is .
The film is much more than just a foundation for a film .
Of course , I work very much with the collisions between different things — sexuality and nature , sexuality and morals — all of these things , but when you have a mention like this , I hope the film is better than that .
— continued on page two —
Brian Brooks : Okay , probably a more straightforward question from our reader Michael Mohan , “ How do you work with actors ? ”
Has that process changed ?
Is the process different film to film ?
Lars von Trier : Yeah , it ’s different from film to film .
I think working with actors is a little bit how a chef would work with a potato or a piece of meat .
You have to kind of have a look at the potato or the piece of meat and see what kind of possibilities are in the ingredient .
I know I ’m using the wrong metaphor .
I think my job is to see what potato is there and from there , just work under their conditions .
I do n’t think I have forced anybody .
Bjork I may have forced here and there .
For the good of the film , I just need to give them what they need .
Brian Brooks :
Was the experience of working with Willem Dafoe different this time ?
Lars von Trier : I was not feeling extremely well , so I did n’t have so much energy for the actors , and they knew that before going in .
They were extremely kind to me .
I think there ’s an interesting thing going on with a director who ’s made more than one film or a couple of films [ in that ] that the actors have a tendency to read your way of filmmaking .
A Bergman film becomes a Bergman film because of the expectations of the actors and everyone involved [ know ] what they expect .
Brian Brooks :
The next is from Mike Jones , a writer , “ Would you ever make a horror film about flying ? ”
Lars von Trier : I do n’t think so .
If I should make a film about flying , it would be fantastic .
I have been in airplanes a few times , and it is really a fantastic experience .
And that ’s not why I do n’t go in them .
You do n’t need a lot of imagination to tell what could go wrong .
Eugene Hernandez :
Is it that you do n’t like to travel or are there means of travel that you like to avoid ?
Lars von Trier : I ’m very antisocial actually .
Not with you guys , right now , but I ’d rather stay home .
I do have an auto camper .
It would take me some years to be able to get back in a plane .
I ’m not very proud of this .
It would have been nice for me to go take a look at the real world and then see the world and then tell stories about it , but that ’s not how it is .
Brian Brooks :
The next question is from a reader , Lucas Kollauf – a general question about Dogme .
Why did you move away from the Dogme95 movement that you helped create ?
How does that experience influence or affect your work today if at all ?
Lars von Trier : I make rules for all of my films .
The Dogme rules were decided to make me concentrate on all the things I was beginning to get good at , like tracking shots .
And so for every film , I had rules , I just change them so I do n’t make the same film again .
“ Antichrist ” was more of a miss in that sense .
I was not on the top of my ability .
But normally I would make some rules .
There were rules in this film like how panning shots would turn into still shots , but not that many .
Eugene Hernandez :
You ’ve mentioned that you felt tormented during the film , that it was very challenging for you .
Why did you feel like you had to continue making it if it was such a challenge ?
Lars von Trier : First of all , I co-own the company and I could n’t face the financial result of that .
And for me , right now , I ’m in a situation where I have a lot of mental problems and to me , it was important to make the film to prove to myself that I could make a film .
Eugene Hernandez :
Do you feel good about the film now ?
Lars von Trier : Some parts of the film I feel good about , but it took me a very long time to feel good at all about this film .
Brian Brooks : Now from Arin Crumley , he ’s a filmmaker – and this is sort of a general question : “ What is your belief about where fictional stories come from ?
How do you tap into stories when you write ?
And , what is the general intrigue of storytelling ? ”
Lars von Trier :
These are questions I ’m asking myself now , because I ’m working on a new project .
Some things that were much easier when we were younger are now much more difficult .
It ’s like an erection .
I ca n’t really answer that .
I wish I could because I would be better off right now .
Eugene Hernandez :
What are you working on now ?
Lars von Trier : I ’m working on a script for a film called “ Melancholia , ” which has to do with some planets colliding with Earth , which is of course maybe not a happy ending , but an ending .
But that does n’t make me feel depressed at all .
That ’s fine .
I ’m just not as cheerful and good at things right now as I could be .
Brian Brooks :
This is from the director of programming at Hot Docs , Sean Farnel , “ What do you think is the funniest film ever made ? ”
Lars von Trier :
There ’s been some Marx Brothers film .
I like very much this “ Airplane ! ”
The first time I saw it , it was extremely funny ( laughs ) .
Eugene Hernandez :
Do you watch a lot of movies while you ’re in the writing process ?
Lars von Trier : I might watch them , but they do n’t [ influence my ] films .
What I do is wrong right now , so maybe I should not watch films .
Okay , I hope you guys cheer up before I talk to you again . [ laughs ]

__ 1675 : __Gottfried Leibniz writes the integral sign ∫ in an unpublished manuscript , introducing the calculus notation that 's still in use today .
Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who readily crossed the lines between academic disciplines .
He had a doctorate in law , served as secretary of the Nuremberg alchemical society and fancied himself a poet .
He also conducted diplomatic missions in London and Paris .
While visiting those cities , Leibniz acquainted himself with such scientific luminaries as Christiaan Huygens , Robert Boyle , Robert Hook , John Pell and Jacques Ozanam .
He showed an unfinished calculating machine to the Royal Society , which elected him a fellow .
Leibniz discussed with his English colleagues his interest in summing series and the geometry of infinitesimals , and he corresponded with them when he was back in France .
They apprised him of books in the field and also told him about Isaac Newton 's yet - unpublished work on the subject .
Newton wrote to Leibniz through an intermediary , and they began an exchange of letters that often took weeks or even months to reach their recipient .
The muddled back - and - forth eventually led to bad blood , with Newton claiming that Leibniz had stolen his work in founding the science of calculus .
Newton 's letters , however , described results , not methods .
The legal and philosophical formalism in which Leibniz had been trained allowed him to create his own symbolic system , including not just the integral sign but the same notation of differentials we still use .
Newton published his system slightly before Leibniz , but the German 's notation was superior .
Continental and English mathematicians would spend decades arguing over who invented the calculus , but it seems yet another example of simultaneous discovery .
The two scientists were of the same era , associated in the same circles , read the work of the same precursors , and shared some of their own ideas .
It should amaze no one that they came to the same results in slightly different mathematical language at nearly the same time .
Leibniz contributed mightily to our knowledge of differential equations .
He discovered the method of separation of variables , first reduced homogeneous equations to separable ones , and figured out how to solve first - order linear equations .
He also worked on the multinomial theorem .
The math department of St. Bonaventure University in western New York state celebrates Integral Day on Oct. 29 to honor Leibniz .
The mathematics suite is decorated with integral and summation ornaments , and students and faculty eat " calculus cookies " and imbibe " summation cider , " presumably with infinitesimal nibbles and sips .
Students compete in a calculus contest to win a gift certificate at the college bookstore .
Does Newton deserve more credit ?
Maybe , but it 's Leibniz 's language you learned in your calculus class .
And ol ' Isaac gets his props for many other discoveries , so do n't overestimate the gravity of the situation .
Happy Integral Day , Gottfried !

Yahoo is sorry it hired a bunch of Go - Go dancers for the " Hack Day " event it hosted in Taiwan last weekend , Kara Swisher reports .
See photos and video stills from the event >
The idea for the event was to attract third - party developers into building widgets for Yahoo.com and other Yahoo platforms .
Whether or not any new widgets are on the way , judging by the pictures , we 're certain lots of attraction happened .
The company only got in trouble after it posted Hack Day winners and photos from the event on its Yahoo Developer Network blog .
Commenters there laced into Yahoo , calling the company sexist .
One , going by the named Sherri , put it this way :
Here 's Yahoo's apology note .
All ,
I wanted to acknowledge the public reaction generated by the images of female dancers at our Taiwan Open Hack Day this past weekend .
Our hack events are designed to give developers an opportunity to learn about our APIs and technologies .
As many folks have rightly pointed out , the “ Hack Girls ” aspect of our Taiwan Hack Day is not reflective of that spirit or purpose .
And it ’s certainly not the message we want to send about our values here at Yahoo !.
Hack Days are about making everyone feel welcome , including women coders and technologists .
This incident is regrettable and we apologize to anyone that we have offended .
Rest assured , it wo n’t happen again .
Best ,

Mozilla Messaging , the organization behind the Thunderbird e-mail program , has introduced a new open source messaging aggregation platform : Raindrop .
The project is at an extremely early stage of development but the code has been made available through Mozilla Labs with the hope of encouraging third - party developers to participate in the effort .
Ars put an early build through its paces and looked at aspects of the project that are relevant to developers .
What 's in a raindrop ?
Raindrop is a Web service designed to collate , filter , and present content from disparate messaging services .
It currently comes with support for Twitter , GMail , IMAP e-mail , and Skype .
One of the key goals is to use smarter filtering methodology to increase the visibility of important messages and reduce the amount of noise that tends to bog down Internet communication .
Raindrop is built with a strong emphasis on extensibility , making it trivially easy to customize and enhance with new capabilities .
It 's important to understand that Raindrop is not a conventional desktop client application like Thunderbird .
It 's a Web application in the sense that you run it as a background service and access it entirely through a browser .
It 's designed to be self - hosted , however , so it is n't quite like a conventional Web service either .
The backend components that are responsible for retrieving and processing messages are coded in Python on top of the Twisted networking framework .
The frontend is implemented with HTML and JavaScript , with extensive use of the Dojo JavaScript library .
The main frontend messaging user interface , which is called the Inflow , is populated with JavaScript widgets .
It displays messages and provides navigation controls that allow the user to filter and interact with their message stream , and it can be accessed in any modern browser .
Raindrop is built largely on top of CouchDB , an Erlang - based open source database framework .
Unlike conventional relational database systems such as MySQL , CouchDB stores its data in JSON documents and exposes its functionality through a REST API .
The Raindrop frontend is served directly from CouchDB , meaning that the actual HTML , JavaScript , and CSS files are stored as attachments within a CouchDB database and are served to users by CouchDB 's internal Web server .
One of the most powerful features of Raindrop is that it can be enhanced and reprogrammed directly from the browser .
Developers can use Raindrop 's built - in " Extender " to modify the extensions that control the program 's message presentation and underlying filtering capabilities .
The Extender uses Mozilla 's experimental browser - based Bespin editing tool , which renders an interactive text editor with syntax highlighting in an HTML5 Canvas element .
Testing Raindrop
Experienced Web developers will have no trouble getting an instance of Raindrop up and running , but the nature of the dependencies will make setup prohibitively difficult for regular users .
Mozilla says that it will eventually provide a simple installer or run its own hosted variant of the service at some point in the future to make it more accessible to non-developers .
Using the instructions supplied at the Mozilla wiki , I was able to test Raindrop on the Ubuntu 9.10 RC .
Most of the required packages were available directly through the Ubuntu repositories .
( Ubuntu users who want to test Raindrop should generally use 9.10 because 9.04 does n't have a sufficiently recent version of CouchDB . )
After installing the required dependencies , I obtained the Raindrop code from Mozilla 's Mercurial repository .
You can run the code directly from the checkout and you do n't have to install it anywhere .
The next step is configuration .
The Inflow has its own settings user interface , but it 's not actually plugged into anything yet — it 's still just a placeholder .
To configure Raindrop , the user will have to manually write a settings file and store it in their home directory .
The settings file , which uses an INI - like format , allows the user to specify their account credentials and the host / port of their CouchDB server .
After the configuration file has been created and saved as ~/.raindrop , the user can start the service by executing the run-raindrop .py script .
To access Raindrop in your browser , you just navigate to http://localhost:5984/raindrop/inflow/index.html.
Of course , you can substitute the host and port as needed if you are running CouchDB on a remote server or somewhere else on your local network .
The Extender interface is located at / raindrop / extender/extensions.html .
Conclusion
Raindrop is an intriguing project with a lot of potential , but the current implementation is mostly rough edges .
It 's clearly a primitive prototype and is not intended yet for production use , but if the project can attract a community of code contributors , it might well evolve quickly .
I suspect that the built - in Extender system will also help accelerate development by lowering some of the barriers to entry .
Raindrop 's most significant weakness is that its complex dependencies will make widespread deployment extremely difficult .
I 'm skeptical that a sophisticated Web application built with Python , Twisted , and CouchDB will ever be trivial to install — especially on Windows .
I also suspect that it 's only going to get mainstream adoption if it 's offered as a hosted service .
At this stage in Raindrop 's development , the app is only interesting to developers .
Additional details about Raindrop are available from the project 's page at the Mozilla Labs website .
The code can be found in Mozilla 's Mercurial repository .
The Liberal Leader in the Senate , Nick Minchin , says a majority of his colleagues do not believe humans are causing climate change .
The Government and Opposition are locked in negotiations over changes to the proposed emissions trading scheme .
The Government wants its emissions trading scheme passed before the Copenhagen summit .
But Senator Minchin has told ABC's Four Corners program most Coalition MPs do not think human activity is causing global warming .
" I 'd say a majority do n't accept that position , " he said .
" We did vote against the bill in August for good reason . "
The Coalition 's chief negotiator , Ian Macfarlane , has told Four Corners any deal needs to have the backing of a majority of Coalition MPs and that is going to be difficult .
" Getting it cleared [ by ] the party room a second time is going to be an enormous feat , " he said .
He agrees timing is a factor .
" I guess I lose a lot of leverage after Copenhagen , " he said .

This does n't happen often enough .
Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) received a handwritten note Thursday from Joint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Tom Barthold confirming the penalty for failing to pay the up to $ 1,900 fee for not buying health insurance .
Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in jail or a $ 25,000 penalty , Barthold wrote on JCT letterhead .
He signed it " Sincerely , Thomas A. Barthold . "
The note was a follow - up to Ensign 's questioning at the markup .

As the CRTC gears up for yet another round of hearings later this fall that will address the fee - for - carriage issue , the most recent batch of submitted comments contains what may constitute an interesting shift in policy by the Conservatives .
Earlier this year , the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage conducted extensive hearings on the future of local broadcasting .
Fee - for - carriage ( ie. a requirement for broadcast distributors such as cable and satellite to pay for retransmission of over - the - air signals ) figured prominently in the discussion .
The Conservative members of the committee issued a dissenting opinion in the final report and offered up the following :
this dissenting report must now indicate our most fervent and rigorous opposition to any potential fee for carriage system , either negotiated or imposed , that would have a detrimental effect on the consumer .
We believe it is fundamentally unfair to expect Canadian consumers to pay new and substantial charges each month to their cable or satellite distributor to reflect such a system .
Fast forward several months later and Conservative MPs Ed Holder ( London West ) , Laurie Hawn ( Edmonton Centre ) , Bruce Stanton ( Simcoe North ) , Patrick Brown ( Barrie ) , Gord Brown ( Leeds - Grenville ) , and Lois Brown ( Newmarket - Aurora ) have each submitted comments to the CRTC public hearing process on the issue .
Each MP sent roughly the same letter , suggesting that they all come from the same playbook .
The new message :
Consumers already pay for local television in their monthly cable bills , as it forms part of the fee which consumers pay under their " basic " service rate .
But there is no return from cable companies .
In other words , consumers are billed by cable companies for local television , but cable companies do not compensate local television stations .
A rebalancing of this system is needed in order to sustain local television and service to consumers .
The Commission 's stated intent of implementing a negotiated , fair market value for local signals is essential to continued local service .
While these two positions are not necessarily conflicting ( cable and satellite companies could pay a fee - for - carriage without passing along the fee to the consumer ) , the recent experience with the LPIF suggests that new fees are invariably passed along to the consumer .
To remain consistent ( ie. FFC but no new consumer fees ) would seemingly require considerable market intervention into cable and satellite billing rates to require the imposition of a fee - for - carriage system and a requirement that those additional fees not be passed along to subscribers .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
One of President Obama 's top advisers said Sunday the Bush administration failed to ask critical questions about the war in Afghanistan , leaving the Obama administration starting from scratch -- and leaving the war " adrift . "
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says President Obama is asking new questions about Afghanistan War .
" The president is asking the questions that have never been asked on the civilian side , the political side , the military side and the strategic side , " White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told CNN 's " State of the Union . "
Among the things the Obama administration wants to know from Afghan leaders : " Do you have a credible Afghan partner for this process that can provide the security and the type of services that the Afghan people need ? "
The United States faces " a much more complex decision " than just determining the appropriate level of troops , Emanuel told CNN chief national correspondent John King in a rare interview .
" It 's clear that basically we had a war for eight years that was going on , that 's adrift , that we 're beginning at scratch , just at the starting point ... and that there 's not a security force , an army , and the types of services that are important for the Afghans to become a true partner , " Emanuel said .
Echoing comments from Sen. John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , Emanuel said it would be " reckless to make a decision on U.S. troop levels if , in fact , you have n't done a thorough analysis of whether , in fact , there 's an Afghan partner ready to fill that space that the U.S. troops would create . "
In a separate interview with CNN , Kerry -- a war veteran who is on a trip to Afghanistan -- said , " Before the president makes a decision about the numbers of troops that ought to come here , I believe it is critical for us to be satisfied that the reform efforts that are absolutely mandatory within the government here are in fact going to take place and be fully implemented . "
Kerry also spoke to CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
In that interview he called for " changes in the kind of counterinsurgency strategy we are pursuing . "
" This is not Iraq , " he said , calling it a " very different challenge . "
Success in Afghanistan will not be defined by military objectives , Kerry said .
" There is no military success ultimately to Afghanistan . "
Emanuel told CNN the U.S. effort requires getting answers to a " set of questions that have to have answers , that have never been asked . "
Obama " will not be rushed to making a decision without asking firm questions and challenging the assumptions , " he said .
With the results of recent presidential elections in Afghanistan still unclear because of concerns about fraud , Emanuel said there are two options : a runoff between the two top candidates or a negotiation .
The end result must be " a legitimate and credible " government that the Afghan people view as valid , Emanuel said .
CNN 's Martina Stewart contributed to this report .

A legal row has broken out over the secret recipe for spice burgers .
Walsh Family Foods Limited , which has produced the burger for over 50 years , has taken High Court proceedings seeking to restrain a former director and owner of the company from using the recipe .
The company claims Patrick Walsh of St Canice 's Road , Glasnevin , Dublin , has the recipe and is using it to produce and sell his own version of the burger , which it is claimed he is passing off as the original .
This afternoon in the High Court , Mr Justice Patrick McCarthy granted interim injunctions to Walsh Family Foods restraining Mr Walsh or anyone he has given the information to from deleting or destroying it .
He also granted the company an interim injunction restraining Mr Walsh from deleting or destroying any of its confidential property .
Only the company was represented at today ’s application .
A full application for an interlocutory injunction in the case will be heard on Thursday .
The future of the spice burger seemed in doubt earlier this year when a receiver was appointed to the sole manufacturer , Walsh Family Foods in June .
However , following an unprecedented public reaction to the news , the company recommenced production of the product , which is unique to Ireland .
The burger generated a turnover of € 1.75 m for the company in 2008 .
According to the receiver appointed to the company , the spice burger is central to the value of the business , which he is in the process of selling .
Mr Walsh jointly owned the company with his sister until it was sold in 2000 for over £ 1 m .
The company claims that from then until May of this year , he remained on as an employee and director .
The company claims that in April of this year as it was becoming clear the business was in difficulty , Mr Walsh obtained by email the secret spice mix recipe from the dry food ingredients company which manufactured it on behalf of Walsh Family Foods .
The recipe is said to be a closely guarded secret , known by very few people .
The company claims Mr Walsh then used it to instruct another dry ingredients manufacturer to prepare a spice mix which he subsequently used in the manufacturing of his own version of the burger .
Walsh Family Foods claims this spice burger , which is called the ‘ Original Spice Burger Company ’ was sold by Mr Walsh to its customers and is virtually identical to its own product in size , taste and weight .
The company is now seeking to stop Mr Walsh from destroying that email and the electronic trail connected to it .
In correspondence read to the court , solicitors for Mr Walsh deny that he has been employed by Walsh Family Foods since 2005 and as a result they say he is not precluded from using information he obtained during his time with the company .
Mr Walsh 's solicitors also denied in the correspondence that their client had solicited customers of Walsh Family Foods , saying instead that they had approached him and urged him to fill the void left by the demise of the company .

Conversation with my husband about Hitler :
Victor :
This house is a wreck .
me : This house is a creative haven .
Victor : No .
It ’s just a wreck .
me : Well , I do n’t know why you ’re telling me about it .
It ’s not my job to clean the house .
Victor : Yeah , actually it is .
Remember ?
You were going to quit your job and work on your book ?
And clean the house .
And do the errands .
That was the deal , remember ?
me : Not really .
That does n’t sound like a deal I ’d make .
Victor : “ I ’m going to be the best housewife EVER .
I ’ll just write and clean and cook . ”
Sound familiar ?
me : Fuzzy .
I was probably drunk when I said all that .
Victor : “ FREE BLOW JOBS FOR EVERYBODY ! ”
me : Oh .
That does sound like something I ’d say .
Are you mad about the blowjobs ?
Victor : No .
I ’m mad about the fact that we both work at home and that this home is a fucking wreck .
me : It ’s not that bad .
You ’re over - reacting because you ’re kind of an anal freak .
Victor :
You are using a frisbee as a plate .
me : What ?
I ’m not - oh hang on , this is a frisbee .
Weird .
Victor : * glare *
Me : Dude .
I ’ll wash it afterward .
It ’s probably dishwasher safe .
Victor :
It ’s not about whether the frisbee is dishwasher safe .
It ’s about the fact that you ’re using a fucking frisbee to eat on because there are no clean plates .
me : There are totally clean plates .
I just saw this on the counter and grabbed it .
Technically it ’s a kick - ass plate .
It even has a lip on it so you do n’t spill anything .
Victor :
How does this not bother you ?!
me : IT TOTALLY BOTHERS ME .
I ca n’t believe I ever agreed to clean the house in exchange for quitting my job .
I ca n’t believe you ’d even think that would work .
If anything you should have known better when you made that deal .
This is all sort of your fault .
Victor : I ’m going to strangle you .
me : And I ’m going to replace all our plates with frisbees .
Because I ’m a visionary .
Victor : I ’m fucking serious .
me : SO AM I. THESE FRISBEE PLATES ARE AWESOME .
Besides , I do n’t have time to clean because I ’m busy doing social media stuff .
Victor :
What did you accomplish today ?
me : A lot .
Social media maven … stuff .
Victor : No .
What exactly did you do today ?
Quantify it for me .
Me : It ’s not quantifiable .
There are n’t even metrics for the shit I do .
Victor : Try .
me : I re-watched the first season of Chad Vader .
Victor : ?
me : For research .
Victor : The fuck ?
me : AND I did this doodle about Hitler .
Victor :
That ’s …not even remotely funny .
me : Dude , it ’s totally funny .
You know ?
Because people always say ‘ They only hate me because they ’re jealous ‘ .
But then it ’s Hitler and everyone really does hate him and is n’t jealous at all ?
Victor : Not funny .
me : I think I just need drawing lessons .
It took me like two hours just to work out how to put a scarf on a stick figure .
And that ’s why I did n’t have time to clean all the soup I spilled in the microwave .
By the way , do n’t look in the microwave .
Victor : I ’m going to lie down until the urge to kill you passes .
Then he left and never came back .
And I had to clean the microwave because I ’m responsible and also because it started to smell like clam chowder even in the bathrooms .
This is why it sucks to be me .
Also , I ’m pretty sure that my husband is anti-Semitic .
PS .
Victor says that not laughing at a joke about Hitler does n’t make you anti-Semitic but that ’s I ’m pretty sure that ’s exactly what an anti-Semite would say .
They have terrible senses of humor .
Comment of the day : Your Hitler seems to be choking on a chicken bone .
If that had happened to the real Hitler in the late 20 ’s so much could ’ve been avoided .
Of course then the Hitler jokes would n’t be as funny .

You 've heard the pitch : the Spawn - 720 is like a Slingbox for console games , letting you play your Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 or ( almost ) any other console , through a streaming client on your PC .
But does it work ?
Yes , so far .
Advertisement
The promise of the Spawn HD - 720 is twofold :
You can " log in " to your console to play games when , say , your TV is otherwise engaged , or you 're away from home .
You can also invite remote players to play against you — as a local player , interestingly enough — over the internet , from anywhere .
The whole system will set you back $ 200 , but there 's no monthly fee .

The streaming box itself is a nondescript brick with a panel full of A/V connectors in the back .
It 's middleman hardware , sitting between the video source — the console — and whatever display it 's connected to , like some sort of VCR .
And in a way , that 's what it is : the HD - 720 grabs , encodes and streams raw video signals without without interacting with your console at all .
In fact , the only input it sends to your Xbox / PS3 / PS2 / whatever is through controller adapters , which let the box ( and in turn , whoever is using it ) act like a local player .

So , right , enough about the hardware , what about that question that you can't not immediately have about this box :
How laggy is it ?
I tested Kung Fu Panda over a LAN connection for a few minutes on an utterly undistinguished $ 500 Core 2 Duo laptop , and it worked .
I can't say there was no lag — there definitely was — but it was n't enough to ruin a game like this , or even a first person shooter .
To give a sense of how it felt , the delay felt like the difference between a wired optical mouse and a first - gen wireless mouse , in that is was enough to make some controls feel imprecise , but not enough to make anyone angry .
This laptop was , for all intents and purposes , an Xbox 360 .

Predictably , there was a catch .
And it was the catch .
I could n't test Spawn remotely , even from a predetermined node with guaranteed upstream bandwidth .
Not so predictably , the Spawn guys said they 're sending out evaluation units in a few weeks , which we 'll be able to connect to any console and stream over any connection .
Spawn , meet Earthlink .
I really hope you get along .
That 'll be the ultimate test , and it's a test I 'm really looking forward to .
Even in its current state , Spawn can definitely keep up at least half of its side of the bargain — local game streaming is decidedly decent , and the client software is polished .
The other half ?
You know , streaming a game of COD 4 over a 512 K bps upstream connection without 150 ms + latency ?
I can't overemphasize how big of a " we 'll see " that is .

If you thought the referees in other sports were bad , take a look at this obvious hand ball and goal by Parana 's Wellington Silva that stood up in Brazil 's Serie B on Saturday .
Outraged at this breach of integrity for the beautiful game , Ceara players soon started a brawl at the end of the first half .

As Congress struggles to rein in health care costs as part of its sweeping reform efforts , hospitals in New York City and other urban areas that provide some of the most expensive care are among the primary targets .
The issue pits hospitals in more rural states like Iowa and Minnesota , where spending tends to be lower , against those in areas like New York and Los Angeles , and revolves around a question that has bedeviled the medical establishment for decades :
How much money do hospitals need to provide adequate care for patients , especially poor people who have not had regular access to health care .
A provision in the House health care bill , included over the objections of hospitals from New York and other cities , would order a neutral group , the Institute of Medicine , to conduct a two - year study of regional variations in Medicare spending .
The bill requires the institute to recommend changes that would reward “ quality and value , ” and those changes would take effect automatically unless Congress objected by May 31 , 2012 .
Proponents say the institute ’s findings could prove crucial to efforts to slow out - of - control costs .
They argue that through greater efficiency , Medicare spending could be cut by 15 to 30 percent , and cite researchers at Dartmouth Medical School , who contend that Medicare could save $ 1.42 trillion by 2023 , and eliminate a looming deficit , by reducing annual growth in per patient spending to 2.4 percent from the national average of 3.5 percent .

Video Game Award Nominees and Winners
Video games continue to flourish at a rapid pace and enjoy all kinds of innovative technology advancements such as the new Nintendo Switch hybrid console .
They have also made a breakthrough into Ultra high - definition 4 K display , thanks to the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X , and with the introduction of the Oculus Go , VR gaming will soon be available to the masses as well .
If there 's anything that stands out about gaming it's that this incredible hobby has truly expanded in recent years .
Gaming has transformed into a live - event thanks to eSports and simultaneously produced endless hours of entertainment for everyone .
Whether you 're a video game enthusiast using a modest setup or a luxury gamer using top - of - the - range technology , an enormous 4 K television , and VR accessories , what truly unites gamers is the wide range of games .
A great game is a great game for everyone , regardless of the tech you use to enjoy the game .
However , with games expanding into more avenues such as mobile , VR , home consoles , and handheld consoles , it can quickly become rather difficult to know which game you should play next .
It 's for this very reason that video game awards were introduced to help you make a more informed decision .
Like the BAFTA's and Oscars for movies , the Game Awards is an annual celebration to honour the best accomplishments in gaming .
These awards also offer previews of video games that are being developed , including game trailers and developer interviews .
How Are Nominees and Winners Chosen for Game Awards ?
Unlike the BAFTA 's and Oscars , the Game Awards does n't feature a panel of voters .
Instead , there 's an advisory committee that consists of hardware producers , developers , and event backers from Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment , Valve , Ubisoft , Telltale Games , Rockstar Games , Activision , Electronic Arts , AMD , Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft .
The advisory committee also elects 51 of the most influential video - game news outlets globally to form a jury , such as Wired , Edge , and IGN .
The jury then proceeds to select their picks for the nominated video games in each of the categories .
The advisory committee then examines the jury 's picks and selects the most - nominated video games in every field .
Thereafter , the jury will vote on the final list .
Furthermore , there 's a public vote from the 14th of November to the 6th of December .
In jury - voted categories , however , the public vote will only account for 10 % towards the final vote .
The Game Awards : 2017 Winners
It was a remarkable year for video games in 2017 , which means it was also rather difficult to determine the best of the best .
However , the Game Awards committee did exactly that on December 7 , releasing the full roster of winners .
The 2017 roster of nominees included 102 video games spread across 30 various categories .
We are totally hoping that this year we will get some amazing casino games nominated as we had n't had a good one in recent years .
Some sites still feature the classic evergreen games like blackjack , which players still appreciate quite a lot and have tons of fun playing and winning real money .
But we think that this throwback gaming movement is because of the lack of innovation in the gaming industry as of late .
Every year , the Game Awards broadcast in several locations online , including every major stream service like YouTube and Twitch , as well as gaming platforms such as Xbox , PlayStation , and Steam .
In addition , you can easily live stream through several social media apps such as Facebook Live and Twitter , or through various gaming sites , including Gamespot and IGN to view the results .
The 2017 Game Awards ceremony produced 30 awards categories , the most popular of which include Game of the Year , Best Narrative , Best Performance , Best Ongoing Game , Best Mobile Game , Best AR / VR Game , Best Action Game , Best Fighting Game , Best Family Game , Best Action / Adventure Game , Best Strategy Game , and Best Racing / Sports Game .
Video Game Awards 2018
For the past 3 years , the annual Game Awards have been held at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles , California and is hosted by none other than Geoff Keighley who is a renowned Canadian television presenter and video game journalist .
The Game Awards take place in December each year , recognizing the technical and creative excellence in the video game industry .
The 2018 nominees will only be revealed later this year .
In the meantime , gamers can look forward to loads of 2018 trailers that will showcase the best video games of 2018 .
While some will patiently wait to watch the 2018 Game Awards to see who won the Game of the Year , most gamers will be looking forward to brand - new video game releases .
If 2017 is any indication , there 's no doubt that 2018 will feature one of the biggest line - ups of reveals and announcements in the history of the show .
With the video gaming industry continuously breaking new ground on several platforms every year , more and more gamers have started showing an interest in mobile game awards as well .
With mobile gaming growing exponentially within the last decade , it comes as no surprise that more focus is placed on developing more superior games for handheld devices .

With a new rail line set to open on the Eastside next month , one of the project ’s most vocal and enthusiastic backers has few good things to say about it .
L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina calls the Eastside Gold Line extension “ substandard ” and potentially dangerous and says she worries that children leaving school are in danger of being hit by oncoming trains .
“ I do n’t know that it ’s safe .
They ’re telling me that it ’s safe .
. . .
Everything has been an excuse .
Everything , ” Molina said .
“ I should be happy ; I worked so hard to get it , and I was so satisfied that even though it was n’t a subway I could live with this , but now I do n’t know what to think , ” she said .
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials announced Monday that the Gold Line extension -- a six - mile route running from Union Station in downtown L.A. to Atlantic Boulevard in East L.A. -- will open Nov. 15 .
Advertisement
Molina , who has represented the Eastside for almost two decades , played a major role in bringing rail service to the area , where she said East L.A. and Boyle Heights ’ largely working - class immigrant population relies heavily on mass transit .
But now , Molina says she is disappointed about how the Gold Line ’s opening is being handled .
She said that what was supposed to be a happy day , when the train picks up its first commuters in November , is increasingly feeling bittersweet .
One of her complaints is the agency ’s decision several years ago to make only a portion of the line a subway , meaning that the majority of the route runs above ground , mostly on 1st and 3rd streets .
Advertisement
Only about 1.7 miles runs underground , through twin tunnels underneath Boyle Heights .
Molina said she considers the Gold Line “ substandard ” because the area deserved a subway line and ended up getting a less - expensive light - rail route .
In an interview with The Times on Monday , the supervisor said she does n’t think there is enough fencing to prevent people from crossing the tracks , particularly children at nearby schools .
She also said there has not been enough community outreach on safety to prepare residents for the new line .
Advertisement
“ We all struggled so hard to get this into our community , ” Molina said .
“ Now , at the end of the day , I feel like I ’m being shortchanged on the issues of integrity , safety and confidence . ”
The Gold Line is being anticipated with excitement on the Eastside , where residents and merchants have endured years of torn - up streets , detours and noise .
MTA officials expect ridership to be about 13,000 boardings per day on the line by the end of the first year .
MTA Chief Executive Art Leahy said he believes the line will be safe when it opens and that his agency is going to lengths to ensure safety .
Advertisement
“ In October , the board approved an additional $ 4.5 million for the line , exclusively for safety enhancements .
That will include about two miles of pedestrian fencing , ” among other enhancements , Leahy said .
He also said there were now 24 safety ambassadors who will help residents navigate tricky spots on the line , and that law enforcement has been working to discourage pedestrians from jaywalking .
“ We ’ve scoured the line , we ’ve had outside experts scour the line , I ’m not aware of anything out there that we have n’t addressed , ” Leahy said .
“ We will do what we need to do to make sure this line is safe , but we also need the public ’s cooperation , ” he said .
City Councilman Jose Huizar , who represents some of the areas the line will go through , hopes the Gold Line will spur further development and private investment in Boyle Heights .
Advertisement
He agreed with Molina that more safety measures are needed but said he believes the MTA is working to make those improvements .
“ I ’m excited that it ’s going to finally open up , and I know we can do a lot more to improve safety .
We have n’t done enough , but I know we have some plans on the way to make it better , ” Huizar said .
Molina ’s criticism of the Gold Line comes amid a big push to get federal money to build a subway from Koreatown to Westwood .
Molina has been pushing for the second phase of the Gold Line extension , which would run from East L.A. to either South El Monte or Whittier .

All but one of the largest credit unions in Wisconsin operated in the black through the first three quarters of this year , helped by an easing of rules that allows them to spread out the cost of replenishing the industry 's hard - hit deposit insurance fund .
The only top - 10 credit union to post a loss during the period , Madison - based Summit Credit Union , said Wednesday it , too , will be profitable by the end of the year , in part because it no longer plans to absorb its payment to the insurance fund all at once this year .
When regulators created uncertainty by boosting the original estimate for Summit 's contribution to the fund by another $ 1 million or so , the credit union rethought its strategy and now plans to space out payments like many other credit unions , said Kim Sponem , president of Summit .
Through Sept. 30 , Summit had a loss of $ 105,874 .
" You 'll see that number significantly improve at year end , " Sponem said .
The need for replenishing the credit union deposit insurance fund is the result of trouble in a part of the industry known as corporate credit unions , which are large , member - owned institutions that offer services such as check clearing , cash delivery and investment services for rank - and - file credit unions .
Some corporate credit unions have taken big losses related to investment in mortgage - backed securities , cutting into the fund .
The National Credit Union Administration 's deposit insurance fund is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 's fund for bank deposits .
Wisconsin 's largest credit union , Landmark Credit Union , generated the highest net income through three - fourths of the year , $ 13.9 million , according to records from the NCUA , which is the national regulator of the industry .
Credit unions are like banks in many ways , but they are not - for - profit cooperatives owned by members instead of stockholders .
Like banks , many have seen delinquent loans increase amid a weak economy and rising unemployment .
At Eau Claire 's Royal Credit Union , for instance , 2.9 % of all loans were delinquent at the end of the third quarter , compared with 1.21 % in the same span a year ago , NCUA figures show .
Brett Thompson , chief executive of the Wisconsin Credit Union League , said that taking into account the economic climate , the state 's credit unions are performing as they should .
Wisconsin credit unions have one of the highest loan - to - deposit ratios in the county , which means they are continuing to make loans , he said .
" I think everything is kind of viewed though a relative perspective these days , " Thompson said .
" Given how the economy has been , given how various sectors of the financial arena have been hit , I think our credit unions feel like they are weathering the storm very well . "
Thompson said he expects more mergers of smaller credit unions into bigger ones .
This year alone , New Berlin - based Landmark has acquired four smaller Milwaukee - area credit unions , including troubled Allco Credit Union .
" The primary drivers will be two things , " Thompson said .
" One , it will depend on how much the economy turns around and how quickly , and two , it also will depend on the speed with which the regulatory burden felt by credit unions increases . "
In addition , Thompson said , " it 's getting harder and harder for small institutions to keep up with and be compliant with these various regulations that are being passed . "

In natural health circles , many people are tossing aluminum pans and using holistic underarm crystals instead of conventional antiperspirant .
Their choices are fueled by an ongoing mystery surrounding aluminum .
About 20 years ago , scientists first raised questions about a possible link between aluminum and Alzheimer 's disease .
Since then , researchers have gone back and forth on this question .
As soon as one publishes a study showing a connection , another disproves it .
These days , most of the top medical experts , from the Mayo Clinic to the Alzheimer 's Association , say there really is no reason to panic .
But other agencies , including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) , continue to look into it because aluminum is so ubiquitous in our daily lives .
We swallow it in foods like processed cheese and baked goods .
Babies encounter it in formula , breast milk and vaccines .
Since aluminum is both strong and lightweight , more auto manufacturers are relying on it to boost fuel efficiency .
That means more aluminum byproducts will enter the air , water and , ultimately , the landfills .
" The Alzheimer 's risk with aluminum has n't been well defined , " says Robert Yokel , a University of Kentucky pharmacy professor who is studying aluminum for the NIEHS .
" You have to weigh risks and benefits .
My personal opinion is if you can make simple choices to avoid it until we sort this thing out , why not ?
" One certainty is that Alzheimer 's disease is not going away .
As the baby boom generation ages and more Americans live longer , this devastating illness is affecting more patients and their families .
Currently , about five percent of people over age 60 will develop Alzheimer 's disease .
Some research shows a relationship between aluminum and other nervous - system disorders , such as Lou Gehrig 's disease and Parkinson 's Disease .
Pros and ConsScientists first became aware of aluminum 's potential health risks 20 years ago , when a group of kidney patients came down with a similar form of dementia after being exposed to aluminum through dialysis .
Another study found aluminum inside the plaques and tangles that appear in Alzheimer 's patients ' brains .
Meanwhile , a few epidemiological studies found that people with a high level of aluminum in their drinking water had a higher incidence of Alzheimer's .
Other studies that followed , however , did not show the same correlation .
Studies of cultures that drink large amounts of tea ( which leaches a lot of aluminum ) also did not show a link .
After several decades , scientists have been unable to replicate the original studies showing aluminum deposits in a brain affected by Alzheimer's .
" There was an aluminum scare 20 years ago , but it now looks like there is no connection , " says Harvard Alzheimer 's researcher Dr. Ashley Bush .
New research , by Bush and others , shows Alzheimer 's to be a much more complex illness than anyone had imagined .
Bush 's laboratory is developing a promising new drug that prevents zinc from reacting with the proteins that form the abnormal deposits in brains attacked by Alzheimer's .
Phase III clinical trials of the drug , developed by Prana Biotech ( www.pranabio.com), will begin next year .
Experts now believe if aluminum does appear in an Alzheimer 's brain , it 's simply because it is so common in our environment .
" It 's a major component of the Earth 's crust , so it shows up everywhere " Bush says .
As for food and water contamination , aluminum probably is n't much of a threat because most of it passes right through the intestines without being absorbed .
Some natural health advocates disagree with this position .
Suzan Walter is president of the American Holistic Health Association , and her mother died of Alzheimer's .
She says many natural health experts advise patients to avoid aluminum based on the precautionary principle , and she takes steps to avoid it in her personal life .
" We do n't know what causes Alzheimer 's , but why not stay away from aluminum just in case ? "
Walter asks .
" It does n't compromise my life to avoid it and it can't hurt .
" Paul Schwartz , national policy coordinator for Clean Water Action , adds , " There is a valid concern to be raised about aluminum and health effects , but the science is not definitive .
" Aluminum in Food and MedicineWhile the metal is not easily absorbed , the government is still paying scientists like Yokel to make sure we are safe when it comes to dietary sources of aluminum .
Currently , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not limit aluminum in food because it is " generally recognized as safe . "
At the same time , no one knows the exact rate the body absorbs aluminum from food .
Since food accounts for 95 percent of our aluminum intake , it 's worth examining , Yokel says .
" We 're looking into whether this constant exposure in our diet is causing a problem , " Yokel says .
Yokel is also studying the rate of absorption for aluminum in drinking water .
For years , municipal water treatment operators have added aluminum to their tanks to make bacteria settle out of the final product , If Yokel 's ongoing experiments show our bodies absorb too much aluminum from tap water , the EPA may adopt stricter regulations .
Aluminum is so common that all of us have some background level in our bodies .
For example , all mothers have traces of aluminum in their breast milk ( about 40 micrograms per liter ) .
Infant formula has about five times as much aluminum as breast milk ( soy formula has the most ) .
And the load just builds from there as a person ages .
" If aluminum does cause Alzheimer 's , it 's possible that lifelong exposure could contribute , " Yokel says .
" Sometime later in life , you could hit that threshold and develop a problem -- but it 's all speculation at this point .
" Certain over - the - counter medicines are loaded with aluminum .
For example , the World Health Organization estimates antacid users swallow as much as five grams of aluminum per day .
Buffered aspirin also has aluminum .
Vaccines are another little - known source of aluminum in our lives .
The media has focused a great deal on mercury in childhood vaccines .
But many vaccines also contain aluminum as an additive .
That may be a concern because the body absorbs injected aluminum more easily .
Vaccine critics also question whether mercury and aluminum might have a synergistic effect on the developing nervous system .
Aluminum is an important part of vaccines , however , because it makes them work better , says Dr. Paul Offit , chief of infectious diseases at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
" It 's used when you want to enhance the immune response , " Offit says .
The Hepatitis B , tetanus and DPT vaccines contain aluminum , as do some batches of the flu shot .
Some parent groups , such as the Virginia - based National Vaccine Information Center , have been critical of the government 's childhood vaccine policies .
They argue medical policy makers and drug companies should offer vaccines without additives like mercury and aluminum .
While most childhood vaccines no longer contain mercury , aluminum might be harder to replace , says FDA spokesperson Lenore Gelb .
So far , no one has identified a safe alternative that can perform the same way .
Even if researchers find a new substance , the testing and approval process would take years , she adds .
In pockets of the country , fears about these additives are causing an anti-vaccine backlash .
Some parents are home schooling their kids to avoid government - mandated vaccines .
And what about elderly patients who might skip their flu shot because they do n't want an extra load of aluminum in their brains ?
Offit believes the immediate benefits of vaccines outweigh any future risks .
Right now , we have no definite proof that aluminum causes Alzheimer 's , Offit argues .
But each year , thousands of children and elderly people die of flu complications .
" There is nothing theoretical about the flu , " he says .
What About Antiperspirants ?
Adults and teens who use antiperspirant every morning get another daily dose of aluminum .
While the skin absorbs a very small percentage of the aluminum in antiperspirants , studies show , natural health advocates raise questions about the effects of constant exposure .
Antiperspirants work by plugging sweat glands with aluminum salts .
Plenty of herbal alternatives are on the market at health food stores .
But Yokel encourages shoppers to do their homework .
A check of the label on one brand of crystal deodorant stone showed " alum " in the ingredients .
That , Yokel advises , is simply a natural form of aluminum .
Another option is to buy conventional deodorant , which should be aluminum - free as long as it does n't say " antiperspirant " on the label .

ARTICLE : Avoiding aluminum .
To cut your aluminum intake , follow these steps : * Switch to stainless steel cookware ( nonstick types have other toxins ) ; *
Try aluminum - free deodorant ; *
Reduce your consumption of tea , processed cheese , and aluminum - containing baking powder ; *
When possible , breastfeed .
Soy formula has the most aluminum .*
Invest in a water filter .
Dr. Robert Griffith , editor of the Santa Fe- based web journal Health and Age ( www.HealthandAge.com), shares a few of the latest ideas in Alzheimer 's prevention : *
Anything that is good for the heart is good for Alzheimer 's , Griffith says , so keep your cholesterol low and cut calories , especially those that come from fat ; *
A recent study showed walking every day cuts Alzheimer 's risk ; *
Take antioxidants and Vitamin C and E together .
Studies show these supplements appear to have a protective effect for those at risk for Alzheimer 's disease ; *
Consider the herb curcumin , which may help prevent Alzheimer's ; *
Eat more fruits and vegetables : they are full of antioxidants .

PUBLIC bravado aside , the defenders of the so - called enhanced interrogation techniques are fast running out of classified documents to hide behind .
The three that were released recently by the C.I.A.  the 2004 report by the inspector general and two memos from 2004 and 2005 on intelligence gained from detainees  fail to show that the techniques stopped even a single imminent threat of terrorism .
The inspector general ’s report distinguishes between intelligence gained from regular interrogation and from the harsher methods , which culminate in waterboarding .
While the former produces useful intelligence , according to the report , the latter “ is a more subjective process and not without concern . ”
And the information in the two memos reinforces this differentiation .
They show that substantial intelligence was gained from pocket litter ( materials found on detainees when they were captured ) , from playing detainees against one another and from detainees freely giving up information that they assumed their questioners already knew .
A computer seized in March 2003 from a Qaeda operative for example , listed names of Qaeda members and money they were to receive .
Soon after Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the chief planner of the 9/11 attacks , was captured in 2003 , according to the 2005 memo , he “ elaborated on his plan to crash commercial airlines into Heathrow Airport . ”
The memo speculates that he may have assumed that Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a fellow member of Al Qaeda who had been captured in 2002 , had already divulged the plan .
The same motivation  the assumption that another detainee had already talked  is offered to explain why Mr. Mohammed provided details about the Hambali- Southeast Asia Qaeda network .
Here ’s an e-mail from a reader named Nadaav Zohar of Akron , Ohio .
I like the way he thinks .
Every election season , I can usually count on a Freakonomics blog entry or three about voting and why it is pointless .
I very much agree with your analysis , and I do n’t vote .
However , I was wondering if you would also not participate in SETI at Home .
The chances that the power boost provided by your idle computer would help the SETI project discover something useful ( the jackpot being extra- terrestrial life ) is probably about the same or greater than the chances that your vote would decide an election .
And the cost ( 10 MB on your hard drive and any unused RAM ) is probably about the same or less ( no waiting in lines , no researching issues , etc. ) .
The potential payoff of SETI is definitely better than the potential payoff of voting .
Even if the election goes your way , you get another politician , another stupid law , etc .
But if SETI finds something useful , we have revolutionized everything we know about life in the universe .
What do you think ?
Is SETI at Home worth it ?
Researching some immune system facts that are readily available to us , and targeting some proven ways to improve our immune systems , can help us as we face seasonal challenges .
I am a believer in building good health by the lifestyle choices we make including trying to eat healthy and supplementing our diets .
Note that I said ‘ trying to eat healthy ’ because we live in a fast - paced , busy world .
It is not always easy to eat healthy .
Even if we do , we know that we do n’t get the same nutrients that we used to get from our foods .
Pair that with the fact that we have more stress , sleep less , weigh more , get less exercise , and did I mention more stress ?
Ok .. it ’s not all bad .
Some of us do exercise regularly or eat well .
Still , we all have some of these challenges in our lives .
On the flip side , we have a lot of solid , scientific information and immune system facts out there to help us do better , and to help us build better health .
There is a website worth checking out to learn more about the immune system : immunityfacts.com .
We have been hearing a lot about the swine flu , or H1N1 virus , because of its appearance this past year and also because of the outbreak in other parts of the world recently ( during their winter ) .
From what I have learned , the swine flu is going to threaten young children and young adults under age 25 the most .
This age group has not built up any immunity against it over their life time like scientists feel that adults have .
To me , this means to step it up and work harder at building good health and a better immune system to fight all viruses , infection , illness and disease .
I already do stay faithful to a daily nutrition program and it has helped me have great overall health .
Rarely do I get sick and I have enough energy every day and feel good every day .
When I look around , that ’s not the case for many folks .
There are some serious health challenges that affect many people every day , and annoying common illnesses that seem to affect some people often .
Plus , viruses like H1N1 are scary to everyone , including me .
Scientists , and the immune system facts that they have provided us , have known about interferon and its role in boosting our immune system for a long time .
It took the same scientist who discovered interferon back in 1954 40 years of research to develop a natural interferon supplement that would not have the terrible side effects of interferon medicine .
The immune system is the human body ’s defense against virus , bacteria , infection , and more .
It is very complex and beyond the scope of this blog to explain .
We ca n’t help but be in awe of the immune system facts we know .
Cells , tissues , and organs work together to try and keep foreign invaders from making us sick .
We all have what is called an immune response that initiate our own attack against what is trying to hurt us .
Unfortunately , we do n’t all have strong , healthy immune systems all of our lives .
As remarkable as our immune systems function most of the time , autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can happen when the immune system malfunctions and actually attacks itself .
Also , immune system facts that we can use to educate ourselves tell us that there are known factors that will weaken our immune systems .
Age , stress , lack of restful sleep , poor diet , lack of exercise can all contribute to compromise the efficient way our bodies should fight illness .
How do we activate our immune system and how can we build a better immune system ?
Immune system facts tell us that interferon is a powerful chemical that is produced by our cells and has the ability to boost our immune system ’s ability to identify other cells that can make us ill .
Natural interferon supplements boost the body ’s natural production of interferon and we already know from our immune system facts that interferon is critical to healthy immune function .
This clinically proven , powerful natural interferon supplement can provide immune support right at the cellular level where the first line of defense is performed .
In addition to natural interferon helping us build our immune systems , we can’t ignore the daily diets and lifestyles that can be associated with weakening our immune systems .
In regard to the nutrition in our daily foods , well - balanced diets with lots of fruit , vegetables , low fat dairy and whole grains are advised for healthy immune function .
Low fat is mentioned because research tells us that reducing fat may increase immune activity .
Studies have shown that people who take multivitamins on a regular basis are sick less .
I have always agreed with this and did not need studies to confirm it .
I know that it works to take vitamins because I know that my family does not get sick much , and also that we do not get all of our vitamins and minerals from our foods .
Even if we try , our busy lifestyles and the way that food is manufactured now combine to give good testament to the fact that we need to supplement .
Immune system facts have given us many answers that can help us as individuals to make good choices in regard to our health .
We can choose to learn how to manage stress , get good sleep , exercise more ( do n’t even have to go to the gym ) , eat a healthy diet , and supplement with a pharmaceutical grade natural vitamin or nutrition program .
Making these choices helps us build good health , and better functioning immune systems , so that we can fight the challenges to our good health all year long .
A nother attempt will soon be made to jolt the American economy only nine months after passage of the biggest economic stimulus package in U.S. history .
Yet Americans are so averse to government spending that the White House does n't dare call the further assistance it is planning a second " stimulus . "
Funny thing about Americans .
They seem to expect recovery from a job - destroying recession with few equals in history without further assistance from Washington .
Recent polls show 65 per cent of Americans oppose an encore to the federal stimulus package of last winter .
Already , 51 per cent think Washington is spending too much on stimulus .
Yet the U.S. jobless rate continues to rise .
It 's now officially just under 9 per cent .
It will rise to 10 per cent - plus by year 's end and stay there through much if not all of 2010 .
A staggering 15 million Americans are out of work .
Seven million Americans lost their jobs since the financial markets crashed beginning in September 2008 .
The comparable figure for Canada is 410,000 job losses , a smaller percentage of our workforce than in the U.S .
Taking into account Americans who have given up looking for work , or are underemployed in temp jobs , the rate of Americans with no , or woefully insufficient employment , is an astonishing 17 per cent .
But so effective have U.S. conservatives been in depicting government stimulus as " theft from future generations , " as John McCain puts it , that even at their moment of maximum suffering , a majority of Americans think their federal government is spendthrift in its efforts to turn around the economy .
Maybe pollsters only canvass Americans who still have jobs .
Unlikely in the extreme , of course , but how otherwise to explain this counterintuitive public sentiment ?
The answer is that Americans are bailout - weary , after the feds spent upward of $ 2 trillion ( U.S. ) to stabilize the banking system and rescued General Motors and Chrysler .
It does n't help that Main Street has seen its tax dollars used to bail out banks that continue to lavish with bonuses executives who helped tip the global economy into the worst downturn since the Dirty Thirties .
Neither does it help that since the stimulus package was passed , the jobless rate has continued to increase .
With a debate in coffee shops across the land about the usefulness of the stimulus , it 's tough to make the case for adding to the record $ 1.4 trillion deficit this fiscal year with another round of stimulus spending .
Most Americans support the healthcare reform proposals making their way through Congress .
But they 're suffering sticker shock at the cost , which is estimated at upward of $ 1 trillion .
Ultimately , the reforms are calculated to reduce the soaring cost of U.S. health care .
But upfront expenditures on , for instance , electronic medical records , are a classic case of spending money to make money – or , in this case , spending money to create efficiencies that will reduce costs long term .
Finally , the stimulus has so far been largely invisible .
" As you drive around town , it 's difficult to visualize tax rebates or aid to states – the fast - acting components of the stimulus , " writes Slate 's ace economics correspondent Daniel Gross .
" But as I drive around my town today , I can see workers labouring at a $ 4 - million stimulus - backed road project that is just getting started and will run through the spring of 2011 . "
The truth of the matter is that the original $ 787 - billion stimulus package sought and won from Congress by U.S. President Barack Obama – a bigger sum as a percentage of the economy than Franklin Roosevelt 's first - year New Deal outlays – has worked as far as it goes .
The White House estimates that about one million Americans – mostly firefighters , police , teachers and other state employees who were designated to be laid off – have been spared the loss of their jobs .
A consensus of U.S. economists , including conservatives , believe the stimulus has pulled the U.S. out of recession and got the economy growing again for the first time since December 2007 .
By design , the epic stimulus package was " back - loaded , " with most of the spending to be done next year .
As of August , only 19 per cent of the $ 787 billion had been spent .
As I 've written before , Obama , more fiscally conservative than most progressives realized until now , wanted to assess the impact of the stimulus in the hope that he would n't have to spend the entire amount .
Obama wanted it spent slowly in order to avoid a boondoggle , in his mission to restore confidence in government competence .
In that , Obama has thus far succeeded .
Felix Salmon , respected economics blogger for Reuters , asked recently : " Can anyone give me an example of something with the following three characteristics : 1 ) It is a policy initiative of the current Obama administration ; 2 ) It was significant enough in scale that I 'd have heard of it ;
3 ) It was n't fundamentally extremely well - managed during the execution . "
The good news is that the 53 per cent surge in U.S. stock - market values since their March nadir signalled an economic upturn .
Sure enough , the U.S. , Canadian and most major European economies are growing again .
Starting this fall , there has been a stronger and faster recovery in U.S. corporate profits than expected .
A resumption in job creation typically is the last phase of a recovery .
Skittish employers must be convinced a recovery is n't just a hiccup but is sustainable before they expand their payrolls .
Obama and Congress can't wait that long .
So there will be a raft of non -" stimulus " stimuli in coming weeks and months .
These will include an extension of jobless benefits for another month or longer , and of the first - time homebuyer tax credit that helped arrest the dreadful plunge in U.S. housing values .
There will be more funds for cash - strapped state governments , which were wrongly cut out of the initial stimulus bill in vain hopes of attracting Republican support .
Food - stamp coverage will be expanded , along with the existing program to enable the newly jobless to keep their employer - provided health insurance .
And there will be tax cuts for business job - creation efforts .
Realistically , with so much of the original stimulus yet to go out the door and , with likely passage of health care reforms later this year that will bring cost relief to millions of U.S. households , the Democrats should not fear for their prospects in the 2010 elections .
Yet that 's no small part of the motive behind the coming " Son of Stimulus " efforts of a Democratic Congress heading into next November , when one - third of the U.S. Senate and the entire House of Representatives is judged at the ballot box .
As Larry Mishel , president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute , recently told the Washington Post , " It 's such a desperate situation that we need to do things that move the dial . "
And I wo n't be the one to argue over Vice - President Joe Biden 's comment this week that if you 're out of work , no matter what the economists say , for you , it 's still a depression .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 13/8/2009 ( 4065 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
MARIJUANA'S painkilling properties are being called into question by new research that suggests the drug can amplify and prolong pain rather than relieve it .
A study published in the current issue of Science suggests prescribing marijuana for pain relief , which is legal in a number of countries including Canada , may be counter - productive .
Experiments with rodents and humans found that a group of compounds that includes cannabinoids , the active ingredients in marijuana , can interfere with the body 's mechanisms to stop pain signals from reaching the brain .
" If you had a toothache , you probably would n't want to treat it with marijuana , because you could actually make it worse , " said University of Texas Prof .
Volker Neugebauer , one of the study 's authors .
-- Canwest News Service
Short answer : no
Longer answer : it depends on what you mean by " equivalent " .
Pointer arithmetic and array indexing are equivalent .
In other aspects , pointers and arrays are different .
Here 's an example displaying the equivalence :
#include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { char arr [ ] = " do n't panic
" ; char * ptr = arr ; printf ( " % c %c
" , arr [ 4 ] , ptr [ 4 ] ) ; printf ( " % c %c
" , *( arr+ 2 ) , *( ptr+ 2 ) ) ; return 0 ; }
The output is , of course :
t t n n
Note that indexing works on both arrays and pointers .
Similarly , pointer arithmetic works on both arrays and pointers .
So how are they different ?
In a very important and fundamental way .
Consider this code snippet : char array_place [ 100 ] = " do n't panic " ; char * ptr_place = " do n't panic " ; int main ( ) { char a = array_place [ 7 ] ; char b = ptr_place [ 7 ] ; return 0 ; }
What exactly happens in the assignment to a , and how is it different from the assignment to b ?
It 's informative to take a look at the disassembly ( taken from Visual C++ 2005 on an x86 machine running Windows XP ) : char a = array_place [ 7 ] ; 0041137E mov al , byte ptr [ _array_place +7 ( 417007h ) ] 00411383 mov byte ptr [ a ] , al char b = ptr_place [ 7 ] ; 00411386 mov eax , dword ptr [ _ptr_place ( 417064h ) ] 0041138B mov cl , byte ptr [ eax + 7 ] 0041138E mov byte ptr [ b ] , cl
The semantics of arrays in C dictate that the array name is the address of the first element of the array .
Hence in the assignment to a , the 8th character of the array is taken by offsetting the value of array_place by 7 , and moving the contents pointed to by the resulting address into the al register , and later into a .
On the other hand , the semantics of pointers are quite different .
A pointer is just a regular variable that happens to hold the address of another variable inside .
Therefore , to actually compute the offset of the 8th character of the string , the CPU will first copy the value of the pointer into a register and only then increment it .
This takes another instruction .
A graphical explanation
This is a graphical explanation :
The rightmost column is the memory addresses , and the boxes are the contents of memory cells .
The first few letters of the string in array_place are displayed .
Note that array_place is simply a label ( or an alias ) to the memory address 0x417000 .
Therefore accessing array_place [ 7 ] is simply accessing memory address 0x417007 .
Therefore , as we can see in the disassembly , the compiler just replaces array_place [ 7 ] by 0x417007 - no address computation has to be done by the assembly it generates .
With a pointer , this works differently : ptr_place is just a variable that contains an address inside .
This is the address to the first byte of the string that sits in another memory location .
Compare this to the disassembly listing of the access to pointer_place [ 7 ] - it becomes clear why the compiler generates that code .
Variable names in C are just labels
This point is frequently ignored by programmers who do n't actually hack on compilers .
A variable in C is just a convenient , alphanumeric pseudonym of a memory location .
Were we writing assembly code , we would just create a label in some memory location and then access this label instead of always hard - coding the memory value - and this is what the compiler does .
Well , actually the address is not hard - coded in an absolute way because of loading and relocation issues , but for the sake of this discussion we do n't have to get into these details .
A label is something the compiler assigns at compile time .
From here the great difference between arrays and pointers in C stems .
And this is also why ...
Arrays passed to functions are converted to pointers
Here 's a snippet : void foo ( char arr_arg [ ] , char * ptr_arg ) { char a = arr_arg [ 7 ] ; char b = ptr_arg [ 7 ] ; } Quiz : how are the accesses to a and b different here ?
Answer : they 're not ! char a = arr_arg [ 7 ] ; 00412DCE mov eax , dword ptr [ arr_arg ] 00412DD1 mov cl , byte ptr [ eax + 7 ] 00412DD4 mov byte ptr [ a ] , cl char b = ptr_arg [ 7 ] ; 00412DD7 mov eax , dword ptr [ ptr_arg ] 00412DDA mov cl , byte ptr [ eax + 7 ] 00412DDD mov byte ptr [ b ] , cl
This happens because arrays passed into functions are always converted into pointers .
The argument declaration char arr_place [ ] is just syntactic sugar for char* arr_place .
Here 's a quote from K&R2 :
When an array name is passed to a function , what is passed is the location of the initial element .
Within the called function , this argument is a local variable , and so an array name parameter is a pointer , that is , a variable containing an address .
If this seems strange , think again .
Recall the diagrams of the previous section .
The C compiler has no choice here , since an array name is a label it replaces at compile time with the address it represents .
But a function is n't called at compile time , it 's called at run time , where something should be placed on the stack to be considered as an argument .
The compiler can't just treat array references inside a function as labels and replace them with addresses , because it has no idea what actual array will be passed in at run time .
This last point may be a bit convoluted , but it 's not critical to the understanding of the article .
You can just take it as a fact : arrays passed to functions are converted to pointers , end of story !
Does the difference affect me ?
Yes .
One way is that arrays just can't be manipulated the way pointers can .
Here 's a quote from Expert C Programming :
There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must be kept in mind .
A pointer is a variable , so pa=a and pa++ are legal .
But an array name is not a variable ; constructions like a=pa and a ++ are illegal .
Here 's an example : #include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { int i ; char array [ ] = " do n't panic " ; char * ptr = array ; /* array traversal */ for ( i = 0 ; i < sizeof ( array ) ; ++i ) printf ( " %c " , array [ i ] ) ; printf ( "
" ) ; /* pointer traversal */ for ( ; * ptr ; ++ptr ) printf ( " %c " , * ptr ) ; return 0 ; } Note how an array has to be indexed with another variable .
A pointer , on the contrary , is just a variable that can be manipulated freely .
Another , more important , difference is actually a common C gotcha : Suppose one file contains a global array : char my_arr [ 256 ] ;
And soothed by the seeming equivalence between arrays and pointers , the programmer that wants to use it in another file mistakingly declares as : extern char * my_arr ;
When he tries to access some element of the array using this pointer , he will most likely get a segmentation fault or a fatal exception ( the nomenclature depends on the OS ) .
Understanding why this happens is left as an exercise to the reader .
Hurray !

This was truly a thing of beauty .
Betsy McCaughey gets smacked down by Dylan Ratigan and Anthony Weiner on MSNBC 's Morning Meeting .
From Think Progress :
Throughout the interview , McCaughey was constantly on the defensive , complaining that she was being shut out of the debate .
“ Anthony , you are ignorant about health insurance , ” she said , before insisting to Ratigan that “ this will go down in history as one of the most browbeating interviews in television history . ”
“ I hope that it does , ” Ratigan replied .
“ And maybe you ’ll learn at that point then to answer questions as opposed to go on television and cast accusations . ”
Continue reading ...
And Bob Cesca noted :
Jamison Foser makes a good point : why is McCaughey on television in the first place ?
While it 's frustrating that cable news continues to elevate wingnuts and crazies , there 's actually an upside to bringing in people like McCaughey .
I 'll explain .
In the case of this Ratigan segment , he 's doing the opposite of what Fox News does all the time .
Fox News claims " balance " by including occasional liberals .
Weak , barely articulate , outnumbered liberals who are way out of their depth .
So the debate is automatically stacked in favor of the conservatives , while Fox News can claim " balance " in a very superficial way .
Ratigan , today , lined up a strong liberal against a weak wingnut , and Ratigan is clearly more sympathetic to Weiner 's position on healthcare .
That meant two pro-reform voices against one weak anti-reform voice .
It 's a start .
Yes it is .
Parallels : Fizzers , Rockets , and Smarties
It ’s almost Halloween and no trick - or - treat bag is complete without a twisty , colorful roll of ( depending where you call home ) Smarties , Fizzers , or Rockets .
Admittedly not one of my most favorites , the chalky pastel - colored candy could usually be found near the bottom of my treat bag .
Weeks after Halloween they would remain next to the yellow lollipops , little boxes of raisins , and — the worst offender — the rock - hard , black - and - orange wrapped molasses candies ( an oddity of growing up in Canada ) .
Whatever name you know them by , they are essentially the same rolled - up tablets which originated as Fizzers .
The candy was first created in the 1930 ’s by British confectioners Swizzels Matlow ( made famous for their Love Hearts ) and are still sold in the United Kingdom and Australia under that name .
L-R : Smarties ( Photo : J. Smith , Wikipedia ) , Fizzers ( Photo : Retro Tuck Shop ) , Rockets ( Photo : Danielle Scott , Flickr )
The fizzy candy first arrived in the North America in 1949 when the brother of a Swizzles Matlow partner came to the United States and started the Ce De Candy company .
Smarties , as they became known in the U.S. , are also manufactured and sold in Canada by the same company .
But not as Smarties …
Where Smarties are not Smarties
To the rest of the world Smarties means chocolate ( and depending who you ask , a more favorable Halloween treat ) .
Similar to plain M&M’s , Nestlé Smarties were first sold in England as “ Chocolate Beans ” in the 1880 ’s before adopting the “ Smarties ” name in 1937 .
The equally colorful candy is popular in the UK , Germany , Australia , South Africa and Canada — where it ’s common to eat the red ones last .
Above : Canadian Smarties packaging ( Photo : pollyalida , Flickr ) ; Below : Comparing M&Ms ( left ) with British Smarties ( Photo : fritish , Flickr )
So , to avoid confusion ( and lawsuits ) Canadians have the nearly identically packaged Rockets instead — and Americans , unfortunately , miss out on the chocolate variety .
Timeless fizz
60 years after its introduction in North America , Smarties and Rockets are still instantly recognizable .
With its timeless packaging and Tuscan - style slab serif type , it has gone mostly unchanged for decades … except as designer Rob Giampietro points out :
Today ’s Smarties differ in one unfortunate respect : they depict the package on the package itself .
Maybe it ’s a symptom of our meta - obsessed times , or maybe it ’s a fear of pure abstraction , but this minor graphic revision leaves the prospective Smarties consumer feeling a bit of the Dröste Effect …
In North America , Ce De Candy currently sells an astonishing 2.5 billion rolls of the candy per year — proving that kids today are still addicted .

THE Chaser has picked up an award likely to take pride of place on the team 's mantelpiece - for the second year running , its War on Everything was the most - complained - about show on the ABC .
The guerilla comedy program attracted a total of 4995 complaints in the year to the end of June , 4286 of which were in relation to the Make a Realistic Wish Foundation sketch that featured children with terminal illnesses .
Following the sketch and expressions of outrage that extended all the way to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , the show was suspended for two weeks and the members of the group apologised .
Next on the 2008 - 09 complaints list was the decision to axe various programs on Radio National , which generated 1379 complaints , many inspired by the on-air attack on the decision by Religion Report host Stephen Crittenden .
In total , the broadcaster received 32,130 complaints , including 3564 for bias or lack of balance and 1738 for factual inaccuracy .
The total number of complaints was down more than 20 per cent from last year 's total of 40,246 .
The figures were contained in the national broadcaster 's annual report , released yesterday , that also revealed that Australians are more satisfied with the ABC 's performance that they were a year ago .
Newspoll found that 89 per cent of people value the broadcaster and its services to the community , up 1 percentage point , while those who believe quality programming offered by ABC television was steady at 82 per cent , and ABC radio up 4 points to 69 per cent .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœGood Bank , Bad BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ split idea is being floated by the UK government .
According to the Independent Newspaper this morning , there is a possibility that Lloyds , RBS and Northern Rock may be split into retail and Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœcasinoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ entities and sold in a state sale over the next few years .
While State side , a US House Bill proposes that the largest firms are to pay for the US financial rescue .
The proposed structure would see that any financial institution ( Banks , Hedge Funds etc ) with a balance sheet greater than $ 10 b
Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœwould have to pay for the rescue of companies whose collapse would be critical to the financial systemÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The Bill also contains provisions that would give the Fed the power to reduce the size of the companies posing a system risk .
Finally the cost is being shifted away from the taxpayer !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 10 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
There is no other way to describe it , but US consumer confidence tanked yesterday ( 47.7 vs. 53.4 ) .
Confidence deteriorated on both the present situation ( a 26 - year low of 20.7 ) and on the expectations front ( 65.7 from 73.7 ) for the 2nd - consecutive month .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that the latter accounted for the most of the decline .
The expectations sub - component retreated back to levels last witnessed 4 - months ago , even after Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœaggressivelyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ advancing in Aug. and Sept .!
The labor index ( jobs plentiful minus hard to get ) , fell to the lowest level in 26 - years ( - 46.2 ) .
The jobs plentiful index fell for the 3rd- consecutive month , while the hard to get index rose to its highest level in three decades .
Something seems to be out of sync , as the data is not mirroring recent NFP reports .
Despite job cuts potentially slowing , finding employment remains difficult , averaging longer than 26.6 weeks .
Other sub - categories show that 6 - month spending intentions remain weak for a 2nd - consecutive month , perhaps due to employment concerns .
On the inflation front , consumers expect prices to be +5 % higher a year from now .
This time last year they predicted a +6.8 % hike in prices !
Finally there is US data that shows that US home prices are showing some signs of stabilizing .
House prices , as measured by the S&P / Case - Shiller home prices index , rose for the 3rd- consecutive month in Aug. yesterday , on a seasonally - adjusted basis ( - 11.32 % vs. - 13.26 % , y/y ) .
This is the first sign of stability after 3 - years of declines !
But , will it be sustainable ?
There are a number of reasons to say itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not happening .
Firstly , the first time home buyers incentives ends at the end of next month .
Secondly , analysts remain concerned about the shadow inventories .
With more inventories beginning to be released could pressurize prices even further .
Finally , resets were at a cyclical low over the last few months .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s also worth noting that for the month of Aug. prices rose +0.97 % vs. the +1.16 % gain in July .
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.08 % , CHF +0.11 % , JPY +0.51 % and higher against GBP - 0.10 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.30 % and AUD - 0.67 % .
BOC Governor is insistent that a strong loonie will damper longer term growth .
In his testimony before the House of Commons Finance Committee yesterday , he said efforts by Cbanks to affect their currencies need monetary policy to back them up .
FX intervention without complimentary policy moves is seldom effective in the long term .
He has options , like credit and quantitative easing to influence the loonie and meet their 2 % inflation target .
The commodity based currency was dealt a blow from softer crude prices as OPEC suggested that they would increase output production if higher oil prices threatened global economic growth .
With equities under pressure , and the USD remaining better bid on risk aversion strategies , is curtailing the demand for the loonie .
With a large percentage of the market being long CAD on the back of recent commodity advances , one should expect the technical traders to dictate the short term direction .
Weak longs are being squeezed out .
Dealers expect to see better levels to own their domestic currency .
After breaching the 1.0600 level earlier this week opens up the top side to 1.0750 .
The best performer , the AUD , amongst the 16 major currencies managed to retreat in the O/N trading session on its inflation reports .
Australian inflation cooled to the slowest pace in 10 - years ( +1.0 % vs. +0.5 % , q/q ) and easing the pressure on Governor Stevens at the RBA to hike the benchmark lending rate ( 3.25 % ) by 50 bp next week .
A 25 bp hike looks increasingly likely to be the best case scenario from the RBA next month .
Governor Stevens said it was Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœpossibly imprudentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to keep borrowing costs at a 50 - year low in the minutes of its Oct. meeting .
For now , the currency remains better bid on deeper pullbacks ( 0.9118 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 79.36 down - 19 c ) .
It was the tri-factor of trading reasons why crude prices softened this week .
Firstly , OPEC is starting to talk crude down .
Members will increase output production to protect the global economic recovery if oil prices continue to rise .
They have indicated that both Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœproducers and consumers were comfortable with oil prices at between $ 75 and $ 80 per barrel and that higher priceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s could put the brakes on the pace of global economic recovery Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Ideally , they want to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœmaintain balanceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and will act accordingly in Dec. depending on where crude is trading .
This will surely put a short term dampener on speculative trading .
Secondly , the dollar has rebounded from its 14 - month lows , thus diminishing the appeal of commodities to investors .
Finally , equities managed to see red .
Oil prices had been pushed to New Year highs last week on the back of the weekly EIA report showing a bigger than forecasted decline in supplies of gas .

September 22 , 2009 .
By Federico Fuentes , Caracas September 25 — Green Left Weekly —
“ The whole world knows that what we have here in Honduras is a coup regime ” , Armando Licona , a leader from the Revolutionary University Student Front said .
Green Left Weekly spoke with Licona , whose organisation is part of the National Resistance Front Against the Coup ( FNRG ) , on the phone from the Honduran capital , Tegucilgalpa .
Today ( September 25 ) , the military attacked the Brazilian embassy with chemical weapons .
President Manuel Zelaya is bunkered down in the Brazilian embassy after secretly re-entering the country on September 21 .
The Honduran poor have waged a campaign of constant resistance against the coup regime to demand that Zelaya is restored and a constitutional assembly called to create a new constitution to meet the peoples ’ needs in one the hemisphere ’s poorest nations .
Since Zelaya ’s return , both repression by the dictatorship and resistance by the people have significantly increased .
An unknown number of peaceful protesters have been killed or disappeared , and the regime rounds up protesters daily .
Despite this , protests continue on the streets .
Licona said that , despite the repression , “ our dignity will not allow us to give up ” .
“ We are a people fighting to ensure that the great changes we have initiated come to fruition .
We will not rest until President Zelaya is restored to power and the national constituent assembly is called , which will allow these great changes that we dream of become reality — a country based on social justice that is not in the hands of some eight or 10 rich families who do whatever they want with complete impunity . ”
Chemical warfare Licona explained : “ Today , the 91st day of resistance , we held a massive march in Tegucigalpa .
But the most serious event was the attacks made against Zelaya ... they are using chemical weapons [ on the embassy ] causing many people inside to vomit blood . ”
Dirian Pereira , from the FNRG international commission , told GLW that , despite Zelaya denouncing the chemical attack , the International Red Cross , the Human Rights Committee of Honduras and Zelaya ’s doctors were denied entry by the military .
The soldiers “ had orders to not let any one pass ” .
“ This is chemical warfare … it seems clear that the order is to get Zelaya out dead or alive — but preferably dead . ”
Meanwhile , the regime has again imposed a night curfew across most of the country , which resistance activists expect will be enforced with brutal repression , and met with defiant resistance .
Licona said : “ The coup regime wants a bloodbath .
But the resistance has stood firm on its strategy of peaceful mobilisations , even despite their attempts to infiltrate our marches to carry out acts of vandalism , carrying guns .
[ The regime is ] totally armed , that is why it is hard .
What we see is a resistance and a people with dignity , but who are fighting with their hands in the face of bullets , batons and tear gas . ” ` Dialogue ' ruse
The attack against the embassy comes less than 24 hours after the coup regime said it was willing to start a dialogue with Zelaya , who has continuously repeated his willingness to talk .
Licona told GLW that the supposed dialogue attempt “ was a proposal of the coup plotter [ Roberto ] Mitchelleti [ installed by the coup as ``president ' ' ] .
What they want is a pretext to claim that all possible avenues of dialogue have been exhausted . ”
Pereira agreed : “ We believe that the arrival of the four musketeers of the right , that is , the four presidential candidates of the right - wing parties , that talked to Mel [ as Zelaya is popularly known ] in the embassy was in order to take a photo with him and immediately circulate it in the media as a way of saying ‘ look , these people are hugging each other ’ .
Prior to this meeting , they met with Micheletti .
They came , spoke with [ Mel ] and what they said to him was that he should hand himself in .
He simply said that the only way out was with his restitution [ as president ] .
“ We believe that they staged this show in order to stop any possible [ United Nations ] intervention of ‘ blue helmets ’ , because the UN Security Council was meeting .
They wanted to stop any possible negotiation in this direction .
I think that to a certain extent they achieved this , because the Security Council resolution simply condemns what they are doing to the [ Brazilian ] embassy . ”
Pereira explained the position of the FNRG : “ We have four well - defined positions : 1 ) the restoration of President Mel Zelaya ; 2 ) the restoration of constitution order ; 3 ) the withdrawal of the military to its barracks ; and 4 ) the installation of the national constituent assembly .
We will not back down on these . ”
Pereira said the resistance would continue with its street protests on September 26 .
“ There will be a march starting at 8 am where we will once again aim to bring together the largest number of people possible .
In the afternoon there will be a caravan of vehicles throughout the barrios and colonias [ poor neighbourhoods ] . ”

The embassy is under siege by the Honduran armed forces , who have attempted to cut food supplies , water and electricity , jam communications .
The army has set up sound boxes that emit high - pitched , irritating high - decibal noise inside the embassy grounds .
Conteris speaks with Australian community radio station 2 NimFM's Latin Radical program and describes the situation there just a few hours after the Honduran military pumped noxious gas into the embassy grounds .

Honduras : People ’s insurrection forces regime to consider talks
By Federico Fuentes , Caracas
September 24 , 2009 — Green Left Weekly —
The coup regime in Tegucigalpa is crumbling in the face of growing resistance from Honduran people and international condemnation that followed the daring September 21 return of legitimate President Manuel Zelaya , who is now inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa .
The dictatorship ordered the police and military to violently repress the thousands who protested outside the Brazilian embassy , as well as the people on the streets across the country .
An unknown number of people have been killed , including an eight - year - old girl , and hundreds arrested .
The response of the Honduran poor , determined to see “ their ” president returned to office , was to launch an insurrection in the impoverished neighbourhoods .
With street battles raging , and barricades raised , a number of working - class neighbourhoods declared themselves “ liberated zones ” .
The international isolation of the coup regime also worsened when United Nations general secretary Ban Ki-moon said on September 23 that elections organised by the Micheletti dictatorship would not be “ credible ” and the UN was withdrawing all assistance ( worth US $ 1.3 million ) for a coup regime - organised November 28 poll .
Desperate , the regime has now opened dialogue with Zelaya — something it refused to do for three months .
The resistance plans once again to take to the streets of Tegucigalpa on September 25 to demand Zelaya ’s reinstatement and the calling of a constituent assembly .
The issue of organising a constituent assembly to redraft the constitution was the detonator for the June 28 coup .
That day , a non-binding referendum was meant to be held , asking the people whether they were in favor of a constituent assembly to rewriting the 1982 constitution — put in place by the military dictatorship at the time .
Gilberto Rios , a leader of the National Resistance Front Against the Coup , told Green Left Weekly over the phone from Tegucigalpa : “ President Zelaya has met [ today ] with a few people from the right wing to see if they could start a process of dialogue .
It possible that the level of tension will briefly come down , although tomorrow will be a climactic day of mobilisations — boosted by the support we received in the UN . ”
Explaining the course of events on September 24 , Rios said : “ The National Resistance Front had called on the people to not mobilise in the centre of Tegucigalpa .
Instead , it was proposed that people should organise protests in their barrios and colonias [ poor neighbourhoods ] , in order to avoid any provocations by the march of the camisas blancas [ white shirts , supporters of the coup ] . ”
Many feared the pro-coup march could be used as a trigger for street clashes and further repression .
Some had warned of plans to stoke violent confrontations near the Brazilian embassy .
Resistance activist Ricardo Salgado told GLW that the march was further evidence that “ a section of the armed forces and the coup regime still look to carry out extreme measures ” to end the anti-coup resistance .
In the end , the pro-coup march was very small and largely consisted of public servants forced to attend , Rios said .
Dialogue
Both Rios and Salgado confirmed that numerous avenues of dialogue had been opened up between Zelaya and coup representatives over the last 24 hours .
Salgado said : “ Last night a representative of the [ coup ] government arrived at the Brazilian embassy to explicitly propose to the president that he resign and that Micheletti would also resign .
This was considered unacceptable [ by Zelaya ] , as it would basically legitimise the coup .
“ Then , this afternoon , Father Juan Jose Pineda , a bishop in Tegucigalpa who is very close to Cardinal Rodriguez , one of the coup plotters ” also visited Zelaya , “ we suspect to offer some kind of negotiation … on behalf of the de facto government ” .
Salgado added , “ later on today [ Zelaya ] will meet with Father Luis Alfonso Santos , who is decidedly against the coup and who just released a 12 - point declaration [ in which he states ] his support for the people , constitutional restoration and the recognition of the legitimate right to insurrection of the people have in the face of a government imposed by force ” .
He said this seemed to confirm that the Catholic Church would play an important role in any negotiations .
Furthermore , the candidates that stated their intention to run in the November presidential elections met on the afternoon of September 24 with Michelleti , and met with Zelaya later that tonight .
Rios said the National Resistance Front “ is and has always been open to dialogue , as long as it contemplates the restitution of Zelaya and the jailing of those responsible for the coup ” .
“ The [ plan to organise a ] constituent assembly is also non-negotiable .
The constitutional order was broken as a result of the coup and the constitution orders that a constitution assembly be held [ in such a scenario ] so that can not be up for discussion on the negotiation table . ”
Rios told GLW that Zelaya “ has spoken with the resistance and that we have the same position in regards to what is up for discussion and what is non-negotiable ” .
He added that he did n’t think the dialogue would succeed “ very easily or quickly ” .
“ The coup regime has its own internal contradictions ” , Salgado said .
“ Although it has attempted to maintain the facade of a strong regime backed by repression , it is clear that the country is in a very bad state and groups of business owners have said it is necessary to negotiate with the president .
“ If we take as our starting point the fact that these business owners are the financiers of the coup , then what we are talking about is sections of the coup regime recognising the need to negotiate . ”
Salgado said : “ My personal opinion is that while it is true that the resistance forces have not matured enough yet to be able to stage an insurrection capable of overthrowing the coup regime , it has been able to reach a high level of organisation . ”
This means that Zelaya “ will need to count on the leadership of the National Resisatnce Front for any proposed solution to the current situation , because that is where he finds his social base .
His popularity is based on [ including ] a large range of people , from popular leaders in the barrios , to teachers to supporters of his former party . ”
Repression and mobilisation
Rios said : “ There continues to be a strong presence of military and police helicopters [ circling Tegucigalpa ] because the National Resistance Front is meeting .
So I think that if the dialogue does not begin today , we will probably face a night where we will see a repeat of the last few nights — where there has been a lot of repression in the colonias with many people detained . ”
Salgado agreed , saying “ the last few nights have been very tense … the military has been carrying out a campaign of attacking the popular barrios and poor colonias .
They have approached homes without any warnings and carried out extrajudicial break - ins into — taking the young men out , beating up the parents .
The exact toll of deaths and those disappeared is difficult to be determine .
We are expecting that [ the coup regime ] will announce another curfew for tonight .
So what we could expect more repression .
And no doubt the people will once again mobilise tonight , on the streets in their barrios . ”
Boosted by the UN resolution and Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez ’s “ educational speech [ at the UN General Assembly ] , which reminded us of why we are involved in this resistance movement ” , Rios said the resistance will be gathering at 8 am September 25 at the Pedagogical University — “ for what will be a very climactic mobilisation ” .

Honduras : Street battles rage as military attacks pro-democracy uprising
By Federico Fuentes , Caracas
September 24 , 2009 — Green Left Weekly —
Street battles continued to rage late into the night of September 23 in the poor neighbourhoods of the Honduran capital , Tegucigalpa , after a day marked by brutal military and police attack on a massive demonstration in support of Honduras ' ousted President Manuel Zelaya .
Zelaya , whose pro-poor policies outraged Hondura ' ruling elite and US corporations , was overthrown in a June 28 military coup and exiled to Costa Rica .
On September 21 , Zelaya stunned the world by re-entering Honduras and taking refuge in Brazil 's embassy in Tegucigalpa .
This daring action — after 88 straight days of resistance to the coup , with strikes , protests and road blockades by the poor majority — set off a renewed wave of mobilisations across the country to demand Zelaya ’s reinstatement .
As battles between unarmed protesters and heavily armed security forces raged on Honduras ' streets , world leaders condemned the coup regime at the United Nations General Assembly meeting .
However , while governments from across the world called for the immediate retun to power of Zelaya , US President Barack Obama managed to go through his entire speech without mentioning the word ``Honduras ' ' .
This is despite the fact that all officers in the Honduran military , which carried out the coup and was shooting live rounds at unarmed protesters as Obama spoke , are trained by the US military .
This military training has not ceased since the June 28 coup .
The presentation of the public position of his government — which is desperately seeking a way to end the anti-coup insurrection that has broken out in the impoverished Central American nation — was left to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and State Department spokesperson Ian Kelly .
Dirian Pereira , from the international commission of National Resistance Front of Resistance Against the Coup ( FNRG ) , spoke to Green Left Weekly over the phone from Tegucigalpa , sounding clearly shaken by the brutality of the repression meted out earlier in the day .
Her voice trembling , she said : “ In all honesty , the repression was extreme .
There was no contemplation nor respect nor anything for human rights .
The repression was extremely strong .
We still do not know what the coup regime aims to do with the opposition , because as each day passes , the situation becomes more and more intense . ''
Called by the FNRG , the massive protest that began at 8 am on September 23 was a strong demonstration of the people ’s will to see their elected president return to the presidential palace .
Due to a spate looting caused by the coup regime 's total curfew that led to shortages of food and medicine , the regime temporarily lifted it between 10 am and 5 pm .
Pereira said : “ The mobilisation was extremely large , making use of the fact that the curfew had been lifted .
The people spilled out onto the streets en masse ...
The police tried to provoke the protesters in order to create chaos , but the resistance ignored them . ”
The aim of the protest was to peacefully march to an area close to the Brazil embassy , where Zelaya remains despite the regime cutting off electricity , blocking food and firing tear gas into the compound .
Gilberto Rios , a leader of the FNRG , told GLW over the phone : “ When we got to the zone , the police , without any prior provocation on behalf of the protesters , began launching tear - gas canisters .
The march was quickly dispersed .
Many had to be taken to hospital and a number of young people were arrested . ”
Despite this , the battle on the streets of Tegucigalpa continues .
“ Right now , throughout the night , there have been a number of shoot outs in the different colonias [ poor neighbourhoods ] of the capital ” , Pereira said .
“ There are parts that are practically in insurrection , there are colonias that have declared themselves liberated zones .
They are well organised , they have set up three , fours layers of barricades to stop the police entering . ”
Both Pereira and Rios explained that the repression by the regime , which has left an unknown number of people dead and hundreds arrested , had increased support for the resistance .
“ Everything is possible ” , Rios told GLW .
“ There is a strong feeling of rejection towards the Honduran armed forces who have been attacking its own people , similarly with the police ...
Where I live , the police came to repress peaceful protests and that caused even more people , who although they are against the coup had not joined the resistance , to join the street battles . ”
However , as the intensity of the situation mounts , “ sectors of the population are beginning to feel that some kind of foreign intervention can prevent a bloodbath ” .
Rios insisted , however , that “ for us , the problem must be resolved internally ” .
Pereira said the talk of possible foreign intervention was coming mostly from right - wing forces who are feeling desperate , as they are losing control of the situation .
Rios said the coup leader Robert Micheletti “ has explained it in the following terms : they consider themselves to be a ‘ little Berlin ’ , they feel like the Nazis when they were completely surrounded at the end of the war . ”
The coup regime has shifted from arguing it was invincible to “ now talking about how they are willing to die in the government palace before handing over power ” .
Rios had earlier in the night told GLW that the FNRG had not been able to meet due to the confusion and the pace of events .
However , Pereira later confirmed they had meet .
However , the resistance has not yet announced what its next steps will be .
When ready , information would be conveyed via Radio Globo , Pereira said .
Radio Globo has acted as a voice for the resistance and its broadcasts are often disrupted and sabotaged has by the military .
Pereira called for people around the world to “ remain alert to what is occurring , denounce it , hold solidarity actions and remain up to date on news coming out of Honduras , because here the news is changing from hour to hour , it is changing every little while ” .
Rios said : “ All of this [ international solidarity ] is important for saving lives . ”
Pereira said : “ I want to say to the whole world that we continue to stand firm resisting .
We are not going to allow this to slip through our hands , because just now , we have the people with us . ”
Honduras : ` There is a people ’s insurrection '
By Federico Fuentes , Caracas
Green Left Weekly -- September 23 , 2009 — Honduras ' President Manuel Zelaya , overthrown in a military coup on June 28 and currently in the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa , has told Telesur TV that the coup regime is planning to take over the embassy .
He says they plan to assassinate him .
Ricardo Salgado , an activist in the Honduran anti-coup resistance , told Green Left Weekly over the phone from Tegucigalpa that “ the decision we have all taken is to fight with everything we have ” .
Salgado said there was an “ intense reaction on the part of the resistance in many zones across Tegucigalpa , in what we call barrios and colonias [ poor neighbourhoods ] .
I would say that there are some 15 - 20 highly populated barrios that frankly find themselves in a situation of total insurrection , fighting against the police , against the army and even against paramilitaries . "
The mass resistance to the coup has continued for three months , with daily protests , strikes and road blockades .
With Zelaya ’s return the Honduras , a desperate coup regime has significantly increased repression .
The people are increasingly in open rebellion .
“ We have evidence that paramilitaries are participating in the street battles in some of the colonias .
The police are trying to retake positions but the people ’s insurrection is occurring in places that geographically are very far apart from one another ' ' , Salgado told Green Left Weekly .
“ In general , there is a situation of insurrection , with the advantage that the police helicopter that was being used [ during daylight ] to fire against the people cannot be used during the night . ”
On the situation in Tegucigalpa , he said : “ All the shops are closed and there is a shortage of food , of medicine .
“ At any moment we could see the looting of shops , because the people are entering into desperation mode .
Moreover , it seems that , although there is not as much news regarding this , that in the interior of the country there are strong insurrectional mobilisations in very small zones .
This has to do with the tactic of protesting close to home .
“ The people are spontaneously taking the decision to resist and the line coming from the [ National Resistance Front Against the Coup ] was , for today , to resist close to one ’s home .
But tomorrow we are calling on everyone to march [ in Tegucigalpa ] . ''
Salgado confirmed to GLW that the national front has called a march for September 23 that will start at 8 am outside the Pedagogical University Francisco Morazon .
He called on all alternative media outlets to join the campaign of informing the world about the truth of what is occurring in Honduras — and in denouncing the murderous plans of the coup regime .

Al Giordano from Narconews reports :
September 22 , 8:03 pm :
An interesting development today in the popular barrios and colonias of greater Tegucigalpa :
The coup 's military curfew -- now extended for a total of 36 hours until 6 am tomorrow morning -- is causing major hardship for the great mass of Honduran citizens who live day to day .
Small shop owners , street sellers , mercado workers and so many others generally do n't have savings .
If they do n't work on a given day , they and their families do n't have food to eat that night .
A great many do n't have refrigerators and they shop the same day for the food they will eat .
The curfew is causing shortages of food and other basic products of daily life , and preventing many from being able to afford what little they need .
And while the general view in the popular ( read : poor ) barrios have been anti-coup , the curfew has brought forward a rage and a higher level of organisation overnight .
Add to that the fact that the National Police have spent last night and today busting into those neighbourhoods to enforce the curfew -- because many citizens are n't paying it any mind as it interferes with their daily subsistence level survival -- and has overreacted with great violence , shooting tear - gas canisters into homes , invading people 's houses , and such .
This has caused a generalised phenomenon throughout the metropolitan area : People have come en masse out of their homes , chased the police out of many of those neighbourhoods , and erected barricades to keep them out .
They are now organising to maintain those barricades .
The coup regime thus , overnight , has lost any semblance of control of considerable tracts of urban Honduras .
Tegucigalpa is beginning to look a lot like the city of Oaxaca , Mexico in 2006 .
September 22 , 8:46 pm : After a bizarre press conference held in English and translated into Spanish , in which a staffer , Carlos Lopez Contreras , represented coup " president " Micheletti ( without Micheletti being present -- his handlers have hidden him away for good reason ) , and in " cadena nacional " ( broadcast on all stations by law ) , the regime has extended the curfew now for 50 hours , until 6 pm September 23 .
September 22 , 8:54 pm : From Quotha.net , more detailed info on the neighbourhood - by - neighbourhood uprising underway in greater Tegucigalpa :
The de facto government , through its violence and denial of constitutional and human rights , has managed what Zelaya alone had not fully succeeded in doing : uniting the entire country in the struggle for freedom .
Today , they resistance underwent an important shift : it went local .
The following Tegucigalpa neighborhoods are defying the curfew and protesting against the coup d'etat : Arturo Quesada Barrio Morazán Centroamérica Oeste Cerro Grande Ciudad Lempira Colonia 21 de Febrero Colonia 21 de Octubre El Bosque El Chile Flor del Campo Hato de Enmedio Kennedy La Fraternidad Pantanal Pedregal Picachito Reparto Residencial Girasoles Residencial Honduras San José de la Vega Sinaí Víctor F. Ardón Villa Olímpica Villanueva
In some places people have repelled the police , while in others the terrain is in dispute .
The police are using live ammunition .
Barricades are everywhere .
This list was current at 7 pm ( September 22 ) local time in Tegucigalpa .
The latest extension of the curfew just announced -- preventing Hondurans from working or shopping all day tomorrow , too -- will only exacerbate this situation .
* * *
Al Giordano from Narconews reports on September 23 , 2009 :
In recent days , the Honduran coup of " president " Roberto Micheletti has demonstrated , again , that it is incapable democratic governance .
Peaceful Hondurans came to the Brazilian embassy to greet their only elected president , Manuel Zelaya , and they were violently driven away with water cannon , tear gas , billy clubs and rubber bullets .
National Police then followed the dispersed crowd into the popular barrios to wound and maim them , and invaded homes that provided them refuge .
That led to scenes like in the neighbourhood of Hato de Enmedio [ see video above ] , and in more than 20 heavily populated slums in and around Tegucigalpa yesterday .
Clueless desk editors like those at the New York Times titled these conflicts " Riots in Honduras " .
But you do n't need to be able to understand Spanish to see and hear , in the video above , that , distinct from rioters , the young people of the neighbourhood who came out and violated the military curfew to defend their neighbourhood from this police invasion know and have memorised complicated political slogans and rhymes which they chanted in unison .
" Riots " are disorganised explosions .
This neighbourhood , and others like it , however , have been forced by the realities of the coup to organise themselves to a greater extent than ever before .
In neighbourhoods like Hato de Enmedio , where a majority of Honduras ' citizens live , you can also see in the video see that not even the main street in the barrio is paved .
Many of the homes have dirt floors as well .
And if a citizen is harmed by a robber or predator , you can call the police , but they wo n't come .
People who live in neighbourhoods like this only see the police when they invade , like they did yesterday , to enforce an unenforceable curfew on people who , if they obeyed the curfew , would starve of hunger .
A curfew is unsustainable on a people that live hand to mouth , day to day .
We can also see in that video the revelation that the tear - gas canisters shot by the National Police yesterday were stamped as property of the government of Perú , suggesting strongly that Peruvian President Alan García is a participant in smuggling arms to the Honduran coup regime .
James S. McDonald , head of investment - management firm Rockefeller & Co. and a board member of NYSE Euronext , died on Sunday in Massachusetts , according to people familiar with the matter .
He was 56 years old .
In a statement Monday night , Barclay McFadden III , who identified himself as a friend of Mr. McDonald 's family , said he " took his own life . "
The family has " no further comments beyond this , " the statement added . "

What ’s the one thing all of these media - enriched diseases have in common ?
In every case , the mainstream news organs have taken the ball and run with it …
FAR out of proportion to the number of people who ever actually end up dying .
“ Oh , but THIS TIME it ’s going to be different … this could be The One … ”
Have n’t you started noticing that the mainstream media ALWAYS wants you to think we ’re right on the brink of apocalypse ?
Remember how every skirmish in the Middle East — like when Israel invaded Lebanon less than two years ago — is feverishly expected to suddenly turn into World War III and the Battle of Armageddon ?
It ’s the same principle .
If it bleeds , it leads .
More and more of us are waking up to what is really going on … but if you are fairly new to the game , you may not recognize the same - old - same - old once it starts happening again .
We here at Divine Cosmos certainly do , and would n’t have even bothered to write up the obvious had we not gotten so many of your letters , some rather desperate - sounding , seeking our opinion .
It ’s much faster to write a post than handle them all individually .
Then , the more we looked at it , the more we realized that this WAS a really big story … but not for the reasons the mainstream media — OR the anti-Obama conspiracy media — have been giving .
LET ’S JUST SAY …
Let ’s say you have an international criminal cartel .
Let ’s say this cartel just lost a very pivotal election — spectacularly ! — and with it the vast majority of their political power .
Let ’s say this cartel knew they were just about dead broke , and that losing the election could mean almost certain financial defeat — so they pulled an incredibly brazen , public smash - and - grab to “ Bail Out ” their sprawling corporate octopus for just a little longer :
Let ’s say this cartel is effectively bankrupt financially , with months or less of operating capital remaining , and is now teetering on the verge of complete collapse .
[ Their bare - minimum budget appears to be about a trillion a year at the very , very least , and the portion of funding from the first round of TARP that went ‘ missing ’ is well under half that amount . ]
Let ’s say this cartel owns a major cable news station as well as certain key organs of mainstream print media .
Let ’s say this cartel used these outlets to try to incite a public uprising , where civilians would overthrow their government , creating a whole new ‘ Nation ’ of states seceding from the Union to side with them :
Let ’s say this cartel ’s plan soon evolved into openly trying to finance and spark off a New American Revolution of “ Tea Parties ” , including offering their own “ celebrity ” newscasters ’ appearances to entice their viewers to show up :
Let ’s say this seditious campaign was a dismal failure , widely ridiculed for the astonishingly poor choice of ‘ branding ’ implicit in the name — a homo - erotic frat prank called ‘ Teabagging ’ , named as such for the relationship between the appearance of a teabag and a rather enjoyable part of the male anatomy .
Let ’s say those few who did participate in the “ Tea Parties ” became even MORE educated as to what ’s really going on , and who ’s really to blame — namely the shadowy controllers behind the scenes , such as the Federal Reserve — and loudly helped spread the word to others driving by :
Let ’s say one insider from this cartel , who happens to be a governor , suggested that his state could secede from the Union — wording it in a slippery ‘ maybe ’ fashion — only to have polls reveal at least 75 percent of his constituency vehemently opposed it .
Another epic and highly embarrassing failure .
Let ’s say the victorious new administration shut down this cartel ’s secret torture prisons — gulags whose continued existence is an essential element of running a dictatorship , where they can detain and brutalize people without ever charging them with a crime .
These secret concentration camps , of course , create great fear in the public , so they would never dare to oppose their tyrannical masters — but again , let ’s say they have now been shut down :
Let ’s say the victorious new administration blatantly released memos implicating the highest levels of the cartel in war crimes — i.e. the torture of detainees — even though at least four different very high - ranking CIA officials screamed for them not to :
Let ’s say that a prominent ACLU lawyer who helped force the release of the memos said “ these are the first dominoes ” that will lead to , at the very least , a purging of many high - level CIA officials :
MORE AWARE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
Let ’s also say the victorious new administration is well aware of the prophecies of an epic shift in human consciousness surrounding the year 2012 .
Let ’s say the new administration knew that releasing the torture memos and defeating the opposition would be a key part of the cleansing of our society — to fulfill the positive 2012 prophecies in practical terms .
Let ’s say the new administration staged a photo - op in front of the AUTHENTIC , ORIGINAL Aztec Calendar — whose timing system is almost identical to the Mayan Calendar … an image widely used as the main symbolic representation of the Mayan Calendar and 2012 .
Let ’s say that this very important symbolic photo was then directly associated with the release of torture memos in the news — and no overt mention of the significance was ever given :
[ Naturally , the choice of that particular location in the Mexico Anthropology Museum , and that one specific artifact ’s relationship to positive 2012 prophecies , must be a coincidence .
It ’s just a photograph .
No need to read in anything unusual about it .
Moving on … ]
Let ’s say the victorious new administration , after first creating a huge public outrage by saying they would not pursue their enemies , then pulled a complete 180 .
Let ’s say the new administration suddenly announced , last Tuesday , that they WOULD potentially prosecute those who operate and control this cartel — at the very highest levels — for having condoned and ordered torture :
Let ’s say that this sudden 180 stunned and demoralized the criminal cartel ’s media outlets — and all they could do was whine and complain about how it was a complete and total change of policy :
TWO - YEAR -OLD ‘DIRTY LAUNDRY ’ SUDDENLY AIRED OUT …
Let ’s say that during this same week , a two - year old , tragic story on torture ‘ suddenly ’ leaked out .
Let ’s say that the leaked story is about a female military officer who witnessed acts of torture in Iraq , and was horrified by them .
Was she ready to blow the whistle ?
To reveal all to the world ?
Very likely .
Did she make a mistake , and telegraph her moves too strongly ?
Very likely .
Did she then “ just so happen ” to die of a ( supposedly ) self - inflicted gunshot wound ?
Unfortunately , yes .
Obviously , in a harsh wartime environment , where everyone carries guns , there is no possibility of foul play in something like this .
She undoubtedly did it herself .
Case closed .
Again , the question .
Why now ?
Why this week ?
Are the cabal ’s secret methods — of using assassination to suppress the truth — being revealed so as to trigger a mass awakening ?
Could the new administration , given all the other things it ’s doing to bring down the criminal cartel , be behind this new leak ?
Think about it :
BLOODY NEW SHEETS
Let ’s say that a fairly innocent corporate underling was recently raised to power in the nearly - destroyed , highly corrupt Freddie Mac mortgage corporation , once all the higher - ups were thrown out :
http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D97NJOS03&show_article=1
Kellermann , a University of Michigan graduate who went to business school at George Washington University , worked for Freddie Mac for the past 16 years and was named acting chief financial officer last September when the government seized control of the company and ousted top executives .
Let ’s say this underling stumbled over something he “ was n’t supposed to . ”
Something that could destroy the criminal cartel completely .
Something that implicated the very highest levels — in a way that rhymes with ‘ tush ’ .
Let ’s say this underling found a BIG story … and he was ready to run with it , despite promises he might have made to dummy up :
http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7399376&page=1
In filings with the SEC in March , Freddie Mac said it had entered into a pact with Kellermann and two other company executives to protect them from liabilities and expenses in connection to any threatened or pending lawsuits .
Let ’s say this underling made a mistake , and telegraphed his impending moves too strongly .
Let ’s say that during this same week , he ‘ just so happened ’ to hang himself in his basement .
Unfortunately , this is true :
[ Of course , there is no correlation between this tragic event and the almost immediate release , just a few days later , of another , similar story about a female military officer in Iraq from two years ago — suggesting the use of fake suicides to cover - up the corruption at the highest levels . ]
KNOCKING DOWN THE HOUSE MADE OF OILY CREDIT CARDS …
Let ’s say that during this same week , articles appear in mainstream media proving that the new administration is fulfilling its pledge to directly attack the corruption in the oil industry and break their ‘ tyranny ’ over our society :
[ In my “ Government Conspiracy 101 ” sociology class in college , with the sneaky title “ Contemporary Social Issues , ” we learned that the oil industry — a key part of the no-longer - ruling criminal cartel — has fought viciously for many , many years to suppress public transportation such as light rail , bullet trains , mass subway transit and bus systems , as well as any and all forms of alternative energy . ]
Let ’s say that during this same week , the new administration also announces initiatives to aggressively tackle the corruption in the credit card industry — another essential pillar of the criminal cartel ’s illicit financing :
Let ’s say that — yes — during this same week , ( ! ) , an ex-astronaut gets widespread public and media momentum , including major TV coverage , to finally destroy the criminal cartel ’s secrecy over their most jealously guarded issue of all — the UFO cover - up — after more than 60 years of violently - enforced silence :
[ UPDATE WED . ]
OH WHAT THE HECK … THROW IN FREE ENERGY ( COLD FUSION ) FOR GOOD MEASURE !
Let ’s ALSO say that during this very same week , the good guys behind the scenes at CBS News release a twelve - minute documentary on 60 Minutes smashing the criminal cartel ’s manufactured myth that “ Cold Fusion ” is a fake .
Let ’s say that this is a very bold step forward towards destroying their grip on oil and all other fuels , inevitably leading towards a Utopian era where money is no longer necessary because we have limitless energy completely without cost :
Let ’s say all the above are true .
( Along with many other facts we will share in later sections of this article , for those who staunchly refuse to see the obvious . )
In that case , by all standards , it was a terrible , awful , no - good , very bad week for the criminal cartel — and wonderful for everyone else who yearns to breathe free .
WHAT CAN A BANKRUPT , WORLDWIDE CRIMINAL CARTEL DO ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE ?
What to do , what to do ?
Could you do another 9/11 ?
Not on such short notice — and not when you ’re flat out of money .
[ When the Disclosure Project brought out 39 whistleblowers with firsthand knowledge of government involvement in UFOs at the National Press Club , all willing to testify before Congress under oath , 9/11 happened just five months later — right as momentum for the hearings had started building , even in spite of the controlled media .
9/11 was obviously a bigger story — and it totally blew out the disclosure movement . ]
So …
Let ’s say the criminal cartel did not have enough money or time to do another 9/11 - type event this time around .
Let ’s say they did not have enough political power to incite a public uprising against the administration that is destroying them .
[ The “ Tea Party ” plans failed miserably and were widely ridiculed . ]
Let ’s say they really have nothing left to stop the inevitable from happening .
Their future hangs in the balance , and could be decided within mere weeks — given the speed with which things are happening these days .
What , then , do they need ?
Something cheap , something fast , something easy — anything to divert attention from their own VERY imminent collapse …
Hmm …
Think , think , think …
A SUDDEN DISTRACTION
That ’s it — a Sudden Distraction !
Time to call up the Controlled Media and create a huge mass panic .

Here ’s a video that makes the point clearly and WITHOUT fear :
RIDICULOUS FEAR -MONGERING
NOTHING else was on television .
Not for the entire weekend .
Monday either .
All the newspapers , all the magazines , all the websites were dominated by gripping headlines .
Most of the media is no longer controlled by the old guard , but when a story like this suddenly shows up , they have no choice but to cover it .
And that they did .
Jon Stewart did a wonderfully humorous two - part series on this ridiculous fear - mongering :
In the second part he uses humor to raise an awkward subject that everyone is starting to think about — could it be possible that the criminal cartel would have done this deliberately ?
By masking it as comedy , the thought goes out there , while everyone can just laugh it off .
Since Alex Jones has gotten so extremely popular on the Internet , there ’s no doubt that the ‘ Jason Jones ’ character — from the “ Center For Stuff I Heard From Some Guy ” — is meant to be a hilarious parody … and it works !
Of course , the criminal cartel hopes that you ’ll be as traumatized , terrified and fearful from their ‘ Pandemic ’ as you were from 9/11 .
A little “ Shock and Awe ” to jolt you into a complete amnesia about everything that happened before That Day .
TRY TO PIN IT ON YOUR ENEMY …
But hey , why stop there ?
Triggering fears of a mass pandemic — the next 9/11 — is still not enough .
Let ’s give everyone , and particularly those damn liberals in New York , a good reminder of 9/11 .
Let ’s make it really simple for them to put two and two together —
This Flu Thing is the Next 9/11 !
How could we do that ?
Hmm … all right , I ’ve got it !
Let ’s fly a frickin’ PLANE right through the middle of New York , at a very low altitude — right around the Statue of Liberty !
Let ’s have the plane followed by an F - 16 — so everyone thinks it ’s been hijacked , and is about to be shot down !
That ’ll scare the livin ’ pants off of ’em !
That ’s great !
That way , everybody will start thinking about 9/11 again — and realize that the new 9/11 is here with the Swine Flu Pandemic !
No , wait , wait , wait …
DUDE !
I ’ve got an even better idea !
What if we use one of the President ’s own planes — Air Force One — and try to get the public to blame all of this on him !
Oh my God !
Dude , that is SWEET !
Let ’s do it !
Ha ha ha ha ha !!…
The Obama Haters Will Never Even Bother to Read the Articles Proving He Had Nothing to Do With It and Was Furious !!
AWESOME !!!
Notice that when Fox wrote about it , there was not so much as a word suggesting that the Obama administration had in any way opposed this .
In fact , they directly suggest he did it himself to scare people … what an evil , evil man :
Officials say the Boeing 747 is used by President Barack Obama and called Air Force
One when he ’s aboard .
Then , of course , you have this handy little poll off to the right of the same article … we need to find out just how scared everyone really is about Our Last Hope , the Swine Flu .
If only 843 people answered , and not even half of them are scared , hmm … we might have a problem :
EVEN STEWART DIDN ’T GET IT RIGHT AWAY
It came out pretty quickly that Obama not only had nothing to do with this , but was furious about it .
Yet , Jon Stewart had worked up a bit about the whole thing before that ever became clear :
HERE’S THE PROBLEM …
Obviously , the old guard has not completely lost power .
They still control parts of the Defense Department , including the backup Air Force One jet .
The problem with this ridiculous attempt to pin this all on Obama is that he DID say he was furious — it DID make it into the news .
A member of the Old Guard may well have to take a bullet for this one — but they ’ve got nothing to lose at this point , so why not ?
Read :
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/nyregion/28plane.html?_r=1&em
Later , aides told reporters that President Obama was furious about the flyover when it was brought to his attention .
The White House Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , conveyed the president ‘s anger in a meeting with the director of the White House Military Office , Louis Caldera , who issued the apology .
“ Last week , I approved a mission over New York .
I take responsibility for that decision , ” Mr. Caldera said .
“ While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey , it ‘s clear that the mission created confusion and disruption .
I apologize and take responsibility for any distress that flight caused . ”
PEOPLE ARE FIGURING IT OUT
As this commenter on Huffington Post writes , the people ARE figuring it out :
Comment from vabeachnet on Huffington Post :
This event sounds a lot like one of Cheney ’s “ moles ” wreaking havoc in the Obama White House .
The DOD is where Cheney has most of his moles stashed , and it would only have taken a couple of them to pull off this idiotic stunt .
There is no way that even a 1st Grader would have failed to realize the reaction people would have had to this .
This has Cheney written all over it .
The GOP is DESPERATE , and that is when they are at their most dangerous .
They are likely to say or do ANYTHING they think will hurt the Obama White House .
CONTINUE INTO PART THREE
In the eight or so years since the original Ratchet and Clank was released on the PlayStation 2 , I 've learned that there 's more to life than collecting items , powering up outlandish weaponry , and unleashing mayhem upon hordes of enemies .
There 's also a fair amount of platforming .
These ingredients have been staples of the Ratchet series since its inception , but like a seasoned chef , Insomniac has added just the right amount of each to concoct a treat that will keep you satisfied until your last bolt - ridden bite .
Ratchet and Clank Future : A Crack in Time is the series ' third installment on the PlayStation 3 and picks up where the previous two games left off .
Our little robot friend Clank has been abducted and hidden away by some adorable , mysterious beings known as the Zoni .
His Lombax compatriot Ratchet , the apparent last of his race , is teamed up with the egomaniacal , would - be - galactic - savior Captain Qwark .
It 's quickly revealed that the naive Zoni have been working for the robotic madman Dr. Nefarious who needs Clank to access the temporal powers of a device known as the Great Clock .
With Clank locked away inside this celestial timepiece , Ratchet begins his adventure to save his friend , the world , and time itself .
Clank has his own demons to fight throughout the game .
The action is as plentiful as the upgrades .
Do n't be fooled , this is all highly organized .
With the team separated from the start , you 'll play the majority of the game alternating between Ratchet and Clank .
Ratchet handles most of the heavy action and fighting as he travels the galaxy , while Clank focuses more on solving puzzles inside the Great Clock .
The game will transition from one character to the other after key missions have been completed , and it all flows smoothly .
Though Ratchet is occasionally joined by Qwark , or another fighter , he will mostly be fighting hordes of enemies aided solely by his weapons ... his many , many , ridiculous weapons .
The Ratchet and Clank games have always included a sizable arsenal , but A Crack in Time has some of the most unique , useful , and satisfying ways to kill or incapacitate your foes yet .
You 'll see the return of some favorites , like the always entertaining , boogie - inducing Groovitron Glove , but you 'll also be treated to suchas the Rift Inducer 5000 .
This little number happens to be a device that tears open a dimensional portal allowing a tentacled beast to peek through and devour your enemies for a limited time .
Honestly , I only found a few duds in the mix ( I 'm looking at you Dynamo of Doom ) and by constantly giving you the chance to upgrade your weapons through continued use , the game encourages you to experiment with new ones .
Upgrading is a huge part of the game and each weapon can reach a maximum level of five , at which point it will transform into a slightly modified , and better version of its former self .
For example , continually using Mr. Zurkon -- a minuscule floating robotic helper bent on destruction -- will eventually transform him into Zurkon the Destroyer .
Each time you reach a new level with a weapon , stats like damage or rate of fire will increase , and the leveling comes so quickly that you constantly feel like you 're progressing towards some goal as you mow down the endless hordes of baddies .
Upgrades for your arsenal will also come in the form of new components for your Constructo weapons .
These include the Constructo Pistol , Shotgun , and Bomb .
Each can be fitted with parts that you 'll collect throughout the adventure , allowing you to toggle between attributes like the rapid fire or charge triggers on the pistol .
These modifications drastically affect the properties of each weapon and you 'll be mixing and matching them to your liking .
With all the options available on the Constructo weapons , I found them to be my go - to choice when I was n't giggling at robots dancing or summoning inter- dimensional beings to do my bidding .
Did I mention upgrades ?
Ratchet will also be upgrading his ship with new lasers , missiles , and armor as he flies around the galaxy searching for his little robotic buddy .
When you 're not running around planet - side , wreaking havoc , you can now pilot your ship freely through defined sectors of space engaging in combat or landing on the many smaller planets to find more collectibles .
All of the space travel and combat is locked to a horizontal plane , so instead of being able to pitch your ship up or down , your evasive maneuvering is limited to barrel rolls and 180 degree turns .
Most of the non-terrestrial combat is n't terribly engaging , but the ability to take optional missions and land your ship on the planetoids to hunt down collectibles is a welcome inclusion .
While Ratchet is tearing about the universe , Clank will be engaging in his own subtler methods of world saving .
He 'll be using his newly acquired time - shifting abilities to navigate and solve puzzles within the Great Clock .
The most devious of these time - and - mind - bending obstacles are the ones that require you to record multiple versions of yourself as you race to trigger different events around the room .
A simple example would begin with recording your movements with Clank A . You position Clank A to stand on a pressure plate that , when depressed , allows access to another button in the distance .
You would then end that recording and start a new one with Clank B , during which you can watch as Clank A goes about his prerecorded business of clearing the way for you to access that distant button .
The complexity quickly ramps up and you 'll eventually have up to four versions of yourself all running around performing tasks that somehow aid the other recordings .
If that sounds complicated , it is , but it's also extremely rewarding and once you 've completed a puzzle you will not only be showered with bolts , the currency of this universe , but you 'll also feel like the smartest human on the planet .
If you truly are not feeling up to the task , you can opt to bypass the puzzle entirely , but will miss out on the monetary rewards as well as the boost to your ego .
All of this puzzle solving and item collection takes place in one of the more visually stunning games to date .
The environments are brightly colored , interestingly designed , and well realized .
The animators over at Insomniac must be some of the best in the business because all the characters move with a fluidity and appropriately cartoonish exaggeration rarely seen in video games .
The level of quality and care taken is present in everything from the rendered cutscenes to the Groovitron dances .
Complimenting the visuals is the sound design which is also top notch .
From the voice acting to the music , the audio breathes life into an already living world and serves to draw you into the rich experience .
While the humor in the game falls more on the corny side , I definitely found myself chuckling at some of the gags , and it all seems to gel with the rest of the presentation .
The story may not be the most enthralling but it 's told well and it will help to keep you curious as you progress through the game .
Playing through on normal , and collecting a majority of items , I was able to complete my first playthrough at around eleven hours .
After you 're finished you 'll have the option to go back and find all the goodies you missed along the way or restart in the Challenge Mode with all your existing weapons and upgrades .
With A Crack in Time apparently marking the end of the " Future " storyline on the PlayStation 3 , I really could n't ask for a better embodiment of everything I 've come to enjoy from the series .
The constant satisfaction from upgrading creative weaponry , item collection which feels rewarding rather than trivial , and the over - the - top action are all here , and better than they 've ever been .
With the addition of some interesting puzzles , even more flexibility with your weapons , and a great presentation , Ratchet and Clank Future : A Crack in Time is not only the best game in the series , but one that will certainly stand the test of , well , time .
Thousands give Top Gear 's James May a helping hand with Lego brick house
Thousands of people today answered Top Gear presenter James May 's call for help building a new house entirely out of Lego bricks - which the TV star has vowed to live in when it is finished .
A total of 1,200 were granted free tickets to the vineyard where the two - storey building is being constructed , leaving 1,500 people to be turned away .
Some queued from 4.30 am this morning , five hours before tickets were handed out .
The fans and Lego enthusiasts came from all over the UK to the building site at the Denbies Wine Estate in Dorking , Surrey .

May sits among a pile of Lego shapes which have been made of individual bricks .
Three million will be used to build a house which the presenter has vowed to live in for a few days
Little helper : Around 1,200 people have been helping May build a house entirely out of Lego bricks
Speaking from the vineyard , Mr May said : " The idea first came up over a beer , when we were talking about what we would have built as kids if we had enough Lego .
" Your imagination is always bigger than your stockpile when you 're a kid .
" Up until now , the largest thing I 've ever built with Lego was probably a plane or a battleship , because that was all I could build with the amount I had . "
When the house , filled with Lego furniture , is completed later this month , May has promised to live in it .
He said : " I 'm planning to stay there for two or three days , or until it falls down - whichever is sooner .
I 'm pretty relaxed about it , but will just have to be careful moving around .
" If I wake up buried under a pile of bricks I 'll know it 's gone wrong . "
Brick by brick :
More than three million Lego pieces have been delivered to the site
Billy Homan , five , gazes at a pile of Lego bricks as he prepares to help build the house
More than three million Lego pieces have been delivered to the site .
Today 's helpers were tasked with making full sized bricks , each one consisting of 272 Lego pieces .
May said a total of 2,000 bricks would be made by the end of the day .
Builders will then take over in laying the bricks over a six - day construction process .
Scientists have entangled light of three different colors .
In the set - up , the optical parametric oscillator ( center ) is pumped by a coherent light source , producing three light fields of different wavelengths ( green , red , and orange arrows ) .
Entanglement is verified using an analysis cavity for each beam , and the golden rings illustrate the tripartite entanglement among the optical fields .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
For the first time , physicists have demonstrated the quantum entanglement of three light beams , all of different wavelengths .
Entanglement of two light beams of different wavelengths has already been demonstrated , but the researchers explain that going beyond two beams is important since three beams can serve as connections at the nodes of a quantum network .
The team of scientists , from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil , and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light and the University of Erlangen - Nuremberg , both in Erlangen , Germany , has published their results in a recent issue of Science Express .
“ We generate directly a higher order of entanglement among bright beams of light ( in general , continuous variable systems ) , enabling us to entangle light of different colors , ” Paulo Nussenzveig of the University of Sao Paulo told PhysOrg.com .
The physicists are working toward the goal of building a quantum information network , in which entangled light beams convey information from one place to another .
Although quantum entanglement is expected to greatly speed up information processing , currently several technological challenges remain .
For instance , quantum resources are fragile and undergo decoherence when interacting with the surrounding environment , which is harmful for applications .
As the physicists explain , a variety of physical systems will likely be combined to perform quantum information tasks .
However , since these diverse systems lack a means of connection , they need a way to join together at the nodes of the quantum network .
With this problem in mind , the physicists have investigated using different frequencies of light to connect different components of a quantum network .
“ The most investigated systems are trapped ions , superconducting flux qubits , quantum dots , polaritons , and others , ” Nussenzveig said .
“ Most have specific advantages and other disadvantages .
In our view , one could envisage applications to start in hybrid systems , taking advantage of the best characteristics of each of these pieces of quantum hardware . “
As Nussenzveig explained , light is the best candidate to convey quantum information .
However , light - matter information exchange cannot take place for light of any frequency .
In general , these material systems interact with light at particular resonance frequencies .
“ Let 's say we would like to convey the information stored in a collection of rubidium atoms to some far node in a quantum network , ” he said .
“ The atoms interact with light at 780 nm , a wavelength that does not propagate very efficiently through optical fibers .
So , we would like to change the wavelength of light that will convey the information to 1,550 nm .
On the other end , we would like to store the information in a quantum dot , resonant at 800 nm .
Three - color entangled light could do that job ( not with our present set - up , but it is a proof - of - principle ) . ”
To generate entanglement with three wavelengths ( colors ) of light , the physicists used an optical parametric oscillator ( OPO ) .
The OPO , which consists of a cooled crystal inside a cavity , oscillates at different frequencies , and can convert one input wave into two longer - wavelength output waves in a process called parametric down - conversion .
When the beam reached the OPO , it was converted into two beams , while the original pump beam was recovered after interacting with the crystal inside the cavity .
The resulting pair of down - converted modes ( twin beams ) possessed strong correlations among its two parts , as well as with the mode that gave birth to them .
The scientists verified tripartite entanglement among these three light modes , and showed that the wavelengths of the beams could be tuned by constraining the phase variations of the three fields .
Here , the wavelengths of the three light beams were 532 nm , 1,062 nm , and 1,066 nm .
When assessing the robustness of the tripartite entanglement , the researchers found that sometimes the light modes quickly become disentangled , an effect reminiscent of so - called entanglement sudden death .
This disentanglement could be harmful for quantum communications applications , such as information networks .
However , the scientists also found that the effect does n’t occur for all oscillation frequencies .
This interesting result reveals that robustness of entanglement can change , indicating that entangled states are not all of the same nature .
The scientists predict that this disentanglement should be observable in other continuous variable systems , and serves as a reminder that much is still unknown about the nature and dynamics of quantum entanglement .
“ Most people think that we already know ( almost ) all there is to know about entanglement of Gaussian states , ” Nussenzveig said .
“ But we 've observed two Gaussian states , both presenting tripartite entanglement , which have a different robustness with respect to channel losses .
They clearly have different properties : why is that so ?
How can we tell , beforehand , if a certain Gaussian entangled state will be robust or not ?
We believe there are still fundamental issues that remain to be understood : the sudden death we observed is an indicator of this necessity . ”

WASHINGTON  Former Vice President Dick Cheney denied in an interview with a special prosecutor investigating the C.I.A. leak case that he had played any role in the disclosure of the identity of Valerie Wilson as an intelligence officer , according to F.B.I. documents released Friday .
Some of the assertions by Mr. Cheney in his interview with the prosecutor on May 8 , 2004 , appeared to conflict with testimony at the 2007 trial of his chief of staff , I. Lewis Libby Jr. , who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice and whose sentence was later commuted by President George W. Bush .
The interview documents were made public through a lawsuit brought by the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , and included a 28 - page typewritten summary of the interview with the prosecutor , Patrick J. Fitzgerald , and copies of handwritten notes taken by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
In a statement , the organization said Mr. Cheney had displayed “ an astonishing inability to recollect even simple facts . ”
Mr. Cheney said in the interview that he could not recall how or when he had learned of Ms. Wilson ’s identity and that he could not recall discussing it with Mr. Libby .
Mr. Cheney denied knowing who , if anyone , at the White House had talked to the columnist Robert Novak about Ms. Wilson ’s identity .
He said he did not know of any reporters who might have been given this information before it was disclosed in Mr. Novak ’s column on July 14 , 2003 .

Imagine what the landscape would look like if Sprint and T - Mobile USA formed a partnership – the balance of power may change after rumors about Deutsche Telekom placing a bid for the third largest wireless carrier .
There are many complications that can prevent such a deal to go through – the complete difference in wireless technology ( GSM versus CDMA ) is what stands out the most .
Now there are reports about T - Mobile USA in talks with Clearwire for a potential partnership .
Now this move makes a bit more sense because T - Mobile USA has yet to come into agreement as to what standard they will choose for their 4G network .
Last in the race to get 3G up to speed here in the US , partnering with Clearwire would place them at an advantage partly because Clearwire already has an established WiMAX infrastructure .
On the flip side , Clearwire would gain additional capital to continue building out its network across the country – providing a dominant footprint for themselves .
While Sprint owns 51 percent of Clearwire , it would be difficult to see what will transpire between all the talks .
Deutsche Telekom has already committed to taking on LTE for its 4G network – while T - Mobile USA is still in limbo about a decision to where they should move.via mocoNews
These days , everyone in the world seems to be on Facebook , including our bosses , parents , and the people we hated in high school .

Chavez returns toVenezuela following the defeat of the April 2002 coup .
Venezuela 's private media actively supported the coup with lies and distortions .
By Eric Toussaint , translated by Francesca Denley and Judith Harris
October 21 , 2009 --
It may be useful to assess the dangers of the systematically hostile attitude of the overwhelming majority of major European and North American media companies to the current events taking place in Ecuador , Bolivia and Venezuela .
This hostility is only matched by an embarrassed , complicit silence towards those involved in the putsch in Honduras and the repression of the Peruvian army against the Indigenous populations of the Amazon .
To demonstrate this , here are a few recent facts :
1 ) On June 5 , 2009 , the Peruvian army massacred more than 50 Amazonian Indians who were protesting against the land concessions made by President Alan Garcia ’s government for foreign , mainly European transnational companies .
The repression aroused no disapproval among the major global media groups .
These groups gave almost exclusive priority to the protests occurring in Iran .
Not only did the press fail to condemn the repression in Peru , it did not even bother to cover the story .
And yet in Peru , so great was public discontent that the government had to announce the repeal of the presidential decree which the Amazonian Indians had fought against .
Once again , media coverage of the government ’s backtracking was almost non-existent .
We must ask ourselves the following question : if a Venezuelan or Ecuadorian army or police intervention had caused the deaths of dozens of Amazonian Indians , what kind of media coverage would such events have received ?
2 ) When the constitutionally elected president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , was ousted by the military on June 28 , the overwhelming majority of media groups declared , in total contradiction of the truth , that the soldiers were reacting to Zelaya ’s attempt to modify the constitution , thus ensuring he could remain in power .
Several media groups added that he was following the example of Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez , who is presented as an authoritarian populist leader .
In fact , Zelaya was proposing to Honduran citizens that they vote in favour of a general election for a constituent assembly , which would have represented real democratic progress .
This is well explained by Cécile Lamarque and Jérôme Duval on their return from a CADTM mission to Honduras :
The coup d’Etat was carried out on the same day Manuel Zelaya had organised a non-binding “ consultation ” asking the Hondurans whether or not they wanted to convene a National Constituent Assembly , after the elections which were due to take place on the 29 November 2009 .
The question went like this : “ Do you agree that at the next general elections of 2009 , a fourth ballot box be installed so as to allow for the people to express their point of view on the convocation of a national Constituent Assembly ?
YES or NO ? ”
If this consultation had resulted in the majority voting “ yes ” , the president would have issued a decree of approval before Congress so that , on November 29 , the Hondurans would formally make known their decision on the convocation of a Constituent Assembly through this “ fourth ballot box ” ( the first three ballot boxes would be for the election of a president , MPs and mayors , respectively ) .
In order to give an air of legality to the coup , Congress and the Supreme Court , associated with the putsch , deemed the ballot box to be illegal and asserted that president Zelaya had “ violated the constitution ” by trying to modify it “ so as to set his sights on serving a new mandate ” , in the manner of an “ apprentice Chavist dictator ” .
And yet , Manuel Zelaya , through this consultation with the people , was not seeking to renew his presidential mandate of four years which can not be renewed .
Zelaya would therefore be unable to be a candidate for his own succession .
Whilst the popular movements opposing those involved in the putsch increased , with protests and strikes in July , August and September , the big international media only dedicated a couple of lines to these events .
On the rare occasions when leading daily newspapers dedicated a feature article to the situation in Honduras , they adopted a policy of slander against the constitutionally elected president by presenting the military ’s actions as a democratic military coup .
This is the case with the Wall Street Journal , which in its editorial on July 1 , 2009 , wrote , “ the military coup d’etat which took place in Honduras on June 28th and which led to the exile of the president of this Central American country , Manuel Zelaya , is strangely democratic ” .
The editorial adds , “ the legislative and judicial authorities will remain intact ” following military action .
On its part , perhaps in a more subtle manner , the famous French newspaper Le Monde participated in a smear campaign against Manuel Zelaya .
Here is one example .
On September 12 , 2009 , Jean - Michel Caroit , the newspaper ’s special correspondent in Honduras , quoted the words of a French expatriate living in the country and then associated these words with the systematically repeated lie regarding Zelaya ’s supposedly sinister intentions , “ ‘ For the Hondurans , Zelaya ’s return is unacceptable as that would mean there would be twenty years of a Chavez - style dictatorship , ’ states Marianne Cadario in reference to the Venezuelan president who -- as his ally Manuel Zelaya tried to do ( underlined by author ) -- modified the Constitution in order for him to be allowed to be re-elected .
Marianne Cadario , a Frenchwoman who has lived in Honduras for over thirty years , states that she is “ very shocked by the reaction of the international community who condemned the putsch . ”
The tone of newspapers like Le Monde and Libération began to change at the end of September after those involved in the putsch began to increase their repressive measures .
The tone became more critical of those involved in the putsch .
Having said this , the daily newspaper Libération deserves a prize for its use of euphemisms .
In fact on September 28 , 2009 ( three months to the day after the coup ) the title “ The Scent of Dictatorship ” ( underlined by author ) of a paragraph explaining how the government involved in the putsch had declared , “ ‘ the banning of “ any public unauthorised meeting , ” the arrest of “ anyone putting their lives or anyone else ’s in danger ” “ evacuation ” of areas where there are protesters and those who interfere with “ any broadcasting of programmes by any media that endanger public order . ”
3 ) At the beginning of August 2009 , Venezuela ’s authorities ’ intention to question the right of 34 radio and television channels made headlines in the international press .
The way in which the major news publications treat the subject of the media in Venezuela is one of unilateral hostility , despite the fact that 90 % of Venezuela ’s media is privately owned , a large number of which actively support disinformation campaigns .
Globovisión , one of the main privately owned TV channels , actively participated in the military coup d’etat against Chavez on April 11 , 2002 .
A documentary made by Globovisión made its way around the world on April 11 , 2002 , and the days following the military coup .
It was actually a set - up , designed to distort the truth .
One can see people posing as Chavez supporters on a bridge , firing their guns in an unidentifiable direction .
The voiceover of the Globovisión journalist states that the Chavez supporters are about to kill opposition protesters who were protesting peacefully in the streets below the bridge .
The Venezuelan prosecution has been able to reconstruct the exact chain of events , having analysed the reports and photographs made by certain individuals on the day of April 11 .
In fact , the pro-Chavez militants , who according to Globovisión were shooting at protesters , were actually responding to gunfire coming from an armoured vehicle of the metropolitan police , allied to the putsch .
The opposition protesters were no longer in the streets when those guns were fired .
Several sources can prove without a doubt that the assassination of the anti-Chavez protesters was used as a set - up so as to attribute these crimes to Chavez , thus justifying their coup .
On April 11 , 2008 , Venezuelan viewers were able to see again the images of the press conference given by the military involved in the putsch at a time when no protester had yet been killed .
And yet the military announced at that time that they were taking power following the murders carried out by Chavez supporters .
This clearly supports the theory that these murders were planned deliberately so as to justify their seditious plan .
More recently , Globovisión has been sympathetic towards the authors of the June 28 putsch in Honduras .
Several program presenters at Globovisión supported the putsch from the very beginning , at the same time accusing the Chavez government of interference in condemning it .
For example , Guillermo Zuloaga , the president of Globovisión , stated on July 17 that “ the government of Micheletti complies with the Constitution , and we would like , indeed we would be delighted , if here in Venezuela , the Constitution was respected in the same way that it is in Honduras ” , thus making clear his support for the putschist government .
Globovisión has never been prohibited from broadcasting .
What major European or North - American media has even mentioned this fact ?
What major European or North - American media has ever informed the public that the overwhelming majority of Venezuela ’s media are controlled by the private sector ?
Or that they capture more than 90 % of the viewing audience ?
Or that they are extremely aggressive towards the government , presenting it as a dictatorship , or that some of them played an active part in ousting a constitutionally elected president , and have continued to broadcast freely for seven years ?
Can one imagine General de Gaulle failing to take repressive measures against a newspaper , radio or TV station that was seen to actively support a coup during the Algerian war ?
Would it not be considered normal for the Spanish government to take measures against the media that actively supported – in real time – Colonel Tejero when he burst into the Cortes with a group of military putschists and held at gunpoint the MPs who were there ?
If Manuel Zelaya were restored to office as constitutional president , would he and his government not be in their right to demand accountability and take measures against the Honduran media owners who deliberately supported the putschists by systematically detorting the truth and covering up the human rights violations committed by the military ?
4 ) When you read the European or North American newspapers , you get the distinct impression that Venezuela is indulging in huge arms expenditures ( particularly by way of Russia ) , which poses a serious threat in the region .
Yet according to the CIA the situation is quite different : Venezuela ’s military budget ranks 6th in the region , after Brazil , Argentina , Chile ( far less populated than Venezuela and regarded as a model ) , Colombia and Mexico .
In relative terms , taking the GDP of each country , the Venezuelan military budget comes 9th in Latin America !
Is any of this published in the leading news publications ?
On another front , in August 2009 , we read in the newspapers that Sweden took Venezuela to task after the Colombian government once again denounced its neighbour for supplying arms to the FARC guerillas .
Sweden had in fact informed Colombia that SAAB missiles found in a FARC camp had been supplied by Venezuela .
But for those who read Hugo Chavez ’s detailed response , it became clear that the missiles in question had been stolen from a Venezuelan harbour in 1995 , four years before Chavez became president .
Conclusion
One needs to be aware of the one - sided manner in which the leading international capitalist media report the news , and adopt a highly critical approach when appraising it .
The discrediting of Hugo Chavez , Rafael Correa and Evo Morales is so excessive that it poses the risk of numbing international public opinion in the event of another coup d’etat , or of lulling the public into approving aggressive measures taken by a government such as the US .
Among the many insidious and unfounded accusations , we can read in the Spanish papers ( for example in El Pais ) that Rafael Correa ’s election campaign was financed by the FARC .
We can also read that Venezuela ’s authorities do nothing to fight drug trafficking .
In the case of the Honduran president Manuel Zelaya , the discredit heaped on him is intended to prevent international opinion mobilising in favour of his return to power as head of State .

Notes
DAMASCUS -- Saudi King Abdullah al Saud is expected to make a rare visit to Syria this week to increase pressure on Syrian leader Bashar al Assad to loosen his alliance with Iran and strengthen Arab consensus on regional political and security issues , according to Saudi officials .
The summit would be the first trip to Damascus by the Saudi ruler since he took power in 2005 .
It culminates months of quiet diplomacy by the oil - rich Arab nation , U.S. and European officials who see Syria as a linchpin to curbing the influence of ...
Rep. Alan Grayson's ( D - Fla . ) derogatory takedown of Bernanke aide drew rebukes from both sides of the aisle Monday night .
Grayson goes too far for colleagues
Republicans and Democrats slammed Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) for calling Linda Robertson , an adviser to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , a “ K Street whore ” in a month - old radio interview that circulated on Capitol Hill Monday night .
“ There ’s no call for that language .
No call for it .
That ’s absurd .
If he was standing here now , I ’d say that to him , ” said Rep. Bill Pascrell ( D - N.J . )
Advertisement
“ He ’s out of control , ” added Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , who is vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference .
The remarks are the latest to surface in a string of controversial statements by Grayson , who said on the Alex Jones radio show that he believes Robertson , a former Enron lobbyist , is not qualified to pass judgment on intricate financial matters .
It ’s clear that his colleagues ’ opinion of him has suffered .
“ Is this news to you that this guy ’s one fry short of a Happy Meal ? ” asked Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y . )
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer defended Robertson , whom he said he knows .
" I think it 's inappropriate and unfair , " the Maryland Democrat said .
He decried the " heated rhetoric " that he said interferes with the ability solve problems .
Late last month , Grayson said Republicans ’ health care plans were for Americans to “ die quickly . ”
Grayson , who is Jewish , later earned reproach from the Anti-Defamation League for referring to the health care system as a “ holocaust in America . ”
More recently , Republicans complained that a Website he created and promoted on the House floor – www.namesofthedead.com – had links to both his official House Web site and his campaign site .
He later removed the link to his campaign site .
Grayson , who did not vote on Monday , has shown no sign of backing down .
Todd Jurkowski , Grayson ’s spokesman , declined comment other than to confirm that the interview occurred .
Democrat Dina Titus of Nevada called Grayson ’s remarks “ a bit extreme and rather sexist . ”
One way of dealing with record budget deficits , besides raising taxes , is to actually collect taxes .
The IRS is opening new offices in Beijing , Panama City and Sydney , to focus on funds flowing out of Europe and into Asia , in part because of a heightened focus on international enforcement in Europe , Shulman said .
The IRS has already gone after the biggest Swiss bank in court , and succeeded in getting lots of names :
The U.S. government has already opened cases against about 150 clients of UBS AG , names it obtained when the Swiss bank paid $ 780 million to settle a criminal suit in February after admitting it helped Americans skirt the law .
Seems they were just getting started :
" The IRS has new momentum in this entire area and in the coming months our efforts will only intensify , " IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said on Wednesday .
Are they really serious about this ?
Well , just ask the rich :
" The IRS has done a very good job of scaring the hell out of everybody , " said Ken Rubinstein , a lawyer with his own firm who counsel clients in tax matters .
He said he expects more prosecutions to keep the heat on offshore bank customers .
And wealth advisors are " upset " , according to the Wall Street Journal ( via Raw Story ) .
The surest way of knowing whether this is actually a serious effort ?
Rich cheaters are scared and upset .
Works for me .
The US Chamber of Commerce has sued a group of online pranksters for trademark infringement , after these Yes Men floated a fake online press release that mimics the Chamber 's website .
The suit arrived on the heels of Chamber efforts to destroy the online release with a DMCA takedown notice .
After receiving the notice , one ISP removed the release , but it soon reappeared elsewhere .
The faux release first appeared last Monday , announcing that the Chamber had suddenly reversed its Apple - bouncing opposition to greenhouse gas legislation .
The Yes Men even went so far as to host a faux press conference - which was soon raided by the ( real ) Chamber men :
But even after the Yes Men acknowledged the hoax , the press release remained online , and the Chamber could n't help but toss a DMCA takedown at the pranksters ' ISP .
Those net watchdogs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) cried foul over the takedown notice , arguing that parody is protected under copyright law and the US Constitution 's First Amendment .
But we would argue the faux release sits somewhere in a gray area between parody and stark imitation .
" It ’s tough when you start to do street theatre on a computer , " Jonathan Handel , an IP lawyer with the California firm Troy & Gould , tells The Reg .
" There ’s no way of signaling that it ’s a parody . "
In hindsight , the release went a bit over - the - top .
" We at the Chamber have tried to keep climate science from interfering with business .
But without a stable climate , there will be no business .
We need business more than we need relentlessly higher returns , " reads the faux prepared statement from Chamber CEO Thomas J. Donohue .
But many were duped by the release , including a Reuters reporter .
A story based on the faux release soon appeared in The New York Times and The Washington Post .
From a convincing url - www.chamber-of-commerce.us - the release faithfully duplicates the look of the Chamber website , using the Chamber 's logo and others images from the site .
And now the Chamber has filed a suit alleging infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property .
" Defendants had a common plan to engage in acts that violated multiple laws , " the complaint ( PDF ) reads .
" These acts deceived the press and public , and caused injury to the Chamber , while promoting the commercial ventures of certain Defendants who trade under the name ' The Yes Men . '
The acts are nothing less than commercial theft masquerading as social activism . "
Such a trademark suit , Jonathan Handel argues , carries a bit more weight .
" There are doctrines such as fair use and parody in trademark law as there are in copyright , but they 're somewhat narrower and less developed , so the Yes Men seem to me to be on pretty thin ice , " he tells The Reg .
The law protects " transformative " uses of intellectual property - a parody is one example - and with a trademark , transformation is much easier to pinpoint .
" The Yes Men could have made their point by using a mock logo inspired by the Chamber 's and poking fun at the Chamber and its logo .
That could still have been effective .
Instead , they used an exact copy of the Chamber 's logo .
Fair use favors transformative uses , but here there was no transformation . "
The Yes Men declined to discuss the suit , but they provided the following statement : " It 's very disappointing , even to us , that the Chamber would take an approach like this to what is very obviously political criticism . "
And they pointed to the EFF , who has yet to respond to our request for comment .
We have also contacted the Chamber of Commerce to verify that the press release announcing the lawsuit is indeed a press release announcing the lawsuit .
But they too have yet to respond to a request for comment .
The Chamber may or may not have a case .
But you 'd have to say they 're hurting themselves as much as the swashbuckling Yes Men .
The Streisand Effect is , well , in effect .
The Yes Men aimed to expose the Chamber 's blinkered attitudes on climate change .
And their prank grows more successful by the day . ®
In the 16th century , if you could transport it , whatever it was , from of one country and into another , there was no doubt that it could be consumed .
There was free movement of goods and people , the age before planning and passports .
Today , we brag about our free trade , our internationalism , our global outlook , but it is ridiculous .
The world is more segmented by national autarkies now than it was 500 years ago .
My particular outrage today concerns the following height of absurdity .
It turns out the Spain has this highly special ham .
Actually , there ought to be some other word than “ ham ” because it is like no ham I ’ve ever had .
It is made from something called a black - hoofed pig that is fed acorns exclusively and then the meat is prepared and cured for fully 3 years , and it sells for something like $ 400 for a leg of the stuff .
In Spain there are special holders for this leg that allow you to cut of super thin slices as you need them .
The flavor and texture is indescribable .
It is sweet and succulent and there are n’t enough adjectives in the language to explain it .
Of course I was ready to sell my cow - hide shoes to raise the money to buy one of these hams .
But then I had some vague memory that customs has a problem with bringing food in .
Well , that ’s unfortunate of course but I figured that at least I wo n’t have to throw out my clothes and stick a ham in my bag .
I ’ll just order one when I get back to the land of the free and the home of the brave .
So I thought first I would google around for a good Spanish ham company .
Oh there ’s one .
But wait !
There is no option for shipping to the U.S. I went to another company .
Same problem .
Again and again .
What the heck is going on here .
Well , it turns out that you cannot import this ham to the U.S. .
Maybe there is a dodgy smuggling company somewhere that makes it possible .
Maybe the Medellin Cartel is taking up the cause .
But I seem to lack contacts with this outfit .
So I ’m completely stuck as is every other American .
( Here is one place that offers a substitute but you have to engage in some kind of deposit and it seems rather complicated , and one does n’t even end up with the right thing . )
Apparently it has something to do with the U.S. Agriculture bureaucracy .
They do n’t think that this ham is prepared the right away and it might introduce something unhealthy into our system .
And do n’t you just know that those bureaucrats in Washington are sitting around worrying about health and this is why they have to keep us from doing things like importing dangerous hams ?
The U.S. government even publishes a guide to ham safety which I ’m sure you check often .
This is preposterous .
I ’m willing to bet that there is some U.S. ham lobby or something behind this rule .
Can you believe this primitivism ?
In order to have this great food , one has to board an airplane and fly to Spain and book a hotel and go out to eat .
Or you could buy a ham in Spain and camp there for a month , eating it bit by bit .
In this age and in our times !
Actually , if you think about it , there is an inconsistency here .
If the USDA is really so concerned about protecting me from Spanish hams , why does the government allow me to fly here and eat it ?
Should the U.S. just ban all travel to Spain for fear that some citizen somewhere might endanger his precious health by eating a ham ?
Why should it be legal for an American to eat ham in Spain but not the U.S. ?
And maybe too the U.S. should ban anyone from Spain from coming to the U.S. because perhaps the immigrant is a carrier of the ham disease and could infect the whole population .
There was a time when Kings and Princes and Queens would order explorers around the world to bring back spices , vegetables , and meats from all places .
Now our rulers order us not to bring spices , vegetables , and meats from all places but rather to munch only on what can be produced on American soil .
This is not progress .
This is horrible , and it is a general trend .
Look at the tariffs on Argentinian beef , French cheese , and Swiss chocolate ?
We live in age of autarky of sorts , and we not even aware of it .
Like the Soviet Union of old , the American government is trying to keep us all ignorant of the delights available around the world in order to make us more captive and obedient citizens .
Remember how the Russians began to rebel once technology revealed to them the prosperity available outside its borders and around the world ?
I swear to you that if every American could get one taste of the forbidden ham , they too might rebel and for the same reasons the Russians did .
Or everyone might just be forced to flee to Spain the way people from East Germany would leave for the West .
Sparked by Arnold Neumaier ’s work on “ a computer - aided system for real mathematics , ” we had a very stimulating discussion , mostly about various different foundations for mathematics .
But that thread started getting rather long , and John pointed out that people without some experience in formal logic might be feeling a bit lost .
In this post I ’ll pontificate a bit about logic , type theory , and foundations , which have also come up recently in another thread .
Hopefully this too - brief summary of background will make the discussion in the next post about the meaning of structuralism more readable .
( Some of this post is intended as a response to comments on the previous discussions , but I probably wo n’t carefully seek them out and make links . )
At the most basic level , what we do when we do mathematics is manipulate symbols according to specified rules .
Just as in chess the rules state that a knight moves like so and not like so , in mathematics the rules state that a quantifier can be eliminated like so and not like so .
( The opinion that this is all there is to mathematics is called formalism , but I ’m not espousing that .
You are free to believe that these symbols have whatever meaning you want , but even the most Platonist mathematician does mathematics by manipulating symbols on paper . )
Now , the actual rules of the game of mathematics are extremely complicated .
But the idea of foundations is to derive these complicated rules from a much simpler list of fundamental rules .
I think many people would agree that it ’s reasonable to take these fundamental rules to be some sort of calculus of terms .
That is , the game is played with sequences of symbols called terms , and the rules specify what terms are valid and what assertions ( called judgments ) can be made about them .
Here are some sample terms :
x 2 − y 2 x^2-y^2
∫ 0 ∞ e − x 2 dx \int_0 ^\infty e^{-x ^2}\;dx
𝒫 ( 𝒫 ( ℝ ) ) \ mathcal {P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R} ) )
∀ n ≥ 3 . ∀ x . ∀ y . ∀ z . x n + y n ≠ z n \forall n\ge 3 . \ forall x.\ forall y. \ forall z. x^n + y^n
eq z^n
Now many people ( myself included ) believe that there is more than one fundamentally different type of term .
For instance , ∫ 0 ∞ e − x 2 dx \int_0 ^\infty e^{ - x ^2}\ ; dx is a real number , 𝒫 ( 𝒫 ( ℝ ) ) \ mathcal {P}(\mathcal {P}(\mathbb{R} ) ) is a set , and ∀ n ≥ 3 . ∀ x . ∀ y . ∀ z . x n + y n ≠ z n \forall n\ge 3 . \ forall x.\ forall y. \ forall z. x^n + y^n
eq z^n is a claim or a theorem , and it ’s illogical to confuse them ( and makes it harder for a computer to guess what you meant ) .
Thus , the rules should define one or more types , and one of the judgments should be of the form “ t t is a well - formed term of type A A , ” written as t : A t:A .
But if you do n’t believe in types , you can just use a version of these rules where there is only one type , call it ( say ) Thing Thing , and read t :
Thing t: Thing as merely “ t t is a well - formed term . ”
In this way we can build many different “ type theories ” .
Most familiar ones include a special type called Prop Prop of “ propositions ” , and a special type of judgment which asserts that a given proposition ( i.e. a term of type Prop Prop ) is “ true . ”
We generally also include “ logical inference ” rules for constructing complex propositions ( e.g. if φ : Prop \varphi : Prop then ( ∀ x : A . φ ) : Prop ( \forall x:A. \ varphi ) : Prop ) and deducing the truth of propositions ( e.g. if φ \varphi and ψ \psi then also φ ∧ ψ \ varphi\wedge\psi ) .
We may also include “ axioms ” , i.e. propositions φ \varphi such that the judgment “ φ \varphi is true ” can be made unconditionally .
For example , in Peano arithmetic , there are two types N N and Prop Prop , a constant term 0 : N 0:N , a rule that if n : N n:N then s ( n ) : N s(n ) : N , a rule that if n : N n:N and m : N m:N then ( n = m ) : Prop ( n=m ) : Prop , the usual rules of logical inference , and various axioms .
Now if we want a foundation for all of mathematics , of course we need a more powerful theory than these .
But ZFC can also be stated in this style : it has two types Set Set and Prop Prop , rules saying that if x :
Set x : Set and y :
Set y: Set then ( x = y ) : Prop ( x=y ) : Prop and ( x ∈ y ) : Prop ( x\in y ) : Prop , the usual rules of logical inference and a collection of axioms .
The same with ETCS , which it is convenient to write with three types Set Set , Function Function , and Prop Prop .
Especially when we intend a theory like ZFC or ETCS as a foundation for all of mathematics , it is convenient to call the type - theoretic language in which these theories are written the “ meta - language ” or “ meta - theory , ” while ZFC / ETCS is the “ object language ” or “ object theory . ”
Things get a bit confusing because there are various ways to augment type theories .
It ’s common to include type constructors , which allow us to form new types such as A × B A\times B out of types A A and B B .
Then we need an additional judgment T : Type T : Type , so that such a type - constructor is a rule saying that ( for example ) if A : Type A : Type and B : Type B : Type then ( A × B ) : Type ( A\times B ) : Type .
We can also have type - constructors which take terms as input , in addition to types ; these are called dependent types .
When we include exponential or dependent - product types , the complexity and power of the type - theoretic meta - language begins to approach that of the object languages ZFC and ETCS , enabling it itself to serve as a foundation for mathematics .
That is , instead of defining a group to be a set equipped with ( among other things ) a function G × G → G G\times G\to G , we could interpret a group as a type G G equipped with ( among other things ) a term m ( x , y ) : G m( x , y ) : G with free variables x : G x:G and y : G y: G .
Or , which amounts to the same thing , we could change our terminology so that what we have been calling “ types ” are instead called “ sets . ”
In fact , as Toby has pointed out , it is natural to say that a type theory ( especially one with many type - constructors ) is itself the object - theory in a meta - meta - theory having meta - types ( or “ kinds ” ) such as Type Type , Term Term , and Judgment Judgment .
The point is that words like “ type ” and “ set ” and “ class ” are really quite fungible .
This sort of level - switch is especially important when we want to study the mathematics of type theory , i.e. the mathematical theory of manipulating symbols according to the rules of type theory , analogous to the mathematical theory of moving pieces around on a chessboard according to the usual rules .
When we study type theory in this way , we are doing mathematics , just like when we ’re doing group theory or ring theory or whatever .
It ’s just that our objects of study are called “ types ” , “ terms ” , and so on .
However , what we do in this mathematical theory can , like any other area of mathematics , be formalized in any particular chosen foundation , be it ZFC or ETCS or a type theory at a higher level .
Now the type theory is itself the “ object - theory ” and ZFC is the “ meta - theory ” !
That was syntax , the rules of the game ; semantics is about its “ meaning . ”
Intuitively , we generally think of a type A A as denoting some “ collection ” of “ things ” , and a term t : A t:A as indicating a “ particular one ” of those things .
In order for this to make sense , the type theory has to exist in some metatheory ( which might or might not be formalized ) having a notion of “ set ” to specify the relevant “ collections of things ” .
In particular , there must be a set of types , and for each type there is a set of terms which can be judged to be of that type .
The judgment rules for propositions then become the study of formal logic ; we say that a proposition is “ provable ” or is a “ theorem ” if it can be judged to be true .
Now , a model of this theory assigns a set [ A ] [ A ] ( in the meta - theoretic sense ) to every type A A and a function of appropriate arity to every term , in a way so that the rules and axioms are satisfied .
Thus , for instance , a model of Peano arithmetic consists of a set [ N ] [ N ] , an element [ 0 ] ∈ [ N ] [ 0 ] \in [ N ] , a function [ s ] : [ N ] → [ N ] [ s ] \colon [ N ] \to [ N ] , and so on .
Likewise , a model of the type theory of ZFC ( here the levels get confusing ) consists of a set [ Set ] [ Set ] , a function [ ∈ ] : [ Set ] × [ Set ] → [ Prop ] [ {\in} ] \colon [ Set ] \times [ Set ] \ to [ Prop ] , and so on .
One can then prove , under certain hypotheses , various things about the relationship between syntax and semantics , such as :
The Soundness Theorem : if φ \varphi is a proposition which is provable from the axioms of a theory , then the corresponding statement [ φ ] [ \varphi ] in any model is actually true ( in the sense of the metatheory ) .
Equivalently , if a theory has at least one model , then it does n’t prove a contradiction .
is a proposition which is provable from the axioms of a theory , then the corresponding statement in any model is actually true ( in the sense of the metatheory ) .
Equivalently , if a theory has at least one model , then it does n’t prove a contradiction .
The Completeness Theorem : if [ φ ] [ \varphi ] is true in every model of a theory , then φ \varphi is provable in that theory .
Equivalently , if a theory does n’t prove a contradiction , then it has at least one model .
is true in every model of a theory , then is provable in that theory .
Equivalently , if a theory does n’t prove a contradiction , then it has at least one model .
The ( first ) Incompleteness Theorem : if a theory does n’t prove a contradiction , then there exist statements φ \varphi such that neither φ \varphi nor ¬ φ
ot \varphi is provable in the theory .
such that neither nor is provable in the theory .
Corollary to the completeness and incompleteness theorems : if a theory does n’t prove a contradiction , then it has more than one model .
The “ certain hypotheses ” is where we get into the difference between first - order and higher - order .
We say that a type theory is higher - order if it involves type constructors such as function - types B A B^A ( intended to represent the “ type of all functions A → B A\to B ” ) or power - types P A P A ( intended to represent the “ type of all subtypes of A A ) .
Otherwise it is first - order .
( We have to deal with Prop Prop specially in first - order logic .
If we actually have a type Prop Prop , then the theory should be higher - order , since Prop ≅ P 1 Prop \cong P 1 ; thus in first - order logic we take Prop Prop to be a “ kind ” on the same level as Type Type , which does n’t participate in type operations . )
We say “ second - order ” if we never iterate the power - type operation .
The Soundness Theorem is true for all theories , but the Completeness Theorem is true only for first - order theories .
I believe that the Incompleteness Theorem as I have stated it is true for higher - order theories ( if I ’m wrong , someone please correct me ) , but the corollary fails since the completeness theorem does .
In particular , a higher - order theory can sometimes be categorical in the logician ’s sense : having exactly one model ( at least , up to isomorphism ) .
The second - order version of Peano Arithmetic has this property .
Now at the level we ’re talking about , it seems that there is no fundamental difference between first - order and higher - order theories ; they each have advantages and disadvantages .
However , when we move up to the metalevel and talk about the term calculus itself , we always get a first - order theory .
This is what I was trying to get at when I said elsewhere that higher - order logic has “ no foundational significance ” .
The point is that what we do when we do mathematics is manipulate symbols on paper , and that is a first - order notion .
In particular , higher - order logic does n’t allow you to escape any of the philosophical consequences of the Incompleteness Theorem .
You are free to believe in a Platonic collection of “ actual ” or “ standard ” natural numbers .
( I do n’t really , myself , but I ca n’t argue you out of such an essentially metaphysical belief . )
Now by the corollary to the Incompleteness Theorem , first - order Peano Arithmetic can’t capture those natural numbers uniquely ; there will always be alternate models containing “ nonstandard ” natural numbers .
By contrast , in second - order logic , the second - order versions of the Peano axioms can be shown to have a unique model .
However , this second - order metatheory involves basic notions like “ power - types ” or “ power - sets , ” so really what you ’ve done with this proof is to explain the notion of “ natural number ” in terms of the notion of “ set , ” which is ( I think most people would agree ) far more ontologically slippery !
And indeed , when your second - order metatheory is interpreted in some meta - meta - theory , it will have lots of different models , each of which has its own “ unique ” natural numbers .
You are , of course , also free to believe in a Platonic notion of “ sets , ” but first - order axioms such as ZF ca n’t characterize those either .
There may be a “ second - order ” version of ZF which uniquely characterizes a model , but you ’ve just explained the notion of “ set ” in terms of the notion of “ class , ” which is not much of an improvement .
The initial ZF - algebra in a category of classes is a similar idea .
To put it another way , suppose that you have some Platonic universe of numbers , sets , and so on in mind , but I ’m an alien from another dimension who has a different such Platonic universe in mind .
If I persist in interpreting all of your words like “ number , ” “ set , ” and so on as referring to things in my Platonic universe , there ’s no way you can convince me that I ’m wrong , no matter whether the logic in which we speak is first - order or higher - order .
Now there ’s another way to build a “ canonical ” model of a theory , which is how one usually proves the Completeness Theorem : we make a “ tautological ” model out of the theory itself .
That is , for each type A A we simply take the set [ A ] [ A ] to be the set of terms of type A A with no free variables ( or “ ground terms ” ) .
Without modification , this naive idea fails for two reasons .
First of all , there might not be enough ground terms .
Some of the axioms of the theory might assert that there exists something with some property , without there being a corresponding term constructor actually producing something with that property .
This is obviously the case for the usual version of ZFC , which has no term constructors at all ( hence no ground terms at all ! ) but lots of axioms that assert the existence of things .
This problem is easily remedied , however , by introducing new constant terms or term constructors into the language .
The second problem is that we may not know how to define all the necessary relations on the ground terms in order to have a model .
Suppose , for instance , we have a couple of ground terms t 1 t_1 and t 2 t_2 in some augmented version of ZFC ; how can we tell whether t 1 ∈ t 2 t_1 \in t_2 should hold in our tautological model ?
Certainly if the axioms of the theory imply t 1 ∈ t 2 t_1 \in t_2 , then it should hold , and if they imply t 1 ∉ t 2 t_1
otin t_2 , then it should n’t , but they might not imply either one .
The usual way to remedy this is to enumerate all such statements and one by one decide arbitrarily whether to make them true or false in the model we ’re constructing .
This works , but the model we get ( though small , even countable , and concrete ) is n’t really canonical ; we had to make a bunch of arbitrary choices .
In the case of Peano Arithmetic , we can avoid introducing new constant terms and obtain a model which is “ canonical ” and in fact the “ smallest ” in some sense : it consists of the terms s ( s ( … ( s ( 0 ) ) … ) ) s( s( \dots ( s(0 ) ) \dots ) ) , which can of course be identified with “ the ” natural numbers in the meta - theory .
( Note that talking about “ the set of terms ” always depends on the meta - theory having something that it calls the natural numbers , so that terms can be defined inductively . )
But I do n’t think this is true for many other theories .
Suppose , for instance , that we augment ZF with term constructors for all of its existence axioms .
Let φ \varphi be a sentence independent of ZF ; then our term - constructor for the axiom of separation gives us a term { ∅ | φ } \{\emptyset | \varphi\} .
Does the relation ∅ ∈ { ∅ | φ } \emptyset \in \{\emptyset | \varphi\} hold in the term model ?
We have to make an arbitrary choice .
There ’s a slicker categorial approach which does produce a really canonical model , but only with an expanded notion of “ model ” : instead of each [ A ] [ A ] being a set , we take it to be an object of some fixed category 𝒮 \mathcal {S} with enough structure .
We can then build a much more “ tautological ” model because we have the freedom to build the category 𝒮 \mathcal {S} along with the model .
In the resulting model , the true statements are precisely the statements provable in the theory , and it ’s even initial among all models of the theory in the appropriate sort of category .
In conclusion :
By Elli Leadbeater
Their jaws spring shut at more than 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) - the fastest recorded speed at which an animal can move its predatory body parts .
The pictures also reveal these tiny creatures , native to Central and South America , do more with their vicious jaws than simply giving a nasty nip .
By biting the ground , the ants hurl themselves upwards when danger looms .
A frosty reception
Uninvited visitors to a nest of trap - jaw ants can expect a vicious response .
The ants are named after their characteristically long jaws , which they use to hurl unfamiliar neighbours from their nests , cripple prey , or deliver a brutal bite to anything they consider a threat .
Employing the same high - speed imaging methods as those used to film flying bullets , an American research team now shows that the jaws can move at exceptional speeds .
Peak velocities exceed 180 km/h ( 110mph )
" This is really by far and away the fastest recorded animal limb movement , " said lead researcher Sheila Patek , of the University of California , Berkeley , who worked with ants from Costa Rica .
" The ants ' jaws are relatively short , but they deliver such a powerful bite because they can accelerate so quickly .
It 's simple physics . "
Airborne antics
The new findings , reported this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also explain why the ants sometimes bounce into the air when they bite .
" If they bite something which is too hard to be crushed or thrown back by their jaws , the impact tosses them upwards , " said Dr Andy Suarez of the University of Illinois , a co-author in the study .
This recoil effect propels the biter on to a brief , haphazard flight which ends in a crash landing several centimetres away .
Such a chaotic journey might seem uncomfortable , but the ants are simply too light to be injured by their misadventures .
In fact , Dr Patek and her team have now shown that the ants sometimes perform the flights voluntarily .
The ants ' jaws are multipurpose tools
The impact throws their tiny bodies upwards .
In effect , the ants are using their enormous bite force as a means to suddenly take off .
This novel way to move may help them to escape predators such as lizards , which attack very quickly and would not be discouraged by a simple bite .
The popcorn - effect of many ants jumping at once might also serve to confuse attackers .
" The results show us the surprising and interesting ways in which a single mechanical system can be co-opted for such different behaviours , " says Dr Patek .

Advertisement A Taliban suicide bomber has attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul , killing at least 17 people in a second attack on the building in little over a year .
Afghan officials say a car bomber blew himself up near the Indian embassy and the Afghan interior ministry .
The Taliban said it carried out the attack and the embassy was the target .
Kabul has been attacked regularly in recent months , and the Indian embassy was itself bombed in July 2008 , with dozens of people killed .
Most strikes in the capital target foreign forces or government offices - but civilians are also often killed .
More recently , six Italian soldiers were killed last month in a bomb attack on a military convoy .
' Cleaners killed '
The latest blast hit at 0827 local time ( 0353 GMT ) , as residents were arriving to work .
AT THE SCENE Martin Patience , BBC News , Kabul
The morning rush hour was brought to an instant halt as a car - bomb ripped through the city .
" I heard a gigantic explosion , " Mohammed Naim , a local painter who runs a gallery , told the BBC .
" Everything in my shop fell down on me .
When I got out onto the street , I saw dead bodies and injured people all around me .
It was horrific . "
The insurgents appear to be sending a clear message - we can strike anywhere in Afghanistan .
Read Martin 's report in full India 's Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said the suicide bomber " came up to the outside wall of the embassy with a car loaded with explosives " .
Television pictures showed charred vehicles at the site and ambulances speeding to the location .
An eyewitness , Habib Jan , told the BBC the victims were civilians .
" A [ Toyota ] Corolla car was parked in front of the Indian embassy .
It was rush hour , about 10 minutes after I arrived at the office when we heard an explosion .
" There were lots of workers cleaning the street - most of them have been killed . "
Regional links Nirupama Rao told reporters that she believed the suicide bomb was directed against the Indian embassy .
In July 2008 a suicide bomber rammed a car full of explosives into the gates of the embassy , killing dozens of people and injuring more than 140 .

In pictures : Kabul blast India : Influential Afghan ally India has a strong relationship with Afghanistan , building and managing infrastructure projects in what analysts say is a concerted effort to minimise Pakistani influence in the country .
Analysts say the strength of India 's relationship with Kabul has made it a key target for the country 's Taliban militants , who have historic links with Pakistan .
Afghan officials linked last year 's bombing to an " active intelligence service " - thought to be Pakistan .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in an online statement that Thursday 's attacker was an Afghan man who blew up his vehicle outside the embassy .
The Afghan Interior Ministry said 17 people had died and 63 had been wounded in the latest attack .
Fifteen of the dead were Afghan civilians and one was an Afghan police officer .
The BBC's Martin Patience , in Kabul , says there appears to be a lot of damage at the scene - now sealed off - and that municipal workers have moved into the area with brooms to begin a clean - up .
Growing threat
This is thought to be the fourth bomb attack in Kabul since August .
Until the summer , the Afghan capital was regarded as relatively secure , but that is changing , our correspondent says .
Insurgents are increasingly targeting the capital because of the publicity it attracts .
Militants seem to be able to attack at will in what should be one of the most secure areas of the country , our correspondent adds .
Edrees Kakar , an office worker and freelance journalist , who heard the latest explosion , told the BBC : " These bomb attacks are happening so frequently that people no longer feel safe .
" People are leaving their homes less and less .
We are frustrated and feel we are not getting sufficient help from the international community . "

Aussie film director George Miller says pre-production work will start next week on the latest Mad Max film , which is to be produced in New South Wales .
Thirty years after the release of the original Mad Max , Miller is preparing to head out west for Fury Road - the fourth instalment of the popular franchise .
Filming on Fury Road will begin in NSW in August 2010 .
Casting for the lead role is already underway , but the big question is whether Mel Gibson is set to return as the star .
Miller is staying tight - lipped about who he would like to take the lead .
It is rumoured Australian Sam Worthington and South African actress Charlize Theron could be cast .
" It could be Mel , it could be anyone .
In fact , I 'm looking around at these faces to see if anyone 's quite interesting here , " Miller said at a press conference .
NSW Premier Nathan Rees was even offered the role .
" What about you ?
Do you want it ?
Sorry , you 'd have to get your hair cut , " Miller said to Rees .
' Important boost '
Mr Rees says the project is an important boost for the state 's economy , as well as the local film industry .
" The Mad Max films are iconic and the latest instalment - Fury Road - will be made right here in NSW , " he said .
" In the hands of director George Miller , we will see one of the largest and most ambitious live action films ever made in Australia . "
Mr Rees says the production will create around 540 jobs over two - and - a - half years .
" Times have been tough for our local industry , " he said .
" I am pleased that our assistance from the Film and Television Industry Attraction Fund helped secure this film for NSW . "
' Like football '
Miller launched his career with Max Max in 1979 .
He has since gone on to direct box office hit Happy Feet and produce Babe .
He says Fury Road is important for the Australian film industry .
" Hollywood has cut its production in half .
Big movies like Fury Road and Happy Feet are rare and competitively sought after in all the filmmaking regions of the world , " Miller said .
" The production agreements have been a long time in the making .
Premier Rees and his team have worked like Trojans to ensure this substantial investment comes into this country .
" These are complex and challenging films and funding them is a big leap of faith by Warner Bros .
" Not only does it help fuel the local economy , but it means many talented people get a chance to practise their craft and lift their skills , " he added .
" Making movies is like football .
How can you achieve excellence if you get to play only once in a blue moon ? "
CarriageWorks , based in Sydney 's Redfern , will be used for development work on Fury Road , as well as a motion capture studio for Miller 's upcoming Happy Feet 2 .
Around 30 weeks of filming of Fury Road will take place in and around Broken Hill .
The original Mad Max was filmed in Victoria , Mad Max 2 was filmed around Broken Hill and the third Mad Max was shot in Coober Pedy , South Australia .
Get the Recipe The Fake Shack ( or the Shack Burger at Home )
I admit it : my tastes are not strikingly original .
I 'm obsessed with the Beatles , Beethoven is my god , and I even think Bono is a pretty neat guy .
Nevertheless , I 've consciously tried to avoid all things at the intersection of over - hyped and New York , until a couple years ago when I finally forced myself to stand on line for a hamburger in the name of research — a hamburger that changed my life .
Yes , I 'm talking about the Shack Burger from Shake Shack , of which more than enough has been written about already .
I 'm not here to wax poetic about what Josh Ozersky has dubbed " the platonic ideal of a hamburger " — rather , I 'm here to talk about a way to skip the line that does n't involve standing outside at 9 p.m. on a rainy Tuesday night : Just make the Shack Burger at home .
Easier said than done .
There 's nothing special about the burger — regular squishy bun , a 1/4 - pound patty of griddled meat , lettuce , tomato , and sauce — but like all good burger experiences , the sandwich is far more than a sum of its parts .
To recreate the experience at home , I had to eat it , dissect it , deconstruct it , research it , eat it some more , rebuild it , break it down again , reconfigure it , taste it , eat it one more time , and finally reconstruct it again .
Here are the results of my labor , from the ground up .
The Bun
This one 's easy .
The soft , squishy buns have the unmistakable sweetness and pale yellow hue of Martin 's Potato Rolls , the sandwich roll size .
East coasters can buy these in pretty much any supermarket , or you can order them online by the case ( that 's 48 buns , which you can freeze and toast straight out of the freezer ) at their website .
The buns are very lightly buttered , then toasted to a light golden brown .
The Meat
According to Adam 's sources , the meat is a 50:25:25 blend of sirloin , chuck , and brisket .
On the other hand , according to Ozersky , the mixture is actually mostly brisket , with chuck and short rib mixed in .
I did a side - by - side comparison of the two purported blends next to a Shack Burger , and found that Adam 's mix is closer in flavor , offering the right level of tenderness from the sirloin , rich beef flavor from the chuck , and slight sour / metallic notes from the brisket .
Even the most casual of Shack fans knows the smash and scrape technique : forming the patties into hockey puck - shaped disks , placing the on the griddle , smashing down with the back of a spatula , then scraping them off when it 's time to flip .
But despite the right meat blend and following this technique , I was n't getting the right texture .
The crust on a Shack Burger forms a sort of flat sheath over the top of the burger , rather than the crispy nooks and crannies I was getting on my burgers at home .
What was I doing wrong ?
At first , I thought it was my grind size .
I was passing the burger once through a 1/4 - inch die , which was giving me a rather coarse grind .
Doing a double pass helped the texture come closer to Shack standards , but I still was n't getting the right crust .
After closely examining the highly informative behind - the - scenes video from the Feedbag , I discovered the secret : do n't use too much oil .
Normally , when I cook in a traditional ( IE , not nonstick or cast iron ) skillet , I 'll add a generous amount of oil to prevent food from sticking .
With a Shack Burger , you want the meat to stick to the pan — that 's how it gets that flat , sheath - like crust .
The Toppings
This part was also a snap .
Neon - yellow American cheese , placed over the patty soon after flipping to give it ample time to melt into the meat is a given .
The shack uses two slices of ripe plum tomato in each sandwich — always cut from the center of the fruit — and one piece of green leaf lettuce , the tender green ends of the leaf only .
The Sauce
I would argue that the Shack Sauce is almost as important on a Shack Burger as the patty itself — it 's what differentiates the Shack Burger from Shake Shack 's regular cheeseburger .
It 's by all accounts a " secret " recipe that was going to take a bit of hard core investigative journalism to uncover .
My first attempt was to play the Shack - virgin card .
When I got to the front of the line at the Upper West Side location one Monday afternoon , I innocently asked the cashier , " So , what 's the Shack Sauce ? "
Her response : " It 's mayo - based .
Sweet , sour , hot . "
I went fishing : " How spicy is it ?
Like it 's got hot sauce in it or something ? "
But she did n't take the bait : " A little spicy .
But also sweet and sour . "
One last try : " So , sweet like thousand Island ?
Like it 's got relish in it ? "
She 's an inscrutable blank wall : " No , no relish .
Mayo - based , sweet , sour , hot . "
I give in : " Okay , give me a Shack Burger , extra Shack Sauce on the side . "
Upon tasting it , my immediate thoughts are mayo , ketchup , a little yellow mustard , a hint of garlic and paprika , perhaps a touch of cayenne pepper , and an elusive sour quality that I can't quite pinpoint .
It 's definitely not just vinegar or lemon juice , nor is does it have the cloying sweetness of relish .
Pickle juice ?
Cornichon ?
Some other type of vinegar ?
I can't figure it out .
This was going to take a little more effort .
My next strategy was a little more drastic : " accidentally " walking through the hidden door in the downstairs rec-room that leads to the kitchen in the hopes of taking a sneaky glance at their pantry for hints .
No good .
I got halfway through the door , only catching a glimpse of a few cans lining the right - hand wall before it was pointed out to me by a friendly employee that the restrooms were actually behind the doors clearly labeled " restroom . "
I sat on the bench outside contemplating a bit of dumpster diving when a thought struck me : Maybe I was going about this all wrong .
I walked back into the restaurant , went straight up to the manager , and asked point blank : " Is the Shack Sauce a secret , or can you tell me what 's in it ? "
A little laugh , and then , " It 's mostly mayo , with some ketchup , mustard , a few spices , and pickles blended in . "
" So , pickle relish , or pickles ? "
" Actual pickles — the sliced pickles we serve with the burgers .
I could n't give you exact tablespoon measure or anything because I do n't know them off hand , but that 's the general idea . "
Note to self : always ask nicely before moving on to breaking - and - entering .
The rest was easy : I brought the extra sauce home , the tinkered around with a blender and my spice rack until I got a pretty damn - close approximation .
Can you pick out which is the real sauce in the pic above ?
The rest was easy : I brought the extra sauce home , the tinkered around with a blender and my spice rack until I got a pretty damn - close approximation .
Can you pick out which is the real sauce in the pic above ?
As for applying the sauce , the key here is generous , even coverage .
For the sake of absolute authenticity , I transferred the sauce to a squeeze bottle , and squeezed out three lines onto the top half of the bun , going back and forth three times along each line .
The Assembly
Final phase of construction : place patty with cheese on toasted bun bottom .
Close bun to encase patty , cheese , tomato , lettuce , and sauce .
Slip into a wax - paper sleeve ( or in this case , a jury - rigged parchment paper sleeve ) , wait 30 seconds for steam from patty to penetrate and soften bun , then consume .
A perfect taste - alike .

Back in 1972 , Bhutan , a tiny Himalayan kingdom , proposed Gross National Happiness as a better indicator of well - being than Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
Ever since , Bhutan has been a poster child for happiness .
Its philosophy has influenced many international committees including one headed by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz , which has just submitted its report on The Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress .
The Stiglitz report says that GDP is a poor measure of well - being , so countries should also measure quality - of - life indicators that make people happy , such as leisure , education , social relationships , political voice and governance .
Happiness is , of course , much more than GDP .
Yet Bhutan 's dirty secret is that it is a world champion in GDP growth .
While many countries faced declining GDP in 2008 , Bhutan had the fastest GDP growth rate in the world at 21.4 % , says the CIA World Factbook .
Bhutan used to be among the poorest countries in the world in the 1980s .
But galloping economic growth for two decades took its per capita GDP in 2008 to a respectable $ 1900 , almost double neighboring India 's $ 1070 .
This fabulous GDP growth was not spurred by the pursuit of happiness , but by giant hydropower projects India has been building in Bhutan 's steep mountains for two decades .
Bhutan 's current hydropower capacity is 1,480 MW , and it plans additional projects to generate 10,000 MW of power by 2020 , almost entirely for export to India , which provides all the financing .
Large dams are not usually regarded as sources of happiness .
Environmentalists usually condemn them for displacing people and submerging forests .
Bhutan 's neat ploy has been to adopt a green name ( Druk Green Power Corporation ) for its hydropower producer .
It gets away with this since environmentalists shy away from attacking a much ballyhooed Shangri - La of happiness .
Its first big hydropower project of 336 MW capacity at Chuka was commissioned in 1988 .
This was followed by Kurichhu ( 60 MW ) in 2001 , Basochho ( 40 MW ) in 2005 and the giant Tala project ( 1,020 MW ) in 2007 , which largely explains the subsequent huge jump in GDP in 2008 .
Electricity revenue will provide no less than 60 % of the government 's entire revenue in 2009 .
Yet only 66 % of Bhutanese households and 39 % of its villages are electrified .
Developing countries with rich natural resources , like oil , often fare very badly .
Economists talk of a " resource curse " that enables a kleptocratic ruling elite to become very rich without any productive effort or decent governance .
Revenues from natural resources flow directly to governments , bypassing citizens .
Hydropower potential is Bhutan 's big natural resource , generating vast revenues for its government .
To Bhutan 's credit , kleptocracy and misgovernance have been kept at bay so far .
Yet as hydropower revenue keeps soaring , the risks will keep rising .
Bhutan has done many things to deserve its Shangri - La reputation .
Its forest cover is a very high 72 % , and it has pledged to keep this above 60 % for eternity .
It admits only a small number of high - end tourists , helping preserve the traditional character of its delightful towns .
Tourists say the people are very friendly , tranquil and hospitable .
Yet appearances can be deceptive .
Bhutan has expelled 100,000 people of Nepali origin , who now languish in refugee camps in Nepal .
The Bhutia tribe accounts for roughly 50 % of Bhutan 's population , and ethnic Nepalese for another 35 % .
Nepalese migrants have swamped original ethnic groups in neighboring parts of India like Sikkim and Darjeeling .
The Bhutias of Bhutan are determined not to be swamped too .
Those expelled claim they are regular citizens who have been ethnically cleansed , while the government claims they are illegal immigrants .
Such ethnic strife does not look like a recipe for happiness .
In most countries women outnumber men .
But Bhutan has only 89.2 females per 100 males , worse even than India ( 93.3 females per 100 males ) where female feticide and infanticide are facts of life .
Bhutan 's gender ratio suggests discrimination against female children in access to health and food .
The CIA World Factbook estimates literacy in Bhutan at 47 % , while a recent Bhutanese publication puts it at 59.5 % .
Nepal banned TV for decades to protect its people from pernicious modern influences , but finally allowed TV in 1999 .
Low literacy and media bans are not usually associated with happiness , but some will say that ignorance is bliss .
So , Bhutan 's greatest achievement is not its index of Gross National Happiness , but its apparent demonstration that happiness can flow from rapid GDP growth and large dams , overcoming problems like gender discrimination and low literacy .

Court : Marijuana Dispensary Can Reclaim Money Seized by Police
By SHERRI M. OKAMOTO , Staff Writer
The federal government cannot retain monies seized from a local medical marijuana dispensary during an illegal 2005 search by the Los Angeles Police Department as proceeds traceable to federal narcotics violations , the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said yesterday .
Reversing the decision of U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson of the Central District of California , the panel explained that the $ 186,000 could not be forfeited under federal law since the search which yielded the money was authorized by a state warrant lacking in probable cause and was not predicated on an asserted violation of federal law .
In March 2005 , the LAPD obtained a search warrant from a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to search a non-profit medical marijuana dispensary owned by United Medical Caregivers Clinic Inc. on Fairfax Avenue .
During the search , officers seized $ 186,416 in U.S. currency from the clinics safe and from a cash register , along with about 209 pounds of marijuana , 21 pounds of hashish , and 12 pounds of marijuana oil .
No criminal charges were filed against the clinic or any of its employees , and the clinic eventually filed a motion in the Los Angeles Superior Court for the return of the money and other items taken during the search .
Attached to this motion was a declaration of the clinics chief executive officer , admitting that the facility distributed  marijuana to patient members .
He asserted that the cannabis products , currency and other items seized were all used in the course of the clinics operation as a lawful medical marijuana provider .
LAPD Request
The Superior Court subsequently ordered the release of the seized currency from the states jurisdiction to allow initiation of federal forfeiture proceedings , pursuant to a request from the LAPD .
After the government filed a complaint for forfeiture in the district court , the clinic filed a motion claiming ownership of the money and seeking to suppress all the evidence seized during the LAPD search .
Based on misleading  statements and reckless  omissions of relevant facts pertaining to the clinics status as a legally - operated medical marijuana dispensary in the LAPDs warrant affidavit , Wilson found that there had not been probable cause to issue a search warrant for a violation of state law and granted the clinics suppression request .
The clinic then filed a motion for summary judgment , arguing that the government lacked sufficient evidence to initiate the federal civil forfeiture action .
However , Wilson denied that motion , opining that the declaration of the clinics CEO was untainted by the illegality of the search and by itself gave the government sufficient probable cause for bringing the forfeiture action .
Fourth Amendment
Writing for the appellate court , Judge Richard R. Clifton disagreed , explaining that the search which the government conceded had been illegal violated the clinics Fourth Amendment rights and that the government lacked probable cause to seek forfeiture of the assets seized .
The jurist acknowledged that there may have been probable cause to search the clinic for a violation of federal law but reasoned  that was not what the LAPD was doing  since the agency had never initiated the process of seeking a federal search warrant from a federal magistrate or in any way indicated that it was pursuing a violation of federal law .
He also emphasized that the search was not illegal because it failed to comply with federal procedural requirements for search warrants as the district court had ruled since the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are inapplicable to searches conducted by state officers with state warrants issued by state judges , even if a federal prosecution results .
Admissibility Issue
Clifton then turned to the issue of admissibility of the declaration , noting that the document would suffice to establish probable cause to believe that the money in question was linked to sales of marijuana , if the government were permitted to rely on it .
But Clifton said the government could not do so since the declaration had been submitted for the express purpose of securing the return of the money , and had to be offered or else the clinic would have been left without legal recourse to regain the currency that was illegally taken from its possession . 
The jurist also expressed concern with the distinct and disturbing possibility that the LAPD could profit from its own illegal activity , were the government to prevail ,  based on a suggestion in the clinics opening brief which the government did not deny that the agency could collect up to 80 percent of any forfeiture obtained .
Because the LAPDs omission of relevant information from the warrant affidavit enabled its illegal search and its seizure of the currency , which in turn led directly to the submission of the declaration of ownership , Clifton concluded that this direct causal chain linking the initial illegality to the declaration foreclosed the governments ability to rely on it to establish probable cause for the forfeiture action .
Absent any other evidence linking the currency with the clinics marijuana sales , Clifton , joined by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins and Marsha S. Berzon , directed the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the clinic .

One version of the approach , to be unveiled next week by the Economic Policy Institute , a labor - oriented research organization , would give employers a two - year tax credit if they increased the size of their work force or added significant hours of work ( for example , making a part - time worker full time ) .
Employers would receive a credit worth twice the first - year payroll tax for each new hire , amounting to several thousand dollars , depending on the new worker ’s salary .
“ It ’s beautiful if it can be timed at a dire moment like this , when unemployment is way too high and appears to be going somewhat higher , ” said Mr. Phelps , an economics professor at Columbia , lamenting that the president dropped it from the $ 787 billion stimulus plan approved in February .
“ But it ’s a pity that this was n’t done a year ago . ”
One of a number of ideas being discussed , the policy is intended to encourage companies to start hiring again by making it cheaper to add new workers .
It has raised concerns , though , that employers might try to exploit the system .
States have dabbled with similar tax credits in recent years , with mixed results .
The federal government last tried this measure in 1977 - 78 .
During that period , employment  which had been soft from the 1973 - 75 recession  climbed at a record pace .
The creation of one out of three jobs that was awarded the credit then was attributed directly to the policy .
But the permanence of those jobs was less clear , and some dispute how many of those positions would have been created eventually anyway .
Supporters say that improvements upon the 1970s policy would increase its potency .
These include better publicizing the credit ; making it available even to concerns that are not making money , in the form of a direct payout to nonprofits and companies in the red ; and distributing the credit quarterly so that companies see it sooner .
New York Times recycles fabrications about Iran ’s nuclear programs
By Peter Symonds
6 October 2009
The media campaign of half - truths and fabrications over Iran ’s nuclear programs stepped up a notch over the weekend .
A prominent front - page article in Sunday ’s New York Times breathlessly revealed “ a confidential analysis ” by International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspectors who “ concluded ” that Tehran had sufficient information to build a workable atomic bomb .
While even the New York Times conceded that the conclusions were “ tentative and subject to further confirmation ” , the article conveniently provided the opportunity for Obama administration officials to do the rounds of the Sunday television talk - shows to argue for intensifying pressure on Iran and for right - wing commentators and lawmakers to demand more aggressive action .
All of this has a familiar ring .
The New York Times played a very similar role in the lead up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Articles in the Sunday edition of the American newspaper of record , many of which were clearly planted by the Bush administration itself , provided a platform for top US officials to manufacture an atmosphere of fear over Iraq ’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda .
Like the Iraqi regime , Iran confronts an impossible task in proving that nowhere in its large territory are there facilities for making , in this case , a nuclear bomb .
Tehran ’s declaration on September 21 of an incomplete uranium enrichment plant near the city of Qom was seized on four days later by Obama to ratchet up the pressure on Iran .
An agreement reached with IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei for inspections of the site on October 25 has brought immediate criticisms that this would allow Iran to shift sensitive equipment elsewhere .
While Washington is not yet demanding searches of the equivalent of Saddam Hussein ’s palaces , the push for more intrusive inspections has begun .
The New York Times article is part of this campaign .
The newspaper has deliberately inflated a “ confidential analysis ” that is at least six months old , is incomplete and the subject of sharp controversy within the IAEA itself .
Washington ’s European allies — Britain , France and Germany — have , in recent weeks , been demanding the release of this “ secret annexe ” as part of their efforts to bully Iran .
In part , the effort is aimed at overturning the National Intelligence Estimate reached in 2007 by US spy agencies that Iran had ended its alleged nuclear weapons programs in 2003 — a conclusion disputed by European intelligence organisations .
It is significant that the European powers have taken the lead and that the IAEA is the focus of their campaign .
The simple truth is that any attempt to concoct dossiers along the lines produced by the US and British prior to the invasion of Iraq would simply not be believed by the vast majority of people .
Rather than discredited American intelligence agencies pushing the case , their European counterparts have taken over .
To date , only limited segments of the IAEA document have been leaked to the press .
The most extensive are to be found on the Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) website , which cites one version of a 67 - page report entitled “ Possible Military Dimensions of Iran ’s Nuclear Program ” .
The New York Times chose to highlight the assessment that “ Iran has sufficient information to be able to design and produce a workable implosion nuclear device ” based on highly enriched uranium .
The claim is based on highly dubious sources .
As the ISIS noted : “ Much of the IAEA ’s information , including test data , reports , diagrams , and videos , was reportedly contained on a laptop .
This laptop has received considerable attention since its public revelation in 2005 . ”
The think tank then noted that the purported laptop , which has never been handed over to the IAEA , might not even exist , but might simply have been invented by US intelligence as a cover for a source inside Iran .
The ISIS , which had previously been critical of the data , now concludes , without serious explanation , that the information “ appears authentic ” .
Since its revelation by US intelligence in 2005 , the “ laptop ” has become notorious .
In his book Target Iran , former US military intelligence officer and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter described the laptop “ as a product of joint cooperation between the Israeli intelligence service and their German counterparts . ”
He drew attention to the distinct possibility that the data had been fabricated by Israeli intelligence by weaving together outright lies with a few verifiable facts .
Now , as the US confrontation with Iran again escalates , the “ laptop ” story is being reenergised by unspecified information from Western intelligence agencies and recycled as good coin .
Buried towards the end of the New York Times article is a scant reference to an interview by IAEA director ElBaradei with the Hindu newspaper on Saturday .
It is worth quoting his comments at length .
Asked about Washington ’s “ laptop ” , he said : “ Information about the alleged [ military ] studies came over time to the agency .
Iran says this information is fake .
US intelligence says Iran had weaponisation studies that stopped in 2003 , other [ Western agencies ] claim Iran continued after that …
The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents . ”
Under the pressure of the US and its European allies , who scarcely conceal their contempt for ElBaradei , the IAEA is again being turned into a political battleground .
Asked about the danger of US or Israeli military attacks on Iran , ElBaradei said : [ U ] sing the language of force is not helpful .
It leads to confrontation , to the other country taking counteraction .
It is better to forget the language of coercion and focus on trying to engage in dialogue . ”
With the “ confidential analysis ” of the IAEA , or at least one of its factions , in the public arena , Obama officials underscored US demands on Iran .
Speaking on NBC ’s Sunday show , “ Meet the Press ” , US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice refused to confirm or deny the report ’s conclusion , but nevertheless exploited it to declare : “ Our whole approach is predicated on an urgent need to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capacity . ”
Iran , she said , had to “ prove to our satisfaction that their program is for peaceful purposes and open up their facilities to inspections , [ and ] freeze their uranium enrichment program … or face real pressure and consequences . ”
Republican and Democrat senators Jon Kyl and Barbara Boxer adopted a more strident tone , both declaring support for legislation to impose draconian new sanctions on the export of refined petroleum products to Iran .
By Monday , the New York Times was exploiting the debate that it initiated , quoting Republican senator Lindsay Graham on Fox News Sunday citing the IAEA report as proof that Iran was “ not developing a nuclear program for peaceful purposes . ”
At this stage , the Obama administration has played down the military option , warning instead that Tehran ’s failure to meet Washington ’s demands by the end of the year would result in crippling sanctions , including a possible ban on the export of petrol and diesel to Iran .
Nevertheless , the continuing and open discussion in US political and media circles of the “ military option ” makes clear that it is on the agenda .
While not emphasising the possibility , Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein , who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee , explained to Fox News Sunday that “ you ’d have to have a ground operation as well as an [ aerial ] military operation ” , as Iran ’s nuclear facilities are buried deep underground .
An article in the Chicago Tribune on Saturday , dealt at length with the operational difficulties in conducting air strikes on Iran , but noted that the US military was developing an array of new warheads to hit “ hard and deeply buried targets ” , including a 30,000 pound “ massive ordnance penetrator ” .
While declaring that it remained “ an unthinkable option ” , the article did point out that “ nuclear warheads could destroy even a deeply buried structure . ”
As the New York Times article demonstrates , the US and international media are once again a central cog in the campaign to manufacture the pretext for new crimes by the US and its allies .
The real motive has nothing to do with Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons programs , but is to further the ambitions of US imperialism to establish its economic and strategic dominance in the energy - rich regions of the Middle East and Central Asia .
Carving vegetables into scary faces then lighting them is an odd kind of custom that just must have interesting roots .
The Irish do not disappoint .
Folks there have a legend of a drunken farmer , whose dealings with the devil led to him being turned back at both the gates of heaven and hell upon his death .
Forced to wander the darkness of purgatory , Jack made an o'lantern from a turnip and lump of burning coal to guide his lost soul .
Every Halloween , communities in Ireland would craft their own turnip lamps to scare him and other wayward spirits away .
The tradition became pumpkin- ified when Irish immigrants found the orange veggie sprouting in abundance in North America .
Today , pumpkins mean big business at Halloween : U.S. farmers grow over a billion pounds a year , worth about $ 106 million .

Large bottles of cheap cider were associated with drinking in public Parents could help keep their teenagers away from drink - fuelled violence and sex by giving them a weekly alcohol allowance , a study has suggested .
A third of those polled had experienced violence when drunk and 12.5 % reported sexual encounters they regretted .
University researchers questioned nearly 10,000 15 to 16 - year - olds in the north - west of England .
They got into trouble more when buying their own cheap alcohol , rather than getting access from parents , it found .
Carefully introducing alcohol to children may help them " prepare themselves for life in an adult environment dominated by this drug " , said the study .
' Increase prices '
Study leader Professor Mark Bellis , from Liverpool John Moores University , said the negative impacts of alcohol on children 's health were " substantial " .
" Those parents who choose to allow children aged 15 to 16 years to drink may limit harm by restricting consumption to lower frequencies - for example , to no more than once a week - and under no circumstances permitting binge drinking .
" However , parental efforts should be matched by genuine legislative and enforcement activity to reduce independent access to alcohol by children and to increase the price of cheap alcohol products . "
Despite much of the chronic burden of alcohol - related disease falling on adults , the foundations of such damage are often established in childhood
Study researchers
In similar studies done by the university in 2006 and 2007 researchers concluded that teenagers who drank alcohol with their parents in moderation were less likely to binge drink .
In 2008 their results showed that teenagers were drinking an average of 44 bottles of wine or 177 pints of beer a year each .
This year 's survey found that teenagers who relied on obtaining their own supplies of cheap alcohol were much more likely to be involved in violence and other forms of bad behaviour .
As well as those reporting violence and sexual encounters they regretted , some 35.8 % of the teenagers had drunk in public places like parks and shopping centres and 45.3 % had suffered forgetfulness after drinking .
Researchers said that while no teenage drinking was risk - free , the way teenagers got hold of alcohol made a big difference to the harm caused .
Just under 20 % of teens who drank once a week and were supplied with alcohol by their parents had been involved in violence when drunk .
The proportion getting into fights rose to 36 % for those drinking as often , after obtaining alcohol by other means .
International threat A strong link was found between the availability of cheap drinks and alcohol - related violence , " regretted " sex , and drinking in public places .
Large bottles of cheap cider were particularly associated with drinking in public , while relatively expensive alcopop - style drinks were less of a significant problem , said researchers .
Writing in the journal BMC Public Health , they warned that parents who tried to impose alcohol bans might only shift the problem away from the family into the street .
They added : " Our results suggest that such a move , even if overall consumption did not increase , could exacerbate negative outcomes from alcohol consumption among teenagers . "
" Despite much of the chronic burden of alcohol - related disease falling on adults , the foundations of such damage are often established in childhood , " they added .
In their paper the scientists said alcohol had emerged in recent decades as " one of the major international threats to public health " .

DWARFED by the jetliner , they look little more than a smattering of black dots .
But this flock of birds could have brought the plane crashing down in seconds .
They flew straight into the path of the Germania airlines flight to Kosovo as it took off from Dusseldorf airport with 80 on board .
‘ It was like a scene from the Hitchcock movie The Birds .
One second all was clear , and the next thing you saw were these birds swarming over the plane , ’ said an onlooker .

It is thought more than 200 starlings were sucked into the right engine as the Boeing jet approached 200mph .
Others dented the fuselage but thankfully did not pierce it .
Their splattered remains could be seen on the plane later .
‘ The pitch of the engine said it all , ’ said plane - spotter Juergen Kienast , who took these dramatic pictures .
‘ It was like sticking a bit of metal pipe into a blender . ’
Once airborne , the pilot reported engine damage and circled for almost 45 minutes before landing safely .

The former US vice - president Dick Cheney is almost as busy now as he was when he was running the United States and its wars .
Most of his effort , repeated and of course unchallenged on Fox News last Sunday , is devoted to an open and unapologetic defence of torture , aka " enhanced interrogation techniques " , which he says have " prevented the violent death of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of innocent people " .
He should have said " other people " or " more people " , because thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of innocent people have indeed died as a result of the full - scale Bush - Cheney wars unleashed in response to the 9/11 atrocities , as if fighting crime with crime , mass murder with mass murder , was the obvious and right thing to do .
The result ?
Nine years on in Afghanistan the latest commander of the Nato forces is this week asking for 20,000 more US troops – nine years on , and escalation : sound familiar ?
– while in Iraq the convoys taking US military equipment out of the country as part of the drawdown are under threat from Iran - influenced Shia militias on the road south to Kuwait , and under threat from Sunni insurgents on the road west towards Jordan and Aqaba .
Cheney and Bush thought they were planting the firm footprint of the American Colossus in the desert sands of the Middle East , to hold sway there in control of its turbulent and unreliable spirit ; instead they have placed 150,000 soldiers and billions of dollars of equipment into the jeopardy of quicksands , surrounded by hostile millions , in the process empowering its enemies in the region and destabilising its friends .
Iran has gained , Pakistan has lost , Hamas and Hezbollah have gained , America has lost .
And dragged tumbling on the coat - tails of this foolish enterprise , confected by ideologues in the fat - insulated comforts of Washington armchairs , is Little Britain in the flap - eared shape of Tony Blair , missal in one hand and missile in the other .
I met a captain in the US Marines who told me how much he admired the courage and supreme professionalism of the British forces he liaised with in Iraq when he was last there .
That was good to hear .
But is there still a justification for their involvement in Afghanistan ?
Why are we still there ?
The standard answer is : to stop al - Qaida or its clones from having a base of operations .
But al - Qaida is comfortably and mainly safely now ensconced in Pakistan .
I would defend a fight against Taliban - style religious fanatics for the purpose of rescuing that half of the Afghan population denied education , opportunities and minimum rights , namely the female half .
But Hamid Karzai's government and its western backers seems to have no interest in this ; just before the quasi-election last week Karzai signed a bill legalising rape of wives by husbands , to placate the Neanderthal religious tendency which dominates almost all factions in the country , not just the Taliban .
But the corrosive effects of the Cheney - Bush epoch on the world are not limited by the borders of the Middle East .
In fact the US 's own borders have become a place of malediction because of them .
On 26 August , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit demanding access to records concerning the US customs and border protection policy of searching the laptop computers of any traveller even if there are no grounds for suspicion regarding him or her .
CPB agents can look at anyone 's bank details , personal files , record of websites accessed , contacts , family photos , indeed all and any personal and other documents stored on a laptop , at will and with impunity , in the absence of any prior reason for doing so .
One attorney working for the ACLU 's First Amendment Working Group said , " Travelling with a laptop should not mean that the government gets a free pass to rifle through your personal papers .
This sort of broad and invasive search is exactly what the Fourth Amendment 's protections against unreasonable searches are designed to prevent . "
Attorney Larry Schwartztol of the ACLU 's National Security Project added , " Innumerable international travellers have had their most personal information searched by government officials and retained by the government indefinitely .
The disclosure of these records is necessary to better understand the extent to which US border and customs officials may be violating the Constitution . "
Hats off to the ACLU .
It stands between the better traditions of the US and the efforts of Cheney - Bush to talibanise it after their own fashion .
The question is : how long will the poison of the Cheney - Bush years keep on seeping through the veins of the US and the world , given that what they started seems so difficult to stop ?

WASHINGTON  President Obama on Monday admonished President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan that he must take on what American officials have said he avoided during his first term : the rampant corruption and drug trade that have fueled the resurgence of the Taliban .
As Mr. Karzai was officially declared the winner of the much - disputed presidential election , Mr. Obama placed a congratulatory call in which he asked for a “ new chapter ” in the legitimacy of the Afghan government .
What he is seeking , Mr. Obama told reporters afterward , is “ a sense on the part of President Karzai that , after some difficult years in which there has been some drift , that in fact he ’s going to move boldly and forcefully forward and take advantage of the international community ’s interest in his country to initiate reforms internally .
That has to be one of our highest priorities . ”
The administration wants Mr. Karzai and the Afghan government to put into place an anticorruption commission to establish strict accountability for government officials at the national and provincial levels , senior administration officials said Monday .
A TEENAGE Toowoomba checkout operator has posted a video on the internet pleading with a mystery shopper to help him keep his job .
Grant Manych , 17 , was operating a checkout at Big W at Clifford Gardens on Monday when he says he accidentally put a bag containing about $ 500 into a female customer ’s shopping bag .
The cash was in a bag ready to be picked up by another staff member and taken to a secure part of the store .
However , because no CCTV footage is available of Mr Manych ’s checkout from the time of the incident , store management has come to the conclusion that Mr Manych took the money .
Mr Manych said his manager informed him yesterday police would be investigating the incident .
So , desperate to keep his job , the 17 - year - old has posted a video on YouTube pleading for the shopper who has the cash to return it to the store .
“ It was a mistake , ” Mr Manych said .
“ It was a busy day and I was trying to serve the lady and put the money in the bag at the same time and I accidentally put the cash bag in the customer ’s shopping bag . ”
Mr Manych said the shopper was a woman in her 50s who was quite tall and had dark hair .
She bought two blouses and lipstick and was at the checkout about 2 pm .
“ I ’m just hoping the lady can realise what this is doing to me .
“ This could affect future jobs for the rest of my life if I ’m prosecuted , ” he said .
Mr Manych said he had worked for Big W in Toowoom ba casually for about a year and said he planned to study at TAFE next year .
Mr Manych ’s message for the shopper was simple .
“ Please just think how this could affect the rest of my life . ”
Big W Toowoomba was unable to comment when contacted yesterday .

Chief constables will be forced to justify the legality of recording thousands of law - abiding protesters on secret nationwide databases , the government 's privacy watchdog announced today .
Christopher Graham , the information commissioner , said he had " genuine concerns about the ever increasing amount " of personal data held by police .
Graham 's move came after the Guardian revealed how police have developed a covert apparatus to monitor people they consider are , or could be , " domestic extremists " , a term which has no legal basis .
Photographs and personal details of thousands of activists who attend demonstrations , rallies and political meetings are being stored on the databases .
Surveillance officers are given so - called " spotter cards " to identify individuals who may " instigate offences or disorder " at demonstrations .
Alan Johnson , the home secretary , was today forced to defend the police for labelling protesters " domestic extremists " .
He said : " I have n't issued any guidance [ to police ] on the definition of that phrase .
The police know what they are doing , they know how to tackle these demonstrations , they do it very effectively . "
There were " far fewer " cases of animal rights extremism than in previous years , he said .
" That 's just one form of domestic extremism .
If the police want to use that as a term , I certainly would n't fall to the floor clutching my box of Kleenex .
David Howarth , the Liberal Democrat justice spokesman , said that " an alphabet soup of agencies appears to have decided to put everyone in this country who protests about anything on a list of suspects " .
" This is an example of mission creep , they have gone beyond their original intention of dealing with violent animal extremists "
Three units given the task of monitoring " domestic extremists " are run by the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) , including the National Public Order Intelligence Unit ( NPOIU ) , which operates as a giant database of political activists .
David Smith , the deputy information commissioner , said : " We will raise this issue with Acpo and seek further information from them about the personal information the police are collecting .
" We do have genuine concerns about the ever increasing amounts of information that law enforcement bodies are retaining .
Organisations must only collect people 's personal information for a proper purpose .
We will need to talk to Acpo to understand why they consider it is necessary to hold lawful protesters ' details in this way , before considering whether this meets the terms of the Data Protection Act . "
He also urged demonstrators who suspected they might be on a database to challenge the police .
" Individuals have the right to request information that is held about them and can challenge organisations about whether , and for how long , the data should be retained . "
One activist , Linda Catt , who has been told that footage of her protesting at last year 's Labour party conference is being held on the NPOIU database , said she would lodge a complaint with the information commissioner about why her details are being held .
Catt also discovered her vehicle was being tracked by a network of automatic number plate reading cameras at the roadside .
The development comes amid growing concern that police forces are accumulating detailed information about peaceful protesters without proper justification .
The NPOIU database can access information collected and stored by individual police forces .
However , there is evidence that police forces supplying the data are not holding the information lawfully .
In May , the court of appeal found against the Metropolitan police in a landmark ruling over the retention of photographs on a database run by its public order unit , CO11 .
The court found the force had been unlawfully holding images of Andrew Wood , an anti-arms trade campaigner who was photographed leaving a public meeting .
One judge said there were unresolved civil liberties questions about the way images were taken and retained in " the modern surveillance society " .
The C011 database , which initially contained 2,500 images , has been reduced to around 1,500 images after an internal audit found that 40 % of the those being held were not compliant with the ruling .
Speaking to the Guardian , the Met 's assistant commissioner , Chris Allison , who is in overall charge of C011 , admitted today that the Met had been forced to review its IT systems .
" The judgment made plain , and clarified for the police service , the circumstances under which we could retain images .
It set down a clear set of standards for us , and as an organisation it is important that we live by those standards .
Then we looked at what we could and could n't do in light of that database . "
He stressed the public order database was not – unlike another Met IT system used to log the movements of protesters named Crimint – accessed by rank and file officers .
" The C011 database is just there to enable a few people within the public order branch intelligence squad to have access .
This is n't routine access across the organisation . "
A spokesman for the Acpo domestic extremism units said people on the database " should not be worried " .
" There are lots of reasons why people might be on the database , " he said .
" Not everyone on there is a criminal and not everyone on there is a domestic extremist but we have got to build up a picture of what is happening .
Those people may be able to help us in the future .
It 's an intelligence database , not an evidence database . "
" Protesting is not a criminal offence but there is occasionally a line that is crossed when people commit offences . "
Police forces around the country feed information about protesters into the NPOIU central database in London .
Most of it comes from special branch and officers who record what people do and say at protests .
In an interview with the Guardian , Anton Setchell , the National co-ordinator of the Acpo units , gave a hypothetical example : " At such and such a time , I was on duty in whatever high street , there was this event taking place , and in amongst it I saw a man who I 've known for the last three years called ...
He was wearing a blue shirt and at 3.05 pm he stood on a podium and got a megaphone and gave a 20 - minute address to the crowd . "
JUST as some people have a better self - image than others , so it seems do countries .

The classic symptoms of a heart attack are equally common in men and women
It is a myth that women have different heart attack symptoms from men , according to Canadian researchers .
A study presented at the Canadian Cardiovascular Congress found no gender differences in symptoms after studying 305 patients undergoing angioplasty .
They say it is a commonly held belief that men and women feel the effects of a heart attack differently .
Dr Beth Abramson , of Canada 's Heart and Stroke Foundation , said : " Heart disease is an equal - opportunities killer . "
' The Myth ' In 2003 a study by the US National Institutes of Health did suggest that many women never had chest pains and that their symptoms were not as predictable .
WARNING SIGNALS OF A HEART ATTACK Pain Shortness of breath Nausea Sweating Fear Martha Mackay , who led the Canadian research , said these latest findings suggested that this simply was not the case .
In the study , researchers found was that the women had all the classic symptoms like chest pain and also tended to have pain in the throat , jaw and neck .
She said : " Clear educational messages need to be crafted to ensure that both women and healthcare professionals realise the classic symptoms are equally common in men and women . "
The average age of the people undergoing angioplasty was 63 and nearly 40 % of them were women .
' No gender differences '
As part of the angioplasty procedure a balloon is inflated inside the blocked blood vessel to stretch it out .
This can briefly cause pain and discomfort which is the same as the patient would feel if they are having a heart attack .
During inflation , the patients were questioned about their current sensations and an electrocardiogram measurement was taken before inflation and when the balloon was deflated .
A total of 245 ( 83 % ) had ischemia or a decreased blood supply in their blood vessel .
No gender differences were found in rates of chest pain or typical acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) symptoms regardless of their ischemic status .
Women were significantly more likely to report throat , jaw and neck discomfort , as well as only non-chest discomfort .
The gender effect was increased after controlling for age , urgency , a prior heart attack or a prior angioplasty .
Dr Beth Abramson , of the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation , said that while women may describe their pain differently from men , the most common symptom in women was still chest pain .
She said : " Heart disease is an equal opportunities killer - the differences between women and men are negligible .
" Women do tend to present about seven to 10 years later than men when they are older and sicker .
" The first thing most people feel is a heaviness in the chest and we all need to be aware of that . "

The art summit showcased collections from 54 galleries from around the world
By Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News , Delhi
At Delhi's main venue for large trade exhibitions , Pragati Maidan , there 's a buzz in the air .
Stylish young women flashing designer bags and sunglasses mingle with bearded artists and men wearing conservative business suits .
At the entrance , a group of schoolgirls file in , wearing crisp uniforms .
Welcome to the India Art Summit , the country 's largest contemporary arts exhibition showcasing collections from 54 galleries from around the world .
But although there are works from several internationally renowned artists , including Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali , the focus is unmistakeably on Indian art .
And there 's a lot to see .
Vast canvases of oil paintings from some of India 's most renowned painters share space with a variety of art forms from younger , more contemporary artists including sculptures , video and digital art installations .
' Indian elements '
At the entrance is the showpiece - three giant sculptures by one of the country 's leading contemporary artists , Subodh Gupta , depicting three monkeys made of bronze , steel and old utensils .
One of the artists exhibiting her work here is Arpana Caur .
In her 50s , she 's one of India 's most celebrated painters and is often described as one of the " Great Indian Modernists " .
Renu
Mody says many young people are now buying art She 's displayed her work internationally and is currently exhibiting at the Bradford Museum in the UK , alongside David Hockney and Damien Hirst but believes that however contemporary Indian art may be , it must stay faithful to its roots .
" For instance , I was commissioned by the Hiroshima Museum of Modern Art for the 50th year of the bombing in 1995 .
That painting , Where Are All The Flowers Gone , is about violence and the need for peace .
But I 've deliberately used some Indian elements , especially in the use of colour . "
Over the past few years , the Indian art market has boomed .
Last year Christie 's sold a painting by the Indian artist , Francis Newton Souza , for a record £ 1.2 million ( about $ 2 m ) .
New buyers
The country 's growing economy has also thrown up new buyers which in turn has led to a mushrooming of art galleries .
Bang in the middle of a busy neighbourhood market in south Delhi , amidst fast - food restaurants and shops , is Gallery Espace .
It 's one of the older ones , having been around for two decades , and has a reputation for promoting young artists often using unconventional forms and materials .
This painting was one of the main attractions at the summit Inside its vast , minimalist space , many of the exhibits are strewn around .
At the entrance is one of them , a giant sculpted head of a Hindu god lying on its side , next to an overturned television monitor .
" It 's meant to represent the collapse of history , " explains the gallery owner Renu Mody as she shows me around her gallery .
" Earlier there were traditional people buying art , collectors who were passionate about art , " she says .
" But because of the market and investment possibilities , many speculators and professionals have begun buying art .
Many of them are in their late 20s and early 30s and have the money to spare and believe investing in art is good value . "
Back at the art summit , the crowds are still pouring in but there 's also been some impressive buying and selling .
A piece by the British - Indian artist , Anish Kapoor , has sold for half a million pounds .
' Fantastic '
All this has brought a smile to the face of Maithili Parekh , deputy director of the British auction house , Sotheby's .
" It 's fantastic , really .
The Indian art market is quite young and new but it 's very exciting and has really taken off .
The art fair has seen immense sales in spite of recession which is really encouraging , " she says .
But there are some shortcomings as well , she tells me .
This exhibit at Gallery Espace is meant to represent the collapse of history " We 're lacking enough curators and critics and art publications .
We have very little institutional and museum collecting which can help make art much more accessible to the public , " she says .
Over to one side of the convention hall , away from the main exhibits , is a darkened lounge displaying a video installation .
With electronic music in the background , it documents the rise of one of India 's largest slums through the use of video footage , stills and graphics .
Indian art draws on a rich tradition that goes back thousands of years but what we are seeing here is its commercial and artistic evolution .
This summit was put together by people in their 20s and one of the art panels was curated by a young girl of 17 .
So an entire new generation of artists and art lovers is driving Indian art and pushing its boundaries .

NO ONE NOTICES THE CONTRAST OF WHITE ON WHITE ….
Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , the Senate ’s most right - wing member , thinks conservative activists demanding a right - wing shift in government policy are just the regular ol ’ American mainstream .
“ This is not some kind of radical right - wing group .
I just hope the Congress , the Senate and the president recognize that people are afraid of what ’s going on . ”
I see .
Confederate - flag waving conservatives , who think Democrats are Nazis , are just normal , middle - of - the - road Americans .
DeMint went on to say that “ a fair analysis ” of the right - wing crowd would show that it ’s “ a cross- section ” of the U.S. population .
Asked why the protestors were almost exclusively white people , DeMint added , “ It ’s probably just the time and organization and the media that promoted it . ”
I have no idea what that means .
As for what the overwhelmingly - white crowd had to say , I still think these protests could benefit from some focus .
We learned today that right - wing activists do n’t like government spending ( except when Bush and Republican lawmakers spent freely ) , do n’t like the size of government ( except when Bush and Republican lawmakers increased the size of government ) , do n’t like deficits and debt ( except when Bush and Republican lawmakers added trillions to the nation ’s tab ) , and do n’t like czars ( except when Bush used dozens of them to implement his agenda ) .
They do n’t like health - care reform , though it ’s not clear why .
They do n’t like gun control , though it ’s not clear why they think anyone ’s coming for their firearms .
They also do n’t like taxes , immigration , abortion , Muslims , the U.N. , and the idea of “ socialism , ” though their understanding of the word is tenuous at best .
In other words , the point of today ’s rally was to let the country know there are a lot of right - wing activists with right - wing beliefs .
We knew that before today , but I guess they wanted to remind us .
These shootouts are police incidents , as opposed to military battles .
I have not ranked them according to body count or fame , but according to the reckless disregard for life inherent in them .
The list is long but the reading easy and the added details help to show just how astonishing some of these shootouts really were .
10 The MOVE Shootout
At 6221 Osage Ave. , Philadelphia , PA , on May 13 , 1985 , members of MOVE , a predominantly black organization dedicated to nature , and African tradition , were confronted by the Philadelphia Police Dept. , after neighbors complained of MOVE ’s constant bullhorn announcements of anti-American sentiment at all hours .
In an attempt to clear the building , the police fired tear gas , and the fire dept .
hosed the roof with water cannons .
A burst of gunfire erupted from inside the building , and the police responded with thousands of rounds of small arms fire for 90 minutes .
They then tried to remove two roof structures by dropping a 4 pound bomb of C - 4 and Tovex onto the roof .
This started a fire that eventually consumed the entire neighborhood .
Eleven members of MOVE died in the fire .
Only two survived .
The PPD was sued and forced to pay $ 1.5 million to a survivor and relatives , due to using excessive force and unlawful search and seizure .
I have included this as an astounding example of a police force ’s audacity and consequent repercussions , as opposed to the rest of the entries .
9 The Marin County Courthouse Shootout
On August 7 , 1970 , in an attempt to free his brother , imprisoned Black Panther leader George Jackson , 17 - year old Jonathan Jackson walked right into a courthouse in Marin County , California with an arsenal of weapons , stormed a room where a trial was taking place , and armed defendant James McClain , on trial for murdering a prison guard , and two fellow convicts who were participating in the trial as witnesses , William Christmas and Ruchell Magee .
The four armed men then took the judge , a district attorney and three jurors hostage , and marched them out of the courthouse into a waiting getaway van .
As they attempted to flee the scene , a shootout began between the suspects and Marin County Sheriffs deputies providing security at the courthouse .
By the end of the gun battle , Jackson , McClain , Christmas , and judge Harold Haley were killed .
According to the hostages , Haley was executed by a shotgun blast to his throat .
Magee was severely injured , but survived the battle and was sentenced to life in prison .
One juror and the D.A. were also wounded .
One of the weapons used by Jackson was later traced to Black Panther icon Angela Davis , who was tried , and acquitted , for participation in the crime .
8 The Newhall Shootout
On April 6 , 1970 , two heavily armed career criminals , Jack Twinning and Bobby Davis , engaged the California Highway Patrol in Newhall , CA .
This resulted in the deadliest day in California law enforcement history .
After dark , Davis almost crashed into another car .
The occupants confronted him , and he pulled out a handgun .
They claimed that the CHP was coming , and he fled .
They called the police .
Later , having picked up Twinning , they were pulled over by Officers Walt Frago and Robert Gore , rookies .
At first the suspects complied .
Davis exited and allowed himself to be frisked .
Frago approached the other side of the car carrying a shotgun at “ port arms , ” stock against his hip and barrel pointed in the air .
This was not procedure .
As Frago walked to the Pontiac , Twinning exited the passenger seat and opened fire with a .38 caliber revolver .
Before Frago could aim his shotgun at Twinning , he was struck by two .357 magnum rounds and killed .
Gore quickly drew his service revolver and returned fire at Twinning , but in doing so lost track of Davis , who was right next to him .
While Twinning and Gore exchanged gunfire , Davis pulled a .38 caliber revolver out of his waistband and killed Gore with two shots in the head , point blank .
Shortly after Gore was killed , a second police cruiser containing CHP officers George Alleyn and James Pence arrived on the scene .
As soon as it pulled up to the first cruiser , Davis and Twinning opened fire on it with their revolvers , expending all their remaining rounds , and then dove back into their own car for new weapons .
Davis pulled out a sawn - off shotgun , while Twining grabbed a semi-automatic Colt 1911 .45 ACP .
After firing one shot , Twinning ’s .45 jammed , but he simply grabbed another one out of the car and exited out the driver ’s side .
As they did this , officer Alleyn emptied his pump 12 - ga shotgun at the Pontiac , firing the gun so fast he accidentally ejected a live round in the process .
A single pellet from the shotgun struck Twinning in the forehead , but did not penetrate his skull and inflicted only a minor wound .
After expending all his shotgun rounds , Alleyn opened fire on Davis with his .357 magnum , but scored no hits .
Davis returned fire with his sawn - off shotgun , striking Alleyn with several rounds of 00 buckshot and inflicting fatal injuries .
At this point , 31 - year - old bystander Gary Kness , a former U.S. Marine , intervened .
Kness got out of his vehicle and ran over to the fallen officer Alleyn .
He tried to drag Alleyn to safety , but was unable to move him .
He looked up and saw Davis discard his now - empty sawn - off shotgun and grab the pump shotgun that had been dropped by Frago .
Apparently not realizing Frago had never fired the weapon , Davis tried to cycle the action of the shotgun , but since it had not been fired , it was locked on a live round .
He accidentally fired the gun into the air , dropped it and grabbed the service revolver out of Frago ’s holster .
Meanwhile on the other side of the cruiser , Pence fired all six rounds from his .357 Magnum revolver at Twinning , and missed .
Twinning returned fire with his .45 , striking Pence in the chest and both legs .
Pence fell , trying to reload .
At the time , the CHP did not issue their officers speedloaders , forcing Pence to reload one round at a time .
Back on the other side of the cruiser , Kness picked up Alleyn ’s discarded shotgun and tried to shoot at Davis , but the gun was empty .
As Davis opened fire on him with Frago ’s revolver , Kness dropped the shotgun and returned fire with Pence ’s service revolver .
His shots struck the Pontiac , and a fragment of one bullet lodged into Davis ’ chest .
However , the shot did not incapacitate Davis , and Kness was out of ammunition .
While this was going on , the wounded Pence was still attempting to reload his revolver .
As he did so , he failed to notice Twinning sneak up to the cruiser and around the left side .
As he inserted the sixth cartridge and started to close the cylinder of his weapon , Twinning killed Pence with a point - blank shot to the head .
Kness ran for cover in a ditch , and both suspects exchanged fire with the officers of a third CHP cruiser , newly arrived , then ran into the darkness with the officers ’ weapons .
Davis was apprehended at 3:25 AM , after stealing a civilian ’s camper and exchanging fire with him .
The owner called the police , who tracked down the camper within hours .
Davis was out of ammunition and surrendered .
Twinning broke into a house three miles from the first shootout scene , and took the resident hostage .
He bragged to the police for several hours of a standoff that he had wasted Frago .
Police then stormed the building with teargas , and twinning shot himself .
Davis was given the death penalty , but this was commuted in 1972 , when the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty .
He killed himself in prison , August 16 , 2009 , at 67 .
7 The Brinks Armored Car Shootout
On October 20 , 1981 , more than 10 members of the Black Liberation Army attacked the two drivers on an armored truck outside a bank at the Nanuet Mall in Nanuet , New York .
At 3:55 PM , the drivers were hit by fully automatic M - 16 fire , and handgun fire , one dying instantly , and the other surviving , but almost losing his arm .
The robbers stole $ 1.6 million and fled in a van , to a nearby parking lot where they changed to a U - Haul truck .
Police converged on the mall , and a college student called to report the vehicle change , after which , four police officers stopped the U - Haul and another get - away car , and were immediately engaged by the robbers .
One suspect , a woman , pretended to be innocent and convinced the police to lower their guard , whereupon , six men jumped out of the back of the U - Haul with M - 16s and body armor , and opened fire .
Two officers were killed , the other two wounded .
The last officer to keep fighting , Brian Lennon , was unable to exit his car , and fired his shotgun through his windshield at the robbers , attempting to ram him with the U - Haul .
They fled the scene , some on foot , some in their second vehicle , others carjacking a civilian .
They were apprehended over the next 6 years , following an extensive investigation , and all received long prison sentences .
The Brinks guard who survived , Joe Trombino , died in the WTC , on September 11 , 2001 .
6 The Battle of Barrington
George “ Babyface ” Nelson ( pictured dead above ) engaged FBI agents in a running gun battle through Barrington , IL , a suburb of Chicago , on November 27 , 1934 .
The events that transpired cemented Nelson ’s infamy as a reckless criminal who had no fear of death .
He was driving down the road with his wife and John Chase , an accomplice , in the car , along with several weapons , when he passed a car of FBI agents going the other way .
Both parties recognized each other , and Nelson swung his car around , and he and Chase began firing at the FBI who attempted to get away .
An astonishing reversal of the normal situation .
The FBI fired back and disabled Nelson ’s car with a shot through the radiator .
He drove it into a small field , and the FBI drove away and set up an ambush that never came .
They then returned , and resumed the firefight with Nelson and Chase in the field .
Two more agents joined the fight , Herman Hollis and Samuel Cowley .
Hollis had killed Pretty Boy Floyd a month earlier .
The agents stopped their vehicle in a hail of Nelson and Chase ’s gunfire and fired back .
Nelson was hit in the stomach as his wife fled the scene .
She saw the hit , and reported Nelson to sit down on the running board of his car , while Chase continued to shoot .
Nelson then snarled and stood , walked right out from behind his car into the gunfire and screamed at Hollis and Cowley , “ I ’m gonna kill you sons of bitches ! ” and opened fire with a .351 semi-automatic rifle , firing so rapidly that it was mistaken for a Thompson submachine gun .
Hollis and Cowley fled in terror , while Chase kept the other two agents pinned down .
Cowley turned and fired back , but ran out of ammunition and was gunned down by Nelson .
Hollis shot Nelson in both legs with a shotgun , knocking him down .
Nelson proceeded to get to his feet and gun Hollis down , hitting him several times in the head .
In all , Nelson was hit 9 times .
He , his wife and Chase fled the scene , before the other two agents could return fire .
Nelson died that night from his wounds .
Chase was captured and went to Alcatraz .
5 The Austin Tower Sniper
In what is still one of the most indelible mass shootings in U. S. history , Charles Whitman , an ex-Marine who had qualified as a sharpshooter , barricaded himself into the Tower on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin , on August 1 , 1966 , and opened fire on innocent bystanders for 96 minutes .
He had already killed his mother and wife , and three others on the way up the Tower stairs .
He used a scoped Remington 6 mm deer rifle , an M - 1 carbine , a .35 caliber Remington pump rifle , a .357 magnum revolver , a 9 mm Luger , and a sawn - off 12 - ga pump shotgun .
He commenced firing at 11:48 am , and indiscriminately killed 11 civilians , and wounded 32 more , before police officers were able to get up to the observation deck and shoot him down .
He shot a pregnant woman through the stomach .
This was probably a deliberate attempt to kill the fetus , which succeeded .
The mother , Claire Wilson survived .
He shot Paul Sonntag , a student , through the mouth , from 400 yards , then shot his fiancée , Claudia Rutt in the chest , as she attempted to drag him behind cover .
Ambulances and even an armored car were employed to rescue pinned - down civilians .
An ambulance driver , Morris Hohmann , was shot through the leg .
In true Texas style , civilians in the area ran to their vehicles and brought out their own deer rifles , shotguns , and handguns , and returned fire to the top of the tower , pinning Whitman down well enough for nine officers to get to the top of the building .
Ramiro Martinez and Houston McCoy flanked Whitman , and Martinez emptied his revolver at him , wounding him .
McCoy then fired two rounds of 12 - ga 00 buckshot into the head , neck and left side of Whitman , killing him instantly .
Martinez then grabbed the shotgun from McCoy , ran up to Whitman ’s body , and shot him again in the upper left arm , point blank .
There is a photo of Whitman ’s dead body on Wikipedia .
He was subsequently found to have a glioblastoma , a brain tumor that could have caused his erratic mentality , as he had not always been homicidal .
4 The FBI Miami Shootout
One of the most astounding cases of physical stamina in history occurred on April 11 , 1986 , in Miami , FL , when the FBI cornered two career robbers , William Matix and Michael Platt .
Matix was an ex-Army MP .
Platt was ex-Army Special Forces .
They were armed with a Ruger Mini - 14 5.56 mm , a shotgun , and two S&W .357 magnums .
The FBI outnumbered them 4 to 1 , but still found itself outgunned as the agents fired 9 mms .
The FBI began the confrontation by ramming the suspects ’ car into a tree .
What followed prompted the FBI to change from the 9 mm to .40 Sig.
Platt fired across Matix ’s body at McNeill and Mireles , two agents , hitting Mireles in the forearm .
Matix then shot at Grogan and Dove , two more agents , with his .357 .
Grogan shot Matix in the right forearm .
McNeill fired six shots , hitting Matix twice , in the head and neck , and knocking him unconscious .
Platt exited the car and was shot by Dove through the upper right arm .
This 9 mm round penetrated his right lung , collapsed it , and stopped less than two inches from his heart .
His chest cavity filled with 1.3 liters of blood .
Platt crossed over the hood of another car and was shot twice more by Dove , in the right thigh and left foot .
He took cover by the car and fired his .357 at Risner and Orrantia , two more agents .
He fired at Hanlon , Grogan , and Dove , and was hit a fourth time , breaking his forearm .
He dropped his gun and was shot a fifth time , the bullet penetrating the right upper arm , armpit , torso , and stopping below the shoulderblade .
Platt shot back , wounding Orrantia and hitting McNeill in the neck , incapacitating him .
Dove ’s pistol was shot and destroyed .
Hanlon fired and was hit in the hand .
Platt charged Grogan and Dove ’s car , though wounded in the leg , foot , and twice in the chest , and shot Grogan dead through the chest , shot Hanlon in the groin , and killed Dove with two rounds to the head .
As he entered their car to get away , Mireles fired five times from a pump shotgun with only one hand , hitting Platt in both feet .
Matix regained consciouness and joined Platt in the car .
Mireles fired four more times , hitting neither .
Platt attempted to start the car as two police officers arrived .
Mireles staggered up to the car and fired six rounds from his .357 .
The first two missed .
The third , fourth , and fifth hit Matix in the face , shattering his cheeks , jawbone , and spinal column .
The sixth penetrated Platt ’s chest to the spine .
The fight lasted 4 minutes and saw 145 shots fired .
2 agents and the 2 suspects were killed .
Only one man , Ronald Risner , emerged unharmed .
Neither suspect had any drugs in his system , according to autopsies .
Matix was shot 6 times .
Platt was shot 12 times .
Their feat has been attributed to nothing more than adrenaline and fearlessness .
3 The Blair House Shootout
In what has been called “ the boldest attempt at home invasion in modern history , ” two Puerto Rican nationalists , Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo , attempted to break into the Blair House in Washington D. C. , and assassinate sitting U. S. President Harry S Truman , on November 1 , 1950 .
They were only armed with one handgun each , and yet walked right up to the front door of the Blair House , while Truman was napping upstairs , and opened fire with the guards at the door .
Collazo shot a policeman and then engaged with two Secret Service agents armed with handguns .
The policeman he shot drew his pistol and joined in , and Collazo was shot twice , in the head and right arm .
Simultaneously , Torresola opened fire on a policeman in a guard booth , Leslie Coffelt , who expected Torresola to ask for directions , as tourists usually did .
Torresola shot him three out of four times with a 9 mm Luger , and Coffelt collapsed in the booth .
Torresola then engaged with Joseph Downs , a White House security officer , who was struck in the hip , and ran to the Blair House basement door , was hit twice more , and collapsed inside the building , slamming the door shut behind him .
Torresola rejoined his compatriot , and shot the same policeman Collazo had wounded , incapacitating him .
Collazo was hit in the chest and incapacitated .
Torresola ran out of ammunition , and began reloading , left of the Blair House front steps .
Coffelt , mortally wounded , staggered out of the booth and shot Torresola in the head from 30 feet , blowing out a chunk of his brain the size of an apricot .
The entire shootout lasted only 40 seconds .
Collazo survived and went to prison .
Coffelt succumbed to his wounds four hours later .
Truman was unharmed , but woke to the sounds of gunfire and went to the window to see .
Had the gunmen shot down all the guards outside , they would have had only one Secret Service agent left , behind the front door with a Thompson Submachine gun , with which to contend , before having unimpeded access to Truman upstairs .
2 The Norco Bank Robbery
On May 9 , 1980 , five robbers , armed with an assault rifle , shotguns , handguns , hollow - point ammunition and pipe bombs , robbed the Norco , California Security Pacific Bank at 3:40 PM .
They stole $ 20,000 in cash , and were spotted by a teller at a bank across the street .
Deputy Glyn Bolasky was the first to arrive .
The robbers spotted him and exited the bank , opened fire and blew out his windshield .
He reversed into the street and crashed into another car .
The robbers piled into their van as Bolasky returned fire .
He was shot in the face , left elbow , both forearms , and left shoulder , before the robbers fled .
His cruiser suffered 47 bullet holes .
Two more officers arrived and engaged the robbers while evacuating Bolasky .
The robbers ’ van was stopped at the scene and they opened fire on other officers joining the fight , before commandeering a truck and fleeing down the highway .
They shot at the pursuing police and threw pipe bombs out the back of the truck , destroying 33 police cruisers , as well as civilian cars , and shot down a police helicopter .
The robbers were able to pull well ahead of the police and set an ambush .
They killed one officer , wounded two more , and pinned the rest down behind their vehicles until another officer arrived with an AR - 15 and opened fire .
The robbers fled , suffering one fatality .
Another of the five was killed in a shootout the next day .
The other three were later captured .
1 The North Hollywood Shootout
On February 28 , 1997 , Larry Phillips and Emil Matasareanu attempted to rob the North Hollywood Bank of America .
Perhaps inspired by the epic shootout scene in the 1995 film “ Heat , ” they were extremely heavily armed , with 9 mm Berettas ; fully automatic AK - 47s with drum clips , an HK - 91 , and an AR - 15 .
They wore homemade body armor of Kevlar sewn around steel trauma plates .
They took Phenobarbital to calm their nerves , then walked up to the front door of the bank , put on ski masks and entered at about 9:17 AM .
They expected to be in and out within 8 minutes , before police could arrive .
Unfortunately for them , a police cruiser with two officers drove by and saw them put on their masks , and radioed in a possible 211 in progress .
The robbers began shooting fully automatic rifle fire into the ceiling , forced the vault open and stole $ 303,305 in cash .
They then forced the 30 or so hostages into the vault , and exited the bank , at 9:38 , and initiated the most awe - inspiring hailstorm of domestic violence in United States history .
It lasted for 44 minutes , during which 10 officers and 7 civilians were seriously wounded .
The police fired 650 rounds of various small - arms ammunition at the robbers .
The robbers fired 1,300 rounds in exchange .
They used armor- piercing rounds , which penetrated the officers ’ cruisers and vests .
The officers , however , could not penetrate the robbers ’ armor with their .38 revolvers , 9 mms , and 12 - ga shotguns .
The robbers shot at a helicopter , which refused to leave , and broadcast the entire battle .
Matasareanu entered a white four - door sedan , while Phillips opened the door and retrieved additional drum clips , and continued to fire at officers .
The police took cover behind their cars , behind buildings and tollbooths .
They were so terribly outgunned that many fled the confrontation to nearby gun stores , and requisitioned AR - 15s and M - 16s , then returned to the fight .
The robbers were hit hundreds of times but continued shooting unabated .
Civilians attempted to flee the area and were shot down indiscriminately .
Phillips followed his accomplice down a residential street firing in all directions , until he was hit in the left thumb .
His HK - 91 jammed , and he dropped it , pulled out his 9 mm and returned fire at the officers approaching .
His 9 mm jammed , and as he cleared it , he placed it under his chin and shot himself dead as an officer shot him .
Matasareanu drove on into the neighborhood .
He commandeered a civilian pickup truck and almost fled the scene when the SWAT team arrived .
He got out and fired fully automatic rifle fire at them through his own windshield .
Some of the SWAT team members were unable to penetrate his armor even with M - 16s , with rounds bouncing off , but eventually began wounding him in the torso and arms .
They also shot under both cars at his feet .
This brought him down , and he died of gunshot wounds before an ambulance could reach him .
Miraculously , not one police officer or civilian died .
19 officers were awarded the Medal of Valor , the police equivalent to the military ’s Medal of Honor .

Ever since William King proposed the taxonomic designation Homo neanderthalensis in 1864 , there has been intense debate as to whether Neandertals represent a distinct species from us .
Species , as defined by the biological species concept , are populations of organisms that can potentially interbreed and have fertile offspring .
It is believed that the lineage leading to Neandertals and modern humans split sometime around 500,000 years ago .
For most of their existence Neandertals and early modern humans were geographically isolated ( and by extension reproductively isolated ) from one another .
The big question is whether they could have produced viable offspring when they met .
Today , most researchers acknowledge that some sexual encounters could have occurred between Neandertals and modern humans .
The more interesting question is how common were these encounters and did they leave their mark on the modern gene pool .
Undoubtedly , modern humans and Neandertals would have recognised each other as fellow humans but this does not mean that they would have acted humanely to each another .
Countless social and psychological studies have shown humans to have a very strong " us versus them " mentality , that no doubt also existed in our ancestors .
It is unlikely that modern humans and Neandertals had an easy relationship .
Most sexual encounters that took place between the two were likely opportunistic and probably involved enslavement and rape .
Palaeoanthropologists generally have little problem seperating Neandertals and modern humans based on their gross morphologies .
However , some of the earliest modern humans from central Europe have traits that have been seen as evidence for continuity between them and Neandertals .
These fossils , particularly those from Peştera cu Oase in Romania and Mladeč in the Czech Republic , have been touted as exemplars for modern - Neandertal admixture .
These specimens show traits that are seen in high frequencies in Neandertals , such as bunning of the occipital and the presence of a suprainiac fossa .
However , many researchers have questioned whether these traits are in fact distinctly Neandertal .
For instance , the form of the occipital seems to be different in early Upper Palaeolithic populations , leading many to favour the term hemibun to describe the shape of the occipital in early Europeans .
Lieberman and colleagues has gone as far as to suggest that the buns seen in these two groups are not homologous .
Similarly , it has been argued that the shape of the suprainiac fossa is distinct in early modern Europeans compared to Neandertals .
A palpable difficulty in assessing proposed Neandertal traits in early modern humans is that both groups shared similar niches and some traits may be the result of lifetime behavioural adaptations or convergent evolution .
Indeed , the shared robustness of these early humans is likely due to the higher physical activities of these Late Pleistocene groups than during later period .
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) has some characteristics that make it ideal for analyses of ancient specimens .
MtDNA is found in abundance – cells can have thousands of copies of mtDNA , while only containing two copies of nuclear DNA .
Moreover , its structure and location within the cell make it more resistant to decay .
All the studies of Neandertal mtDNA to date cluster outside the range for modern human mtDNA variation .
However , the mitochondria contain only a small part of the total DNA that make up a genome .
The possibility that Neandertal genes could show up somewhere else in the genome cannot be ruled out .
The recent announcement by Svante Pääbo that he is sure that Neandertals and modern humans had sex is quite a bold pronouncement coming from a scientist .
It raises the question of whether this ascertain is based on some hard evidence they found while sequencing the Neandertal genome .
It is possible that if there was some Neandertal genes passed on to the first moderns in Europe , they could have got eliminated from the subsequent gene pool as population sizes fluctuated during the more severe climatic episodes .
A more likely scenario is that Pääbo's team found evidence of modern introgression in the Neandertal genome .
In all likelihood the incoming modern humans were more numerous than the Neandertals , thereby absorbing the endemic populations through genetic swamping .

Charles Lane at The Washington Post stepped in it big time yesterday with an awful piece that literally had to be edited after publication for shocking insensitivity .
Now he 's returned with another , falling back on the desperate argument that medical marijuana is a Trojan Horse for recreational legalization .
Listen , medical marijuana is n't a trick and it's pathetic to pretend that the people trying to legalize marijuana are behaving surreptitiously when we 've been screaming " legalize marijuana " at the top of our lungs for a damn long time now .
You can't blame us for the fact that the medical marijuana debate necessarily serves to illustrate so much about the absurdity of marijuana prohibition as a whole .
Nor does it in any way undermine our credibility when we place the interests of seriously ill patients before those of casual users when setting our political priorities .
Critics of medical marijuana advocacy often accuse us of demanding unusual regulatory exceptions for marijuana , complaining that it has n’t been approved by the FDA and that the whole concept of medicine by referendum is absurd , as though there exists any other path for us to take .
It really should n’t be necessary to explain all the ways in which endemic and entrenched anti-pot prejudice across numerous government agencies renders preposterous any notion that we could just play this out by the usual rules .
We 've been trying that for decades now and we get cheated at every turn , so you can save your appeals to procedure .
Marijuana can't be treated like other medicines , because it 's nothing like them .
It was here first and it 's vastly cheaper , safer , and more versatile than its modern pharmaceutical counterparts .
It 's a bush that just grows out of the ground and what we want is for the government to stop arresting people who 've found ways to use it .
There 's nothing even the least bit complicated or disingenuous about that .
Those who now lament the cascading political momentum of medical marijuana as some sort of grand conspiracy have it exactly backwards .
Marijuana was prohibited through a vicious series of outrageous lies and perversions of science .
We all know the history of racism , demagoguery , and blind hysteria that somehow turned a helpful plant into a scary satanic deathbush .
From the very beginning , there has never been a time when any of this made sense .
To now stand proudly atop the pedestal of prohibition while questioning our credibility and our motives is just insane .
Yes , there is a massive lie at the center of this debate , but we 're not the ones telling it .
The drug war itself is the true Trojan Horse that masquerades as a symbol of health and safety , while harboring destruction within its folds .
" Tea Bag Nation Ends Today "
For two months , we 've sat and watched the rabid right achieve the unimaginable : Derail universal health care and send the Democrats in Congress running for cover .
Many have asked , " How did this happen ?
How could a small minority of angry people control the public agenda ?
Where is the majority 's response ?
Why the silence ? " I do n't have the answers to all these questions .
But I do know this : I 've had enough .
As far as I 'm concerned , Tea Bag Nation ends today .

Well , what did I expect ?
A fair representation in the press and a balanced view from commentators ?
Come off it .
Whenever , religion comes up , people lose all sense of reason and impartiality .
This is why I wanted to construct a theory that addresses secular supernatural beliefs to avoid the problems of focusing just on religion .
However , bloggers and commentators have completely misunderstood my position and the ideas I am proposing about the origins and prevalence of supernatural beliefs because of the recent press articles .
A couple of things .
First , most of the articles in the press are based on the original article in The Sunday Times by Jonathan Leake and Andrew Sniderman .
Jonathan did have the courtesy to phone me on Friday afternoon to talk about the piece .
He had not read the book but had a copy of SuperSense sent to him .
I thought I made my position relatively clear as we discussed the evidence and studies that indicate that we are born with brains to seek out patterns and infer hidden mechanisms , forces and entities .
That does not make me either religious or a religious apologist .
For example , if there is a gene for psychopathic killers that does not make it morally acceptable .
I talked about the early emergence of mind body dualism and how it relates to the notion of an after - life and my particular research interest , psychological essentialism .
I said that I thought many supernatural beliefs had a natural origin in the way children reason about the world and that while story - telling was one way of transmitting beliefs , in many instances cultural stories reflected notions that were intuitively plausible to children .
In fact , I categorically said that religions were cultural constructs as Richard Dawkins had proposed .
Where I differ from Dawkins ( and again this is very clear in the book ) is the likelihood of removing supernatural beliefs through education but this is an empirical question that is not yet resolved .
I also think that we need to understand individuals differences .
Belief formation is not simply hard - wired or indoctrination .
To use Ben Goldacre ’s dictum , “ I think you ’ll find it more complicated than that ”
Jonathan thanked me and said that he would run the piece past me on Saturday for my approval .
He did n’t .
As Saturday night passed , I thought that they had probably decided to drop the piece as it did not fit with the simple “ Born to Believe in God ” angle that he wanted to push when we initially spoke .
So imagine my horror to read the title of the piece in the Sunday Times .
In fact , when you read the actual piece it does have me saying that beliefs are much more complex than either nature of nurture ( to use that completely unsatisfactory dichotomy that is the mark of naive reasoning so favoured by journalists ) .
And there were factual errors .
I have not done a study on atheism and moral contamination beliefs about hypothetical organ transplantation though I daresay that all people irrespective of their religious persuasion would show the same effects that we found in groups of students .
Still it was printed as a study on atheism .
The problem was compounded the following day with pieces in “ The Daily Mail ” and “ The Daily Telegraph ” regurgitating new versions of the story with added insertions .
And so on ….
like Chinese whispers the story has become distorted with individuals adding their own interpretations and agendas .
So before you start putting words in my mouth , judging me or the ideas I am putting forward , then please read the book .
I think that it is relatively clear what I am saying .
UPDATE : Tim Lambert just posted a criticism of Jonathan Leake but I have to say that Jonathan was very quick to respond to my initial complaint back when this was first posted and an updated article was posted online .
So I have no complaint ( esp as I understand that it was probably the sub - editor who came up with the headline ! )
While TheCityFix has made the case for the pedicab before , it ’s always good ( but rare ) to see a writer from the “ mainstream media ” lauding the three - wheeled transport option .
The Times ’ Ariel Kaminar ’s sensitive and experiential inquiry provides helpful insight into , and light - hearted goodwill towards , the New York City pedicab scene .
Unfortunately , her exploration of the chauffeured trikes was inspired by titillating Fox News coverage of a brawl that broke out between two traffic impaired men ( one had been driving a taxi ; the other , a pedicab , both behaving like idiots ) , and a subsequent City Council ruling to begin regulating the smaller vehicles .
Kaminar , thankfully , gamely decided to investigate pedicabs further when a City Council member carped on the humble vehicles with a little too much vitriol to the New York Post : “ Pedicabs have been for too long acting like they rule the streets ahead of any other mode of transportation . ”
Questioning whether their three wheels could be so bad , Kaminar then set out then to gain actual on - the - streets experience of pedicabs in NYC , which grounds her story substantially .
The whole sequence of events marks how far we have to go before the pedicab is taken seriously as a transportation mode .
While regulation is a necessary step in the right direction , it needs to be done wisely instead of fearfully , and media coverage typically has n’t been up to the task of presenting pedicabs in a balanced enough light to judge them squarely .
In Los Angeles a few months back , where an instigating brawl did n’t inspire media outlets , LA Times coverage of the development of pedicab regulations was limited to a link to local blog coverage .
( Though , the local blog coverage was quite good .
See Gary Kavanagh ’s take on the absurd pedicab rules that were under consideration , followed by a similar appraisal by Eric Richardson , which was linked by the LA Times , as well as LA Streetsblog coverage . )
Slightly better , I guess , than the scant context they did provide of San Diego ’s regulation developments , where they failed to describe whether pedicabs function any more deeply than as a scam attracting “ foreign college students ” to cheap jobs .
Part of this lack , I suspect , is due to the continuing disconnect between the “ mainstream ” view of bicycling generally ( as an adult male sport for fitness freaks and weirdly clad adventurers ) and the growing movement of folks who make use of the bicycle an inspired mode of transport .
See my friend Josef ’s blog post ( he ’s a bicycle shop owner ) on how this plays out at bike retailers .
Until this disconnect is addressed , bicycling , and pedicabs , remain quaint forms of getting around .

For those who learned French in the classroom , I ’m guessing the teacher was not willing ( or able ) to teach students how to properly and thoroughly cuss in French .
So , in that vein , here are some of my very favorite French curses .
These are the things you hear spilling out of cab driver ’s mouths , accidentally being shouted by a grandmother when she drops the milk , or accompanied by grimaced faces and occasional hand gestures in the streets of Paris .
Now , before you go around dropping the French equivalent of the F bomb on your next trip , keep in mind that language plays an immensely important role in French culture .
In fact , being articulate and well spoken is considered to be an extremely valuable asset and characteristic , and while the French also like to curse a lot , the term most often associated with curse words is “ unrefined . ”
However , in the right place , with the right people , you can impress your French friends ( and make them giggle ) by appropriately using these very useful and colorful curses .
Julie ’s 10 Favorite French Swear Words
1. Merde !( maird )
This translates quite literally as “ shit . ”
You ’ll definitely hear “ merde ” used in France in as wide of a context as “ shit ” in English .
Sometimes , for extra emphasis , you ’ll hear people say “ MAIR - duuuhhhh ” instead of the more accurate “ maird ” .
2. Putain !/ Pute !( Poo - TAHN ) /( poote )
This word packs a serious punch , so use it with caution ( and maybe not in mixed company ) .
Putain literally translates as “ whore , ” but tends to be used more like the word “ fuck ” in English .
Not only can it be used as an emotional reaction to something , like “ Fuck ! ” in English , you can also direct it at someone in particular , “ ça pute ” ( that whore ) .
People joke that the word “ fuck ” can be used as every part of speech in English , and in French , putain functions much the same way .
3. Chiant / ça me fait chier ( CHI - ant ) /( sa meh fey CHIay )
This word is most commonly used in the context of “ ça me fait chier , ” which translates as a more vulgar version of “ that pisses me off . ”
4. Salope ! ( sal - OPE )
You ’ll most likely be directing this one at someone in particular , rather than as an angry expletive shouted in response to something .
It translates as “ bitch , ” and is used pretty much exactly the same way the word is used in English .
Also , like in English , you can incorporate this word into a a phrase like “ fils de salope ” ( son of a bitch ) .
* salop ( pronounced sal - OH ) is the masculine version
5. Foutre /
Je m’en fou ( FOO - truh ) / ( Juh men foo )
Again , although you may hear this dropped around a lot , use it with caution as “ foutre ” is the verb for “ to fuck . ”
You ’ll most often hear this in the phrase “ je m’en fou , ” which essentially means “ I do n’t give a fuck . ”
This also became one of my favorite phrases while I was living in Pairs and it was another one that would make my grande tante ( great aunt ) cringe when it slipped out at home .
6. Con/conasse / connard ( cohn ) /( con-ASS ) /( con- ARD )
This is often used as “ ass ” in French , though it is also sometimes translated as a milder “ idiot . ”
There is a famous movie in French titled “ Le Dîner des Cons , ” which is about a group of Parisian businessmen who each bring a “ con , ” or an idiot , to dinner and then the favorite “ con ” is chosen at the end ( i.e. the guy who makes the biggest fool of himself ) .
If this sounds familiar , it ’s because it was remade in America as “ Dinner for Shmucks ” with Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd .
7. Nique ta mere !
( neek tah mare )
Watch out for this curse , as it literally translates as “ fuck your mother . ”
This phrase is not only extremely vulgar , but also very offensive and should be reserved for situations when only the most extreme curse is needed .
8. Ta Gueule ! ( ta - GOOL )
This is just about the rudest way possible of telling someone to shut up .
While it does not really have an exact equivalent or translation in English , it ’s kind of like saying “ shut the fuck up , ” or “ shut your trap . ”
You ’ll definitely hear this in banter among friends , but it can also be used in a really insulting way .
9. Casse - toi ! ( kass - twah )
This French curse became the center of a French controversy when President Sarkozy was caught saying this to a French citizen who had refused to shake his hand at an agricultural fair in France .
This insult is kind of like a very rude way of saying “ bugger off , ” or maybe even “ fuck off . ”
Combined with another expletive ( like “ con ” ) , it can actually pack quite a powerful punch .
10 . C’est des conneries !
( Say - day - KOHN - ree )
Clearly this curse is related to # 6 on this list , and can be translated best as “ this is bullshit . ”
I particularly enjoy this phrase and find it very useful in my daily life .
I also like to throw in extra words for emphasis like “ C’est vraiment des conneries ! ” ( That is REALLY bullshit ) .

So , those are my favorite French swear words and cusses .
You may have your own colorful expletives .

Frederic Mitterrand has rejected criticism from the far right France 's Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand is facing intense pressure over a book he wrote that described paying for " young boys " in Thailand .
The book was written four years ago , before he joined the government , but is back in the headlines following his impassioned support for Roman Polanski .
Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on child sex charges .
Mr Mitterrand , nephew of late President Francois Mitterrand , is expected to defend himself on TV later on Thursday .
Mr Mitterrand has come under attack from right and left .
In his 2005 book The Bad Life , he wrote : " I got into the habit of paying for boys , " saying his attraction to young male prostitutes was not dimmed despite knowing " the sordid details of this traffic " .
FREDERIC MITTERRAND
Born in Paris , 21 August 1947 Nephew of former Socialist President Francois Mitterrand Former TV presenter , documentary maker and writer Appointed head of the French Academy in Rome in 2008 Named by Nicolas Sarkozy as culture minister in June 2009 " All these rituals of the market for youths , the slave market excited me enormously ... the abundance of very attractive and immediately available young boys put me in a state of desire . "
Mr Mitterrand , 62 , has denied being a paedophile , saying the term " boys " was used loosely .
The account of cruising for prostitutes in Thailand attracted little attention when it was published in 2005 , when Mr Mitterrand was a TV personality .
' Sex tourism '
He did not share his uncle 's socialist politics , and was brought into the centre - right government by President Nicolas Sarkozy in June 2009 .
But his strong defence of Polanski has brought the book back into the public eye .
Polanski faces deportation to the United States for having had sex with a 13 - year - old girl in 1977 .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Mr Mitterrand said the US ' behaviour , in seeking his extradition , was callous and " horrifying " .
Socialist Party spokesman Benoit Hamon told Reuters : " As a minister of culture he has drawn attention to himself by defending a film maker accused of raping a child and he has written a book where he said he took advantage of sexual tourism .
To say the least , I find it shocking . "
Marine Le Pen , vice president of the right - wing National Front , read excerpts of Mr Mitterrand 's book aloud during a television interview , and said it left " an indelible stain on the government " .
She called for the culture minister to step down .
" Resign , Mr Mitterrand and perhaps , afterwards we 'll be able to give lessons to other people , " she said .
Mr Mitterrand said it was an honour to be dragged though the mud by the National Front , and criticised the Socialists for making common cause with the extreme right .
A senior aide to President Sarkozy , Henri Guaino , on Thursday backed the minister , saying the row was " excessive and quite undignified " .
But the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby , in Paris , says that the revelation that a senior cabinet minister was involved in sex tourism , just as the country holds negotiations with Thailand to discuss ways of fighting it , will inevitably embarrass Mr Sarkozy 's government .

I found the show enjoyable .
It was light , good natured , and fun , but I did n't see anything that would keep me watching .
I can see how the how would appeal to people ; it 's a bit like Desperate Housewives with magic .
I 've seen many bad reviews for the show and honestly I do n't see why they hated it so much .
The dialogue was really fresh for the first act and had a fairly interesting premise .
Some coins fall beside a group of women they make wishes , and toss them into a fountain .
Later , they discover they can do certain things .
A rich guy named Darryl Van Horne ( Paul Gross ) comes to town and buys everything .
He eggs the women on to embrace their desires .
It touched on social issues like women in the workplace , women 's vs men's roles , and had a bit of family drama involved .
Each woman has their own issue and it could be interesting to see how they deal with it .
Roxanne ( Rebecca Romijn ) is a cougar ( yes I know , another cougar ... ) and her boytoy wants to be her boyfriend .
She has dreams of the future but does n't fully understand her ability .
Kat ( Jaime Ray Newman ) has an alcoholic husband and after she accidently shocks him with lightening , requests a divorce .
Joanna ( Lindsay Price ) struggles to assert herself at work , but her newfound powers starts changing things up .
Will it continue watching ?
No , it 's not my kind of show .
Will other people keep watching ?
Definitely .
I saw lots of things in the show that others might like .
I 've seen complaints about the whole anti-feminism thing , but it 's too early to tell .

Stem cells could create new skin to help burns victims
Human embryonic stem cells are able to change into any of the 200 cell types in the human body French researchers say they have found a way of using human embryonic stem cells to create new skin which could help serious burns victims .
They say the stem cells grew into fully formed human skin 12 weeks after being grafted on to mice .
The researchers , writing in the Lancet journal , say the skin could solve the problems of rejection that burns patients currently face .
One stem cell expert said they had made an important advance .
Burns techniques
For more than 20 years , patients with serious burns have benefited from a technique which grows new skin in the laboratory using their own skin cells .
This report takes research into regenerative skin stem cells to the next level
Holger Schluter , Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre
But the technique takes three weeks , putting the patients at risk of dehydration and infection .
Skin from cadavers is used during this period to cover the wounds but its availability is limited and it is often rejected by the patient 's immune system .
Artificial nets which cells can grow on have also been tried .
But they do not work on large burns , where they increase the risk of rejection and disease transmission because they can contain material from cows and other humans .
Skin formation
The researchers duplicated the biological steps that lead to skin formation during embryonic development .
They placed the cells on an artificial net which helped the cells to form a layer of skin .
This was grafted on to five mice and 12 weeks later , the skin had a structure consistent with human skin .
Dr Christine Baldeschi , from the Institute for Stem Cell Therapy and Exploration of Monogenic Diseases in Evry , France , who led the research , said the results were promising .
She said the technique could lead to " an unlimited resource for temporary skin replacement in patients with large burns awaiting grafts of their own skin " .
Researchers are now planning a human trial of the new technique .
An accompanying editorial by Holger Schluter of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne , Australia , said the research represented an important advance .
He said : " This report takes research into regenerative skin stem cells to the next level .
" This finding suggests that skin derived from embryonic stem cells could be transplanted onto burnt patients awaiting skin grafts , with a reduced risk of rejection . "

Fuel cells are often touted as one method to help decrease society 's addiction to fossil fuels .
But there is still a lot of work to be done before fuel cells will be ready for mass market to be used in transportation , home heating and portable power for emergencies .
U of C chemists Jeff Hurd and George Shimizu have taken the science behind a specific type of fuel cell towards a higher level of design .
They have discovered a new material that allows a PEM fuel cell , known as a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell , to work at a higher temperature .
This discovery is extremely important in terms of increasing the efficiency and decreasing the cost of PEM fuel cells .
" This research will alter the way researchers have to this point perceived candidate materials for fuel cell applications , " says Shimizu a professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calgary .
A research paper by Shimizu , Hurd , Ramanathan Vaidhyanathan and Venkataraman Thangadurai of the University of Calgary , and Christopher Ratcliffe and Igor Moudrakovski of the Steacie Institute for Molecular Sciences , National Research Council , has just been published in Nature Chemistry online .
Shimizu filed a patent with the US patent office last year .
A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device which converts the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water and electrical energy .
Water usually carries the ions ( protons ) in a hydrogen fuel cell but this research uses higher boiling molecules trapped in a molecular scaffolding .
Currently , PEM fuel cells can produce energy from hydrogen below 90 °C , just under the boiling point of water .
With Shimizu 's material , energy can be produced at a higher temperature , up to 150 °C .
This could ultimately make the fuel cell cheaper to produce because at a higher temperature less expensive metals can be used to convert hydrogen into energy .
Currently , platinum is used which is extremely expensive .
Also , reactions at a higher temperature would be faster thus increasing efficiency .
" Ours is an entirely new approach that strikes a balance between having a regular molecular structure and mobile components all while showing genuine promise of application , " says co-author Hurd , a PhD candidate studying chemistry at the U of C .
Kevin Colbow , director of research and development at Ballard Power Systems , a company that designs and manufactures clean energy hydrogen fuel cells , calls the work significant .
" We believe that further improvement on conductivity and robustness of these materials could provide next generation membranes for PEM fuel cells . "

It appears that Conficker is still alive and well .
www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694401.htm
I heard about a local company today who on Monday of this week started having some pretty strange goings on in their network and called in their consultants to try to figure out what was happening .
It turns out after much time spent trying to determine what was going , it was " just another Conficker Outbreak " .
( Still working on it as a matter of fact ) .
They do have anti virus however the infection went undetected for quite some time .
Why ?
Because Conficker did what Conficker does and it over rode the security software and antivirus software to allow them to do their dastardly deeds while remaining undetected .
This company has close to 100 computers and more than 50 % of them have been infected , some for a while it seems .
Conficker has continued to grow its little Botnet and the BotHerder is still spreading their damage .
If you look at the " pictorial " representation of the spread in the US alone from January to July it is pretty amazing .
www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001646.html
We also received an email today from a reader whose company was experiencing Conficker activity .
So perhaps there is a new wave of the bad guy coming .
So just a reminder - quick check -
www.confickerworkinggroup.org/infection_test/cfeyechart.html
If this Eye Chart does n't display the logo's for 6 of the top security sites in the world , you may be infected and will be the next to fall to the plight of the Conficker Worm .

I write a lot of little conversion programs .
They take a command - line argument or two , loop over a series of files , read them , convert them , manipulate them , mangle them , then write them out elsewhere .
It 's the Unix filter pattern ( and , one might argue , the functional programming pattern ) .
These programs tend to be , at most , 100 lines of code , with significant whitespace .
I often start by writing a couple of helper functions , one to find the names of all of the interesting files , one to read a file , one to process the input names into output names , and one to write a file .
I should abstract this whole process into a reusable framework , but I have n't figured out the appropriate genericity yet .
The important point is that I start with names :
my $ scenes = get_scene_list ( ) ; for my $ chapter ( get_chapter_list ( ) ) { my $ text = process_chapter ( $ chapter , $ scenes ) ; write_chapter ( $ chapter , $ text ) ; } die ( " Scenes missing from chapters : " , join "
\t " , '' , keys % $scenes ) if keys % $scenes ; exit ; sub get_chapter_list { ... } sub get_scene_list { ... } sub process_chapter { ... } sub read_scene { ... } sub write_chapter { ... }
This particular program is 88 lines of code , with copious whitespace and BSD - style brace placement .
There 's no functional reason to write it with functions instead of straight - line code that operates on global variables .
There 's only aesthetic practicality .
Names matter .
I do n't have to show you the contents of any of these functions because their names describe what they do .
They do n't tell you how they do what they do , but you can get a sense of the organization and intent of the code by reading the simple control flow here .
Very little novice code I 've seen makes the attempt at organized , named structure .
I can appreciate that design and abstraction and factoring are all skills learned through practice just as much as is programming effectively in a language .
Even still , these are important skills to learn .
I 've heard a lot of people try to explain subroutines as " Pieces of reusable code " .
That 's wrong ; I think the Forth and Lisp and domain - driven design people have it right here .
A subroutine is a way to name a set of behavior .
It 's an abstraction .
Being able to identify and name individual sets of behavior is essential to being able to solve problems well .
Thinking in terms of sets of behavior -- individual units of behavior -- is essential to programming well .

Performance and memory usage have been extensively optimized throughout the entire program .
. NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is now required , which has many built - in performance improvements .
Startup performance on most systems will be better by about 20 % .
Memory usage has been reduced when more than one image is open .
The selection outline is no longer animated .
Instead of " dancing ants " , a context - sensitive " XOR " stipple pattern is drawn .
This has allowed for improved performance and lowered CPU consumption ( and longer battery life ) .
On Windows XP , the Text tool has improved reliability and font selection ( it uses GDI instead of GDI + ) .
On Windows 7 , the Text tool will use DirectWrite ( instead of GDI ) which gives better performance and greatly improved quality .
On Windows Vista , you may install DirectX 11 to enable this feature ; otherwise GDI will be used .
All installation prerequisites are now installed automatically , such as .NET and Windows Installer .
Updates are now downloaded in the background , and installed after you exit the application .
In previous versions , this was a foreground task and you could not use Paint.

1. Command Line Editing
This chapter describes the basic features of the GNU command line editing interface .
1.1 Introduction to Line Editing
The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent keystrokes .
The text C-k is read as ` Control - K ' and describes the character produced when the k key is pressed while the Control key is depressed .
The text M-k is read as ` Meta - K ' and describes the character produced when the Meta key ( if you have one ) is depressed , and the k key is pressed .
The Meta key is labeled ALT on many keyboards .
On keyboards with two keys labeled ALT ( usually to either side of the space bar ) , the ALT on the left side is generally set to work as a Meta key .
The ALT key on the right may also be configured to work as a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier , such as a Compose key for typing accented characters .
If you do not have a Meta or ALT key , or another key working as a Meta key , the identical keystroke can be generated by typing ESC first , and then typing k .
Either process is known as metafying the k key .
The text M - C-k is read as ` Meta - Control - k ' and describes the character produced by metafying C-k .
In addition , several keys have their own names .
Specifically , DEL , ESC , LFD , SPC , RET , and TAB all stand for themselves when seen in this text , or in an init file ( see section 1.3 Readline Init File ) .
If your keyboard lacks a LFD key , typing C-j will produce the desired character .
The RET key may be labeled Return or Enter on some keyboards .
1.2 Readline Interaction
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text , only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled .
The Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text as you type it in , allowing you to just fix your typo , and not forcing you to retype the majority of the line .
Using these editing commands , you move the cursor to the place that needs correction , and delete or insert the text of the corrections .
Then , when you are satisfied with the line , you simply press RET .
You do not have to be at the end of the line to press RET ; the entire line is accepted regardless of the location of the cursor within the line .
1.2.1 Readline Bare Essentials
In order to enter characters into the line , simply type them .
The typed character appears where the cursor was , and then the cursor moves one space to the right .
If you mistype a character , you can use your erase character to back up and delete the mistyped character .
Sometimes you may mistype a character , and not notice the error until you have typed several other characters .
In that case , you can type C - b to move the cursor to the left , and then correct your mistake .
Afterwards , you can move the cursor to the right with C-f .
When you add text in the middle of a line , you will notice that characters to the right of the cursor are `pushed over ' to make room for the text that you have inserted .
Likewise , when you delete text behind the cursor , characters to the right of the cursor are `pulled back ' to fill in the blank space created by the removal of the text .
A list of the bare essentials for editing the text of an input line follows .
C-b Move back one character .
C-f
Move forward one character .
DEL or Backspace Delete the character to the left of the cursor .
C-d Delete the character underneath the cursor .
Printing characters
Insert the character into the line at the cursor .
C- _ or C-x C-u
Undo the last editing command .
You can undo all the way back to an empty line .
( Depending on your configuration , the Backspace key be set to delete the character to the left of the cursor and the DEL key set to delete the character underneath the cursor , like C-d , rather than the character to the left of the cursor . )
1.2.2 Readline Movement Commands
The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need in order to do editing of the input line .
For your convenience , many other commands have been added in addition to C- b , C-f , C-d , and DEL .
Here are some commands for moving more rapidly about the line .
C-a Move to the start of the line .
C-e Move to the end of the line .
M-f
Move forward a word , where a word is composed of letters and digits .
M-b
Move backward a word .
C-l Clear the screen , reprinting the current line at the top .
Notice how C-f moves forward a character , while M-f moves forward a word .
It is a loose convention that control keystrokes operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words .
1.2.3 Readline Killing Commands
Killing text means to delete the text from the line , but to save it away for later use , usually by yanking ( re-inserting ) it back into the line .
( `Cut ' and `paste ' are more recent jargon for `kill ' and `yank ' . )
If the description for a command says that it `kills ' text , then you can be sure that you can get the text back in a different ( or the same ) place later .
When you use a kill command , the text is saved in a kill - ring .
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together , so that when you yank it back , you get it all .
The kill ring is not line specific ; the text that you killed on a previously typed line is available to be yanked back later , when you are typing another line .
Here is the list of commands for killing text .
C-k Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line .
M-d Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word , or , if between words , to the end of the next word .
Word boundaries are the same as those used by M-f .
M- DEL
Kill from the cursor the start of the current word , or , if between words , to the start of the previous word .
Word boundaries are the same as those used by M-b .
C-w Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace .
This is different than M- DEL because the word boundaries differ .
Here is how to yank the text back into the line .
Yanking means to copy the most - recently - killed text from the kill buffer .
C-y Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor .
M-y Rotate the kill - ring , and yank the new top .
You can only do this if the prior command is C-y or M-y .
1.2.4 Readline Arguments
You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands .
Sometimes the argument acts as a repeat count , other times it is the sign of the argument that is significant .
If you pass a negative argument to a command which normally acts in a forward direction , that command will act in a backward direction .
For example , to kill text back to the start of the line , you might type `M -- C - k ' .
The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta digits before the command .
If the first `digit ' typed is a minus sign ( ` - ' ) , then the sign of the argument will be negative .
Once you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started , you can type the remainder of the digits , and then the command .
For example , to give the C-d command an argument of 10 , you could type `M - 1 0 C - d ' , which will delete the next ten characters on the input line .
1.2.5 Searching for Commands in the History
Readline provides commands for searching through the command history for lines containing a specified string .
There are two search modes : incremental and non-incremental .
Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string .
As each character of the search string is typed , Readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far .
An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry .
To search backward in the history for a particular string , type C-r .
Typing C-s searches forward through the history .
The characters present in the value of the isearch - terminators variable are used to terminate an incremental search .
If that variable has not been assigned a value , the ESC and C - J characters will terminate an incremental search .
C-g will abort an incremental search and restore the original line .
When the search is terminated , the history entry containing the search string becomes the current line .
To find other matching entries in the history list , type C-r or C-s as appropriate .
This will search backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far .
Any other key sequence bound to a Readline command will terminate the search and execute that command .
For instance , a RET will terminate the search and accept the line , thereby executing the command from the history list .
A movement command will terminate the search , make the last line found the current line , and begin editing .
Readline remembers the last incremental search string .
If two C-r s are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string , any remembered search string is used .
Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history lines .
The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line .
1.3 Readline Init File
Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs - like keybindings installed by default , it is possible to use a different set of keybindings .
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting commands in an inputrc file , conventionally in his home directory .
The name of this file is taken from the value of the environment variable INPUTRC .
If that variable is unset , the default is `~/.inputrc ' .
If that file does not exist or cannot be read , the ultimate default is ` /etc / inputrc ' .
When a program which uses the Readline library starts up , the init file is read , and the key bindings are set .
In addition , the C-x C-r command re-reads this init file , thus incorporating any changes that you might have made to it .
1.3.1 Readline Init File Syntax
There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the Readline init file .
Blank lines are ignored .
Lines beginning with a ` # ' are comments .
Lines beginning with a ` $ ' indicate conditional constructs ( see section 1.3.2 Conditional Init Constructs ) .
Other lines denote variable settings and key bindings .
Variable Settings
You can modify the run-time behavior of Readline by altering the values of variables in Readline using the set command within the init file .
The syntax is simple : set variable value
Here , for example , is how to change from the default Emacs - like key binding to use vi line editing commands : set editing - mode vi Variable names and values , where appropriate , are recognized without regard to case .
Unrecognized variable names are ignored .
Boolean variables ( those that can be set to on or off ) are set to on if the value is null or empty , on ( case - insensitive ) , or 1 .
Any other value results in the variable being set to off .
A great deal of run-time behavior is changeable with the following variables .
bell - style Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell .
If set to `none ' , Readline never rings the bell .
If set to `visible ' , Readline uses a visible bell if one is available .
If set to `audible ' ( the default ) , Readline attempts to ring the terminal 's bell .
bind - tty - special - chars
If set to `on ' ( the default ) , Readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel 's terminal driver to their Readline equivalents .
blink - matching - paren
If set to `on ' , Readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted .
The default is `off ' .
colored - completion - prefix
If set to `on ' , when listing completions , Readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color .
The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable .
The default is `off ' .
colored - stats
If set to `on ' , Readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type .
The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable .
The default is `off ' .
comment - begin
The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the insert - comment command is executed .
The default value is " # " . completion - display - width
The number of screen columns used to display possible matches when performing completion .
The value is ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width .
A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line .
The default value is - 1. completion - ignore - case
If set to `on ' , Readline performs filename matching and completion in a case - insensitive fashion .
The default value is `off ' .
completion - map - case
If set to `on ' , and completion - ignore - case is enabled , Readline treats hyphens ( ` -' ) and underscores ( ` _ ' ) as equivalent when performing case - insensitive filename matching and completion .
The default value is `off ' .
completion - prefix - display - length
The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification .
When set to a value greater than zero , common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions .
completion - query - items
The number of possible completions that determines when the user is asked whether the list of possibilities should be displayed .
If the number of possible completions is greater than this value , Readline will ask the user whether or not he wishes to view them ; otherwise , they are simply listed .
This variable must be set to an integer value greater than or equal to 0 .
A negative value means Readline should never ask .
The default limit is 100 . convert - meta
If set to `on ' , Readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an ESC character , converting them to a meta - prefixed key sequence .
The default value is `on ' , but will be set to `off ' if the locale is one that contains eight - bit characters .
disable - completion
If set to ` On ' , Readline will inhibit word completion .
Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to self - insert .
The default is `off ' . echo- control - characters
When set to `on ' , on operating systems that indicate they support it , readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard .
The default is `on ' .
editing - mode
The editing - mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is used .
By default , Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode , where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs .
This variable can be set to either `emacs ' or `vi ' .
emacs-mode - string
If the show - mode - in - prompt variable is enabled , this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active .
The value is expanded like a key binding , so the standard set of meta - and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available .
Use the ` \1 ' and ` \2 ' escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters , which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string .
The default is `@ ' .
enable - bracketed - paste
When set to ` On ' , Readline will configure the terminal in a way that will enable it to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters , instead of treating each character as if it had been read from the keyboard .
This can prevent pasted characters from being interpreted as editing commands .
The default is `off ' .
enable - keypad
When set to `on ' , Readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called .
Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys .
The default is `off ' .
enable - meta- key
When set to `on ' ,
Readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called .
On many terminals , the meta key is used to send eight - bit characters .
The default is `on ' .
expand - tilde
If set to `on ' , tilde expansion is performed when Readline attempts word completion .
The default is `off ' .
history - preserve - point
If set to `on ' , the history code attempts to place the point ( the current cursor position ) at the same location on each history line retrieved with previous - history or next - history .
The default is `off ' .
history - size
Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list .
If set to zero , any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved .
If set to a value less than zero , the number of history entries is not limited .
By default , the number of history entries is not limited .
If an attempt is made to set history - size to a non-numeric value , the maximum number of history entries will be set to 500. horizontal - scroll - mode
This variable can be set to either `on ' or `off ' .
Setting it to `on ' means that the text of the lines being edited will scroll horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than the width of the screen , instead of wrapping onto a new screen line .
By default , this variable is set to `off ' . input - meta
If set to `on ' , Readline will enable eight - bit input ( it will not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads ) , regardless of what the terminal claims it can support .
The default value is `off ' , but Readline will set it to `on ' if the locale contains eight - bit characters .
The name meta - flag is a synonym for this variable .
isearch - terminators
The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the character as a command ( see section 1.2.5 Searching for Commands in the History ) .
If this variable has not been given a value , the characters ESC and C - J will terminate an incremental search .
keymap Sets Readline 's idea of the current keymap for key binding commands .
Built - in keymap names are emacs , emacs - standard , emacs - meta , emacs-ctlx , vi , vi-move , vi-command , and vi-insert .
vi is equivalent to vi-command ( vi-move is also a synonym ) ; emacs is equivalent to emacs - standard .
Applications may add additional names .
The default value is emacs .
The value of the editing - mode variable also affects the default keymap .
keyseq - timeout Specifies the duration Readline will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence ( one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far , or can take additional input to complete a longer key sequence ) .
If no input is received within the timeout , Readline will use the shorter but complete key sequence .
Readline uses this value to determine whether or not input is available on the current input source ( rl_instream by default ) .
The value is specified in milliseconds , so a value of 1000 means that Readline will wait one second for additional input .
If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero , or to a non-numeric value , Readline will wait until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete .
The default value is 500 .
mark - directories
If set to `on ' , completed directory names have a slash appended .
The default is `on ' .
mark - modified - lines
This variable , when set to `on ' , causes Readline to display an asterisk ( ` * ' ) at the start of history lines which have been modified .
This variable is `off ' by default .
mark - symlinked - directories
If set to `on ' , completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended ( subject to the value of mark - directories ) .
The default is `off ' .
match - hidden - files
This variable , when set to `on ' , causes Readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' ( hidden files ) when performing filename completion .
If set to `off ' , the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed .
This variable is `on ' by default .
menu - complete - display - prefix
If set to `on ' , menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions ( which may be empty ) before cycling through the list .
The default is `off ' . output - meta
If set to `on ' , Readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta - prefixed escape sequence .
The default is `off ' , but Readline will set it to `on ' if the locale contains eight - bit characters .
page - completions
If set to `on ' , Readline uses an internal more - like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time .
This variable is `on ' by default .
print - completions - horizontally
If set to `on ' , Readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order , rather than down the screen .
The default is `off ' .
revert - all - at - newline
If set to `on ' , Readline will undo all changes to history lines before returning when accept - line is executed .
By default , history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across calls to readline .
The default is `off ' .
show - all - if - ambiguous
This alters the default behavior of the completion functions .
If set to `on ' , words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell .
The default value is `off ' .
show - all - if - unmodified
This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to show - all - if - ambiguous .
If set to `on ' , words which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion ( the possible completions do n't share a common prefix ) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell .
The default value is `off ' .
show - mode - in - prompt
If set to `on ' , add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode : emacs , vi command , or vi insertion .
The mode strings are user - settable ( e.g. , emacs - mode - string ) .
The default value is `off ' . skip - completed - text
If set to `on ' , this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line .
It 's only active when performing completion in the middle of a word .
If enabled , readline does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed , so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated .
For instance , if this is enabled , attempting completion when the cursor is after the `e ' in ` Makefile ' will result in ` Makefile ' rather than ` Makefilefile ' , assuming there is a single possible completion .
The default value is `off ' .
vi-cmd - mode - string
If the show - mode - in - prompt variable is enabled , this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode .
The value is expanded like a key binding , so the standard set of meta - and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available .
Use the ` \1 ' and ` \2 ' escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters , which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string .
The default is ` ( cmd ) ' .
vi-ins - mode - string
If the show - mode - in - prompt variable is enabled , this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode .
The value is expanded like a key binding , so the standard set of meta - and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available .
Use the ` \1 ' and ` \2 ' escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters , which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string .
The default is ` ( ins ) ' .
visible - stats
If set to `on ' , a character denoting a file 's type is appended to the filename when listing possible completions .
The default is `off ' .
Key Bindings
The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is simple .
First you need to find the name of the command that you want to change .
The following sections contain tables of the command name , the default keybinding , if any , and a short description of what the command does .
Once you know the name of the command , simply place on a line in the init file the name of the key you wish to bind the command to , a colon , and then the name of the command .
There can be no space between the key name and the colon -- that will be interpreted as part of the key name .
The name of the key can be expressed in different ways , depending on what you find most comfortable .
In addition to command names , readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed ( a macro ) . keyname : function - name or macro keyname is the name of a key spelled out in English .
For example : Control -u : universal - argument Meta-Rubout : backward - kill - word Control - o : " > output "
In the example above , C-u is bound to the function universal - argument , M- DEL is bound to the function backward - kill - word , and C - o is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand side ( that is , to insert the text `> output ' into the line ) .
A number of symbolic character names are recognized while processing this key binding syntax : DEL , ESC , ESCAPE , LFD , NEWLINE , RET , RETURN , RUBOUT , SPACE , SPC , and TAB . " keyseq " : function - name or macro keyseq differs from keyname above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence can be specified , by placing the key sequence in double quotes .
Some GNU
Emacs style key escapes can be used , as in the following example , but the special character names are not recognized .
" \C-u " : universal - argument " \C - x \ C-r " : re-read - init - file " \e [ 11 ~ " : " Function Key 1 "
In the above example , C-u is again bound to the function universal - argument ( just as it was in the first example ) , ` C-x C-r ' is bound to the function re-read - init - file , and ` ESC [ 1 1 ~ ' is bound to insert the text ` Function Key 1 ' .
The following GNU Emacs style escape sequences are available when specifying key sequences : \ C- control prefix \ M- meta prefix \e an escape character \\ backslash \ " " , a double quotation mark \' ' , a single quote or apostrophe
In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences , a second set of backslash escapes is available : \a alert ( bell ) \b backspace \d delete \f form feed
newline \r carriage return \t horizontal tab \v vertical tab \ nnn the eight - bit character whose value is the octal value nnn ( one to three digits ) \x HH the eight - bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH ( one or two hex digits )
When entering the text of a macro , single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro definition .
Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name .
In the macro body , the backslash escapes described above are expanded .
Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text , including ` " ' and ` '' .
For example , the following binding will make ` C- x \' insert a single `\ ' into the line : " \C- x\\ " : " \ \ "
1.3.2 Conditional Init Constructs
Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests .
There are four parser directives used .
$ if The $ if construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode , the terminal being used , or the application using Readline .
The text of the test , after any comparison operator , extends to the end of the line ; unless otherwise noted , no characters are required to isolate it .
mode
The mode= form of the $ if directive is used to test whether Readline is in emacs or vi mode .
This may be used in conjunction with the `set keymap ' command , for instance , to set bindings in the emacs - standard and emacs - ctlx keymaps only if Readline is starting out in emacs mode .
term
The term= form may be used to include terminal - specific key bindings , perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal 's function keys .
The word on the right side of the `= ' is tested against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first `-' .
This allows sun to match both sun and sun-cmd , for instance .
version
The version test may be used to perform comparisons against specific Readline versions .
The version expands to the current Readline version .
The set of comparison operators includes `= ' ( and `== ' ) , `!=' , `< =' , `>=' , `< ' , and ` >' .
The version number supplied on the right side of the operator consists of a major version number , an optional decimal point , and an optional minor version ( e.g. , ` 7.1 ' ) .
If the minor version is omitted , it is assumed to be `0 ' .
The operator may be separated from the string version and from the version number argument by whitespace .
The following example sets a variable if the Readline version being used is 7.0 or newer : $ if version >= 7.0 set show - mode - in - prompt on $endif application
The application construct is used to include application - specific settings .
Each program using the Readline library sets the application name , and you can test for a particular value .
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program .
For instance , the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash : $ if Bash # Quote the current or previous word " \C- xq " : " \eb \ " \ef\ " " $ endif variable
The variable construct provides simple equality tests for Readline variables and values .
The permitted comparison operators are `= ' , `== ' , and `!=' .
The variable name must be separated from the comparison operator by whitespace ; the operator may be separated from the value on the right hand side by whitespace .
Both string and boolean variables may be tested .
Boolean variables must be tested against the values on and off .
The following example is equivalent to the mode=emacs test described above : $ if editing - mode == emacs set show - mode - in - prompt on $endif $endif
This command , as seen in the previous example , terminates an $ if command .
$ else Commands in this branch of the $ if directive are executed if the test fails .
$ include
This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands and bindings from that file .
For example , the following directive reads from ` /etc/ inputrc ' : $ include /etc/inputrc
1.3.3 Sample Init File
Here is an example of an inputrc file .
This illustrates key binding , variable assignment , and conditional syntax .
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for # programs that use the GNU Readline library .
Existing # programs include FTP , Bash , and GDB .
# #
You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r. # Lines beginning with ' # ' are comments .
# # First , include any system - wide bindings and variable # assignments from /etc / Inputrc $ include /etc / Inputrc # #
Set various bindings for emacs mode .
set editing - mode emacs $ if mode=emacs Meta - Control - h : backward - kill - word Text after the function name is ignored # # Arrow keys in keypad mode # # " \M - OD " : backward - char # " \M - OC " : forward - char # " \M - OA " : previous - history # " \M - OB " : next - history # # Arrow keys in ANSI mode # " \M - [ D " : backward - char " \M - [ C " : forward - char " \M - [ A " : previous - history " \M - [ B " : next - history # # Arrow keys in 8 bit keypad mode # # " \M-\C- OD " : backward - char #" \M-\C- OC " : forward - char # " \M-\C - OA " : previous - history # " \M-\C - OB " : next - history # # Arrow keys in 8 bit ANSI mode # # " \M-\C -[ D " : backward - char # " \M-\C - [ C " : forward - char # " \M -\C - [ A " : previous - history # " \M -\C - [ B " : next - history C-q : quoted - insert $ endif #
An old - style binding .
This happens to be the default .

1.4 Bindable Readline Commands
This section describes Readline commands that may be bound to key sequences .
Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default .
In the following descriptions , point refers to the current cursor position , and mark refers to a cursor position saved by the set - mark command .
The text between the point and mark is referred to as the region .
1.4.1 Commands For Moving
beginning - of - line ( C-a ) Move to the start of the current line .
end - of - line ( C-e ) Move to the end of the line .
forward - char ( C - f ) Move forward a character .
backward - char ( C- b ) Move back a character .
forward - word ( M - f ) Move forward to the end of the next word .
Words are composed of letters and digits .
backward - word ( M - b ) Move back to the start of the current or previous word .
Words are composed of letters and digits .
previous - screen- line ()
Attempt to move point to the same physical screen column on the previous physical screen line .
This will not have the desired effect if the current Readline line does not take up more than one physical line or if point is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width .
next - screen - line ()
Attempt to move point to the same physical screen column on the next physical screen line .
This will not have the desired effect if the current Readline line does not take up more than one physical line or if the length of the current Readline line is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width .
clear - screen ( C-l ) Clear the screen and redraw the current line , leaving the current line at the top of the screen .
redraw - current - line () Refresh the current line .
By default , this is unbound .
1.4.2 Commands For Manipulating The History
accept - line ( Newline or Return )
Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is .
If this line is non-empty , it may be added to the history list for future recall with add_history ( ) .
If this line is a modified history line , the history line is restored to its original state .
previous - history ( C - p ) Move `back ' through the history list , fetching the previous command .
next - history ( C-n ) Move `forward ' through the history list , fetching the next command .
beginning - of - history ( M-<)
Move to the first line in the history .
end - of - history ( M ->)
Move to the end of the input history , i.e. , the line currently being entered .
reverse - search - history ( C-r ) Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up ' through the history as necessary .
This is an incremental search .
forward - search - history ( C-s ) Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down ' through the history as necessary .
This is an incremental search .
non-incremental - reverse - search - history ( M - p ) Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up ' through the history as necessary using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user .
The search string may match anywhere in a history line .
non-incremental - forward - search - history ( M - n ) Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down ' through the history as necessary using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user .
The search string may match anywhere in a history line .
history - search - forward ()
Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point .
The search string must match at the beginning of a history line .
This is a non-incremental search .
By default , this command is unbound .
history - search - backward ()
Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point .
The search string must match at the beginning of a history line .
This is a non-incremental search .
By default , this command is unbound .
history - substring - search - forward ()
Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point .
The search string may match anywhere in a history line .
This is a non-incremental search .
By default , this command is unbound .
history - substring - search - backward ()
Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point .
The search string may match anywhere in a history line .
This is a non-incremental search .
By default , this command is unbound .
yank - nth - arg ( M - C-y ) Insert the first argument to the previous command ( usually the second word on the previous line ) at point .
With an argument n , insert the n th word from the previous command ( the words in the previous command begin with word 0 ) .
A negative argument inserts the n th word from the end of the previous command .
Once the argument n is computed , the argument is extracted as if the ` !
n ' history expansion had been specified .
yank - last - arg ( M -. or M-_ )
Insert last argument to the previous command ( the last word of the previous history entry ) .
With a numeric argument , behave exactly like yank - nth - arg .
Successive calls to yank - last - arg move back through the history list , inserting the last word ( or the word specified by the argument to the first call ) of each line in turn .
Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls determines the direction to move through the history .
A negative argument switches the direction through the history ( back or forward ) .
The history expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument , as if the ` !$ ' history expansion had been specified .
1.4.3 Commands For Changing
Text
end - of - file ( usually C-d )
The character indicating end - of - file as set , for example , by stty .
If this character is read when there are no characters on the line , and point is at the beginning of the line , Readline interprets it as the end of input and returns EOF .
delete - char ( C-d ) Delete the character at point .
If this function is bound to the same character as the tty EOF character , as C -d commonly is , see above for the effects .
backward - delete - char ( Rubout )
Delete the character behind the cursor .
A numeric argument means to kill the characters instead of deleting them .
forward - backward - delete- char ()
Delete the character under the cursor , unless the cursor is at the end of the line , in which case the character behind the cursor is deleted .
By default , this is not bound to a key .
quoted - insert ( C- q or C-v )
Add the next character typed to the line verbatim .
This is how to insert key sequences like C-q , for example .
tab-insert ( M- TAB ) Insert a tab character .
self - insert ( a , b , A , 1 , ! , ... )
Insert yourself .
bracketed - paste - begin ()
This function is intended to be bound to the " bracketed paste " escape sequence sent by some terminals , and such a binding is assigned by default .
It allows Readline to insert the pasted text as a single unit without treating each character as if it had been read from the keyboard .
The characters are inserted as if each one was bound to self - insert instead of executing any editing commands .
transpose - chars ( C-t ) Drag the character before the cursor forward over the character at the cursor , moving the cursor forward as well .
If the insertion point is at the end of the line , then this transposes the last two characters of the line .
Negative arguments have no effect .
transpose - words ( M - t ) Drag the word before point past the word after point , moving point past that word as well .
If the insertion point is at the end of the line , this transposes the last two words on the line .
upcase - word ( M - u ) Uppercase the current ( or following ) word .
With a negative argument , uppercase the previous word , but do not move the cursor .
downcase - word ( M - l ) Lowercase the current ( or following ) word .
With a negative argument , lowercase the previous word , but do not move the cursor .
capitalize - word ( M - c ) Capitalize the current ( or following ) word .
With a negative argument , capitalize the previous word , but do not move the cursor .
overwrite - mode () Toggle overwrite mode .
With an explicit positive numeric argument , switches to overwrite mode .
With an explicit non-positive numeric argument , switches to insert mode .
This command affects only emacs mode ; vi mode does overwrite differently .
Each call to readline ( ) starts in insert mode .
In overwrite mode , characters bound to self - insert replace the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right .
Characters bound to backward - delete - char replace the character before point with a space .
By default , this command is unbound .
1.4.4 Killing And Yanking
kill - line ( C-k ) Kill the text from point to the end of the line .
backward - kill - line ( C-x Rubout )
Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line .
unix - line - discard ( C-u ) Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line .
kill - whole - line () Kill all characters on the current line , no matter where point is .
By default , this is unbound .
kill - word ( M-d ) Kill from point to the end of the current word , or if between words , to the end of the next word .
Word boundaries are the same as forward - word .
backward - kill - word ( M- DEL )
Kill the word behind point .
Word boundaries are the same as backward - word .
unix - word - rubout ( C-w ) Kill the word behind point , using white space as a word boundary .
The killed text is saved on the kill - ring .
unix - filename - rubout ()
Kill the word behind point , using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries .
The killed text is saved on the kill - ring .
delete - horizontal - space () Delete all spaces and tabs around point .
By default , this is unbound .
kill - region ()
Kill the text in the current region .
By default , this command is unbound .
copy - region - as - kill ()
Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer , so it can be yanked right away .
By default , this command is unbound .
copy - backward - word ()
Copy the word before point to the kill buffer .
The word boundaries are the same as backward - word .
By default , this command is unbound .
copy - forward - word ()
Copy the word following point to the kill buffer .
The word boundaries are the same as forward - word .
By default , this command is unbound .
yank ( C-y ) Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point .
yank - pop ( M-y ) Rotate the kill - ring , and yank the new top .
You can only do this if the prior command is yank or yank - pop .
1.4.5 Specifying Numeric Arguments
digit - argument ( M - 0 , M - 1 , ... M-- )
Add this digit to the argument already accumulating , or start a new argument .
M-- starts a negative argument .
universal - argument ()
This is another way to specify an argument .
If this command is followed by one or more digits , optionally with a leading minus sign , those digits define the argument .
If the command is followed by digits , executing universal - argument again ends the numeric argument , but is otherwise ignored .
As a special case , if this command is immediately followed by a character that is neither a digit nor minus sign , the argument count for the next command is multiplied by four .
The argument count is initially one , so executing this function the first time makes the argument count four , a second time makes the argument count sixteen , and so on .
By default , this is not bound to a key .
1.4.6 Letting Readline Type For You
complete ( TAB ) Attempt to perform completion on the text before point .
The actual completion performed is application - specific .
The default is filename completion .
possible - completions ( M-? )
List the possible completions of the text before point .
When displaying completions , Readline sets the number of columns used for display to the value of completion - display - width , the value of the environment variable COLUMNS , or the screen width , in that order .
insert - completions ( M-*)
Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by possible - completions .
menu - complete ()
Similar to complete , but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions .
Repeated execution of menu - complete steps through the list of possible completions , inserting each match in turn .
At the end of the list of completions , the bell is rung ( subject to the setting of bell - style ) and the original text is restored .
An argument of n moves n positions forward in the list of matches ; a negative argument may be used to move backward through the list .
This command is intended to be bound to TAB , but is unbound by default .
menu - complete - backward () Identical to menu - complete , but moves backward through the list of possible completions , as if menu - complete had been given a negative argument .
delete - char - or - list ()
Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line ( like delete - char ) .
If at the end of the line , behaves identically to possible - completions .
This command is unbound by default .
1.4.7 Keyboard Macros
start - kbd- macro ( C-x ()
Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro .
end - kbd- macro ( C-x ) )
Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro and save the definition .
call - last - kbd- macro ( C-x e )
Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined , by making the characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard .
print - last - kbd- macro ()
Print the last keboard macro defined in a format suitable for the inputrc file .
1.4.8 Some Miscellaneous Commands
re - read - init - file ( C- x C-r ) Read in the contents of the inputrc file , and incorporate any bindings or variable assignments found there .
abort ( C-g ) Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal 's bell ( subject to the setting of bell - style ) .
do-lowercase-version ( M - A , M - B , M- x , ... )
If the metafied character x is upper case , run the command that is bound to the corresponding metafied lower case character .
The behavior is undefined if x is already lower case .
prefix - meta ( ESC ) Metafy the next character typed .
This is for keyboards without a meta key .
Typing ` ESC f ' is equivalent to typing M-f . undo ( C - _ or C- x C-u ) Incremental undo , separately remembered for each line .
revert - line ( M-r ) Undo all changes made to this line .
This is like executing the undo command enough times to get back to the beginning .
tilde - expand ( M -~ ) Perform tilde expansion on the current word .
set - mark ( C-@ )
Set the mark to the point .
If a numeric argument is supplied , the mark is set to that position .
exchange - point - and - mark ( C- x C-x ) Swap the point with the mark .
The current cursor position is set to the saved position , and the old cursor position is saved as the mark .
character - search ( C - ] )
A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of that character .
A negative count searches for previous occurrences .
character - search - backward ( M - C - ] )
A character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence of that character .
A negative count searches for subsequent occurrences .
skip - csi- sequence ()
Read enough characters to consume a multi- key sequence such as those defined for keys like Home and End .
Such sequences begin with a Control Sequence Indicator ( CSI ) , usually ESC - [ .
If this sequence is bound to " \e[ " , keys producing such sequences will have no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command , instead of inserting stray characters into the editing buffer .
This is unbound by default , but usually bound to ESC - [ .
insert - comment ( M -# ) Without a numeric argument , the value of the comment - begin variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line .
If a numeric argument is supplied , this command acts as a toggle : if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of comment - begin , the value is inserted , otherwise the characters in comment - begin are deleted from the beginning of the line .
In either case , the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed .
dump-functions ()
Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the Readline output stream .
If a numeric argument is supplied , the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an inputrc file .
This command is unbound by default .
dump-variables ()
Print all of the settable variables and their values to the Readline output stream .
If a numeric argument is supplied , the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an inputrc file .
This command is unbound by default .
dump-macros ()
Print all of the Readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output .
If a numeric argument is supplied , the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an inputrc file .
This command is unbound by default .
emacs-editing - mode ( C-e )
When in vi command mode , this causes a switch to emacs editing mode .
vi-editing - mode ( M - C - j )
When in emacs editing mode , this causes a switch to vi editing mode .
1.5 Readline vi Mode
While the Readline library does not have a full set of vi editing functions , it does contain enough to allow simple editing of the line .
The Readline vi mode behaves as specified in the POSIX standard .
In order to switch interactively between emacs and vi editing modes , use the command M - C-j ( bound to emacs - editing - mode when in vi mode and to vi-editing - mode in emacs mode ) .
The Readline default is emacs mode .
When you enter a line in vi mode , you are already placed in `insertion ' mode , as if you had typed an `i ' .
Pressing ESC switches you into `command ' mode , where you can edit the text of the line with the standard vi movement keys , move to previous history lines with `k ' and subsequent lines with `j ' , and so forth .

A " Secondary Section " is a named appendix or a front - matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document 's overall subject ( or to related matters ) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject .
( Thus , if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics , a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics . )
The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters , or of legal , commercial , philosophical , ethical or political position regarding them .
The " Invariant Sections " are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated , as being those of Invariant Sections , in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License .
If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant .
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections .
If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none .
The " Cover Texts " are certain short passages of text that are listed , as Front - Cover Texts or Back - Cover Texts , in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License .
A Front -Cover
Text may be at most 5 words , and a Back - Cover Text may be at most 25 words .
A " Transparent " copy of the Document means a machine - readable copy , represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public , that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or ( for images composed of pixels ) generic paint programs or ( for drawings ) some widely available drawing editor , and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters .
A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup , or absence of markup , has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent .
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text .
A copy that is not " Transparent " is called " Opaque " .
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup , Texinfo input format , LaTeX input format , SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD , and standard - conforming simple HTML , PostScript or PDF designed for human modification .
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG , XCF and JPG .
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors , SGML or XML for which the DTD and / or processing tools are not generally available , and the machine - generated HTML , PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only .
The " Title Page " means , for a printed book , the title page itself , plus such following pages as are needed to hold , legibly , the material this License requires to appear in the title page .
For works in formats which do not have any title page as such , " Title Page " means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work 's title , preceding the beginning of the body of the text .
The " publisher " means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public .
A section " Entitled XYZ " means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language .
( Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below , such as " Acknowledgements " , " Dedications " , " Endorsements " , or " History " . )
To " Preserve the Title " of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section " Entitled XYZ " according to this definition .
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document .
These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License , but only as regards disclaiming warranties : any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License .
VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium , either commercially or noncommercially , provided that this License , the copyright notices , and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies , and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License .
You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute .
However , you may accept compensation in exchange for copies .
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3 .
You may also lend copies , under the same conditions stated above , and you may publicly display copies .
COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies ( or copies in media that commonly have printed covers ) of the Document , numbering more than 100 , and the Document 's license notice requires Cover Texts , you must enclose the copies in covers that carry , clearly and legibly , all these Cover Texts : Front - Cover Texts on the front cover , and Back - Cover Texts on the back cover .
Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies .
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible .
You may add other material on the covers in addition .
Copying with changes limited to the covers , as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions , can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects .
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly , you should put the first ones listed ( as many as fit reasonably ) on the actual cover , and continue the rest onto adjacent pages .
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100 , you must either include a machine - readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy , or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer - network location from which the general network - using public has access to download using public - standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document , free of added material .
If you use the latter option , you must take reasonably prudent steps , when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity , to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy ( directly or through your agents or retailers ) of that edition to the public .
It is requested , but not required , that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies , to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document .
MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above , provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License , with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document , thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it .
In addition , you must do these things in the Modified Version : Use in the Title Page ( and on the covers , if any ) a title distinct from that of the Document , and from those of previous versions ( which should , if there were any , be listed in the History section of the Document ) .
You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission .
List on the Title Page , as authors , one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version , together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document ( all of its principal authors , if it has fewer than five ) , unless they release you from this requirement .
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version , as the publisher .
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document .
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices .
Include , immediately after the copyright notices , a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License , in the form shown in the Addendum below .
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document 's license notice .
Include an unaltered copy of this License .
Preserve the section Entitled " History " , Preserve its Title , and add to it an item stating at least the title , year , new authors , and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page .
If there is no section Entitled " History " in the Document , create one stating the title , year , authors , and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page , then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence .
Preserve the network location , if any , given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document , and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on .
These may be placed in the " History " section .
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself , or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission .
For any section Entitled " Acknowledgements " or " Dedications " , Preserve the Title of the section , and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and / or dedications given therein .
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document , unaltered in their text and in their titles .
Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles .
Delete any section Entitled " Endorsements " .
Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version .
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled " Endorsements " or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section .
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers .
If the Modified Version includes new front - matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document , you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant .
To do this , add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version 's license notice .
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles .
You may add a section Entitled " Endorsements " , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties -- for example , statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard .
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front - Cover Text , and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back - Cover Text , to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version .
Only one passage of Front - Cover Text and one of Back - Cover Text may be added by ( or through arrangements made by ) any one entity .
If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover , previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of , you may not add another ; but you may replace the old one , on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one .
The author(s ) and publisher (s ) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version .
COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License , under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions , provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents , unmodified , and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice , and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers .
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License , and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy .
If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents , make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it , in parentheses , the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known , or else a unique number .
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work .
In the combination , you must combine any sections Entitled " History " in the various original documents , forming one section Entitled " History " ; likewise combine any sections Entitled " Acknowledgements " , and any sections Entitled " Dedications " .
You must delete all sections Entitled " Endorsements . "
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License , and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection , provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects .
You may extract a single document from such a collection , and distribute it individually under this License , provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document , and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document .
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works , in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium , is called an " aggregate " if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation 's users beyond what the individual works permit .
When the Document is included in an aggregate , this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document .
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document , then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate , the Document 's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate , or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form .
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate .
TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification , so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4 .
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders , but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections .
You may include a translation of this License , and all the license notices in the Document , and any Warranty Disclaimers , provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers .
In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer , the original version will prevail .
If a section in the Document is Entitled " Acknowledgements " , " Dedications " , or " History " , the requirement ( section 4 ) to Preserve its Title ( section 1 ) will typically require changing the actual title .
TERMINATION

The three or four years you will spend at college or university should be some of the best years of your life .
You have a rare privilege : a few years to devote most of your time to learning about yourself , your culture , your society and your areas of interest .
Understand that your real purpose here is not only knowledge but also to develop a life guided by wisdom and reason .
You have moved out of your parents ’ home .
You are meeting new people and starting to make your own decisions , your own life .
You are now pretty much your own boss .
But you are also on your own and that can be unnerving , lonely and a little scary .
This is your opportunity to struggle with your new environment , to understand your challenges through reflection , insight and the help of others .
Use the support systems at the university .
You are never alone , and the very act of seeking help or advice , of opening up to others , may become a vital part of your education – of your experience of learning about yourself through others .
Speaking of dialogue , I recently met a woman at an alumni dinner , a graduate of my department .
She had graduated with high B average and now works in a public affairs agency .
I ’ll call her Simone .
It was a beautiful night – a fancy dinner , elegant surroundings and quiet , meaningful conversations among alumni and professors who shared the bond of having been members of the McMaster community .
I was seated beside Simone and we chatted for much of the evening , mostly sharing memories : people we knew in common from her grad year , observations that she and classmates had made about faculty quirks of dress or mannerism , little things .
We laughed a lot and reminisced .
At the end of the evening , as we got up to say goodnight , she looked at me fixedly and said :
“ Alex , I want you to tell your students something from me .
Do you know what I really gained from my years at Mac ? ”
I shook my head , surprised by her suddenly intense expression .
“ I gained understanding .
Understanding that the world is complicated and profound , even when it is trying to be simple and ridiculous .
Understanding about how to learn and how to know .
Above all , I understood that although the world is sometimes sad , it is never boring and that I should love it , and try to improve it , even though it sometimes seems to betray me . ”
I was surprised by her comments .
She had obviously thought about this very deeply .
“ Alex , I did n’t understand until maybe the middle of third year .
I finally understood that education is about storytelling – the stories of art and science , society and engineering , health and commerce and how they all weave together into the grand story of our lives together . ”
Heed Simone ’s advice .
It is wise .
Learn to catch the storyline of the courses and conversations and relationships and solitary epiphanies you will experience at college or university .
It is n’t easy .
It requires a lot of hard work .
It requires a personal sense of purpose .
It requires an open heart and a seeking mind .
But the payoff is amazing : a life that is transformed from mere existence to living .
From shades of gray to millions of colours .
A life in which every experience becomes a possibility for adventure , growth and love .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Recent events in Afghanistan seem to have given Obama pause – and with good reason .
If there is an evolving Obama doctrine underlying the administration ’s foreign policy , it is a focus on the consent of the governed and civil society .
( I consider this a marked step forward from the “ Democracy ! ! ” approach by the Bush White House . )
On top of this , counterinsurgency doctrine holds that we must have a partner seen by the local population to be legitimate in order to succeed in containing insurgent forces .
The massive electoral fraud in the recent Afghan elections then undermined both the core principle the Obama administration has put forward in its foreign policy and any chance of military success using a counterinsurgency strategy .
Restoring the legitimacy of the Afghan government thus has been one of the major goals of the Obama administration in the past month as they attempted to salvage the situation .
The obvious solution was for Karzai to allow some of the many millions of votes for him that were clearly the result of fraud to be thrown out thus ensuring a runoff between the top two contenders for the presidency .
Though it would seem to be in Karzai ’s own interest to be seen as legitimate as well as America ’s , he apparently did not see it the same way – and believed American forces would protect him and ensure he remained in power even if he blatantly stole the election .
It thus took significant efforts by the Obama administration to push him to act in both his own and America ’s interests .
According to Ahmed Rashid , prominent Afghani author and reporter , writing for the New York Review of Books blog there were two main factors that pushed Karzai to finally consent to “ enduring ” a runoff election :
He finally became convinced that Obama was serious about not sending in more soldiers to secure the country – as he realized Obama was less concerned about “ looking tough ” in the eyes of the world and more interested in making sure American soldiers were fighting a winnable war for American interests and was willing to cut Karzai loose if that turned out to be in America ’s interest .
( Karzai apparently believed Bush would commit to supporting him no matter what , as Bush had a “ chummy , ” mentor - mentee type relationship with the Afghan leader .
Obama deliberately kept his distance to keep the focus on America ’s interest in the region . )
Karzai , as a vain man , did not appreciate dealing with anyone who had ever publicly said a critical word about him ; thus the administration used officials who had previously criticized him to ramp up the pressure while three of the few people in Washington who never had ( John Kerry , Rahm Emanuel , and Karl Eikenberry ) were tasked with cajoling him into complying .
It seems quite silly that despite American and Afghan interests coinciding on this , it took so much attention to the vanities of a corrupt leader in order to persuade him to act in his own and his main sponsor ’s interests .
Despite elaborate theories about how history works , to get things done , to implement a larger agenda , you need to pay attention to petty personal details .
On such petty - ness , the fate of the world apparently too often turns .

Christians are a tiny minority in Pakistan .
They are barred from running for president .
Mr. Fanish was arrested on Saturday in the village of Jathikai and charged with blasphemy , a statute often used against minorities in Pakistan , human rights groups say .
A Muslim family accused him of desecrating a Koran , but his local supporters said the family claimed that he had been admiring their daughter .
Whatever the case , he was taken to a jail in Sialkot , the district capital , and after two days of police questioning he was found dead in his cell , touching off Christian riots .
On Wednesday , the provincial government ordered an investigation into the death and are investigating whether to charge the jail staff with negligence .
The inspector general of prisons for Punjab Province , Kokab Nadeem Warriach , declined to say whether he believed that Mr. Fanish ’s death was allowed or perpetrated by police guards .
He said by telephone that three prison officials had been suspended , and that the investigation ordered by the provincial government would conclude this week .
The police said Mr. Fanish had hanged himself in his cell , using a strip of material ripped from his clothing .
The Joint Action Committee for People ’s Rights , an alliance of more than 30 human rights groups , said in a statement that it had talked to witnesses who saw marks of torture on his body .
The Spotted Owl likes trees , big trees .
When nesting , it does n’t settle for young saplings or even partially mature second growth .
It places its nest high up in the largest original trees in western forests .
And it likes to roam .
Each pair of nesting owls can claim an area up to two miles in diameter around its nest .
The forest industry also likes these monster trees .
The quality and amount of straight grain wood in one ancient tree is almost unfathomable .
Old growth timber has all the characteristics that make it extremely desirable and valuable .
There is no comparison in quality between a board logged from old growth and one cut from fast growing , timber farm trees .
The forest industry has been attracted to these ancients trees so much , there is barely ten percent of our original forest left in western forests .
The ratio east of the Mississippi is even lower .
With the exception of the Great Plains and the western low deserts , this country was once covered with trees that were hundreds to thousands of years old .
It was the most extensive collection of temperate forests on the planet .
Those remaining are for the most part small patches in steep and hard to access locations .
Some of these virgin stands have Spotted Owls in them .
It is estimated there are about 2.000 pairs surviving today .
In 1990 , life changed in the western forests .
The Fish and Wildlife Department declared the Spotted Owl an endangered species .
After numerous court cases and government studies , it was decided continued logging of the ancient forests would finish off the species .
In 1991 , the US District Court set the requirements : in a radius of 1.3 miles around a spotted owl nest , logging companies must leave 40 % of the ancient trees on national forest property .
While this was pitted as the typical government land grab , intrusion into our private property rights for the sake of a bird , this was seldom the case .
Old growth forests had become even a rarer bird on private property .
Most private western timber property is owned by beneficiaries of the massive federal land giveaways to the railroads that began in earnest during the tenure of president Abraham Lincoln .
About ten percent of our continental land mass , mostly mature primitive forests and mineral properties , has been given away in the form of railroad grants .
These gifts were not payments for laying tracks , those generous checks came later .
They were given to provide asset backing for capital loans .
When the tracks were laid , Congress met secretly and changed the wording to allow the corporations to keep the lands that were “ loaned out ” to them .
National forest service lands have been the backyard of the corporate timber firms .
Literally .
The land grants were given away as sections in checkerboard fashion , supposedly to increase the worth of the federal lands with the development of the railroad .
What this checkerboard layout did do was tie up the landlocked sections .
It appropriated access to public lands to private corporations that had already been given alternate sections .
When it came to board feet , these corporations had in essence been given twice as much property .
If possession is nine tenths of the law , access to possession is probably at least half .
The forest service has used other methods to advantage resource corporations .
They use a system very similar to the Federal Reserve : release large amounts to selected traders at much discounted prices .
Auction the public lands in amounts so large that only the biggest and most capitalized corporations will be capable of bidding , which insures the timber goes at bargain basement prices .
In this way , the public worth is used to grow select private profit .
There are other tricks that are used to keep the cost down .
Often in road less areas , the contract for road building is awarded to the winning bidder of the timber auction on a non-competitive basis .
Costs for roads into the logging areas of 70 % to 80 % of the auction total are not uncommon .
This link is a very interesting account of the continuing sellout of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska .
The forest service also uses creative accounting tricks to make it seem like they earn more money off timber sales than they actually do .
All counties that experience federal timber sales receive a portion of the sales to compensate for the removal of trees .
The Forest Service accountants deduct this amount after figuring net gain from a sale .
They have also appreciated some roads within the forests , most of them dirt or at best gravel , over centuries rather than a couple of decades , to lower their costs .
Despite ownership of what was the most abundant temperate forest on the planet , the Forest Service , guardian of that same forest , continually loses the taxpayer ’s money .
In plain and simple terms , the taxpayer pays selected corporations to log our forests in the interest of private profit .
I was fortunate to live in the heart of the private timber land of western Oregon during the spotted owl controversy .
Across our road were 200 acre tracts of privately owned timbered property .
From the western line our neighbor ’s 200 acre properties to the Oregon Coast , a straight line distance of about forty miles , were the quasi private properties of Weyerhaeuser Corporation , a direct beneficiary of the railroad grants .
This is a common pattern of ownership on the west coast from north of San Francisco to the Canadian border , interspersed with chunks of state forests .
The national forests are predominately in the Sierra Nevada and Oregon Cascade ranges , although coastal sections of Washington State are federally owned .
Much of these publicly owned coastal Washington forests are due to swaps with the railroads , in which giveaway lands were given back in exchange for other valuable public properties .
The spotted owl ruling hampered the public giveaway .
No longer could these large corporations pick and choose what public lands they wished to log .
This drove up wholesale timber [ price paid for logs at the mills ] prices from less than two hundred dollars a thousand to over six hundred .
While the owl logging restrictions seldom affected the small timber lot owner , the higher prices enabled them to market trees that had been unmarketable for years , due to prices depressed by discounted public auctions .
Mills offered to purchase small lots of trees , sometimes as few as five or six , and even helped the owner find a logger .
Some went to so far as to set up “ pickup ” of these trees .
Previously , the land owner was responsible for trucking the trees to the mill where the mill could reject the trees outright or offer a low ball figure for logs that already had quite a bit of capital invested in them .
It had become a seller ’s market .
Small timberland owners moved out of their modular homes into new houses and improved their properties .
Things were looking up , all because of a peculiar bird and its nesting habits .
What is wrong here is the collective dominance and control of the timber market by the Forest Service , in collusion with the corporate resource firms that were the direct beneficiaries of the railroad land grants .
Again , our government confuses the public ownership of “ common ” lands with collective or “ group ” ownership and direction .
The collective can distribute the goods and resources as they wish , they do not need the approval of “ common ” owners .
Much of our public forests could be owned and managed privately .
If they were auctioned in small plots , around 200 acres , they would be large enough for an entrepreneur to own and earn a decent living investing their labor and know how , rather than requiring formidable amounts of capital that would be necessary for large plots .
This would be consistent with homesteading principles as opposed to the principles of public giveaway that are now in place .
Smaller plots invite more intensive management and higher efficiency .
Since these are public lands , the smaller auctions will also bring much higher prices , as what is profitable and also affordable to the individual does not produce enough profit margin for the highly capitalized and bureaucratic resource corporation .
In this part of the country , areas that were dominated by the State - corporate timber industry are filled with poverty .
Young people work low paying jobs if they are lucky or leave to find work in other more urban areas .
The welfare and unemployment rate is extremely high .
Although this controlled timber production system has been in place for decades , towns and communities have little to show for it , other than scarred hillsides and muddy streams .
In fact , without secondary government intervention with programs such as welfare , unemployment , disability and food stamps , it is unlikely these communities would have ever survived under the current corporate system .
This is a little realized aspect of the welfare system ; welfare can sometimes enables corporatism .
Without this welfare aide , many workers would need higher wages to subsist .
Welfare allows the taxpayer to subsidize the monopoly industry by supplementing the workers paycheck and enabling him to continue working at below market wages .
What the government supplies , the industry does n’t .
A true free market demands opportunity of access to land for all who wish and are capable of competing in the productive sector .
Reclaiming the right of free individuals to earn a living in the woodlands goes beyond partisan spin and meaningless slogans .

The zero percent solution A renaissance for ' Islamic finance ' -- a version of capitalism that avoids interest -- offers innovative financial tools to Muslim and non-Muslim alike
( ADEK Berry / AFP / Getty Images ) LAST MONTH , two economists published a working paper suggesting an unusual way to diversify one 's investment portfolio : buy something called sukuk , or bonds that conform to the demands of Islam .
The Koran , most Islamic scholars agree , forbids the charging of interest , so traditional bonds are off - limits to devout Muslims .
But sukuk generate a steady income from actual , tangible assets , like a rented piece of land .
Sukuk are also , it turns out , more stable than traditional sovereign bonds .
While the sample size was small , the study by Selim Cakir , of the International Monetary Fund , and Faezeh Raei , a graduate student at the University of Texas , suggested that a portfolio that mixed sukuk with traditional bonds would do a better job than an all - bond portfolio of hedging against unpredictable seesaws in the financial markets .
One of the fastest growing areas of finance today is based on the 1,400 - year - old strictures of shariah , or Islamic law .
Sukuk are part of the field of " Islamic finance , " which - while it emerged in its modern incarnation in the late 1970s - has in recent years been attracting money at a precipitously quick clip .
Sukuk issuance in 2007 is on pace to at least double last year 's total .
And while exact figures are impossible to come by , industry analysts estimate that as much as $ 500 billion is now invested worldwide under Islamic guidelines .
Most of the world 's leading banks and investment companies , including Chase Manhattan , Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank , and HSBC have started offering financial tools and services that meet the Koran 's requirements .
Now the industry is broadening its reach , from oil - rich Middle Eastern royalty to the middle class , raising the prospect that the impact of Islamic finance could be felt well outside the Muslim faith .
More than 60 percent of the money in the investment firm Saturna Capital 's shariah - compliant mutual funds comes from non-Muslims , attracted by the funds ' industry - leading returns .
Last year a Texas - based oil and gas company raised $ 165.67 million by issuing sukuk , many of which were snatched up by American hedge funds .
And regional banks in parts of the United States with large Muslim populations have started offering a growing range of innovative financial products - Islamic home and business financing instruments , Islamic savings accounts - that they believe could attract non-Muslim investors as well .
" Islamic finance is just finance - it's conservative , people - oriented finance , " says Shaykh Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo , a Virginia - based shariah scholar who consults for many of the banks and firms that have set up Islamic financial instruments .
At a time of volatile markets , he says , " I think a lot of people are going to start taking a look at what we 're doing . "
In the United States , the growth of Islamic finance fits into a larger trend of so - called " ethical investing , " where funds and financial instruments are tailored to accord with ethical principles , whether it's the tenets of the Catholic church or those of the environmental movement .
Shariah - compliant mutual funds and asset management companies do n't invest in companies that make money from anything Islam considers haram , or forbidden : alcohol , tobacco , gambling , pornography , pork , or interest .
What sets Islamic investing apart , though , is the degree to which its prohibition on interest requires that its adherents rethink the way they make their money .
And the ideals that are enforced by Islamic financial contracts - that there should be sharp limits on someone 's ability to profit from someone else 's indebtedness , that risk and reward be shared equally between the two parties - could , Islamic bankers believe , make a powerful sales pitch to prospective borrowers , no matter what their faith .
" Our strategy is to first go after the very devout , because there 's so much pent - up demand there , " says Hussam Qutub , a spokesman for the Virginia - based Islamic investment firm Guidance Financial Group .
" But there is a larger demand out there , and I think we will find ourselves spilling into the non-Muslim market . "
The prophet Mohammed , himself a merchant , saw nothing inappropriate about turning a profit - unlike , for example , early Christian church authorities , who took a dim view of moneymaking .
Mohammed taught that it was interest and speculation that were sinful , because they divorced money from tangible goods and allowed people to make money merely by having money .
Partly as a result , Muslims were for centuries more advanced than Christians in the development of trade law .
Merchants in Europe often turned to Islamic law to make financial agreements - the partnership contract that allowed Christopher Columbus to sail for the New World was drawn up by Muslim lawyers .
Christian authorities in the late Middle Ages began to change their thinking , eventually reaching a consensus that neither profit nor interest were sins after all ( as long as the latter was n't deemed usuriously high ) , but Muslim religious authorities have continued to separate the two .
The current renaissance of Islamic finance has its roots in the 1970s .
Recently independent after decades of Western control , Muslim countries from Southeast Asia to the Persian Gulf were trying to reassert what they saw as their own cultural and religious traditions .
The Middle East , flush with oil money , was a natural arena for the practice and display of Muslim financial piety .
Today , with oil and gas prices at record highs , there are vast sums of Middle Eastern money looking for places to be invested .
And banks , hedge funds , and other financial - services companies are stumbling over each other to create those opportunities .
The process has been greatly aided by the creation , in 1999 , of the Dow Jones Islamic Market Indexes , which list stocks that a board of shariah scholars has deemed deserving of investment , and by firms such as Shariah Capital , which advises companies on shariah compliance .
Middle Eastern investors " are a very large and wealthy population , and managing their money the way they want it to be managed has become much easier , " says Tim Krochuk , managing director of GRT Capital Partners , a Boston - based investment advising firm that offers shariah - compliant asset management strategies .
" Why would n't we get involved ? "
But Islamic finance is no longer just about managing oil fortunes .
Growing numbers of middle - class Muslims are also starting to run their financial lives according to shariah principles .
Much of the recent growth in Islamic finance has come from consumer finance instruments - basically Islamic alternatives to car loans , home mortgages , and other consumer loans - that are designed for the middle and working class rather than the wealthy , according to Abdulkader Thomas , CEO of a Kuwait - based Islamic financial consultancy called Shape Financial .
Here in the United States , Guidance Financial last year sold more than a billion dollars in Islamic home finance instruments .
Designing these instruments - and fitting them into the existing tax and regulatory structures - has demanded creativity on the part of banks .
One popular loan option , for example , is called a murabaha .
In a murabaha , someone who wants to buy , for example , a car , rather than taking out a loan , goes to an Islamic bank and has the bank buy the car for him .
He then buys it from the bank , usually in installments , with a mark - up for the bank 's having provided the service .
Another , called a musharaka , is a joint venture set up between the customer and the bank .
In the context of a home purchase , if the customer has put in 20 percent of the money for the house , he gets a 20 percent share of it , and then gradually buys out the bank 's 80 percent ( along with a utility fee to the bank for letting him stay in the house ) until he owns it outright .
The growing sector has its critics , among both economists and conservative Islamic clerics , who describe it as a casuistic bait - and - switch .
According to Timur Kuran , a professor of political science and economics and chair of the Islamic Studies program at Duke University , " Islamic banks come up with these convoluted ways of lending money that make interest look like something else , when in fact they 're really just operating like conventional banks . "
Sohrab Behdad , an economics professor at Denison University and another critic , sees murabahas as particularly egregious .
He sees no difference between entering into a murabaha and simply taking out a loan and buying the car outright , especially since the title to the car is often transferred from the bank to the customer almost immediately .
To economists like Behdad , the bank 's service charge is simply a disguised interest payment .
All these obfuscations , the critics charge , add layers of bureaucracy , and end up cutting into the revenue that Islamic financial arrangements create , hurting the cash - strapped clients that the system prides itself on taking care of .
To the bait - and - switch critique , the industry 's proponents respond that the difference is there because Islamic law sees one , even if functionally it 's hard to find it .
" It 's like the difference between a wife and a live - in girlfriend , " says David Loundy , vice president of the Chicago - based Devon Bank , a national leader in Islamic finance .
" They may serve some of the same functions , but there 's a legal difference between the two , in terms of inheritance and taxes . "
Others in the industry argue that the difference is more than legalistic .
Amjad Quadri , national director of the Ann Arbor , Mich . - based University Islamic Financial Corporation , points out that the partnership structure of a musharaka is not mere symbolism .
In the case of a typical mortgage , if the borrower is unable to make his payments and the bank is not able to recoup its initial investment by then selling the house , the bank can often come after the borrower for the rest of the money .
In an Islamic home financing arrangement , however , the bank does not have that recourse .
" The risk has to be shared , and lenders are n't allowed to take advantage of borrowers in that way , " Quadri says .
" There 's a concept of being merciful to people in debt and hardship . "
UIFC and Guidance have started to see a trickle of non-Islamic customers , attracted by the more forgiving financial model they offer .
To critics such as Kuran , the idea that economic relationships would be structured around religious doctrine is wrongheaded and dangerous .
But the scholars and financiers who truly believe in the tenets of Islamic finance describe something more benign : a buffer against the vicissitudes of the market .
One Islamic financial instrument that has n't yet made it to the United States is Islamic life insurance , or takaful .
For - profit insurance is not allowed in shariah , in part because it turns a profit on the misfortune of others .
Takaful , on the other hand , is a mutual assurance arrangement in which members ' regular payments are used to help other members who are in need , with no money set aside for profit .
According to Ibrahim Warde , author of the 2000 book " Islamic Finance in the Global Economy , " takaful companies , even when connected to investment funds , are ultimately controlled by the policy - holders themselves , and as a result are usually more generous in terms of payouts .
There 's nothing exclusively Islamic about this idea : Many of the biggest insurance firms in the West descended from similar mutual association societies .
But industry analysts see takaful as a major growth area .
Global reinsurance giants such as AIG , Swiss Re , and Munich Re have gotten into the business .
In the United States , at a time when the public image of home insurance companies has been tarnished by complaints , especially in the two years since Hurricane Katrina , of inadequate payouts and canceled policies , it may be that such a pitch , with its faith - infused promise of fair treatment and mutual support , could find an audience among even the most committed heathens .

Agnese che spiega ai magistrati di Caltanissetta cosa accadde nelle 48 ore precedenti alla strage di via Mariano D'Amelio .
Il verbale di interrogatorio è di poco più di un mese fa , lei da una parte e i procuratori di Caltanissetta Sergio Lari e Domenico Gozzo dall ' altra .
Lei si è presentata spontaneamente per raccontare " quando Paolo tornò da Roma il 17 di luglio " .
Il 17 luglio 1992 , due giorni prima dell ' autobomba .
Paolo Borsellino è a Roma per interrogare il boss Gaspare Mutolo , un mafioso della Piana dei Colli che aveva deciso di pentirsi dopo l'uccisione di Giovanni Falcone .
È venerdì pomeriggio , Borsellino lascia il boss e gli dà appuntamento per il lunedì successivo .
Quando atterra a Palermo non passa dal Tribunale ma va subito da sua moglie .
" Mi chiese di stare soli , mi pregò di andare a fare una passeggiata sulla spiaggia di Villagrazia di Carini " , ricorda la signora Agnese .
Per la prima volta in tanti anni il procuratore Borsellino non si fa scortare e si concede una lunga camminata abbracciando la moglie .
Non parlava mai con lei del suo lavoro , ma quella volta Paolo Borsellino " aveva voglia di sfogarsi " .
Racconta ancora la signora Agnese : " Dopo qualche minuto di silenzio , Paolo mi ha detto : ' Sai Agnese , ho appena visto la mafia in faccia ...' " .
Un paio d'ore prima aveva raccolto le confessioni di Gaspare Mutolo .
Su magistrati collusi , su superpoliziotti che erano spie , su avvocati e ingegneri e medici e commercialisti che erano al servizio dei padrini di Corleone .
Non dice altro Paolo Borsellino .
Informa soltanto la moglie che lunedì tornerà a Roma , " per interrogare ancora Mutolo " .
Il sabato passa tranquillamente , la domenica mattina - il 19 luglio , il giorno della strage - il telefono di casa Borsellino squilla .
È sempre Agnese che ricorda : " Quel giorno , molto presto , mio marito ricevette una telefonata dell ' allora procuratore capo di Palermo Pietro Giammanco .
Mi disse che lo " autorizzava " a proseguire gli interrogatori con il pentito Mutolo che , per organizzazione interna all ' ufficio , dovevano essere gestiti invece dal procuratore aggiunto Vittorio Aliquò " .
Lo sa bene Paolo Borsellino che sta per morire .
E ai procuratori di Caltanissetta Agnese l'ha ribadito un ' altra volta : " Paolo aveva appreso qualche giorno prima che Cosa Nostra voleva ucciderlo " .
Un'informazione che arrivava da alcune intercettazioni ambientali " in un carcere dov' erano rinchiusi dei mafiosi " .
Una minaccia per lui e per altri due magistrati , Gioacchino Natoli e Francesco Lo Voi.
Ricorda sempre la vedova : " Così un giorno Paolo chiamò i suoi due colleghi e disse loro di andare via da Palermo , di concedersi una vacanza .
Li consigliò anche di andare in giro armati , con una pistola " .
Gioacchino Natoli e Lo Voi gli danno ascolto , ma lui - Borsellino - rimane a Palermo .
Sa che è condannato a morte .
E ormai sa anche della " trattativa " che alcuni apparati dello Stato portano avanti con Riina e i suoi Corleonesi .
Ufficiali dei carabinieri , quelli dei Ros , il colonnello Mario Mori - " l'anima " dei reparti speciali - e il fidato capitano Giuseppe De Donno .
Probabilmente , questa è l'ipotesi dei procuratori di Caltanissetta e di Palermo , Paolo Borsellino muore proprio perché contrario a quella " trattativa " .
Nella nuova inchiesta sulle stragi siciliane e sui patti e i ricatti con i Corleonesi , ogni giorno scivolano nuovi nomi .
L'ultimo è quello del generale Antonino Subranni , al tempo comandante dei Ros e superiore diretto di Mori .
Un testimone ha rivelato ai procuratori di Caltanissetta una battuta di Borsellino : " L'ha fatta a me personalmente qualche giorno prima di essere ammazzato .
Mi ha detto : ' Il generale Subranni è punciutu " ( cioè uomo di Cosa nostra ndr ) ...' " .
Un'affermazione forte ma detta nello stile di Paolo Borsellino , come battuta appunto .
Cosa avesse voluto veramente dire il procuratore , lo scopriranno i magistrati di Caltanissetta .
La frase è stata comunque messa a verbale .
E il verbale è stato secretato .
Il nome del generale Subranni è affiorato anche nelle ultime rivelazioni di Massimo Ciancimino , il figlio di don Vito .
Nella sua intervista a Sandro Ruotolo per Annozero ( però questa parte non è andata in onda ma è stata acquisita dalla procura di Caltanissetta ) , Massimo Ciancimino sosteneva : " Mio padre per la sua natura corleonese non si è mai fidato dei carabinieri .
E quando il colonello Mori e il capitano De Donno cercano di instaurare questo tipo di trattativa , è chiaro che a mio padre viene il dubbio : ma come fanno questi due soggetti che di fatto non sono riusciti nemmeno a fare il mio di processo ( quello sugli appalti ndr ) a offrire garanzie concrete ?... " .
E conclude Ciancimino : " In un primo momento gli viene detto che c'è il loro referente capo , il generale Subranni ... " .
È un'altra indagine nell ' indagine sui misteri delle stragi siciliane .

“ We ’re celebrating our 40th birthday in style ” , announced the Sun yesterday .
With a series of self - congratulatory quotes ( i.e. from people like Simon Cowell ) , Britain ’s own bible belters have kickstarted a series of “ sparkling birthday features ” .
It ’s undisputed that the Sun managed to push its way to the forefront of Britain ’s contemporary culture .
From shifting the nation ’s attention towards mammary glands , through their contribution to harmony and cohesion , and all the way to reasoned and fact - based news reporting , the Sun has indeed become the epitome of British phlegm , “ a national institution ” ( according to the Sun itself ) .
But to spare the Sun the risk of sliding into self - important back - slapping mode , which would be soooo unlike them , we ’ve decided to help them celebrate the rag ’s history with a short roll of honour of some of its most memorable moments .
It ’s May 1982 and , in the midst of the Falklands ’ war , it is announced that the British troops have sunk an Argentine ship called General Belgrano , killing 300 people .
The Sun‘s own contribution comes in the guise of a sombre , level - headed headline : “ GOTCHA “ .
In 1987 the Sun completely made up allegations about singer Elton John and rent boys .
They ended up paying £ 1 m in libel damages .
The incident looked positively tame compared to what happened two years later .
The Hillsborough tragedy became one of Britain ’s most dramatic moments .
The Sun decided to lend a helping hand by publishing the headline “ THE TRUTH ” , falsely claiming that Liverpool supporters urinated on rescue workers and picked the pockets of crushed victims .
Nothing , of course , like the stalking of Clare Short in 2003 .
The Birmingham Ladywood MP dared to speak out against Page 3 - effectively attempting to deprive Britain ’s lads of their right to access basic masturbating tools .
The Sun ‘s response ?
As they do n’t do hysteria , they opted for a subtle , discreet and persuasive ploy .
As Clare Short recounts :
“ [t ] his led to busloads of Page 3 girls parked outside my house all day in the hope of setting up embarrassing photos , and mock - up pictures of me as a very fat Page 3 girl .
They even sent half - dressed people to the house I share with my 84 - year - old mother in Birmingham and had people hiding in cars and chasing me down the street in an effort to get embarrassing photographs ” >.
And if the word ‘ bullying ’ springs to mind , then get a life .
The Sun were only messing about .
Like when they unleashed a hate campaign against Swiss referee Uri Meier in the follow - up of the controversial Euro 2004 exit of England against Portugal .
After urging readers to “ let rip ” and send him emails , the tabloid stalked the referee ’s home in northern Switzerland and published his address .
Fed up of death threats and afraid for his family , Mr Meier was soon forced to move .
But if that was just a question of sport , no - one can deny the Sun ’s contribution to community relations .
Like last year ’s completely fabricated “ Muslim terror hit list ” story , or the other about a Muslim bus driver who allegedly “ kicked passengers off the bus ” so that he could pray .
In July 2003 , the rag ’s front page sported the headline “ SWAN BAKE : Asylum seekers steal the Queen ’s birds for barbecues ” .
At least on that occasion the Sun apologised .
Five months later .
On page 41 .
Part two of this piece is here .
Cause of common chronic diarrhea revealed in new research
A common type of chronic diarrhoea may be caused by a hormone deficiency , according to new research published in the November issue of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology .
The authors of the paper , from Imperial College London , with collaborators from King 's College London and the University of Edinburgh , say their results could help more doctors recognise this type of diarrhoeal illness , and may lead to the development of more effective tests and treatments to help improve the lives of many people suffering with chronic diarrhoea .
Chronic idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea affects an estimated one in 100 people in the UK and it can cause people to have up to ten watery bowel movements a day , often for months at a time .
This type of diarrhoea occurs when an overload of bile acid reaches the colon and causes excess water to be secreted into the bowel .
Today 's study suggests that bile acid diarrhoea is caused by the body producing too much bile acid , because of a deficiency in a hormone called FGF19 , which normally switches off bile acid production .
The authors of the study say that new hormone - based treatments could be developed in the future to treat the condition and doctors could potentially test people 's hormone levels to diagnose it .
Dr Julian Walters , lead author of the study from the Division of Medicine at Imperial College London , said : " Bile acid diarrhoea is a common condition , likely to affect more people than Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis , yet until now we did not understand exactly what causes it .
People with bile acid diarrhoea need to use the toilet urgently many times during the day and night .
This can have a big impact on their lives , at home , at work and while they are travelling , as they always need to be near a toilet .
" If they are diagnosed , we have treatments that can remove bile acid from the colon , alleviate the symptoms and improve their quality of life .
However , the current test used to diagnose the condition is not available in many countries and requires patients to attend the hospital twice .
This means many people are not diagnosed .
Our new findings mean that in the future doctors may be able to diagnose the condition by doing a quick and simple blood test , " added Dr Walters .
Bile acid is produced by enzymes in the liver , to help the body digest fats .
Its production is controlled by a hormone called Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 ( FGF19 ) .
Over 90 % of the bile acid is absorbed from the intestine back into the blood and is then reused .
In healthy people , when bile acid is absorbed by the intestine , the body makes more FGF19 to stop new bile acid from being produced .
However , results of today 's study suggest that people with bile acid diarrhoea make less FGF19 , so the hormone ' switch ' fails to stop the liver from producing more bile acid than the body needs .
Because of this , more is produced than the intestine can absorb .
This then irritates the colon and the resulting watery secretion causes diarrhoea .
The researchers say that testing the amount of FGF19 in people 's blood could lead to a fast , easy and cheap way of diagnosing bile acid diarrhoea .
They also hope today 's findings will help scientists develop new treatments to increase the production of FGF19 and reduce the amount of bile acid being made in patients .
The researchers tested the amount of bile acid being produced in the livers of 17 patients diagnosed with bile acid diarrhoea and 19 healthy controls .
They did this by measuring the amount of a molecule called C4 in the blood , which indicates how much bile acid is being made .
The results showed that the people with bile acid diarrhoea were producing an average of nearly three times more bile acid than the controls , with 51 nanograms of C4 per millilitre of blood in the patient group , compared to 18 nanograms per millilitre in the control group .
The researchers then measured the amount of FGF19 in the patients and controls .
The results showed that the people with bile acid diarrhoea were producing around half the level of the hormone than the controls , with 120 picograms of FGF19 per millilitre of blood levels in the patient group , compared to 231 picograms per millilitre in the control group .
These results suggest that there is a significant link between bile acid production and decreased levels of FGF19 in people with bile acid diarrhoea .
The researchers say that , following this small study , further research is needed to see if these findings can be replicated .
Most years one or two graduating seniors in R.O.T.C. are commissioned as officers , according to Jerry Hill , a Yale administrator who oversees the program .
Next spring there will be none .
At Harvard in June , eight graduates were commissioned , in all three military branches .
The year before , there were five .

These modest numbers come even though , in the last five years , the Army has nearly tripled the amount of money it has put into R.O.T.C. scholarships , to $ 263 million , and increased enrollment nationwide by 26 percent , to 30,721 students , to fill vacancies in its officer corps .
It has been a time when military recruiters in all branches , working in a depressed economy , are ­acing their quotas .
At Texas A&M , 115 freshmen in 2008 received Army R.O.T.C. scholarships , compared with 35 the year before .
The military has a lot at stake : 60 percent of all new Army officers each year come from R.O.T.C. programs .
R.O.T.C. students at Harvard and Yale are not the only ones campus - hopping .
Harvard is one of eight colleges served by M.I.T. , the Army R.O.T.C. host school .
Five of these satellite colleges —
Wellesley , Tufts , Gordon , Endicott and Salem State — have arranged for transportation for their cadets to get to M.I.T.
Several colleges in the consortium have the R.O.T.C. staff travel to their campuses to conduct military classes and physical training , making it easier on their students .
Harvard , with its campus ban , does neither .
One of the featured speakers at the 2009 Harvard commissioning ceremony , Darnell Whitt II , a retired naval captain , noted that the year he graduated from Harvard — 1959 — 121 seniors were commissioned as officers .
He told the R.O.T.C. students that he was sorry their numbers were so few and that he hoped that by the time they returned for their 50th reunion , “ the current issues about military matters at Harvard will have been resolved and there will be a closer connection between the great university and those in uniform . ”
THIS is the 40th anniversary of the antiwar protests that led to the ban of R.O.T.C. at some of the nation ’s most elite universities — Harvard , Yale , Brown , Columbia , Stanford , the University of Chicago , Tufts .
And yet , the attitude on these campuses today is hardly antimilitary .
There are numerous signs of genuine respect for the soldiers who serve .
An editorial last May in the student newspaper , The Harvard Crimson , which for decades attacked R.O.T.C. , praised classmates who had joined the program .
“ They demonstrate a commitment to service that should be admired and followed by the rest of the student body , ” The Crimson said .
The Yale , Columbia and Brown student papers have all published editorials in the recent past calling for the return of R.O.T.C. to their campuses .
R.O.T.C. members interviewed at Harvard , M.I.T. and Yale said they rarely if ever heard negative comments around campus , and a few said they had experienced the opposite problem .
“ People stop me and thank me for serving , ” said Gregory Wellman , an Army R.O.T.C. cadet at M.I.T .
“ It ’s a little awkward because at this point I ’m just a student and have n’t done anything . ”

Bacon Attack !
Recipe Ready to get hit by a Bacon Attack !?
Here 's the recipe for the Bacon Burger »
Anyone who 's vaguely into bacon ( and who is n't ? ) or follows important internet memes has surely born witness to the bacon burger — that is , a burger patty entirely made up out of ground bacon .
The trouble is , anyone who 's actually followed through and made one of these things has probably come to the same conclusion that I have : they just are n't very good .
Overly salty , overly smoky , overly fatty ( I did n't believe it , but yes , there is such a thing ) , and just plain overly bacon-y , they make for an interesting story , but are hardly good eats .
Still , the concept is sound : Bacon is delicious , burgers are delicious ; why should n't the two go hand - in - hand to make something extra delicious ?
The goal of this week 's Burger Lab is to do just that :
Take a burger to the bacon extreme , while at the same time coming up with something that is as good to eat as it is fun to gawk at .
I present to you , The Bacon Attack !
As usual , I 'm going to build the burger one piece at a time before putting it all together , starting with the grind .
The Meat
To begin my testing , I opted for good quality cured — not brine - injected ( i.e. Oscar Meyer - quality ) — smoked slab bacon over the pre-sliced stuff in order to allow me maximum mobility in terms of grind size .
I did n't want to limit my options before I 'd even started .
I could go into the relative merits of nitrate - free vs. traditional , or hickory vs. applewood smoke , but that 's another story for another time .
Personal taste reigns supreme .
Just to get my bearings , I made a single patty out of 100 % pure ground bacon , and as expected , could n't get through more than a bite and a half of it ( If anyone has any suggestions of what to do with the quarter pound patty of cooked ground bacon with two bites taken out of it sitting in my fridge , I 'm all ears ) .
Like a good cocktail , this patty was going to need a mixer .
While grinding it together with beef was certainly an option , I found that beef ended up fighting with the bacon .
It became a beef burger flavored with bacon , rather than a bacon burger .
Whenever I 'm at a loss , my first instinct is to grab a package of pork butt , and this time was no exception .
When ground together with the bacon 50 / 50 , the well marbled meat diluted the flavors of the bacon to acceptably delicious levels , without introducing any odd flavors of its own .
The Toppings
Crisply fried , thick - sliced bacon was a no - brainer — I did mine in a cast iron skillet over low , low heat for even , spatter free cooking , though if I were doing a larger volume , I 'd do it on a sheet tray in the oven .
But if this recipe is really about optimizing bacon , it would 've be a shame to throw out all of that flavorful rendered bacon fat that comes out of those slices .
The solution ?
Bacon fat mayo , of course .
If you missed last week 's Food Lab post , it was about the science behind making mayonnaise by replacing vegetable oil with rendered animal fats .
For this burger , a solid dollop of bacon - fat mayo ( studded with bacon bits , of course ) is just what the doctor ordered *.
* The doctor in my mind , that is .
The Bun
Here 's where I begin heading into personally uncharted waters .
I 've made burger buns a few times , but in all honesty , I 'm a cook , not a baker .
But on the other hand , I do know exactly what I 'm looking for in a burger bun .
It should have a soft , golden crust , a slightly sweet and savory flavor , and a tender , almost squishy interior .
The key to these qualities is fat .
Because fat interferes with the formation of gluten — the protein network that gives baked goods their structure — a fatty dough ends up less tough and more tender .
I started with my basic burger bun dough , which uses yeast , water , oil , sugar , an egg , and flour , and started upping the bacon .
Stage one was to introduce crisply fried bacon bits to the dough before allowing it to rise .
The crisp bits studded in the finished bun add sudden bursts of salt and smoke that pop on your tongue as you chew the soft bread .
But to really take the bacon to the extreme , I replaced the vegetable oil with the bacon fat that I had just rendered off of the bits .
Perfect .
I think I may have invented the only Atkin 's - friendly burger bun in the world — the thing tasted almost more meat than bread .
The Assembly
The bacon patty gets plenty crisp and flavorful on its own , so there 's no need to use the smash and scape technique here — just form the meat into patties , and fry away .
While pork is really just as safe to eat as beef even at rare , most people find soft , cool pork to be off - putting , so I try and get my patties to at least a nice juicy pink stage .
Because cured meat proteins are able to hold more water than unadulterated proteins , the bacon meat helps the patty retain moisture as it cooks , so luckily , slight overcooking does n't pose too much of a problem — these things come out juicy no matter what you do to them .
I toyed briefly with the idea of adding cheese , but found that it only distracted from the baconiness , and that really , it does n't need it .
Perhaps in future experiments I 'll attempt to make meltable cheese slices flavored with bacon to accompany the burger , but I 'm afraid my past attempts at making meltable cheese have ended in failure .
The end result ?
Bacolicious !
The soft , smoky bun with crisp , salty lardons is just strong enough to support the juicy patty inside , but soft enough to melt into a wash of bacon flavor on your tongue .
The crisp strips and intense baconnaise , while hardly necessary , work together to turn this into one of the purest expressions of bacon I have ever put in my mouth — and I 've put many expressions of bacon in my mouth .
The only accompaniment that the Bacon Attack !
needed ( incidentally , even in the middle of a sentence , the Bacon Attack !
should always be punctuated with an exclamation point — it 's just that kind of a sandwich ) was a batch of homemade B&B pickles to eat between bites and help cut through some of the richness .
I have n't decided yet whether the " Attack ! " in Bacon Attack !
is a noun or an imperative verb ( as in , " Bacon , Attack ! " ) , but after eating it , my mouth is telling me it's the latter .

October 20 , 2009 -- Berdikari --
Thousands of people protested at the national parliament building in Jakarta today , during the inauguration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as Indonesia 's new president and Boediono as vice - president .
Protesters demanded that the president put an end to neoliberal policies during his second term , because they have been proven to be a failure and have brought suffering to the people of the world , including Indonesia .
Spokeperson for the Street Parliament Alliance ( APJ ) , Lalu Hilman Afriandi , stated : `` In the last five years , the government has been busy seeking foreign loans .
Up to August 2009 , our debt had reached US $ 160.64 billion and each year it has added hundreds of trillion rupiah into the state budget .
This policy is not only a burden to the state budget , but also an opening for foreign interests that seek the implementation of neoliberal policies , such as [ privatisation ] , trade liberalisation , bank deregulation , liberalisation of education . "
Lalu Hilman explained that what has been happening is that debt is being used to pay debt , creating a vicious circle where debt feeds on itself .
Dominggus Oktavianus , chairperson of the Indonesian National Front for Labour Struggles ( FNPBI ) said that neoliberal policies cause deindustrialisation and bankrupts national industry that is supposed to be able to provide jobs and produce goods for people 's needs .
Currently , the informal workers ' sector has reached 70 % of the total labour force .
Some of them are laid - off workers and young workers who have not been employed by industry .
" It means that besides intensifying lay - offs , neoliberalism from the outset has shrunken the labour market .
This is exacerbated by the spread of the contract system , outsourcing and low wages " , Dominggus Oktavianus said .
Chairperson of the Poor People 's Union ( SRMI ) , Marlo Sitompul , hopes that the new president will address the rights of the poor .
" Especially as his second term was marked by the Bank Century case that caused the loss of 6.7 trillion rupiah ( US $ 718.96 million ) of public money .
The new government should not be too confident , because this case has clearly hurt its credibility among the people , even among their own voters " , explained Marlo .
The Jakarta protest was filled with posters and banners titled " Put and end to it " ( hentikan ) to counter Yudhoyono 's campaign slogan ``Keep it going '' ( lanjutkan ) , referring to a second mandate , went peacefully despite a heavy police presence .
Similar demonstrations occurred in dozens of other places in Indonesia .
In Makassar , South Sulawesi province , more than 1000 people gathered at the Liberation West Irian memorial monument to declare ``Stop the neoliberal regime ' ' .
Demonstrations also occurred in the capital cities of other provinces , including East Java , Central Java , West Java , Jambi , Riau , North Sumatra , Aceh , Bali , West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara .
The simultaneous countrywide actions were coordinated by the People 's Democratic Party ( PRD ) .
Aksi “ Hentikan ” Neoliberalisme Juga Digelar di Surabaya
Selasa , 20 Oktober 2009
Surabaya ( Berdikari Online ) - Aksi untuk merespon pelantikan SBY - Budiono sebagai Presiden dan Wakil Presiden juga berlangsung di Surabaya .
Sebanyak 150 orang massa Front Rakyat Anti Neoliberalisme menggelar aksinya di depan Gedung Negara Grahadi , Jalan Gubernur Suryo , Surabaya , siang tadi ( 20/10 ) .
Dalam aksinya , massa Front Rakyat Anti Neoliberalis merangkai huruf berukuran besar bertuliskan ; " HENTIKAN " .
Selain itu , massa membawa sejumlah poster berisikan penolakan terhadap dilanjutkannya sistim neoliberal diIndonesia .
Menurut juru bicara aksi ini , HendravenSaragih , pemerintahan SBY terbukti gagal dalam menjalankan mandat rakyat saat berkuasa lima tahun sebelum ini .
Ini tercermin dengan meningkatnya angka kemiskinan , pengangguran , dan PHK massal .
Sebagai contoh , menurut dia , kebijakan neoliberal SBY di bidang ekonomi mendorong proses de-industrialisasi secara berkelanjutan .
Akibatnya , jumlah orangyang tercatat sebagai penganggur ataupun pekerja sektor informal terus meningkat , yang mengutip penelitian OPSI , sudah mencapai 70 % dari angkatan kerja .
Hendraven menjelaskan , SBY juga tidakpunya prestasi lebih baik dalam hal pemberantasan korupsi .
Terbukti , SBY membiarkan sejumlah pejabatnya terlibat dalam skandal bank century , dan malah dilantik lagi hari ini .
Padahal , menurut Hendraven , Budiono sebagai pihak yang diduga terlibat skandal century seharusnya diperiksa secara hukum , baru dilantik setelah mendapatkan rekomendasi tidak terlibat .
Pada kenyataannya , dua tokoh utama pemerintahan neoliberal SBY yang diduga terkait kasus century ini , yaitu Budiono dan Sri Mulyani , justru mendapat tempat khusus dalam pemerintahan SBY jilid II ini .
Untuk itu , pemerintahan ini bukan pemerintahan bersih .
Dalam tuntannya , Front Rakyat Anti-Neoliberal menuntut pihak berwajib memeriksa seluruh pejabat yang terlibat dalam kasus Bank Century .
Mereka juga meminta seluruh proyek neoliberal di Indonesia dihentikan , dan dicabutnya semua undang - undang yang berbau neoliberal , seperti UU Minyak dan Gas , UU Penanaman Modal , dan UU Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus .
The article in the November 14 issue of the New York Times about the extent to which the biotech firm Genetech was able to put their own words into legislators ' mouths raises the next logical question :
To what extent are corporations in the U.S. actually drafting laws and getting them passed ?
We can't deny this is happening , yet few want to talk about it .
Tobacco industry documents , though , show exactly how corporations can and do co-opt legislative processes from start to finish , and how successful they are at it .
Big Tobacco 's success at staving off regulation shows its ability to control legislative processes .
The tobacco industry 's pioneering work in this area has drawn a road map for other industries showing how to manipulate state and federal legislatures as well .
There are many ways that businesses turn legislative processes to their own advantage .
Certainly they lobby to thwart laws they do n't like , but they also actively draft and push through laws of their own design , for lots of purposes .
Tobacco documents demonstrate this .
Big Tobacco Embraces " Bomb - Throwing "
Starting around the late 1980s , the tobacco industry made a fundamental shift in its legislative strategy from simply fighting bills it did n't like , to actively drafting and pushing legislation designed to head off public resistance to its products .
They called it their " proactive strategy " or " throwing bombs . "
They used it to dissipate opponents ' resources , harass them , get out in front of them and keep them from causing more trouble for the industry -- all tactics which are now part of the playbook for other industries that have drawn contingents of opponents , like the health insurance industry , the pharmaceutical industry , the extractive industries , the plastic bag industry and many others .
Following are on - the - ground examples of how the tobacco industry applied its proactive legislative strategy .
Tactic # 1 : If You See a Strong Law Coming , Pass a Weak One
One corporate legislative " bomb - throwing " tactic involves pushing through weak , ineffective laws designed to head off more restrictive ones .
A Tobacco Institute paper titled " Proactive Legislation " describes the industry 's use of this tactic in state legislatures .
In 1988 , the Institute noted that strong public sentiment existed in Colorado for a statewide smoking ban .
Support was so strong , in fact , that even the industry 's usual ally , the Colorado Restaurant Association , supported such legislation .
To head off the public 's favored measure , the Institute planned to introduce its own , weak statewide smoking bill " with moderate provisions " that would " institutionalize certain smokers ' rights and dramatically weaken one of the strongest statewide GASP [ Group to Alleviate Smoking Pollution ] organizations in the country . "
Big Tobacco planned to hide its efforts by arranging for unrelated groups -- trade , professional and business organizations -- to be the bill 's primary supporters .
The Institute searched for a friendly legislator to introduce the bill , and identified Colorado Republican legislator Bill Owens ( who went on to become governor ) as " a friendly member of the House Local Government Committee ( consistently favorable to tobacco interests ) " who could " offer a substitute bill with desirable provisions with a good chance of having it adopted and passed out of committee ... "
The Institute laid out its strategy for getting the bill through the legislature :
Publicly , tobacco industry advocates should express the position that NO smoking restriction law is desirable .
If pressed , they should acknowledge that uniform regulation throughout the state is preferable to the state of confusion which now exists .
Privately , our lobbyists would of course encourage legislators ' support of the substitute [ weak ] bill .
Through this and other legislative efforts , the Tobacco Institute staved off a truly effective statewide smoking law in Colorado until fully 18 years later , in 2006 .
Tactic # 2 : Link to an Emotional Issue
Another way corporations get their preferred laws on the books is to link their issue to one that people feel very strongly about , and then leverage that emotion to advance their measure .
Example : Most people strongly oppose discrimination in the U.S.
The Tobacco Institute harnessed those feelings to pass laws protecting smoking by portraying smoking as a trait , or a human characteristic , rather than a behavior .
A 1990 letter by Tobacco Institute lobbyist Stan Boman discusses passing " smokers ' rights " legislation in Oklahoma .
In the letter , Boman portrays smoking as a personal trait , instead of a behavior , by opining that employers who require employees to be nonsmokers subject smokers to " spiteful and unreasonable discrimination in employment practices . "
Boman wrote that the industry felt " something must be done " about this situation , and added , " as a result , non-discrimination legislation [ protecting smokers ] has been introduced in 27 states and passed in nine of them . "
Thus , by 1990 the tobacco industry got laws passed protecting smoking behavior in fully one - third of the states in which they attempted to do so , and were continuing to push for similar laws in the remaining states .
Tactic # 3 : Introduce bills purely to make opponents waste resources playing defense
In Rhode Island in 1990 , the industry planned to introduce a " proactive " bill to create uniform sales , sampling and vending machine regulations , and which would also " preempt local ordinances and forbid bans . "
The primary purpose of their measure was to " cut off the possibility " that citizens could enact bills regulating tobacco more strictly .
An Institute report describing the plan gives away the strategic nature of this bill :
This legislation is unlikely to be enacted ; it is intended to dissipate the energies of the anti-tobacco forces and put them on the defensive .
Similarly , a 1994 Philip Morris ( PM ) memo written by Ellen Merlo , PM's Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs , shows that PM has abused state legislative processes purely to harass opponents .
Merlo describes how PM combatted local smoking restrictions and increased cigarette taxes in California in 1994 .
PM 's strategy was to " create a flurry of legislative activity to confound the antis [ public health advocates ] by introducing various bills and measures to put them on the defensive ... "
Merlo's words show that PM would tie up state legislatures with essentially meaningless bills solely to antagonize public health advocates ( the " anti's " ) .
She also demonstrates PM 's confidence in its ability to introduce legislation at will .
This memo was circulated to executives at the highest levels of Philip Morris .
Tactic # 4 : Introduce " Trojan bills "
The tobacco industry will also hide its preferred measure in a bill about a completely unrelated topic , and many legislators will have no idea about the origins and real purposes behind these " Trojan " bills .
Example : in 1995 , Philip Morris disguised " smokers ' rights " legislation as property rights legislation .
First , PM framed smoking restrictions as a " government taking " of private property .
This allowed them to link smoking to property rights -- a hot - button issue , particularly in western states .
A telltale 1996 PM email shows that PM introduced a " property rights " bill that would effectively prevent smoking bans statewide .
Incredibly , PM 's bill did not even contain the words smoking or tobacco .
Instead , the wording prohibited placing " burdens on individual property owners to achieve general public purposes , " which included protecting public health .
The bill put the burden of proving harm to public health on local government , an expensive obstacle to enacting a smoking ban .
Pam Inmann , PM's Colorado lobbyist , emailed PM executives in 1996 about the " takings " bill that the company successfully introduced in Colorado 's legislature .
Inmann wrote :
Tomorrow barb will fax you a cc [ copy ] of SB 69 [ a private property " takings " bill ] ... I think this will work on smoking bans in the future ... "
PM 's takings bill was introduced and was passed by Colorado 's Senate and House of Representatives , but was ultimately vetoed by then - Governor Roy Romer .
Tactic # 5 : Analyze and Exploit Every Part of a Legislator 's World
A 1993 PM presentation called Grasstops Government Relations is a tutorial about how PM influences legislators .
PM uses an " Influence Wheel " that contains sections representing legislators ' ideology , beliefs , media , special constituents , voters , pet causes and charities , to show how the company scrutinizes every facet of a legislator 's world and how the company influences them at every possible juncture .
For example , PM helped legislators create and strengthen alliances with individuals and groups to reinforce their hold on office ; indulged their desire to be associated with good works and helped them be seen at sporting and cultural events .
PM even investigated legislators ' spouses ' favorite charities and donates to them .
PM indulged legislators with trips to " promotional and cultural events " in nice locales , including foreign countries .
In short , PM finds every possible way to help legislators get what they want -- and believe they need -- thus earning their loyalty .
At the same time , Grasstops Government Relations shows how PM shifts the focus of tobacco issues to help legislators avoid discussing tobacco issues in a framework of public health :
... Finally , we try to change the focus on the issues .
Cigarette tax become[s ] an issue of fairness and effective tax policy .
Cigarette marketing is an issue of freedom of commercial speech .
Environmental tobacco smoke becomes an issue of accommodation .
Cigarette - related fires become an issue of prudent fire safety programs .
And so on .
I am certain that this list represents only the tip of the iceberg of legislative tricks used by industry to manipulate legislators and legislation .
The tobacco industry 's influence on lawmaking in the U.S. has been pervasive , and shows that corporations draft their own legislation , get their preferred measures introduced at will , and obtain passage for them at a remarkable rate .
How Many of our Laws May Have Been Drafted and Passed by Corporations ?
There is probably no easy way to quantify corporate lawmaking in the U.S. , but industry documents give us an idea of its extent .
PM sets its goals high when working to enact laws of its own making .
In 1994 , Ellen Merlo of PM gave an internal speech in which she stated PM planned to enact laws in all 50 states that would stop cities and towns across the U.S. from passing their own smoking laws .
In her speech , Merlo boasted that by October of 1994 , PM had successfully passed its laws in 29 states -- well over half the country .
This article considers the manipulative activities of just one industry , and over just a few years .
Many other industries now have more than enough money to exert the same influence -- the pharmaceutical industry , the insurance industry , the chemical industry , the food and drink industries , and so many more .
I know of no study that has examined the origins of state and federal laws to find out just how many came about due to corporate conniving .
Corporations will continue to wrest control of our country 's legislative processes away from the people and co-opt it for themselves , but we out number them .
It 's time to join together to ensure , as Abraham Lincoln so memorably said in his 1863 Gettysburg Address , that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . "
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
An American father jailed in Tokyo has been harshly treated , his attorney said Monday , while Japanese authorities said he is getting " special " treatment .
Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son , Isaac , and daughter , Rebecca .
Attorney Jeremy Morley , in a statement released Monday , said Christopher Savoie -- accused of trying to kidnap his children after his ex-wife took them to Japan -- is being held without trial , interrogated without an attorney present and denied needed medical treatment for high blood pressure .
Savoie has also been exposed to sleep deprivation , and denied private meetings with attorneys and phone calls to his wife , according to Morley , who said the way his client has been treated amounts to " torture . "
He acknowledged that some of the claims are based on second - hand information from Savoie 's wife , Amy , saying she has communicated with people familiar with her husband 's case .
Police in Yanagawa , a rural town in southern Japan where Savoie is being held , denied the allegations in Morley 's statement , saying Savoie gets regular visits by a physician and medicine as prescribed .
A Yanagawa police officer , who declined to give his name citing departmental policy , told CNN that Savoie , like any other detainee , has a " dim " light in his cell for safety , and is assured to get 8 hours of sleep a day .
Savoie is being questioned -- with an interpreter -- within the boundaries of Japanese law , which allows for suspects to be interviewed without the presence of an attorney , the officer said .
The law also permits several rounds of questioning for hours on end , the officer said .
The officer said Savoie is allowed " frequent " visits with his defense attorney in Japan and is generally given " special " treatment due to the nature of his case , the officer said .
" If you call this ' torture , ' what can we say ? " the officer said .
Savoie , 38 , a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen , allegedly abducted his two children -- 8 - year - old Isaac and 6 - year - old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa .
With the children , Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate , in the city of Fukuoka , to try to obtain passports for them .
Screaming at guards to let him in the compound , Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested .
Savoie and his first wife , Noriko Savoie , were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January .
The couple , both citizens of the United States and Japan , lived in Japan , but had moved to the United States before the divorce .
Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States .
Christopher Savoie had visitation rights .
During the summer , she fled with the children to Japan , according to court documents .
A U.S. court then granted Christopher Savoie sole custody .
Japanese law , however , recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian , regardless of the U.S. court order .
The law there also follows a tradition of sole - custody divorces .
When a couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and life - long break from the children .
Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced there , police said .
And , Japanese authorities say , the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports .

9 Signs You Might Be Going Insane
October 21 , 2009 by by Mamapedia Staff
Photo by : flickr.com/photos/johhlegear/695552819/
Something does n’t feel right .
Maybe you ’ve been depressed — crying at the drop of a hat , not enjoying things that used to make you happy .
Or you feel overwhelming anxiety , the kind that makes you think your heart might beat right out of chest .
Or perhaps it ’s a little scarier than that , and you ’ve started seeing things that are n’t there .
The bad news : something ’s up .
The good news : you ’re not going insane .
Insanity is actually just a legal term to describe abnormal mental patterns and behaviors ( as in not - guilty by reasons of insanity ) .
Your symptoms could indicate any number of diagnoses .
Most of them decrease with treatment , including psychiatric attention and medication .
If you ’re concerned by your feelings or behavior , you may be struggling with one of the following common psychiatric illnesses :
Schizophrenia According to the National Institute of Mental Health , schizophrenia is a chronic , severe , and disabling brain disorder that affects about 1.1 percent of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year .
People with this disorder hear and see things that are n’t there , making it difficult to identify real experiences .
The top three symptoms of schizophrenia are :
Delusions
The most common schizophrenia symptom , delusions are ideas you believe firmly that are n’t based in fact .
For example , you may believe someone is spying on you or plotting against you .
Psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers defined the three main criteria for an idea to be considered a delusion : Certainty ( held with absolute conviction ) incorrigibility ( not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary ) impossibility or falsity of content ( implausible , bizarre or patently untrue )
Hallucination
A hallucination is a perception that is n’t provoked by a stimulus .
You may associate hallucinations with seeing imaginary things — like people who are n’t actually there — but you can also experience the symptom in ways that are n’t visual .
You could have auditory hallucinations , such as hearing voices , or olfactory hallucinations , such as smelling rotten flesh .
Another type , known as a hypnagogic hallucination , involves seeing or hearing things just as you fall asleep .
Paranoia Paranoia — baseless or excessive suspicion or others — is n’t always pathological .
Everyone gets paranoid from time to time .
The psychiatric symptom is far more severe ; it usually involves delusions about other people ’s intentions .
Approximately one - third of delusional thoughts in schizophrenia patients cause paranoia .
Bipolar Disorder ( also known as manic depression )
Two main symptoms characterize bipolar disorder : alternating periods of intense highs ( mania ) and lows ( depression ) .
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that approximately 5.7 million American adults suffer from bipolar disorder , totaling 2.6 of the US population over 18 .
The top three symptoms of bipolar disorder are : Mania Mania entails increased energy , enhanced mood , and difficulty sleeping .
Manic people often feel so high of life they believe they ’re invincible , and as a result , exhibit poor judgment — spending excessively , or engaging in sexual acts with many partners , for example .
Hypomania — which only lasts a few days , as opposed to a week or longer — can be just as dangerous .
It also involves rapid talking , decreased need for sleep , and inflated self esteem .
Depression Depression as a psychiatric symptom is more severe than sadness or anger .
Signs include persistent feelings of sadness , anxiety , hopelessness , guilt , irritability , or isolation ; fatigue , apathy , and loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable ; sleep and appetite disturbances ; social anxiety ; and self - loathing .
Suicidal thoughts
It all starts with suicidal ideation — thinking about the idea of suicide , and possibly making a detailed plan .
Some people ideate without intending to pull the trigger ; they ’re just depressed enough to consider the possibility of taking their life .
Research shows 30 – 70 % of all suicide victims suffer from major depression , post - traumatic stress disorder , or bipolar disorder .
If you or someone you know is considering suicide , read the Mayo Clinic ’s advice on staying safe .
You do n’t have to die or live in pain — there is a way out .
Dementia Disorders Dementia is an impairment of intellect , memory and personality .
Alzheimer ’s — the most well - known form of dementia — affects 5.3 million Americans , many over 65 years old .
Other causes of dementia include : complications of chronic high blood pressure , blood vessel disease , or previous stroke ; advanced Parkinson ’s disease ; Huntington ’s disease ; and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease .
The top three symptoms of bipolar disorder are : Memory Loss Although memory loss is one of the most common signs of dementia , it is not isolated to this condition .
Trauma , drug or alcohol abuse , or an infection may also be to blame .
Memory loss only qualifies as a diagnostic criteria if affects your daily living — you forget how to do things you ’ve done many time before , like tying your shoes , or you ca n’t keep track of things that happen from one day to the next .
Personality / mood changes
In the early stages of dementia , people often exhibit dramatic changes in personality .
An outgoing person may suddenly become withdrawn , or a shy person may make bold choices .
Research indicates personality changes aid in the early detection of Alzheimer ’s , which could facilitate early treatment .
Time and place disorientation People with dementia often get lost in familiar places , on their own street for example .
They may also have difficult remembering how they got somewhere , or how they can get home .
If this is your key symptom , you could be struggling with multiple personality disorder , also known as dissociative identity disorder .
Sufferers have alternate personalities that function independently of each other — meaning you could wake up in a park and not remember how you got there or what you did along the way .
As you may have ascertained , mental illness encompasses a vast range of conditions .
Even if you have clear symptoms , it ’s impossible to diagnose yourself by reading — especially since your mind is where the problems all began !
If you believe your mental state has declined in some way , visit a licensed mental health professional for diagnosis .
You ’re not crazy — but it would be crazy to suffer in silence from an illness that can improve with treatment .
Ah , moral crusades .
Fewer things can unite us together or angry up the blood more than organizations that fight for a cause .
But think tank groups do n’t start in a vacuum .
They ’re organized and recruited and assembled by hard - working individuals with an axe to grind .
But just like John Kerry in a chain email , some people flip - flop .
Here ’s a list of people who changed their minds after having a hand in changing the world .
1 ) Bussee & Cooper – Exodus International
The early 1970 ’s was a tumultuous time for our nation ’s homosexuals .
The Stonewall Riots paved the way for gay rights groups while simultaneously setting back gay rights , AIDS was beginning its toehold on society and Al Pacino was beginning his acting career .
And in 1973 , an organization was co-founded by two men who claimed to have been cured of being gay .
Exodus International , a group of hard - core bible thumpers who believe homosexuality can be cured through prayer and disappointingly few pictures of naked women .
The co-founders were Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper , and after working together for several years ( presumably while taking lots of cold showers ) they each divorced their wives and got gay married in 1979 .
This entire article was written just so that we could post their wedding photo below :
Gary Cooper unfortunately died of AIDS in 1991 , but Michael Bussee is still an ex-ex - gay activist who penned an official apology for helping start the organization .
Exodus International finally dissolved in 2013 , very publicly .
2 ) Candy Lightner – MADD
Some tragedies are born of tragedies .
Candy Lightner ‘s daughter was unfortunately killed by a drunk driver in 1980 , and because the guy got such a light sentence Lightner decided to start the organization MADD .
Little did she know how much the group would appeal to women who were apparently harassed by a beer keg , so irrational is their hatred for any beverage with alcohol in it .
As MADD became more and more prohibitionist and as her accidental minions picked up their barrel - smashing hatchets Carrie Nation style , Lightner left the organization in disgust only five years after she started it , stating “ MADD has become far more neo- prohibitionist than I had ever wanted or envisioned … I did n’t start MADD to deal with alcohol .
I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving ” .
MADD of course is alive and well today as those of us who ’ve gone to high school within the past twenty years know .
And thanks to those manipulative “ plays ” where the uppity student council trucked in totaled cars into the football stadium , we ca n’t responsibly sip a beer without breaking into a cold sweat .
3 ) Brandon Darby – Common Ground
Brandon Darby was the ultimate far - left activist .
Handsome and a natural leader , it was as though he was forged from the lofty dreams of dread - locked girls listening to Ani Difranco .
Darby was a mainstay in the Austin activist crowd , but he was n’t exactly a hippie , more like a Black Panther if the Panthers were revolutionary white guys from South Texas .
He was n’t a vegetarian , he owned guns , he had lots of sex with no doubt hairy young women and probably did n’t play much hackey sack .
His rise to fame came when he helped start a relief organization in post - Katrina New Orleans - Common Ground .
He was flying high off the praise of fellow leftist extremists until , while on a funding trip to Venezuela , he was recruited to help start guerrilla warfare in the swamps of Louisiana .
Spooked and in over his head , Darby decided that the violent overthrow of the U.S. government maybe was n’t for him and he eventually quit Common Ground to return to Austin and attempt to live a normal life .
Then it was just a natural move for him to become an FBI informant .
Sponsored by law enforcement , Darby infiltrated a group of political protesters and helped them plan an arson tactic using Molotov cocktails at a Republican National Convention .
Since Darby was wired , two young guys – David Guy McKay and Bradley Neal Crowder – were arrested and probably water boarded .
Helped in part by Darby ’s testimony , Crowder and McKay ’s soft , supple bodies were sentenced to 24 and 48 months in federal prison respectively .
4 ) Justin Boyer – ANSWP
Some guys are just walking Mountain Dew commercials of extreme .
Take for example Justin Boyer– a good - looking guy who read Mein Kampf at age ten , was suspended from school for laughing at and NAZI - saluting a Holocaust survivor , and co-founded the American National Socialist Workers Party - a neo-NAZI group of dudes from Ohio with too much time on their hands .
In 2008 , Boyer was listening to Obama ’s acceptance speech and changed his racist ways .
So much so that only a few months after ceasing tattooing himself with swastikas and lightening bolts he began The United Globalist Movement– a far - left militia aimed at forming a one - world government to stamp out racism , prejudice , religious extremism , poverty and environmental evils .
The militia never really made it out of the development stage , but his heart was in the right place .
And say what you will about Obama , but clearly the man ’s a hypnotist of super hero proportions and we must be sure he uses his powers for good and not evil .
If he can get a NAZI like Boyer to renounced an insatiable desire to lynch minorities surely he can get the leaders of China and Japan to finally make out .
Wetlands International , a not - for - profit organization dedicated to preserving the world ’s wetlands , has warned of drastic environmental consequences if the Russia government goes ahead with plans to begin large scale peat mining , including the potential release of 113 gigatons of carbon .
Peat mining for energy “ causes much larger carbon dioxide emissions than fossil fuels , will ruin precious nature and disrupt the hydrology of large areas , ” writes Tatiana Minaeva from Wetlands International .
Large - scale plans for exploitation of the country ’s massive peatlands was recently announced by Konstantin Alekseyev , director of the Department of coal mining and peat industry of the Russia ’s Ministry , on the ministry ’s website .
Currently carbon emission from Russia ’s peatlands are 100 megatons per year ( only 0.1 percent of Russia ’s energy use ) , however with 1.4 square kilometers of peatland , containing 47 percent of global peat resources , Russia could potentially release 113 gigatons of carbon from peatland mining if all peatlands were drained .
Such emissions would comprise fifteen times the annual global carbon emissions .
Russia should “ develop only small scale mining for local use in remote areas and to only allow techniques that limit the impact on the landscape and allow natural regrowth , such as ‘ wet ’ peat extraction to limit the extraction to small areas were also deep layers are mined instead of large surfaces .
In addition , mined areas should be restored by ending drainage , ” Minaeva writes .
Wetlands International further warns that peatland ecosystems in Russia are extremely sensitive to disturbance , saying that any impact is “ often ten times the size of the area of the activity itself ” .
Currently third ( as of 2006 ) in the list of highest carbon emitters behind China and the United States , Russia ’s president recently announced that it would lower its carbon emissions by 10 - 15 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
However , this actually means Russia plans to raise emissions , since emissions were far higher in 1990 before the collapse of the Soviet Union .
The announcement means Russia will allow emissions to rise by 2 - 2.5 percent every year until 2020 .
Ireland and Finland have the world ’s highest percentage of energy generated by draining peatlands .

Russia pledges to raise carbon emissions to combat global warming
( 06/25/2009 )
In a bizarre announcement that threatens to further weaken the international community ’s ability to come together on climate change , Russia has said it will reduce its emissions 10 - 15 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
The problem is that in 1990 Russia ’s carbon emissions were much higher than they are today , so this ‘ lowering ’ of carbon emissions actually means that Russia will raise its emissions by 2 to 2.5 percent annually until 2020 .

Location : BG ’s Food Cartel in Beaverton
Description :
Another field trip yielded yet another great cart find – The Frying Scotsman .
This new fish and chips cart is located in NW Portland , away from the regular pods we normally see every day downtown .
Yet , after a 10 minute bus ride and a block or two walk , I found the cart and discovered two more within walking distance .
Who knew NW 22nd was a cart magnet ?
The day I visited , autumn had arrived and was threatening rain .
Being an Oregonian , I was out just in a sweater with no jacket nor umbrella , secretly hoping to not be caught uncovered .
When I arrived at The Frying Scotsman , I was glad to discover his cart is in a garage , fully covered and protected from the elements .
The Frying Scotsman focuses on traditional British style fish and chips .
The owner and head chef James was born and raised outside of Glasgow and only recently moved to Portland with his family .
While eating my lunch , ( during the downpour , protected by the garage ) I was able to chat with James .
Such a friendly gentleman who has traveled the world working in different countries and experiencing life .
A lifelong chef , opening a “ British chippy ” after not being able to find work in this town was a natural conclusion .
I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the haddock fish and chips .
James serves up large portions of fish , lightly breaded with a handful of thick cut fried potatoes .
Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection .
I ’m one of those eaters who love his condiments and the tarter sauce complemented the fish just right .
What ’s great was that it was n’t needed that much as the fish was tasty in and of itself .
Sitting there at a small fold up table decorated with an embroidered table cloth while watching it rain and rain was a perfect way to spend my lunch .
The Frying Scotsman is a find .
I ’m glad James decided to open this cart .
Welcome to Portland sir and we wish you all well .
Take a field trip up to NW 22nd and say hi to James .
He ’s a great conversationalist and has some great stories .
I know I ’ll be back .
Tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Posters of the Russian Civil War , 1918 - 1922

Ian Pearl has fought for his life every day of his 37 years .
Confined to a wheelchair and hooked to a breathing tube , the muscular dystrophy victim refuses to give up .
But his insurance company already has .
Legally barred from discriminating against individuals who submit large claims , the New York - based insurer simply canceled lines of coverage altogether in entire states to avoid paying high - cost claims like Mr. Pearl’s .
In an e-mail , one Guardian Life Insurance Co. executive called high - cost patients such as Mr. Pearl “ dogs ” that the company could “ get rid of . ”
A federal court quickly ruled that the company ’s actions were legal , so on Dec. 1 , barring an order by the federal Department of Health and Human Services , Mr. Pearl will lose his benefits .
His medical treatment costs $ 1 million a year .
Most of that is for ‘ round the clock , in - home nursing care - for operation of his ventilator , hourly breathing treatments and continuous intravenous medication .
( Corrected paragraph : ) A Guardian spokesman said policies such as Mr. Pearl ’s - which offered unlimited home nursing - had simply become too expensive for new small - business customers to buy , and that even Medicaid and Medicare do not cover 24 - hour home nursing .
His parents , Warren and Susan Pearl of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , said their health insurance premiums had risen over the years to $ 3,700 a month .
As a last resort , Mr. Pearl would be admitted to a state hospital under Medicaid .
But the Pearls consider that a death sentence .
“ Ian would be lucky , or unlucky , to survive more than a matter of weeks or months , ” Mrs. Pearl said .
“ One - on - one skilled nursing is essential . ”
Her husband , 60 , a wealthy businessman , said the couple have enough savings to pay for their son ’s care for a few years , and after that , they could mortgage the family ’s home .
The Pearls ’ younger son , Matthew , is the best - selling author of “ The Last Dickens , ” a novel published this year by Random House .
“ Ian and Matt spend hours on the phone discussing story lines .
Matt uses
Ian to bounce ideas off of , ” Mrs. Pearl said .
Ian Pearl became the first wheelchair - bound pupil to be mainstreamed in the Broward County elementary schools , and he was elected president of his high school class at University School of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale .
He has Type II spinal muscular atrophy - which often kills victims in infancy .
He grew to adulthood only to suffer respiratory arrest at 19 .
He has required a tracheal tube ever since .
He has been fortunate most of his life to be covered under the Guardian small - business health plan his father bought through his remodeling company , Warren Pearl Construction of New York City .
Generous by modern standards , the health insurance plan covered home nursing , something most small - business plans do not cover today .
Over the years , Guardian has scaled back the benefits in new types of plans it has offered , to the point where it no longer offers in - home nursing coverage .
In the state of New York , where Mr. Pearl ’s business operates , 54 other employers offered the Guardian plan .
Their policies covered nearly 500 employees and dependents , including two other severely ill people .
The Pearls moved to Fort Lauderdale 30 years ago because the humidity there is beneficial to their son .
Warren Pearl has commuted back and forth from New York every weekend since .
He said Guardian has for years used private investigators to find pretexts to deny coverage .
An investigator came to their door , he said , to get proof that he does in fact fly back and forth to New York and that his two - employee company really operates in New York .
Investigators went to Mr. Pearl ’s job sites .
“ The insurance companies are cheating in order to have obscene profits , ” he said .
Guardian , a 150 - year - old mutual company , reported profits of $ 437 million last year , a 50 percent increase over $ 292 million in 2007 .
It paid dividends of $ 723 million to policyholders and had $ 4.3 billion in capital reserves , according to its annual report .
The company ’s investment income totaled $ 1.5 billion that year , a small increase from the year earlier .
The insurer also canceled similar policies in New Jersey and South Carolina , and earlier ceased offering any health plans in Colorado , but did not cancel all of the policies in every state in which they were offered , said John Fried , the Pearls ’ attorney .
The company took the action only against those plans where claims were highest , he said .
The insurer discontinued the coverage late last year , but was required by law to continue paying for Ian Pearl ’s care for another year .
In 2006 , Guardian began an initiative called Moving Forward , which was “ designed to increase Guardian ’s competitive position by reducing what it paid out in claims , ” wrote Judge William Pauley , of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , in his summary judgment in Guardian ’s favor in July .
The move would help the company lower overall rates to compete better for more business .
The judge found that the company had not violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) , because it canceled entire policy lines .
The Pearls also claimed Guardian violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , but the judge found that only HHS can enforce that law and that private citizens cannot sue under it .
The Pearls appealed to HHS under the Bush administration and were told the agency could do nothing , Warren Pearl said .
They petitioned again in a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Oct. 5 , with support from their congresswoman , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Florida Democrat , but have not heard back .
Contacted by The Washington Times last week , the agency said , “ Our Department has been contacted by the Pearl family and we have heard their very serious concerns .
We are actively investigating this matter . ”
The House Energy and Commerce Committee , chaired by Rep. Henry A. Waxman , California Democrat , is also investigating , the Pearls said .
The committee held hearings on benefit cancellations earlier this year .
Spokesmen for Mr. Waxman and Ms. Wasserman Schultz did not respond to requests for comment .
In an e-mail to four other Guardian executives entered into evidence in the Pearls ’ suit , company Vice President Tim Birely discussed how the company could “ eliminate this entire block to get rid of the few dogs . ”
He concluded , “ Paul [ Saylor ] , keep in mind that my intent is to be as narrow and laser - like as possible .
We may need to broaden some things in NY due to state of domicile and some historical [ nonsense ] with some of these policyholders . ”
Asked about the use of the phrases such as “ get rid of ” and “ dogs , ” Guardian spokesman Richard Jones said , “ I ’m not aware of any language related to any of the things that you just mentioned , no . ”
He said plans such as Mr. Pearl ’s had simply become too expensive to market to employers .
“ We certainly sympathize with [ Mr. Pearl ’s ] ’s condition .
As a business , though , we have to offer plans that enough customers want , ” Mr. Jones said .
“ But in this particular case the expense of the plan meant that most small businesses were not able or were not willing to purchase it .
As a result we started offering different plans , ” he said .
“ This has been through the courts .
Guardian ’s activities were upheld by the courts as well as by the New York State Department of Insurance .
“ We certainly do n’t think this particular case has anything to do with health care reform , ” Mr. Jones said .
Mr. Fried argues in his appeal that Judge Pauley misinterpreted the ERISA law .
“ I think we ’re entitled to a trial as to whether Guardian ’s discontinuation of its policy was in effect discrimination against Ian Pearl , ” he said .
The Pearls say they are out for justice .
“ This is a matter of life and death for my son , ” Warren Pearl said .
“ I have to have faith that HHS will enforce the law .
“ This is attempted murder , as far as I ’m concerned .
They targeted us , they never expected to get caught .
I believe that justice will prevail . ”

BRECKENRIDGE , Colo . 
High - altitude partying is a deeply carved tradition in ski country , where alcohol in the open and illicit drugs in the shadows have been intertwined for years .
Even before last week ’s town vote here that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana , one of the best - selling T - shirts at Shirt and Ernie ’s on Main Street winked at what it means to live and play 9,600 feet up in the Rockies .
“ Dude , ” the shirt says , “ I think this whole town is high . ”
But what the town ’s drug ordinance could mean for the local culture and economy , as well as its potential impact on the resort industry if more ski towns go Breckenridge ’s way , has become part of the discussion as people scan the skies and wait for snow .
For business owners ever vigilant about the town ’s image , safety - minded resort managers and footloose ski and snowboard vagabonds whose ranks have given towns like this a tinge of wildness since the first ski bum washed a dish or waited a table , marijuana is openly discussed as perhaps never before .
An 11 - year - old girl has become a mother after going into labour during her wedding .
Reports say the girl was still wearing her wedding dress when she arrived at hospital and gave birth to a baby girl .

" It feels strange to be a mum and have a baby , " Kordeza Zhelyazkova told News of the World .
" I used to play with my toys but now she is my new toy .
She is so beautiful , I love her .
Violeta is the child and I must grow up .
I am not going back to school - I am a mother now . "
Kordeza met her 19 - year - old husband , Jeliazko Dimitrov , in the playground of her Roma gypsy school in Sliven , Bulgaria , when he rescued her from bullies .
" Then she arranged to meet me and asked me out on our first date .
I thought she was 15 .
She did n't tell me she was 11 , " Dimitrov was quoted as saying .
According to News of the World , Kordeza was conceived a week later .
" I have n't had sex education classes and I did n't know how to get pregnant .
I 'd never had a boyfriend and I 'd never heard of condoms . "
" I did n't know I was pregnant until my grandmother saw I had put on weight .
I just thought I 'd eaten too many burgers . "
Dida , the girl 's grandmother , was herself pregnant at 13 .
" It 's normal for our girls to have babies young .
It 's our tradition .
But I did n't want it for my Kordeza - I felt she was too young , " she was quoted as saying .
Dimitrov is now facing up to six years in prison for having sex with a minor .
" I 'm scared .
I want to look after my wife and child .
Instead I may be going to prison , " he told News of the World .
Sliven is the underage mother capital of Europe with 177 cases last year .
What If They Passed Single - Payer and Didn't Tell Anyone ?
That might have just happened , at least at the state level .
The Wyden folks quietly slipped in an amendment giving states enormous flexibility to experiment upward .
Essentially , states can ask the federal government for a waiver that allows them to keep the federal funds they 're receiving and do pretty much anything they want with them , so long as the coverage they provide is " at least as comprehensive as required under the Chairman ’s Mark " and will " lower health care spending growth , improve the delivery system performance , provide affordable choices for all its citizens , expand protections against excessive out - of - pocket spending , provides coverage to the same number of uninsured and not increase the Federal deficit . "
That could be used for a public option .
But it could also be used for single - payer .
The potential problem , as Jon Cohn points out , is that a Republican statehouse could use it to ratchet back coverage in existing public programs .
But since the amendment does n't allow anything to drift beneath the levels envisioned in the bill itself , it 's hard to imagine a conservative state using it to be any less generous than the state would otherwise be .
On the other hand , it 's not impossible to imagine a liberal state using the waiver to introduce some mega-public plan that 's a lot stronger than what 's currently on the table and can be used as a demonstration project for other states .
At the very least , this should make governor 's races more interesting from the health - care perspective .
As I add info as I find it , please discuss the implications in comments .
From Fisk 's article
The Americans , who are aware the meetings have taken place – although they have not discovered the details – are sure to fight this international cabal which will include hitherto loyal allies Japan and the Gulf Arabs .
Against the background to these currency meetings , Sun Bigan , China 's former special envoy to the Middle East , has warned there is a risk of deepening divisions between China and the US over influence and oil in the Middle East .
" Bilateral quarrels and clashes are unavoidable , " he told the Asia and Africa Review .
" We cannot lower vigilance against hostility in the Middle East over energy interests and security . "
This sounds like a dangerous prediction of a future economic war between the US and China over Middle East oil – yet again turning the region 's conflicts into a battle for great power supremacy .
China uses more oil incrementally than the US because its growth is less energy efficient .
The transitional currency in the move away from dollars , according to Chinese banking sources , may well be gold .
An indication of the huge amounts involved can be gained from the wealth of Abu Dhabi , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Qatar who together hold an estimated $ 2.1 trillion in dollar reserves .
And more on China
Chinese financial sources believe President Barack Obama is too busy fixing the US economy to concentrate on the extraordinary implications of the transition from the dollar in nine years ' time .
The current deadline for the currency transition is 2018 .
The US discussed the trend briefly at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh ; the Chinese Central Bank governor and other officials have been worrying aloud about the dollar for years .
Their problem is that much of their national wealth is tied up in dollar assets .
" These plans will change the face of international financial transactions , " one Chinese banker said .
" America and Britain must be very worried .
You will know how worried by the thunder of denials this news will generate . "

From Reuters : Gulf in talks on replacing US $ for oil : report
From Bloomberg : Dollar Falls as Paper Says Arab States May Stop Using Greenback
Another Reuters : Ending dollar oil sales easy ; pricing is hard
CNBC : Dollar Falls on Report of Ending its Use in Oil Trade
The UK's Independent newspaper , citing unnamed sources , said the talks centred on using a basket of currencies , including the yen , yuan and euro , as well as gold .
The proposed transition would take place within nine years , it said .
" This is U.S. dollar negative news which is moving markets and shows that central banks not just in Asia are looking to diversify away from the dollar , " said Jonathan Cavenagh , currency
analyst at Westpac .
" This looks to be a very long term thing with a few hurdles to cross , " he said , adding that European authorities would likely be reluctant to agree to such an idea since euro zone
manufacturers are sensitive to exchange rate moves .
The euro rose 0.3 percent compared to late U.S. trading on Monday to $ 1.4688 [ EUR= 1.4704 0.0056 ( +0.38 % ) ] .
The dollar extended its losses against the yen after the Independent report , falling to as low as 88.97 yen on trading platform EBS , down from the day 's high of 89.65 yen .
The greenback was last down 0.5 percent on the day at 89.09 yen [ JPY= 89.07 - 0.46 ( - 0.51 % ) ] .

UPDATE TUES 10/6 early early am : Saudi Bank Governor Denies Talks to Replace Dollar
Saudi Arabia has n’t held talks with China and other countries on dropping the dollar as the currency for pricing oil , Saudi Central Bank Governor Muhammad al - Jasser said , denying a report in the U.K. ’s Independent newspaper .
The Independent report is " absolutely incorrect " and there has been " absolutely nothing " of that nature discussed between Saudi Arabia , the world ’s biggest oil exporter , and other countries , al - Jasser told reporters in Istanbul , where he ’s attending an International Monetary Fund summit .
The dollar pared losses after his remarks .
Representatives of other nations mentioned in the " secret meetings " have also denied knowledge of such meetings .
No word yet from Fisk or the Independent regarding these latest developments .
It appears to have been an overnight sensation .
Fisk 's credibility appears to be on the line here .
If there are further clarifications on this story today , I 'll post them here .
In the meantime , it will be useful to keep an eye on how the markets react today .
Regardless what the politicians and reporters say , what people do with investment in dollars and commodities like gold and oil will be telling .
Gold futures are at an 18 month high right now at $ 1028 / oz and are trending even higher .
The DXY is off its overnight low of 76.22 and is hovering around 76.35 .
Oil futures are up a bit at 71.33 .
Here is an excellent discussion and round up of opinion about Fisk 's story and reaction to it from the Financial Times Alphaville :
The world and the dollar react to Robert Fisk
Introduction
The goal of my project is to create a modular , reusable hexagon based map that could be used in simple games and ALife applications .
I wanted to leverage as much functionality as possible from .
NET , which meant using GDI + and Forms .
Drawing shapes with GDI + and capturing mouse events with Forms is fairly trivial , which would allow me to spend my programming time solving on more important issues ( like hexagon geometry ! ) .
This is the first " version " of the hex map , and by no means complete .
Hexagon
Hexagon based games , whether traditional board games or computer - based , provide more strategic and tactical game - play when compared to simple square based games ( like the Checkers game board ) .
The hexagon has six sides , which allows movement in six directions , instead of four .
The distance from the center of a hexagon to the center of each neighboring hexagon is equal , which eliminates the distortion of calculating diagonal distance in a traditional square based map .
Hexagons are more pleasing to look at , which counts for something , right ?
The core of my code is based on the geometry of the hexagon .
When I use the word hexagon , I really mean regular hexagon , which is a six - sided polygon where all six sides have the same length .
The beauty of the hexagon based map is that you really only need to know one thing : the length of a side of a hexagon .
After that , you can calculate everything else you need to know .
If you know the length of side s , then you can calculate r and h .
The values for a and b are pretty much irrelevant because you can calculate them from s , r , and h , and you do n't really need a and b for any calculations anyway .
So , how do you find r and h ?
h = sin( 30° ) * s r = cos( 30° ) * s b = s + 2 * h a = 2 * r
My namespace is Hexagonal
For lack of a better term , I called my namespace Hexagonal , and that 's where all my core classes live .
The class Math has a bunch of static methods to handle geometric calculations .
Some people may argue that these are trigonometric calculations , but for my purposes , trigonometry is a subset of geometry .
public static float CalculateH ( float side ) { return ConvertToFloat( System.Math.Sin(DegreesToRadians ( 30 ) ) * side ) ; } public static float CalculateR ( float side ) { return ConvertToFloat( System.Math.Cos(DegreesToRadians ( 30 ) ) * side ) ; } public static double DegreesToRadians ( double degrees ) { return degrees * System .
Math .
PI / 180 ; }
The Sin and Cos methods in System .
Math take arguments in radians , not degrees .
So , we need a helper method to convert degrees to radians .
The Hex object represents a hexagon .
When creating a Hex object , you need to know a few things - the length of a side , the x , y coordinates of the upper vertex , and the orientation of the hex .
I introduced the concept of orientation so that hexes could be created with the flat side down or a pointy side down .
The orientation will affect how the vertices are calculated .
The vertices are numbered somewhat arbitrarily on my part , but we need to refer to vertices in some manner .
The important method in Hex is CalculateVertices ( ) , which is private and called by the constructor .
I also created an enumeration for hexagonal orientation .
public class Hex { private System. Drawing .PointF [ ] points ; private float side ; private float h ; private float r ; private Hexagonal .
HexOrientation orientation ; private float x ; private float y ; ... private void CalculateVertices ( ) { h = Hexagonal.Math.CalculateH( side ) ; r = Hexagonal.Math.CalculateR( side ) ; switch ( orientation ) { case Hexagonal .
HexOrientation .
Flat : points = new System .
Drawing .PointF [ 6 ] ; points [ 0 ] = new PointF ( x , y ) ; points [ 1 ] = new PointF( x + side , y ) ; points [ 2 ] = new PointF( x + side + h , y + r ) ; points [ 3 ] = new PointF( x + side , y + r + r ) ; points [ 4 ] = new PointF ( x , y + r + r ) ; points [ 5 ] = new PointF( x - h , y + r ) ; break ; case Hexagonal .
HexOrientation .
Pointy : points = new System .
Drawing .PointF [ 6 ] ; points [ 0 ] = new PointF ( x , y ) ; points [ 1 ] = new PointF( x + r , y + h ) ; points [ 2 ] = new PointF( x + r , y + side + h ) ; points [ 3 ] = new PointF ( x , y + side + h + h ) ; points [ 4 ] = new PointF( x - r , y + side + h ) ; points [ 5 ] = new PointF( x - r , y + h ) ; break ; default : throw new Exception ( " No HexOrientation defined for Hex object . " ) ; } } } public enum HexOrientation { Flat = 0 , Pointy = 1 , }
The Hex class was designed to be simple .
All it does is remember its position in two dimensional space .
The Board class is a collection of Hex objects that represent a game board .
For this first version , the only type of board that can be created is rectangular .
Arranging hexagons in a rectangular shape can be done fairly simply using a two dimensional array .
For example , a board with Flat orientation would map to a two dimensional array like this :
The most important method in the Board class is Initialize ( ) , which is private and called from the constructor .
Initialize ( ) creates a two dimensional array of Hex objects with all the calculations for the hex vertices .
public class Board { private Hexagonal .
Hex [ , ] hexes ; private int width ; private int height ; private int xOffset ; private int yOffset ; private int side ; private float pixelWidth ; private float pixelHeight ; private Hexagonal .
HexOrientation orientation ; ... private void Initialize ( int width , int height , int side , Hexagonal .
HexOrientation orientation , int xOffset , int yOffset ) { this . width = width ; this .height = height ; this .xOffset = xOffset ; this .
yOffset = yOffset ; this . side = side ; this .orientation = orientation ; hexes = new Hex [ height , width ] ; this .boardState = new BoardState ( ) ; float h = Hexagonal.Math.CalculateH( side ) ; float r = Hexagonal.Math.CalculateR( side ) ; float hexWidth = 0 ; float hexHeight = 0 ; switch ( orientation ) { case HexOrientation .
Flat : hexWidth = side + h ; hexHeight = r + r ; this .
pixelWidth = ( width * hexWidth ) + h ; this .
pixelHeight = ( height * hexHeight ) + r ; break ; case HexOrientation .
Pointy : hexWidth = r + r ; hexHeight = side + h ; this .
pixelWidth = ( width * hexWidth ) + r ; this .
pixelHeight = ( height * hexHeight ) + h ; break ; default : break ; } bool inTopRow = false ; bool inBottomRow = false ; bool inLeftColumn = false ; bool inRightColumn = false ; bool isTopLeft = false ; bool isTopRight = false ; bool isBotomLeft = false ; bool isBottomRight = false ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < height ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < width ; j++ ) { #region Position Booleans if ( i == 0 ) { inTopRow = true ; } else { inTopRow = false ; } if ( i == height - 1 ) { inBottomRow = true ; } else { inBottomRow = false ; } if ( j == 0 ) { inLeftColumn = true ; } else { inLeftColumn = false ; } if ( j == width - 1 ) { inRightColumn = true ; } else { inRightColumn = false ; } if ( inTopRow && inLeftColumn ) { isTopLeft = true ; } else { isTopLeft = false ; } if ( inTopRow && inRightColumn ) { isTopRight = true ; } else { isTopRight = false ; } if ( inBottomRow && inLeftColumn ) { isBotomLeft = true ; } else { isBotomLeft = false ; } if ( inBottomRow && inRightColumn ) { isBottomRight = true ; } else { isBottomRight = false ; } #endregion if ( isTopLeft ) { switch ( orientation ) { case HexOrientation .
Flat : hexes [
0 , 0 ] = new Hex ( 0 + h + xOffset , 0 + yOffset , side , orientation ) ; break ; case HexOrientation .
Pointy : hexes [ 0 , 0 ] = new Hex ( 0 + r + xOffset , 0 + yOffset , side , orientation ) ; break ; default : break ; } } else { switch ( orientation ) { case HexOrientation .
Flat : if ( inLeftColumn ) { hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex ( hexes [ i - 1 , j ] . Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.FlatVertice.BottomLeft ] , side , orientation ) ; } else { if ( j % 2 == 0 ) { float x = hexes [ i , j - 1 ] .
Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.FlatVertice.UpperRight ].X ; float y = hexes [ i , j - 1 ] .
Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.FlatVertice.UpperRight ].Y ; x += h ; y -= r ; hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex(x , y , side , orientation ) ; } else { hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex ( hexes [ i , j - 1 ] . Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.FlatVertice.MiddleRight ] , side , orientation ) ; } } break ; case HexOrientation .
Pointy : if ( inLeftColumn ) { if ( i % 2 == 0 ) { hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex ( hexes [ i - 1 , j ] . Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.PointyVertice.BottomLeft ] , side , orientation ) ; } else { hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex ( hexes [ i - 1 , j ] . Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.PointyVertice.BottomRight ] , side , orientation ) ; } } else { float x = hexes [ i , j - 1 ] .
Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.PointyVertice.UpperRight ].X ; float y = hexes [ i , j - 1 ] .
Points [ ( int ) Hexagonal.PointyVertice.UpperRight ].Y ; x += r ; y -= h ; hexes [ i , j ] = new Hex(x , y , side , orientation ) ; } break ; default : break ; } } } } } } public enum FlatVertice { UpperLeft = 0 , UpperRight = 1 , MiddleRight = 2 , BottomRight = 3 , BottomLeft = 4 , MiddleLeft = 5 , } public enum PointyVertice { Top = 0 , UpperRight = 1 , BottomRight = 2 , Bottom = 3 , BottomLeft = 4 , TopLeft = 5 , }
This method starts by creating a Hex at the array position 0,0 .
After a
Hex object is created , every other Hex can be created because some vertex of a Hex is also the vertex of another Hex .
So , you can loop through the two dimensional array from top to bottom , left to right , creating Hex es .
The orientation will affect the calculations .
I also created enumerations to give friendly names to the vertices .
It 's important to note that we have a two dimensional array of Hex objects , and we 're also calculating x , y pixel coordinates for our hexes , so it 's easy to get confused when you see x , y or i , j , or 0,0 .
The Hex and Board code above is not complete , you 'll have to download the source to view all of it .
There 's just too much to show it all here .
I 've shown you the core methods that do the important work .
The position booleans in Board 's Initialize ( ) method are not strictly necessary , and not all of them are used , but I left them in for now .
public class GraphicsEngine { private Hexagonal .
Board board ; private float boardPixelWidth ; private float boardPixelHeight ; private int boardXOffset ; private int boardYOffset ; ... public void Draw ( Graphics graphics ) { int width = Convert .
ToInt32( System.Math.Ceiling ( board.PixelWidth ) ) ; int height = Convert .
ToInt32( System.Math.Ceiling ( board . PixelHeight ) ) ; width += 1 ; height += 1 ; Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap ( width , height ) ; Graphics bitmapGraphics = Graphics.FromImage ( bitmap ) ; Pen p = new Pen( Color .
Black ) ; SolidBrush sb = new SolidBrush ( Color .
Black ) ; sb = new SolidBrush ( board.BoardState.BackgroundColor ) ; bitmapGraphics .
FillRectangle(sb , 0 , 0 , width , height ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < board .
Hexes.GetLength( 0 ) ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < board .
Hexes.GetLength( 1 ) ; j++ ) { bitmapGraphics .FillPolygon ( new SolidBrush ( board .
Hexes [ i , j ] . HexState.BackgroundColor ) , board .
Hexes [ i , j ] . Points ) ; } } p.Color = board .BoardState .
GridColor ; p. Width = board .
BoardState .
GridPenWidth ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < board .
Hexes.GetLength( 0 ) ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < board .
Hexes.GetLength( 1 ) ; j++ ) { bitmapGraphics .DrawPolygon( p , board .
Hexes [ i , j ] . Points ) ; } } if ( board.BoardState.ActiveHex != null ) { p.Color = board .BoardState.ActiveHexBorderColor ; p. Width = board .BoardState.ActiveHexBorderWidth ; bitmapGraphics.DrawPolygon( p , board.BoardState.ActiveHex.Points ) ; } graphics .
DrawImage ( bitmap , new Point ( this .boardXOffset , this .boardYOffset ) ) ; bitmapGraphics .
Dispose ( ) ; bitmap .
Dispose ( ) ; }
The GraphicsEngine class takes a Board object and writes it to the screen using GDI +.
I 'm not going to take a lot of time to explain GDI + , but the Draw ( ) method accepts a Graphics object which is derived from a calling form .
Draw ( ) then writes the Board and Hex es to a bitmap variable , and finally displays that bitmap to the screen .
You 'll notice that there are the HexState and BoardState classes that are properties of the Hex and Board classes , respectively .
The HexState and BoardState classes contain state type information about the Hex or Board .
In this case , the state information is color .
These classes are not strictly necessary , but I wanted to keep the Hex and Board classes as pure as possible , meaning that they only contain information about geometry and pixels .
This way , the stateful information is separated , and can be developed independently .
Pulling it all together in a Form
To make this all work , you need to create a Form with a GraphicsEngine object and a Board object .
Then , create a handler for the form 's Paint event .
private void Form_Paint ( object sender , PaintEventArgs e ) { foreach ( Control c in this . Controls ) { c.Refresh ( ) ; } if ( graphicsEngine != null ) { graphicsEngine .
Draw (e. Graphics ) ; } this .
Invalidate ( ) ; }
Another option is to override the form 's OnPaint method .
I 've seen this done both ways , but I 've decided to leave OnPaint alone .
I 'm not sure which is the best method , but they both work .
Also , the form 's DoubleBuffered property needs to be set to true .
This can be done in code or in the designer .
Double buffering prevents flicker when you are painting to the screen ( set it to false and see what happens ) .
To capture mouse clicks , create a handler for the form 's MouseClick or MouseDown event .
private void Form_MouseClick ( object sender , MouseEventArgs e ) { if ( board != null && graphicsEngine != null ) { Point mouseClick = new Point ( e.X - graphicsEngine.BoardXOffset , e.Y - graphicsEngine.BoardYOffset ) ; Hex clicked Hex = board .
FindHexMouseClick( mouseClick ) ; if ( clickedHex == null ) { board .
BoardState .
ActiveHex = null ; } else { board .
BoardState .
ActiveHex = clickedHex ; if ( e.Button == MouseButtons .
Right ) { clickedHex .
HexState.BackgroundColor = Color .
Blue ; } } } }
One of the things the GraphicsEngine can do is keep track of an x , y offset so that the Board object can be drawn anywhere on the form .
If there is an offset , the mouse click needs to account for that offset and pass that new x ,y value to the Board 's FindHexMouseClick ( ) method .
The FindHexMouseClick ( ) method is very important because it translates x ,y pixel coordinates to Board / Hex coordinates .
There are several ways to convert pixel to hex coordinates , Google " pixel to hexagon " .
I found a really slick algorithm that will work for any polygon , not just hexagons .
The algorithm takes a point and determines if it lies within a polygon by drawing lines through the edges of the polygon .
A full description can be found here .
My implementation lives in my Math class .
public static bool InsidePolygon ( PointF [ ] polygon , int N , PointF p ) { int counter =
0 ; int i ; double xinters ; PointF p1, p2 ; p1 = polygon [ 0 ] ; for ( i= 1 ; i< =N ; i ++ ) { p2 = polygon [ i % N ] ; if ( p. Y > System .
Math .Min( p1.Y, p2.Y ) ) { if ( p. Y < = System .
Math .Max ( p1.Y , p2.Y ) ) { if ( p.X < = System .
Math .Max ( p1.X, p2.X ) ) { if ( p1.Y != p2.Y ) { xinters = ( p.Y- p1.Y ) *( p2.X-p1.X ) /( p2.Y - p1.Y ) +p1.X ; if ( p1.X == p2.X || p.X < = xinters ) counter ++ ; } } } } p1 = p2 ; } if ( counter % 2 == 0 ) return false ; else return true ; }
Conclusion
Please download the source project since it was impossible to include every last line of code in this article .
My source is a Visual Studio 2005 console project .
The console project actually launches the form .
I did this because you can make Console .
WriteLine ( ) calls from the form and send messages to the console , which is obviously helpful for debugging .

Nearly all Americans say sending a text message while driving should be illegal , and about half say texting while behind the wheel should be punished at least as harshly as drunken driving , according to a recent New York Times / CBS News poll .
“ If you ’re going to drive , drive ; if you want to talk or text , pull over to the side of the road , ” Constance Drake , 71 , of Toms River , N.J. , said in a follow - up interview .
Ninety - seven percent support the prohibition of texting while driving , an unusual level of agreement for any topic .
Eighty percent also support a ban on talking on a hand - held cellphone while driving .
Fifty percent said the punishment for texting while driving should be just as severe as for drunken driving .

The British group Plane Stupid has put out a " shock ad " that is meant to horrify people into being concerned about global warming .
The " horror " part : you see polar bears dropping out of the sky to their bloody deaths on the ground .
For better or worse , the controversial ad has backfired in this household .
Why ?
Because my husband and I are both fans of the TV comedy series WKRP in Cincinnati ( 1978 -1982 ) .
In what is arguably the best - known WKRP episode -- entitled " Turkeys Away " -- the bumbling station manager Mr. Carlson puts on a Thanksgiving promotion that involves tossing live turkeys from a helicopter hovering over a shopping mall .
It is one of the funniest things I 've seen on TV and gave rise to a line much - quoted by fans ; Carlson declares , " As God is my witness , I thought turkeys could fly . "
( For a video clip of the turkey promo , click here .
For Carlson 's declaration , click here . )
Of course , in our household , that line is now " As God is my witness , I thought polar bears could fly .
" ( h/t Watts Up With That .
) A commenter observes : " They 're hitting the ground like sacks of wet cement ! "
That 's another line from " Turkeys Away . "
Police say dead koalas and other frozen road kill may be used to disrupt the Australian leg of the Repco World Rally Championship in the Tweed Valley tomorrow .
Head of the Tweed - Byron police , Superintendent Michael Kenny , told local media protest groups rallying against the racing event would be watched closely after rumours began circulating about the use of dead animals , the lighting of fires and people laying across the track .
" Some of the bizarre things are that there is road kill been put in freezers that is going to be thrown on to the road during the event , " Superintendent Kenny said yesterday .
" That 's a rumour at best but I 'm saying there are a lot of stories going around about this sort of madness that may or may not occur . "
Protest groups No Rally and Kyogle - based 7th Generation oppose the rally on environmental grounds , claiming it will frighten off wildlife and disrupt the areas breeding season .
Albany health professionals question safety of hastily introduced H1N1 vaccine

UPDATE : The following statement was sent to us by the New York State Nurses Association ;
Thank you for discussing the problems concerning mandatory immunization in your recent article “ Nurses plan rally to protest mandatory swine flu shot . ”
Although the referenced Newsday article correctly states that our organization supports opposition to mandatory vaccination , the article on PrisionPlanet .
Com inaccurately draws an connection between the organizers of the Sept. 29 rally and the New York State Nurses Association .
Our position is that : The New York State Nurses Association is not affiliated with the Health Workers March on Albany .
While we share the belief that immunization should not be mandatory , NYSNA disputes the accuracy of the rally organizers ’ message and believes such a rally is not the best method of resolving this issue .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Albany nurses and other health professionals are planning to stage a rally next week to protest a state regulation that mandates they will lose their jobs if they refuse to take the swine flu shot , as fears grow about the vaccine ’s dangerous ingredients and government plans to forcibly inoculate whole populations with the H1N1 jab .
Earlier today we reported on the case of “ Clare , ” a daycare worker in Albany who , despite having minimal contact with hospital staff who work in a separate building , an exemption allowed in the official decree , was ordered to take the seasonal flu shot on the spot or be fired .
She was also advised that the same procedure would be in place for the swine flu shot , as is outlined in the New York State Department of Health ’s emergency regulation issued in August .
Now nurses across the state are standing up against government intimidation to take the shot , pointing out that the vaccine has not been properly tested and contains mercury , squalene and other dangerous additives .
The New York State Nurses Association is supporting a demonstration on behalf of nurses set to take place next week , reports Newsday .
“ This vaccine has not been clinically tested to the same degree as the regular flu vaccine , ” said Tara Accavallo , a registered nurse in Stony Brook ’s neonatal intensive care unit , the division that has produced a number of protesters .
“ If something happens to me , if I get seriously injured from this vaccine , who ’s going to help me ? ”
Accavallo says she is willing to lose her job if need be , which is exactly what will happen to thousands of other health professionals on November 30 if the government refuses to back down .
Rob Kozik , another registered nurse in Stony Brook ’s neonatal intensive care unit , said he has no problems with a seasonal vaccine but he has deep concerns about being immunized against H1N1 .
“ I usually get vaccinated against the flu , but they are mandating an untested and unproven vaccine , ” Kozik told Newsday “ The H1N1 vaccine already has a poor track record , ” he added .
“ Back in 1976 there was vaccine [ to protect against swine flu ] that caused death and Guillain - Barre syndrome , ” said Kozik , referring to a nerve - damaging disorder that some people linked to the vaccine .
He said he also worries about the vaccine additive thimerosal , which is used as a preservative in some doses of the vaccine .
According to Dr. Steven Walerstein , medical director of Nassau University Medical Center where H1N1 vaccinations have already started , 25 workers at the institution refused to take the shot and were later “ referred to human resources and counseling . ”

A d v e r t i s e m e n t
If polls are proven accurate , at least a third of nurses and health workers in the U.S. and the UK will refuse to take the shot , with another third still undecided .
The fact that health professionals , and even employees loosely affiliated with hospitals , are being intimidated into taking the shot , proves President Obama ’s claim that the vaccine will be voluntary to be deceptive and misleading .
At the very least people ’s livelihoods are on the line if they refuse to be injected and elsewhere , in countries such as Ireland and Greece , authorities have threatened large fines and jail time for people who refuse the vaccine .
As we have previously documented , the swine flu vaccine was rushed through safety procedures while governments have provided pharmaceutical companies with blanket immunity from lawsuits arriving out of the vaccine causing deaths and injuries .
It was previously revealed that some batches of the vaccine will contain mercury , a toxin linked with autism and neurological disorders .
The vaccine will also contain the dangerous ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome and a host of other debilitating diseases .
It was also recently reported that the UK government sent a confidential letter to senior neurologists telling them to be on the alert for cases of a brain disorder called Guillain - Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) , which could be triggered by the vaccine .
The CDC in America replicated this warning weeks later .
As a result of the dangers of the vaccine becoming widely known , authorities are moving to get out ahead of the story by acknowledging that millions of health problems in the aftermath of a vaccination campaign will be blamed on the vaccine , citing the 1976 swine flu debacle when the shot proved far deadlier than the actual virus .
Reuters reports that public health officials , “ Expect an avalanche of so - called adverse event reports , which are reports of death , illness or other health trauma that occur within two weeks after receiving treatment — in this case , the swine flu vaccine , ” in reaction to an estimated “ one million heart attacks , 700,000 strokes and 900,000 miscarriages . ”

Am Freitagabend wurde in Bielefeld der BigBrother Award 2009 in der Kategorie „ žPolitik “ an Dr. Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen , Bundesministerin für Familie , Senioren , Frauen und Jugend , verliehen .
Die gesamte Laudatio von Alvar Freude nach dem Klick .
Der BigBrotherAward 2009 in der Kategorie „ žPolitik “ geht an
Dr. Ursula von der Leyen ,
Bundesministerin für Familie , Senioren , Frauen und Jugend .
Sie hat innerhalb der letzten zwölf Monate ein System zur Inhaltskontrolle im Internet vorangetrieben , das zu einer Technik von orwellschen Ausmaßen heranwachsen kann .
Kaum ein
Thema ließ in den vergangenen Monaten die Emotionen so hochkochen wie die Pläne Ursula von der Leyens , den Zugang zu bestimmten Inhalten im Internet zu blockieren .
Damit wollte sie die Darstellung sexuellen Missbrauchs von Kindern unterbinden .
Ein hehres Ziel , wie könnte man schon dagegen sein ?
Es gibt zwei Gründe , aus denen man dagegen sein muss .
Erstens : Die Sperren sind für die erklärten Ziele , Kinder vor sexuellem Missbrauch zu schützen und die Verbreitung entsprechender Darstellungen zu vermindern , nicht nur untauglich , sondern sogar kontraproduktiv .
Gleichzeitig gäbe es bessere und wirksamere Methoden , die freilich im Wahlkampf nicht so viel Aufmerksamkeit erzeugen .
Zweitens : Die Sperren etablieren eine technische Infrastruktur zur Internet - Zensur , die in der Lage ist , beliebige Inhalte zu kontrollieren und blockieren .
Es entstünde ein allgegenwärtiges Überwachungsinstrument .
Dies greift nicht nur in unsere freiheitlich - demokratischen Grundrechte ein , sondern ist auch ein erster Schritt der Politik , sich den virtuellen Raum Internet zu unterwerfen .
Aber schauen wir kurz zurück .
Ende November vergangenen Jahres fand in Rio de Janeiro der 3 .
Weltkongress gegen sexuelle Ausbeutung von Kindern und Jugendlichen statt .
Im Vorfeld wurde von verschiedenen Organisationen ein umfangreicher Forderungskatalog präsentiert .
Aus diesem Katalog hat sich Ursula von der Leyen einen Punkt herausgepickt : die Blockade von Webseiten mit einem plakativen Stopp - Schild .
Dabei werden die Inhalte nicht entfernt .
Sie werden nur versteckt .
So wenig , wie ich verschwinde , wenn mir jemand ein Stopp - Schild vors Gesicht hält , genauso wenig verschwinden Webseiten auf diese Weise .
Wochenlang zog nun Ursula von der Leyen von Wahlkampfauftritt zu Wahlkampfauftritt und berichtete von unfassbaren Taten , denen im Internet jeder einfach zusehen könne .
Ein emotionales
Thema , das alle bewegt .
Und als selbsternannte Heilsbringerin hat sie die vermeintliche Lösung : Internet - Blockaden .
Doch von ihren Begründungen für diese Maßnahme hält kaum etwas einer Überprüfung stand : nicht die angeblichen Milliardenumsätze , nicht die offene Zugänglichkeit für jedermann und vor allem nicht die Wirksamkeit der Stoppschilder , die sie als Maßnahme gegen den Missbrauch anpreist .
Die Bundesregierung musste in einer Stellungnahme einräumen , keine genauen Kenntnisse über den gesamten Themenbereich zu haben .
Nicht über die Verbreitungswege , die Ursprungsländer oder die Umsätze beim oft zitierten massenhaften kommerziellen Vertrieb .
So behauptete die Ministerin , Kinderpornografie im Internet werde beispielsweise aus Indien verbreitet , sei dort nicht verboten und man könne daher dort auch nicht dagegen vorgehen — deshalb bliebe nur die Blockade in Deutschland .
Hier musste sie wenige Tage später nach Protesten Indiens zurückrudern , denn Kinderpornografie ist in Indien schon lange verboten .
Nun behauptet sie , entsprechende Bilder und Videos würden ohne Möglichkeiten der Rechtsdurchsetzung über irgendwelche Bananenrepubliken verbreitet , die so genannten „ žfailed states “ .
Dass dies falsch ist , die einschlägigen Server mehrheitlich in den USA und Westeuropa einschließlich Deutschland stehen und in „ žfailed states “ kein einziger , ficht sie dabei nicht an .
Die Entfernung der Inhalte wäre also möglich , Ursula von der Leyen versteckt sie aber lieber notdürftig .
Sie ist somit diejenige , die weiter die Verbreitung von Darstellungen sexuellen Missbrauchs von Kindern duldet .
Sie ist diejenige , die nicht einschreitet .
Sie tut nichts , sondern hält lediglich einen Vorhang davor und lässt die Täter weiter agieren .
Und sie benutzt das Leid der Kinder — für ihren Wahlkampf und zur Errichtung einer allgemeinen Internet - Zensur - und Kontroll - Infrastruktur .
Jetzt könnte man sagen :
In der Politik wird eben auch mal plakativ mit Symbolen gespielt , das ist in Wahlkampfzeiten kaum zu vermeiden .
Nicht zuletzt hat Wolfgang Schäuble letzte Woche zugegeben , dass es primär um Wahlkampf ging .
Doch der entscheidende
Punkt für unsere Kritik an den Sperrplänen ist nicht einmal , dass sie wirkungslos sind oder dass mit ihnen auf populistische Art Stimmenfang betrieben wird .
Das Entscheidende und wirklich gefährliche sind die Nebenwirkungen .
Das BKA soll geheime Sperrlisten führen , die keiner rechtsstaatlichen Kontrolle unterworfen sind .
Die Exekutive bestimmt , was auf einer Verbotsliste steht , die Liste wird geheim gehalten und eine Kontrolle durch die Judikative findet nicht statt .
Im Gesetz ist zwar ein Gremium vorgesehen , das die Listen nachträglich kontrollieren soll .
Aber dieses Gremium wird kaum in jedem Einzelfall prüfen können , ob das BKA alle anderen Maßnahmen ausgeschöpft hat oder im Land des Anbieters keine Löschung durchsetzbar ist , ob also die im Gesetz verlangte Bedingung erfüllt ist , um einen Sperreintrag in die Liste aufzunehmen .
Für die Blockaden müssen die Internet - Zugangsanbieter eine technische Infrastruktur aufbauen , die zur Kontrolle beliebiger Inhalte genutzt werden kann .
Die unterschiedlichen Interessengruppen stehen schon seit Jahren Schlange :
Sie möchten extremistische politische oder religiöse Meinungen , Glücksspiele , Computerspiele , angebliche oder tatsächliche Urheber - und Persönlichkeitsrechtsverletzungen blockieren — und das ist erst der Anfang .
Deshalb geht es bei diesem Gesetz nicht nur um Kinderpornografie , sondern um viel Grundsätzlicheres : Darf ein demokratischer Staat kontrollieren , was die Bevölkerung lesen kann ?
Darf ein demokratischer Staat eine Infrastruktur zur Inhaltskontrolle einrichten und so den ersten Schritt zu einer umfassenden Zensur gehen ?
Artikel 5 unseres Grundgesetzes definiert nicht nur die Meinungsfreiheit .
Er besagt auch , dass jeder das Recht hat , sich aus allen öffentlichen Quellen ungehindert zu unterrichten .
Dies ist ein wesentliches Grundrecht in einer freiheitlichen Demokratie und schließt auch das Recht ein , Inhalte zu rezipieren , deren Verbreitung nach unserer Rechtsordnung verboten ist .
Eine staatliche Inhaltskontrolle steht dem diametral entgegen .
Wenn wir mit der Meinungs - und Rezipientenfreiheit gegen Internetsperren argumentieren , wird oft gefragt , ob diese Grundrechte denn auch für Kinderpornografie gelten sollen .
Aber diese Frage stellt sich nicht .
Kinderpornografie ist ein Verbrechen .
Sie ist weltweit geächtet und kann weltweit bekämpft werden .
Und genau das muss getan werden , nämlich echte Verbrechensbekämpfung , anstatt Internetseiten mit einem Schild zu versehen , an dem wir nicht vorbeilaufen sollen und es doch problemlos könnten .
Ursula von der Leyen beginnt mit der Demontage eines Mediums , das Bertolt Brechts Radiotheorie Wirklichkeit werden lässt : Seine Vision war , „ žden Zuhörer nicht nur hören , sondern auch sprechen zu machen “ .
Die Netzsperren wenden sich gegen eine solche offene Kommunikation , sie installieren eine allgemeine Inhaltskontrolle .
Es geht um mehr als allein um Zensur .
Es geht darum , wie wir mit der Kommunikationsgesellschaft umgehen .
Kann der Staat akzeptieren , dass er nicht alles kontrollieren darf , auch wenn er technisch dazu in der Lage wäre ?
Die Unterhaltung in allen Bussen , in allen Parks oder in allen Schlafzimmern der Welt kann nur schwer kontrolliert oder gar unterbunden werden .
Bei der Unterhaltung im Internet ist dies möglich .
Die Technik , die für effektive Internet - Sperren nötig ist , kann auch dafür genutzt werden .
Bisher galt nach den Erfahrungen aus der Nazi - Zeit das Tabu : Der Staat manipuliert nicht , was der Bürger rezipiert .
Er erschafft keine Feindsenderverbote .
Ursula von der Leyen bricht dieses Vertrauensverhältnis .
Und wofür ?
Für Wahlkampf - Propaganda .
Noch eine Anmerkung zum Schluss : nach den neusten Ergebnissen der Koalitionsverhandlung zwischen Union und FDP soll das Gesetz zwar in Kraft treten , aber vorerst nicht umgesetzt werden .
Dies ist kein Verdienst von Frau von der Leyen , und die Gefahr ist nicht gebannt , sondern nur verschoben .
Ursula von der Leyen hat den Big Brother Award 2009 redlich verdient .
Daher :
Herzlichen Glückwunsch , Dr. Ursula von der Leyen !

In my last article on these pages , I offered criticism of a New York Times article that had praised the Lincoln administration 's property violations in pursuit of military objectives .
Today I want to focus on a regular Wall Street Journal columnist who praises the Obama administration 's plans to violate property rights in pursuit of socializing medical care .
The conventional dichotomy between " liberal " and " conservative " newspapers is spurious : all major news organizations support the welfare - warfare state .
Who 's the Predator — the Government or Corporations ?
Wall Street Journal columnist Thomas Frank starts his piece with the angle that everyone on Capitol Hill took his advice to read James K. Galbraith 's book The Predator State , which concerns the capture of government agencies by corporate special interests .
Frank then expresses dismay that many Republican politicians have apparently misunderstood his advice :
During a debate last week over two Democratic proposals for a healthcare bill featuring a " public option " — a government - run alternative to private health insurance — [ Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley ] announced he opposed the idea because , as he put it , " Government is not a fair competitor . …
It 's a predator . "
The word " predator " seems to have become something of a Republican talking point .
Mr. Grassley 's colleague from South Dakota , John
Thune , went on the record in July to warn that , when government goes into business , it " becomes not a competitor but a predator . "
Have these two august men of the right secretly become fans of Mr. Galbraith , one of our leading liberal economists ?
If so , they need to go back over " The Predator State " a second time .
Although they have snapped up Mr. Galbraith 's catchy title , they have misunderstood his message .
Hmm , that 's interesting .
Even hardcore - progressive activists smell a rat in the emerging healthcare " reform " bills , and accuse Obama of being a " charming liar " by selling out to " Big Pharma " and other villains .
What we have in Washington is the worst of both worlds : the government is greatly expanding its role in healthcare , and is at the same time redistributing billions from regular Americans into the pockets of politically connected corporations .
( The same thing is playing out with cap - and - trade legislation , as I explained recently on Fox Business . )
Granted , Republican congressmen — with one notable exception — are n't actually proponents of a truly free market .
They typically oppose only certain types of corporate welfare , while generously supporting other types ( such as military contracts ) .
Even so , Senators Grassley and Thune are perfectly correct when they claim that a " government option " in health insurance would not be true competition , but instead act as a predator on the market .
Unfortunately , Thomas Frank has no grasp of even basic economics and ends up writing sentences that would embarrass USA Today , let alone the Wall Street Journal :
What makes government predatory , Mr. Grassley seems to believe , is its public - mindedness .
Were government to offer health insurance to everybody without the industry 's many devices for excluding risky individuals , some seem to fear , it might be able to offer consumers a price too fair for the profit - minded sector to match .
This is a curious reversal for a movement that ordinarily celebrates Darwinian struggle and the destruction of the weak by the strong .
Just think of the conservative caricatures that must be inverted for this argument to work :
All those soft liberal bureaucrats ?
Ferocious man-eaters .
The welfare state ?
Law of the jungle .
No , Mr. Frank , what makes government predatory is that it steals its resources from unwilling taxpayers .
In contrast , insurance companies ( at least until Obama 's mandate goes through ) can't force people to send them checks .
A government enterprise can put any private analog out of business if the politicians are willing to throw enough money into it .
I am not necessarily predicting that this will happen — after all , well - heeled corporations are writing the legislation behind the scenes — but the very legitimate fear is that the government will get its foot in the door with a " public option . "
Precisely because the bureaucrats running the plan will have no need to turn a profit , they will be able to " afford " to insure anybody , regardless of preexisting conditions , at a price that does n't cover expected payouts .
When the shortfall occurs , they will simply ask the politicians for another injection of a few billion dollars .
" The conventional dichotomy between ' liberal ' and ' conservative ' newspapers is spurious : all major news organizations support the welfare - warfare State . "
The private competitors wo n't have such recourse to free taxpayer money , of course .
Normally they would respond simply by insuring only people with no history of disease , in order to keep premiums low and compete with the price the government charges its customers .
But alas , the legislation would make such exclusions illegal — insurance companies would n't be able to accept only healthy people as customers .
Hence , the fear is that the government could " innocently " offer a simple competing plan , and then — oops ! — all the private insurers go out of business .
I guess we need universal government coverage after all .
Think of it this way : in principle , GM ( now government owned ) could sell brand - new sedans at $ 2,500 each , with infusions of taxpayer money .
That would obviously destroy the car market for private - sector manufacturers .
The same principle applies to health insurance .
The Current System Is Awful
Whenever writing a column such as this , I leave myself open to the accusation that I " just do n't get it . "
Let me be clear : the current health insurance system is awful .
My young son had a minor condition that required no treatment of any kind , and yet no matter how high a premium I offered to pay — even with a rider saying the policy would n't cover anything related to the condition — my insurance agent said nobody would give us coverage .
I eventually had to incorporate my consulting business in order to buy a family policy ( with a very high deductible ) through that route .
So believe me , I understand why people think , " The government needs to do something ! "
Those people are right , the government does need to do something .
Specifically , it needs to get out of healthcare .
How Government Screws Up Health Insurance
It 's not an accident that health insurance tends to be tied to employment .
During the wage - and - price controls of World War II and the Nixon era , companies competed for employees not by offering higher salaries ( which was illegal ) but by offering perks such as health insurance .
Currently , one of the major reasons companies offer insurance as part of compensation packages is that it is tax deductible .
In other words , if a corporation pays $ 10,000 a year to insure you and your family , they can write it off as a business expense , and you wo n't pay taxes on it .
But if the corporation increased your salary by $ 10,000 and told you to buy your own insurance , you would get taxed on that money .
Another major distortion is that there are barriers to interstate competition among health insurers .
If all the Obama administration wants to do is promote options for consumers , this seems like low - hanging fruit .
But as this hilarious video shows , Wolf Blitzer can't get David Axelrod to comprehend the point .
" The predator state can not be tamed . "
I am not a medical doctor , and I do n't even play one on TV .
However , I am an economist , and an amateur student of history .
How anyone can think that greater government involvement will reduce costs and corruption in the health insurance market is beyond me .
That belief flies in the face of basic economics , and all of human history .
Galbraith was right : there is indeed a " predator state " — just ask villagers in Pakistan .
And so long as a powerful state able to transfer trillions of dollars to its friends exists , the shareholders of large corporations will jockey for their cut of its loot .
The solution is not to lecture politicians , as Mr. Frank does at the end of his column .
The predator state can not be tamed .
Only when the public withdraws its consent will the predations come to an end .
This is an interesting piece from the BBC about yesterday ’s Irish referendum , complete with a picture of nuns fresh from voting !
Voting has closed in the Republic of Ireland ’s second referendum on the EU ’s Lisbon Treaty – a vote that may decide long - delayed EU changes .
They previously rejected the treaty in a June 2008 referendum , by a margin of almost 7 % .
This time opinion polls suggest the Yes camp will win .
If at first you do n’t succeed , keep telling lies until you do .
The Republic of Ireland is the only one of the EU ’s 27 member states to put the treaty to a referendum .
At least one other country was promised one and France and the Netherlands voted against the original Constitution , but the word ‘ No ’ means something different to the EU mobsters than it does to everyone else .
Ireland ’s economy has been hit hard by recession since the last vote was held .
So the ‘ Yes ’ camp are playing on people ’s fears that the Irish economy can only prosper by being controlled from Brussels .
Could n’t they see that the “ Celtic Tiger ” was a mirage that would disappear like a puff of Irish mist ?
Turnout in Dublin averaged 44 % by 1800 GMT , officials said .
That contrasted sharply with other parts of the country , where turnout was as low as 10 % in several areas by midday .
This is almost hilarious , or it would be , but for the deadly seriousness of the whole thing .
The only country to have a vote – two votes – on the Lisbon Treaty has a ten percent turnout in some areas .
Welcome to democracy , EU - style .
The ‘ democracy ’ that , should the Irish have voted ‘ yes ’ yesterday , might very well propel Tony Blair into the job of first unelected ( by the people ) ‘ President of Europe ‘ .
Well , why do you think he converted to Catholicism ?
He had to be after either this or the Pope ’s job .
Or both .
“ Exit polls so far are definitely suggesting a shift towards a ‘ Yes ’ vote , particularly in working class and inner-city areas which came out in force for a ‘ No ’ vote last time , ” an official with the governing Fianna Fail party told the agency .
They want to be sure they know where their next three meals are going to come from .
Brussels , they imagine .
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen urged voters to go to the polls : “ It is an important day for the country and an important referendum …
I ’d ask everybody , we all have rights as citizens , and one of the rights that should be cherished is our right to vote . ”
I agree .
Cherish your vote , because you are the only ones to get one in this great democracy of half a billion people .
In Louth , 250 jobs have been lost recently at the Coca - Cola factory , with further redundancies at Xerox – in a region that voted strongly No last time .
But being close to the UK border , there are strong Republican sympathies here .
Some argue that having fought for Irish independence it would be reckless to hand more power to Brussels , our correspondent adds .
This is how crazy it is : ‘ we do n’t want to be ruled from London , but an ultra corrupt and all - controlling bunch of unelected foreigners following a globalist agenda is … so much better ’.
Apart from Ireland , the only other countries yet to ratify Lisbon are the Czech Republic and Poland .
Despite opposition calls for a referendum in the UK , the treaty has been ratified there by parliament .
There is still some hope left with the Czech fellow .
Let ’s pray he does n’t have an ‘ accident ’ , eh ?
All of Ireland ’s major parties campaigned for a Yes vote except the nationalist Sinn Fein .
The party believes rejecting the treaty would secure a more democratic EU .
Its leader Gerry Adams said : “ Citizens want a fairer Ireland , a fairer Europe , a democratic Ireland , a democratic Europe .
What can I say ?
I might have to change my view of him of being nothing more than a big hairy , scary monster .
The Yes camp also had some lavish donations from big business .
And how did big business lavish gifts on the other political parties ?
The repeat referendum is about the same treaty text , but since last year EU leaders have given specific commitments on issues which made some Irish voters nervous last time .
The country will not be forced to legalise abortion , to lose control over taxation and will not have its neutrality threatened .
So , they ’ll still be allowed to hate the English .
But one day soon , you just know , it will be a crime to criticise the EU and its President , St. Tony .
Even if the Irish have caved in to the fear of fear itself and voted “ Yes , okay , you ’ve twisted me arm this time ” then there is still hope for us and all of Europe if the ‘ grassroots ’
Tories can make their globalist - sucking leaders act according to their wishes and those of the majority of the British people .
We yet live in hope .
UPDATE 5.0 PM – Ireland votes “ Yes ” .
PARIS , France ( CNN ) -- French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand said Thursday he will not resign over accounts in a book he wrote in 2005 about paying to have sex with " boys " in Thailand .
In an interview with French television network TF1 , Mitterrand said he " absolutely condemn[s ] sexual tourism , which is a disgrace , and ... pedophilia , " in which he insisted he has never participated .
Despite the use of the French word " garcon " in his 2005 book " The Bad Life , " Mitterrand , 62 , has previously said the term did not mean " little boys . "
He said the males he paid for sex were his age , or maybe five years younger , but not underage -- and the relations were consensual .
" Anyway , you can recognize someone who 's 40 years old ... " he told TF1 .
A 40 - year - old man " does n't look like a minor , " he added , suggesting that his partners were middle - aged men .
His actions , Mitterrand said , were " without a doubt , an error , " but " a crime , no , " he said in the interview .
Despite recent calls to resign from the far - right National Front and the left - leaning Socialist Party , Mitterrand , who is openly gay , vowed to stay in his job .
He said he met Thursday morning with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and that the president supports him .
In a July interview with the weekly French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur , Sarkozy said he had read Mitterrand 's book , and found it " courageous and talented . "
The controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after Mitterrand deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker Roman Polanski , who fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13 - year - old girl .
The culture minister told TF1 that he was " too emotional " when he denounced the filmmaker 's arrest in Switzerland as " horrifying . "
" To see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning , and to see him alone , imprisoned , when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored , that is to say , he was trapped , it 's absolutely horrifying , " he said October 4 , according to Agence France Presse .
The far - right National Front organized an anti-Mitterrand demonstration in Paris on Thursday evening .
" Send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency ! " the party 's Web site said .
The party 's vice president , Marine Le Pen , has demanded Mitterrand 's resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts .
Mitterrand responded , saying , " It 's an honor to be dragged through the mud by the National Front . "
Mitterrand 's acts of " sexual tourism " have left " a dark smudge " on the government , Le Pen said .
The group is also gathering signatures on a petition , online and on paper , from those who want Mitterrand to step down .
" We really hope he will resign , " National Front communications director Julien Sanchez told CNN .
" It 's an embarrassment for our country , that our culture minister has done this .
It affects our international image .
It 's not right , " he added .
Watch report on the controversy surrounding French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand »
On the other side of the political spectrum , the left - leaning Socialist Party suggested Sarkozy should consider Mitterrand 's position .
" It 's up to President Sarkozy to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism , and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce , " said party spokesman Benoit Hamon .
" If everything is relative and Mr. Mitterrand can be excused because he 's famous , well , I do n't excuse his behavior , " Hamon said .
Martine Aubry , the leader of the Socialist Party , said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment .
Mitterrand said on TF1 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the French word " garcons " -- but added , " you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality . "
He also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others , and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism .
The minister said he never had sex with " young boys " and denounced those who accused him of such acts , saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about .
Mitterrand told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked " little boys " were untrue .
" It 's because when people say ' boys ' we imagine ' little boys , ' " he said then .
" How to explain that ?
It belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us , which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation .
It has nothing to do with that . "
Mitterrand was a television personality , not a government minister , when the book was published .
It caused a stir upon its publication , as well , and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then .
In one passage , published by the French newspaper Le Monde on Thursday , Mitterrand describes in detail a sexual encounter with a " boy " he said was called Bird .
" My boy did n't say a word , he stood before me , immobile , his eyes still straight ahead and a half - smile on his lips .
I wanted him so badly I was trembling , " he wrote .
Mitterrand also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in Thailand -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment .
" Most of them are young , handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them .
I would learn later that they did n't come every night , that they were often students , had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families , who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner 's earnings , " the book said .
" Some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers , who also had their fans .
It was the artistic side of the exposition :
Their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out . "
He also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of " le commerce des garcons " ( the boy trade ) -- the misery , the piles of money from which " les gosses " ( the kids ) got only a few crumbs , the ravages of drugs -- " all of these rituals of the fair of the youths , the slave market , excited me enormously . "
" The profusion of very attractive boys , immediately available , put me in a state of desire that I no longer had to restrain or conceal . "
Mitterrand -- the nephew of the Socialist former president Francois Mitterrand -- joined Sarkozy 's center - right government this summer .
Wikipedia , the user - edited online reference Web site , has locked down Mitterrand 's entry , preventing changes to it , in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him .

I 've posted a lot of clips with Jane Hall on The O'Reilly Factor .
She often was paired up with the uber - right winger Bernard Goldberg and usually BillO would wind up yelling at her because she did n't agree with his point of view .
Her demeanor has always been gentle so I always found it upsetting that BillO would scold her .
I mean , he even cut off her microphone once , which was odd for such a mild mannered speaker .
She left FOX recently and I did wonder why .
Howard Kurtz tackled the " Should have the Obama administration called FOX News the opposition ? " question in his Sunday " Reliable Sources " segment on CNN , and although Hall thought it was n't a smart move by the administration , she let it out that she quit FOX because they stopped debating the issues .
She cited Glenn Beck 's " scary " presence as a reason why she left .
It kinds of makes the arguments moot at this point by the mainstreamers who are sticking up for FOX .
Ca n't they handle the truth ?
Another big problem I have is the way cable TV uses pundits , and it 's not just FOX .
They constantly will pair up a right - wing opinionator with a journalist who they just assume is a liberal .
The journalist usually will go on TV , but is n't in love with this because it puts their " neutrality " at issue .
Hall also expressed her displeasure on that front .
KURTZ : Did you feel like you were being used to give
Fox a certain degree of legitimacy , coming on as a media professor ?
HALL : No , I did n't .
The reason I left was in part because they 've had less debates than they used to .
Is it a fair point to say how much debate is there on MSNBC ?
How many Republican strategists ?
We have a bifurcation of the media .
KURTZ : Wait a second .
The reason you left is because you feel they have less debate than they used to .
In other words , it used to be " Hannity and Colmes , " now it 's just Hannity .
It used to be Bernie and Jane .
Now it 's just Bernie .
HALL : I think there 's less debate than there was .
And I 'm also , frankly , uncomfortable with Beck , who I think should be called out as somebody whose language is way over the top .
And it 's scary .
KURTZ : Was that a factor in your decision to leave Fox ?
HALL : Yes , it was .
You can see that she did n't go on gunning to attack FOX ; Kurtz simply caught a remark and seized on it .
Then , as usual , Howie had to defend FOX News , but in so doing , he admitted that Lou Dobbs is an offensive right - winger , just like Beck , in his own commentary about the dispute .
KURTZ : Let me give you my two cents here .
This is also polarizing .
You either have to take the position that Fox is a courageous news organization or a threat to western civilization .
I have criticized things that O'Reilly has said , that Hannity has said .
Certainly , on this program , I told Glenn Beck that he was being offensive with words that he had for a Muslim member of Congress .
At the same time , I do n't think an entire organization should be judged by a few commentaries , any more than I think it is fair to judge CNN by the things that Lou Dobbs says .
Look at some of the people at Fox .
I wrote down some names here .
Major Garrett used to work at CNN .
Bill Hemmer used to work at CNN .
Greta Van Susteren used to work at CNN .
Chris Wallace used to work at ABC and NBC .
Did they all drink the Kool - Aid when they went there ?
Sometimes ,
Fox 's reflexive opposition to Obama bleeds into its news coverage , as you were saying , Nico .
But I do n't think it 's fair to tar everyone with the same brush .
You want to take that on ?
Look , Howie , Ailes sets the agenda .
Even if certain people working on Fox have n't been drinking the " Kool - aid " ( * cough * Shep* cough * Smith * cough ) the cable network is a propaganda arm .
If you do n't like Obama saying so , fine , but the truth is the truth .
PITNEY : I think you paint it a little too moderately .
Take their flagship news program " Special Report With Brett Baier . "
George Mason did a study , 80 percent of the coverage is negative .
KURTZ : Toward Obama ?
PITNEY : Toward Obama .
KURTZ : Is that on the opinion round table ?
PITNEY : No .
Just the first 30 minutes .
Says it all .
Here 's an example where the punishment does n't quite seem to fit the crime .
A Florida man was sentenced to 15 years in prison Monday for stealing a $ 4.99 box of Lucky Charms and a $ 1.59 can of evaporated milk .
Remember , we said he was a cereal stealer , not a serial killer .
Last time we checked , those pots of gold and blue diamonds were made of marshmallows , not real jewels .
It 's not like he kidnapped or killed the creepy little leprechaun .
The judge threw the book at Mark Anthony Griffin because he was a " prison releasee reoffender , " a weird way of saying he had been in jail before .
The Lakeland Ledger reports Griffin was convicted in 2007 of burglary and grand theft .
Griffin is a homeless man , and while that does n't make what he did right , it 's hard to imagine that crime , which amounts to around $ 7 with tax , is worth the thousands of tax payer dollars it will take to house him in a state penal facility .
The judge who sentenced Griffin seems to agree , but said he was bound by the law to give the reoffender the mandatory minimum .
" Personally , I think the money could have been better spent in treatment rather than incarceration for 15 years , but that is not my decision , " Bartow Judge Donald Jacobsen said .
" It seems to me that treatment would be a far better resolution of this . "
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel voted Thursday to create a new federal agency to police financial products offered to U.S. consumers , advancing a key part of the White House 's proposed overhaul of financial rules .
The House Financial Services Committee voted 39 to 29 to create the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , which would have broad reach to examine and punish companies ranging from one - room payday loan stores to huge banks like Bank of America Corp .

The auto bailouts seem to have come at a very steep price for the labor movement .
Public support for unions has now dropped below 50 % for the first time since Gallup started asking the question in the 1930s .
I think we can now expect that EFCA is not going to pass , with or without card check .
When progressives look back at the first hundred days of Obama 's presidency , I think they 're going to ask if they did n't squander their opportunity for pyrrhic short term gains .

Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously envisioned the states serving as laboratories , trying " novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country . "
And on health care , that 's just what they 've done .

GRAND RAPIDS -- Barbershop owner Thomas Martin is taking his case to Lansing to restore his cut - and - a- beer service .
Martin , who has 11 shops in the Grand Rapids area , used to offer customers one complimentary brew until authorities in Kent and Ottawa counties told him to stop .
" It 's just a nice benefit , " Martin told The Grand Rapids Press for a story Thursday .
" It 's like the old - fashioned service . "
State Rep. Kevin
Green says he does n't see why Martin 's clients can't have a beer since no one is looking to get drunk .
The Wyoming Republican has asked the Michigan attorney general 's office to research whether giving customers a beer violates state law .
Matt Frendewey , a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Cox , says the beer benefit is under review but there is no time frame for a decision .
In the meantime , no one will be sipping suds at Martin 's barbershops .
State law prohibits businesses where people consume alcohol when paying for other services .
Grand Rapids has a similar ordinance .
Kent County sheriff's Lt. Kevin Kelley says vice officers who visited Martin 's shops in November determined he violated the law and said he would need a liquor license because he essentially was selling alcohol by providing it with a service .
Martin says depriving his customers from the mountain of beer he has on hand is another sign of " the government telling you what you can do and can't do . "
Fliers nostalgic for the golden era of air travel might want to book a trip to Anthony Toth 's garage .
Mr. Toth has built a precise replica of a first - class cabin from a Pan Am World Airways 747 in the garage of his two - bedroom condo in Redondo Beach , Calif .
The setup includes almost everything fliers in the late 1970s and 1980s would have found onboard : pairs of red-and - blue reclining seats , original overhead luggage bins and a curved , red-carpeted staircase .

The Internet created a new way for quotations to become famous , including many that would probably might not be well known otherwise .
( It also created a new way for misquotes to spread , a major pet peeve of people like me who want to know whether a quotation is real or not . )
Depending on how much you “ surf the ‘ Net ” and how long you ’ve been surfing , you may or may not know quotes like “ All your base are belong to us ” and “ I Can Has Cheezburger ? ”
Nowadays , quotes like those that spread virally via social media are often called memes .
Some quote memes are popularized by graphic images with text that get posted on sites like Facebook and Twitter .
Some are spread by videos , through sites like YouTube .
These online media outlets provide a lightning - fast way for memes to spread around the world and become famous literally overnight .
One example is a quote that had its initial “ fifteen minutes of fame ” in 2007 and eventually became a long - lasting meme .
On September 17 , 2007 , US Senator John Kerry gave an address to students at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
After delivering his prepared remarks , Kerry took questions from the audience .
As the Q&A period was ending , 21 - year - old student Andrew Meyer grabbed a microphone , started insulting Kerry , ranting about political conspiracy theories , and talking about how President Bill Clinton was impeached for getting “ a blowjob ” ( from Monica Lewinsky ) .
The University police decided Meyer was going a bit over the top and started to forcibly remove him from the auditorium .
He resisted .
The cops warned him to go quietly or get zapped with a taser gun .
Meyer kept resisting , while yelling “ Do n’t tase me , bro . ”
The police tased him anyway , arrested him and removed him from the building .
Someone shot a video of the hubbub .
Shortly thereafter , it was posted it on YouTube .
Then it was reposted on multiple YouTube pages and other sites .
Within 24 hours , the incident and Meyers ’ phrase “ Do n’t tase me , bro ! ” were known to millions of Internet users .
( For the few readers who may not know , the slang word bro is shorthand for brother . )
Soon after the video and phrase went viral online , mainstream news outlets picked it up and made it even more famous .
Indeed , quote maven Fred Shapiro , author of the great Yale Book of Quotations picked “ Do n’t tase me , bro ” as the most memorable quote of 2007 in his annual list of famous quotes of the year .
The word tase was also listed as 2007 ’s word of the year by the editors of the New Oxford American Dictionary .
Meyers ’ quote has since been featured on t- shirts and other accessories and has been used and recycled in countless ways in videos , social media posts , songs , books and other media .
This has given Meyer enough of a “ celebrity ” status and fan base to become a professional blogger , political commentator and activist .
On his website , TheAndrewMeyer.com ( a URL that makes it clear he is The Andrew Meyer , as opposed to any others ) , the “ About ” page says :
Andrew Meyer writes and speaks about politics , music , sports , spiritual wisdom and more , and is internationally known for questioning U.S. Presidential candidate John Kerry and coining the phrase " Do n't Tase Me Bro ! "
He also sells ads to willing sponsors of his website .
One of the more prominent ads featured there as I was writing this post was an ad for a company selling “ Food That Fights Dementia . ”
I suspect some targets of Meyer ’s political attacks might find that ironic .

Lors d'un meeting public rassemblant des employés du ministère des Affaires Etrangères américain , Jim Finkle , un fonctionnaire , a posé la question suivante à Hillary Clinton : « Pourriez - vous s'il vous plaît nous laisser utiliser un navigateur Web qui s'appelle Firefox ? » .
Le courageux fut immédiatement acclamé .
Finkle expliqua alors que lorsqu'il travaillait pour la National Geospatial Intelligence Agency , tout le monde utilisait Firefox .
« Donc je ne vois pas pourquoi on ne pourrait pas faire la même chose au ministère » , dit -il .
« C'est un logiciel bien plus sûr que d'autres . »
Pas besoin de vivre une journée dans la peau de Jim Finkle ou de ses collègues du ministère pour comprendre leurs revendications .
Des millions de gens se trouvent dans la même situation : on leur rebat les oreilles avec le génial Firefox , les merveilleux Google Docs , et des dizaines d'autres programmes ou de sites tout aussi formidables et qui pourraient améliorer sensiblement leur manière de travailler .
Toutes ces applications , ils les utilisent chez eux , donc pas la peine de les convaincre , ils en sont déjà adeptes .
Mais au travail , c'est le service informatique qui dicte les règles .
Cette bande de privilégiés décide comme bon leur semble et de façon tout à fait arbitraire comment les gens doivent travailler .
« L'admin »
La secrétaire d'Etat ignorait pourquoi Firefox était bloqué au ministère , c'est alors qu'un assistant est venu en renfort expliquer que ce logiciel gratuit coûte en fait beaucoup trop cher .
« Il faut embaucher des gens pour l'“ admin ” , et puis les patchs doivent être téléchargés . »
Euh ... parce que ça se passe autrement d'habitude ?
A chaque fois c'est pareil , vous demandez à un type de l'informatique de vous laisser utiliser un programme plutôt banal et qui semble sûr , et c'est toujours la même rengaine : ça va coûter beaucoup trop cher en « admin » , et avec tout ce qui traîne sur le Net , c'est vraiment trop dangereux .
En fait , ces gardiens tout - puissants de l'informatique au bureau sont un peu comme les agents de sécurité dans les aéroports : incapables d'arguments rationnels .
Tout ça parce qu'en théorie , leur mission semble logique .
Les ordinateurs , tout comme les avions , sont potentiellement dangereux : ils peuvent être le foyer de virus et autres logiciels malveillants , consommer des ressources censées servir à accomplir d'autres tâches , et vous transformer en as de la procrastination .
Pourquoi ne pas carrément verrouiller tout le parc informatique ?
La fermeture et le contrôle contre la créativité et l'énergie
Toutes ces restrictions infantilisent les employés qui deviennent alors amers , subissent une baisse de moral et les enferment dans des routines qui les rendent complètement inefficaces .
Et , le pire dans tout ça , annihilent totalement leur motivation .
Aujourd 'hui , le succès de la plupart des entreprises dépend entièrement de la créativité , de l'énergie et de la volonté de ses employés .
Et ces restrictions informatiques nuisent à tout cela en mettant les salariés sous la coupe de toute une ribambelle de gens qui , bien qu'ils ignorent quels outils sont nécessaires pour accomplir telle ou telle autre tâche , restent tout de même décisionnaires .
J'ai l'air d'en faire trop ?
Je sais .
Mais tous les employés de bureau du monde subissent ces pratiques depuis trop longtemps .
La plupart des mes collègues chez Slate.com travaillent sur des machines contrôlées par les types du service informatique .
Ils doivent demander l'autorisation pour installer n'importe quel programme , même si celui est tout à fait sûr , même s'il s'agit d'une appli qui utilise la plateforme Adobe AIR ou bien de la mise à jour d'un navigateur Web connu .
Veiller à la sécurité du système
D'autres n'ont pas accès à un grand nombre de sites Internet , puisque le service informatique met en place des filtres qui bloquent non seulement les sites pour adultes mais aussi ceux qui pourraient être une source de divertissement , y compris tout ce qui est mail , chat , sites de rencontre , de shopping , ou des sites d'infos comme Digg ou Reddit ( ou bien même Slate ) .
Chaque service informatique n'a pas exactement la même mission .
Au sein d'une société comme Slate , par exemple , il faut veiller à la sécurité du système .
Empêcher les gens d'installer n'importe quel logiciel est une manière simple et efficace de ne pas se retrouver avec des ordis vérolés .
Chez d'autres , l'ambition est carrément sinistre : empêcher les salariés de s'amuser .
Alors on bloque l'accès à Internet en invoquant la théorie selon laquelle un employé qui a peur est un employé productif .
Mais c'est rarement le cas .
Autre reproche qu'on pourrait faire à ces restrictions : leur aspect arbitraire .
En bloquant des sites ou des programmes « dangereux » , le service informatique empêche forcément l'accès à un grand nombre d'applications utiles .
Le directeur de la publication d'une importante maison d'édition new - yorkaise m'a confié que le service artistique de sa boîte se retrouve sans arrêt confronté aux sévères filtres de sécurité du système .
Mettons qu'un dessinateur doive effectuer une recherche sur les épées ottomanes du 14e siècle pour illustrer un roman de fantasy .
Voici ce sur quoi il va tomber : « L'accès à ce site a été restreint car il correspond à la catégorie suivante : Armes » .
Plus hallucinant encore : les entreprises ont beau vouloir marketer leurs produits sur des plateformes communautaires et des réseaux sociaux , le service info bloque systématiquement l'accès à Facebook , Twitter , et consorts .
Méconnaissance des métiers
Le pire dans tout ça , c'est que comme souvent ils n'ont aucune idée des différents métiers exercés au sein de l'entreprise qui les emploie , ils ignorent que certains outils peuvent être salutaires pour des salariés .
Comme je l'expliquais dans un autre article , passer de Outlook à Gmail a changé ma vie ; dorénavant je me repose sur Google et donc je n'ai plus à sauvegarder moi-même régulièrement mes vieux emails .
Quand je travaillais encore dans un bureau - il n'y a pas si longtemps - un nouveau du service informatique a décidé qu'en transférant mes mails pros sur ma boîte Gmail perso j'enfreignais probablement la loi Sarbanes - Oxley .
J'ai essayé de lui démontrer la stupidité de son raisonnement , puisque premièrement la loi Sarbanes - Oxley interdit de supprimer des mails , pas de les transférer , et que deuxièmement , son service n'interdisait à personne de transférer des mails sur un BlackBerry ou un iPhone .
Mais rien à faire .
Et il n'y a pas que Gmail , il y a les plugins pour Outlook ou Firefox , les clients Twitter , les programmes de recherche locale comme Google Desktop , et un tas d'autres applis qui n'ont pas encore été inventées mais qui faciliteront certainement le travail de millions de gens .
Et le problème du service informatique , c'est qu'il leur faut des années pour décider que oui , c'est bon , ce programme est validé .
La preuve , il y a encore des gens qui travaillent sous IE 6 .
Vous allez me dire qu'il est normal qu'une entreprise veuille s'assurer que ses salariés sont bien en train de travailler - si on les laissait faire tout et n'importe quoi , personne ne se mettrait jamais au boulot .
Mais il me semble que la plupart du temps , c'est à la limite du grotesque .
Ma fiancée travaille dans un hôpital qui bloque l'accès aux messageries instantanées .
Cela fait des années qu'elle et ses collègues , médecins , infirmières etc. ont prouvé que malgré la tentation de la messagerie instantanée , jamais ils ne s'interrompent pour aller chatter .
Alors quoi , vous allez me dire que d'un coup tout le personnel d'un hôpital va s'arrêter de travailler parce qu'on les laisse utiliser MSN ?
L'ouverture ne crée pas des tire - au - flanc
Personne n'a encore prouvé qu'un accès Internet non contrôlé transformait les gens en tire - au - flanc .
Au contraire même .
Brent Corker , professeur de marketing à l'université de Melbourne , a récemment effectué des recherches sur les performances de deux groupes d'employés , un dont l'accès au Net était bloqué , l'autre pas .
Corker a découvert que ceux qui pouvaient utiliser Internet étaient 9 % plus productifs .
Pourquoi ?
Parce que nous ne sommes pas des machines ; les gens qui pouvaient surfer sur le Web faisaient de courtes pauses tout en continuant à travailler , et ces quelques minutes de distraction les rendaient même plus alertes que ceux qui n'avaient d'autre choix que de rester plongés dans leur tâche .
Les découvertes de Corker viennent appuyer de nombreuses thèses qui montrent que se distraire de temps à autre peut être bénéfique .
Par exemple , gribouiller pendant une réunion nous rend plus vigilant .
De plus , Daniel Pink , dans son livre « Drive : The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us » , remarque que les entreprises les plus novatrices sont celles qui se montrent le moins sévères avec les employés un peu tire - au - flanc .
Productivité contre présence
Chez Google , qui , comme la plupart des entreprises de haute technologie n'impose aucune limitation sur son parc informatique , on encourage les salariés à exercer des activités qui n'ont rien à voir avec leur métier .
Chez Pixar , chacun est libre de prendre des cours de cinéma , de peinture , de dessin , d'écriture , etc .
Et chez Netflix , pas de planning vacances : les gens prennent autant de congés qu'ils veulent du moment que le travail est fait .
Il y a une expression qu'on emploie dans les RH pour décrire ce genre de boîtes : on les appelle les « results - only workplace environments » ( en français , régime de l'emploi évalué uniquement d'après les résultats ) , où les gens sont jugés sur ce qu'ils font , et plus sur comment ils le font .
Comme Reed Hastings , PDG de Netflix , l'a un jour expliqué à un journaliste : « Je veux des managers qui entrent dans mon bureau en disant '' Il faut vraiment donner une augmentation à Sally ; pas parce qu'elle fait des heures sup ' , mais parce qu'elle est super productive ' ' . »
Cela rappelle l'argument de Daniel Pink : c'est plutôt la perspective d'être autonome — et non pas de gagner une fortune — qui motive les salariés à travailler dur .
Les gens travaillent mieux , dit - il , quand ils sentent qu'on les laisser travailler seuls .
Dur de se dire ça quand votre ordinateur vous met sans arrêt des bâtons dans les roues .
Responsabiliser les salariés
OK , OK , mais les entreprises ont bien le droit de faire quelque chose contre les sites pornos et les virus , non ?
Oui , c'est sûr , mais au lieu de restreindre l'accès à tout et à tout le monde sans expliquer pourquoi tel programme sent mauvais et pourquoi tel autre est bloqué parce que c'est plus pratique , il faudrait plutôt apprendre aux salariés à utiliser leur ordinateur .
Les services informatiques pourraient aussi bloquer les sites les plus flagrants , ceux sur lesquels se trouve du contenu illégal , comme the Pirate Bay , ou qui pullulent de virus et autres logiciels malveillants .
Mais en faire plus , c'est contre - productif .
Pour reprendre les mots d'un salarié avec qui j'ai discuté , bloquer l'accès à des sites
Web « ne rend pas une entreprise plus intelligente , au contraire » du point de vue de l'innovation technologique .
Et c'est rarement une stratégie gagnante .

WASHINGTON  Anything that hops , burrows , buzzes , crawls or grazes near a nuclear weapons plant may be capable of setting off a Geiger counter .
And at the Hanford nuclear reservation , one of the dirtiest of them all , its droppings alone might be enough to trigger alarms .
A government contractor at Hanford , in south - central Washington State , just spent a week mapping radioactive rabbit feces with detectors mounted on a helicopter flying 50 feet over the desert scrub .
An onboard computer used GPS technology to record each location so workers could return later to scoop up the droppings for disposal as low - level radioactive waste .
The Hanford site , overseen by the federal Department of Energy , produced roughly two - thirds of the plutonium used in the nation ’s nuclear weapons arsenal , beginning in World War II and ending in the 1980s .
Today it is the focus of the nation ’s largest environmental cleanup , an effort that has cost tens of billions of dollars and is expected to continue for decades .
Yet the helicopter flights , which covered 13.7 square miles and were paid for with $ 300,000 in federal stimulus money , took place in an area that had never been used by the bomb makers .

WINTER SPRINGS , Fla . -
A man who thought there was an intruder in his house shot and killed his fiancee the day before they were to be married , police said Friday .
� Right now everything points to a tragic accident , � Police Chief Kevin Brunell told The Associated Press , adding investigators were awaiting forensic results .
John Tabutt , 62 , told investigators he got his gun when he thought he heard an intruder , then fired at a figure in the hallway , according to Brunelle .
It was Tabutt 's live - in fiancee , 62 - year - old Nancy Dinsmore , who family members say he was going to marry Saturday .
Tabutt told authorities he thought she was next to him in bed the whole time .
A message left for a phone number listed for the house was not returned .
Brunelle said no charges have been filed against Tabutt , adding the information he provided has been verified and he appeared �very distraught . �
Tabutt was �very concerned about her well - being , � standing by while she was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics , Brunelle added .
The couple planned to wed in a small ceremony Saturday at St. Stephen Catholic Church in Winter Springs , Dinsmore 's son - in - law Scott Sposato , of Vero Beach , told the Orlando Sentinel .
� They loved each other , � he said .
� It was quite apparent . �
Tabutt called 911 shortly after 2:30 a.m. Friday , moaning and sobbing , the newspaper reported .
� I thought I had an intruder in the house , � he told the emergency dispatcher .
� Honest to God , she looks dead . �
He then thought he heard her take a breath .
� Hang in there , Honey .
Hang in there , � he said .
Winter Springs is about 15 miles north of Orlando .

It is I think , comparatively rare for a senior political figure to describe equally senior members of their own party as “ fruit loops ” and “ f … wits ” , going on to observe that “ They do n’t know how crazy they look , because crazy people never do ” .
But that was exactly the reaction to last Monday ’s Four Corner ’s program in which Liberal Party Senate Leader Nick Minchin and others went on camera to spout delusionist conspiracy theories of the type Kevin Rudd had pre-emptively denounced only two days previously ( i guess he had an idea what was going to be on Four Corners ) .
Minchin described the scientific consensus view that human activity is driving climate change as the result of a communist plot , saying
For the extreme Left it provides the opportunity to do what they ’ve always wanted to do , to sort of deindustrialise the Western world .
You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the Left , and … they embraced environmentalism as their new religion .
This is , of course , standard stuff on the political right – I had a string of people pointing me to the latest silly talking point in which a British unfair dismissal case was supposed to prove that global warming is a religion – but it was a big mistake to say it on Four Corners .
The real problem though is that Nick Minchin is not , in the ordinary sense of the term , a fruit loop or f…wit .
Rather , he is a sharp and effective political operator , who does n’t worry much about ideas and therefore takes his beliefs from the environment in which he moves .
In the current state of the right that means his ideas on climate change , like those of most of the people with whom he mixes , are deeply delusional .
So thoroughly embedded are delusionist assumptions and information sources on the right that , within the given cultural milieu , any psychologically normal person must necessarily , in exactly the same way as any psychologically normal member of an isolated tribal culture would accept the standard myths of that culture .
The delusionist message is propounded by a parallel - universe of “ scientists ” ( a handful of whom have relevant scientific qualifications ) , think tanks and bloggers , and continually reinforced by the distribution of talking points like the unfair dismissal case mentioned above .
This is bad enough as applied to climate change , which is one of the big problems facing the world .
But the problem goes far beyond this , extending , for example to economic policy issues .
It is unsurprising that advocates of market liberalism would like to downplay the implications of the global financial crisis for the theoretical foundations of their position such as the efficient markets hypothesis , and it ought to be possible to make a case that the current crisis does not provide sufficient evidence to abandon the EMH .
But , thanks to the rightwing talking points machine , no one much feels the need to make such a case .
Instead we get absurd claims that the near - collapse of global capitalism was brought about by the Community Reinvestment Act , a minor piece of 1970s legislation aimed at ensuring fair access to bank loans for credit - worthy borrowers in poor neighborhoods .
This claim , silly on its face , has been comprehensively refuted , but people I would otherwise regard as sensible continue to put it forward .
And of course , the talking points machine was seen in full force before and during the Iraq war .
The lionization of someone like Arthur Chrenkoff , who argued throughout 2003 , 2004 and 2005 that the view of events in Iraq presented by the mainstream media was excessively gloomy and pessimistic (! ) and presented a “ Good News from Iraq ” to explain how well things were going , was a typical instance .
Chrenkoff ended up working for Liberal Senator Brett Mason , who is , unsurprisingly a prominent climate delusionist .
The fact is that the political right , at least in the US and among those sections of Australian opinion that take their lead from the US , has become utterly unhinged from reality , to the point where anyone who relies on rightwing sources for information is bound to be deluded .
Even where individual pieces of evidence may be factually correct , they are selected to support delusional claims such as those cited above , with the often overwhelming evidence to the contrary being disregarded .
This raises an interesting question for those of my readers inclined to conservative or libertarian views but disinclined to joining the fruit loops .
How should such a person form their views on current issues .
My answer is that the only option is to ignore entirely everything written on “ their ” side of the debate and confine attention to factual evidence presented by reputable official and scientific sources and to critical analysis of the arguments of the “ left : .
Perhaps if enough people did this , they would be able to form the nucleus of a body of thought which would reclaim the ground once occupied by sane conservatives .
But , at present , there is no sign of this happening .
Sophisticated genetic fingerprinting confirmed that a laboratory experiment was the source of a bacterial infection that sickened a graduate student on Boston University ’s medical campus , city disease investigators said yesterday .
The genetic tests , conducted at the state laboratory in Jamaica Plain , compared a blood sample from the researcher with bacterial matter recovered from the lab where he was working on BU ’s South End campus .
“ The bottom line , ’’ said Dr. Anita Barry , top disease tracker at the Boston Public Health Commission , “ is they matched . ’’
The analysis erased any doubt about what caused the researcher to become sick last month and intensified investigations into precisely how he was exposed to a germ known as Neisseria meningitidis , which can cause meningitis .
The city ’s biological lab safety division will review safety procedures in BU ’s medical labs , to ensure that the school is doing everything possible to minimize researchers ’ exposure to pathogens , Barry said .
Investigators will examine what kind of protective gear the researcher was wearing , what kind of training he received , and how thoroughly he was supervised , Barry said .
The city strengthened its regulation of labs after three BU scientists became infected with tularemia in 2004 , an episode that revealed sloppy lab practices and a failure to report those illnesses in a timely fashion .
This time , the university has pledged to operate transparently , promising to share findings of an internal investigation with scientists across the university and even researchers at other schools .
“ We want others to learn if there are ways we identify that this could be prevented , ’’ said Ara Tahmassian , associate vice president for research compliance at Boston University School of Medicine .
“ When I look at this incident , it ’s one too many , ’’ said Tahmassian , who joined BU after the tularemia cases .
“ But if some of the other institutions can utilize what went wrong and hear the lessons learned , fantastic . ’’
Tahmassian has convened a panel of specialists to review the incident and said he expects them to report expeditiously .
“ This is not going to be months , ’’ he said .
“ This is going to be within a week or two , pinpointing the best we can . ’’
The infection of the researcher , who has recovered , came at an awkward moment for BU .
A federal health agency is conducting what is probably the final safety review of a controversial $ 200 million lab project the university has built to work with the world ’s deadliest agents , including Ebola and plague .
The centerpiece of that project , a high - security Biosafety Level - 4 lab , is in a completed but unoccupied building on Albany Street .
The exposure of the graduate student - the university has not identified him , citing patient confidentiality rules - happened in a building next door to the contentious project .
He was participating in the hunt for a vaccine against the form of meningitis caused by the germ .
The researcher was working in a Biosafety Level - 2 lab , which has less stringent safety procedures than Level - 4 labs .
When he became ill , the graduate student sought medical attention and notified the director of the lab , concerned that his symptoms might be related to his research .
Unlike with the tularemia infections , BU alerted city disease investigators of their suspicions about the student within hours of learning about his illness .
He is the only person who has become sick , Barry said .

Religious people and atheists have much in common – their beliefs require a leap of faith , writes BREDA O'BRIEN
EVEN THOUGH the President has decided not to refer it to the Supreme Court , the blasphemy provision in the Defamation Act remains unpopular with religious believers and atheists alike .
I know no religious person who is wildly enthusiastic about it , and most think it a bad idea .
Certainly , some religious people believe that every culture has ideas that it considers too offensive to express .
Secular culture is no different , and social disapproval and exclusion follow just as swiftly for anyone who offends against new dogmas .
Today , the unspeakable usually concerns anything considered to offend against the principle of equality .
However , even those who believe that the taboo has merely been transferred to a sort of secular blasphemy , are not particularly in favour of criminalising religious blasphemy .
So the newly formed Atheist Ireland should not feel isolated in their dislike of the blasphemy provision .
I would like to offer a welcome to Atheist Ireland .
After all , we people of faith should stick together .
Atheists often appeal to science to underwrite their disbelief , but the decision not to believe in God lies ultimately in the arena of gut feeling , or hunch , or intuition .
That decision is something that the scientific method cannot arbitrate on .
Some atheists speak about the impossibility of proving a negative .
Polemicists like Richard Dawkins like to talk about the impossibility of proving that there is n’t a teapot flying around the sun .
It would be hard to imagine anyone , after serious weighing of and struggling with the possibilities , coming to believe in a flying solar teapot , but many , including prominent scientists , have come to believe in God .
Indeed , many believers see in science , particularly quantum physics , increasing evidence for , though not proof of , the existence of a god .
The decision to live as if there is n’t a god requires a leap of faith , as does the decision to live as if there is .
Religious people and atheists have a great deal in common .
And now that Irish atheists are banding together , planning good works and hoping to influence Irish society , it looks more and more like a religion .
Okay , enough teasing .
Being serious for a while , I welcome Atheist Ireland because the growing numbers need representation in Irish society .
I realise with a certain degree of mild surprise that I know rather a lot of atheists , certainly far more than I should , given the overall representation of atheists in the population .
The ones I know best are principled , highly moral people , and are extraordinarily tolerant of this columnist ’s well - known religious biases .
In fact , they are the kind of people that my mother would have declared , without a trace of irony or any wish to offend , to be certain of a high place in heaven .
However , I believe that the average atheist , if such exists , is not well served by atheism ’s most vocal public representatives , such as Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins .
Their target is religious fundamentalism .
Their problem is their failure to see that there is any other kind of religion .
Author Karen Armstrong has travelled an interesting path – from being a Roman Catholic nun to wanting nothing whatsoever to do with religion to now being an authority on world religions and an activist for religious liberty .
In her latest book , The Case for God , she is sharply critical of the “ new atheists ” such as Hitchens and Dawkins , for an interesting reason , not because of their atheism , but because of their lack of sophistication .
She describes a long tradition of dialogue between theologians and atheists , which both sides found stimulating and valuable .
She does not think such a dialogue can happen with new atheists , because unlike Feuerbach , Marx and Freud , they are not theologically literate .
For example , she says that Dawkins takes the Bible as literally as any Protestant fundamentalist .
The only point of disagreement is that Dawkins finds it unreliable about science , whereas fundamentalists do not .
She also says that unlike earlier atheists , the new atheists lack a passion to create a better world .
Their desire to ascribe all evil to religion means that they show little concern for the poverty , injustice and humiliation that are underlying causes of many of the atrocities they label as religious .
Human beings are the great symbol - users , which has probably spurred much of human progress .
Some evolutionary theorists believe that the desire to seek meaning , most often expressed as religious meaning , has also been central to human development .
At its best , religious belief enables people to transcend suffering , inspires acts of altruism and builds community .
Of course , religion that is distorted can lead to appalling acts .
But every age has its dark side .
As people abandon practice of their faith ( in the sense of daily engagement with compassionate service and openness to mystery ) , some have substituted either the pursuit of wealth or selfish individualism .
This can hardly be termed progress .
Many atheists would also be appalled by lack of social solidarity .
Neither atheism nor religion has a monopoly on truth and morality .
Ireland is facing enormous challenges in the years ahead .
Perhaps the real division is not between atheists and religious people , but between those who would wish to see a culture of social justice , concern for the vulnerable and weak and a sustainable future , and those who are just out to grab everything they can for themselves .
With apologies to Rodgers and Hammerstein ’s Oklahoma ! , the atheist and religious person can be friends .

Torture of Loan Agents Charged in Calif .
Foreclosure Crisis Calif .
couple with home in foreclosure accused of beating , robbing two lenders .
Oct. 28 , 2009  -- California 's burgeoning foreclosure crisis turned violent after angry homeowners allegedly attacked and tortured two loan agents who they believed had reneged on a promise to help save their home , authorities said .
A California couple and three accomplices were charged in the case .
They are accused of beating and torturing the two loan - modification agents , whom they believe defrauded them and did nothing to help them keep their home in a Los Angeles suburb from going into foreclosure , prosecutors said .
Daniel Weston and Mary Ann Parmelee and their accomplices allegedly lured loan agents Lamond Dean and Gustavo Canez into a Glendale home last week .
There they held the pair for hours , robbed them , threatened them with a firearm and beat them with " wooden knuckles , " according to prosecutors
Weston and Parmelee live in home under foreclosure in La Canada - Flintridge and " allegedly sought loan modification assistance from the victims but believed that nothing was being done and wanted their money back , " said Shiara Davila - Morales , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney .
The five defendants intended to " cause cruel and extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge , extortion , persuasion and for a sadistic purpose , inflict great bodily injury , " according to court documents .
One of the two men escaped their alleged captors and alerted police on Oct. 20 .
Both men were taken to the hospital and later released .
Parmelee , 52 , along with Mario Soloman Gonzales , 47 , and Marissa Parker , 49 , were arraigned last week and face two counts each of torture , false imprisonment by violence and second - degree robbery .
According to authorities those three watched as Weston , 52 , and Gustavo Canez , 36 , allegedly beat and robbed them .
" Weston and Canez allegedly carried out the attack in the presence of the other defendants .
The victims also were allegedly robbed of their loan paperwork and personal belongings , " said Davila - Morales in a statement .
Those men were arraigned Monday and face the same charges plus additional weapons charges , according to the felony complaint filed in court .
All five of the accused have pleaded not guilty .
The defendants are each being held on $ 1 million bail and face charges that could land them in prison for life .
Defense attorney Stephen Douglas Wegman , who is representing Gonzales and Parker , told ABC News.com that " there was loan fraud involved " but that his " clients have nothing to do with the incident . "
He said his clients were " both innocent , " but would not comment on whether they were at the home in Glendale where the alleged torture took place .
Public defender Michael Ramirez - Mares said his client Gustavo Canez " pleaded not guilty and was entitled to his day in court . "
Calls to the lawyers for Weston and Parmelee were not returned .
Paremelee is herself a real estate agent and if loan fraud was committed , she would be one of thousands of Californians whose home was in foreclosure and became a victim of a modification scam .
In September there were 50,342 homes in foreclosure in California , or 1 in every 53 homes .
The state is the third - worst hit by the foreclosure crisis in the country .
On the heels of the housing crisis , a number of illegal schemes have propagated in California , leading state Attorney General Jerry Brown to crack down , in particular , on loan - modification schemes .
Authorities have not yet disclosed what company the agents worked for , but on Oct. 6 , Parmelee filed a civil suit Newport Home Loan , Inc. in Los Angeles County Court .
A public records search found that the home Paremelee and Weston shared on La Canada Blvd , had tens of thousands of dollars worth of judgments liens against it dating back to 2000 .
Weston declared Chapter 13 , or personal bankruptcy , in June .
Description :
Software Cracking is the art of breaking security protections in a software .
Generally software cracks are distributed in the form of patches to the original software or keygen programs which generate arbitrary key / serial combinations .
A Cracker works his way through a program by disassembling it and understanding the security protections built into it .
He then proceeds to alter the behavior of the program by finding and changing ( patching ) the routines responsible for the security mechanisms , in order to allow full unlimited access to the program .
Alternately , he can also reverse engineer the key / serial comparison routines and write a keygen for the program .
This allows users to generate arbitrary valid keys / serials for the program .
In this awesome video created by Spiffomatic 64 , we learn about the basics of software cracking .
Spiffomatic64 starts with a basic introduction to the tools of the trade - Ollydbg and Peid .
He talks about Ollydbg in detail - the screen organization , shortcuts , how to run / pause programs , setting / removing breakpoints and how to inspect memory / code in a running program .
He then uses a simple crackme prolixe_keygenme1 to show how software crackers work their way through a binary .
He first verifies using Peid that the program has not been compressed or packed and then loads this program into Ollydbg , disassembles it and then proceeds to find the place in the code responsible for the annoying alert message shown in the beginning and then finally the place responsible for the key validation checks .
Once the code in these routines have been understood , he proceeds to patch the binary to convert the crackme into a keygen :)
Very nicely done .
This video is a highly recommended watch for budding reverse engineers !
I would recommend that users download the 3 programs mentioned above and try the entire process themselves .

THERE'S a climate of fear in the US among the military , law - enforcers , policy - makers , the media , opinion - formers and many ordinary citizens .
A major cause is the intimidating Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , which is dedicated to Muslim empowerment , receives substantial funding from Arab governments and has been accused by federal prosecutors of funnelling money to Hamas .
So effective and ruthless is CAIR that anyone in authority worries before doing anything that can be misrepresented as anti-Muslim and lead to lawsuits citing religious or racial discrimination .
There were plenty of people who might have prevented the psychiatrist Major Nidal Malik Hasan from murdering 12 soldiers and a policeman , but were too scared to do so .
FBI operatives , for instance , knew he was exchanging chummy emails with the al Qaeda supporter Anwar al Awlaki , who had been an imam at a Virginia mosque which Hasan attended and who fled to the Yemen after 9/11 because the FBI were investigating his close links with two of the hijackers .
There were the fellow - worshippers at the Muslim Community Centre in Maryland who were perturbed by Hasan 's hatred of his country , his rigid Islamic fundamentalism and his insistence that jihad was not about inner spiritual struggle but the killing of those who were a threat to Islam .
Then there were the senior army doctors who 18 months ago sat through a long PowerPoint presentation from Hasan called The Koranic world view as it relates to Muslims in the US Military , in which he called for Muslims to be released from the army as conscientious objectors rather than fight against their co-religionists ; he explained that " fighting to establish an Islamic state to please Allah , even by force , is condoned by Islam " .
After worried discussions , nothing happened .
Army psychiatrists concerned about Hasan 's increasing preoccupation with religion and war sent him to a university lecture series on Islam and the Middle East .
And how has the army responded to the massacre ?
" As horrific as this tragedy was , " said the Chief of Staff General George Casey , " if our diversity becomes a casualty , I think that 's worse . "
Well , I do n't think the relatives of the dead are likely to agree .
Worship of diversity , fundamentalist political correctness and terror of being accused of Islamphobia has obscured the simple truth that the US army is no place for anyone who believes the Koran should be interpreted literally .
Commentators sought PC reasons for Hasan 's homicidal spree .
He had had a breakdown because of the dreadful stories his work required him to listen to : this was probably , said one , a " seemingly disproportionate response " to anti-Muslim comments from colleagues and tales of bad things that had happened to Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That he was being sent to Afghanistan , was scared and just wanted to get out of the army was a common view .
Sadly , despite President Obama 's claim that what happened at Fort Hood was " incomprehensible " , it 's easy to understand : the accumulated evidence is that Hasan was an Islamist fruitcake who swallowed the whole , unexpurgated and unmodernised Koran , right down to the paradise that awaits those who kill and are killed for Allah , which is why he was shouting Allahu Akbar ( ' God is great ' ) as he shot his comrades .
There have been other dodgy Muslim fundamentalists in the United States army , including Sergeant Hasan Karim Akbar , who in 2003 murdered two soldiers and wounded 14 , but -- with CAIR in mind -- the army continues to run from anything that can be described as religious profiling .
A good example of how CAIR has put the fear of Allah into American society is the case of the flying imams .
Three years ago , at Minneapolis airport , some passengers and crew on US Airways Flight 300 were alarmed by six imams whose suspicious behaviour included praying loudly , changing seats and two of them demanding seatbelt extensions which they did not use ; an Arabic - speaker on the flight heard two of them mention Osama bin Laden and condemn America for " killing Saddam " .
They were removed from the flight by airport police , detained , questioned and released .
CAIR backed the imams ' claim that they had suffered from religious discrimination and underwrote their lawsuits against the airline , the law - enforcers and unnamed passengers who had reported them to the crew .
Congress banned the suing of airline passengers who report on suspicious activity , but after a bizarre judicial ruling that no competent law enforcer could have thought their treatment reasonable , the airline and the law - enforcers settled out of court last month .
The consequences for airline security are terrifying .
Rather surprisingly , a few days ago the American government had the guts to seize mosques and property owned by a group it claims are a front for the Iranian government .
This , said CAIR ominously , " may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide . "
The hope is that it may send the positive message that enough is enough .

FBI Informant Charged With Four Murders
He married the mother of one victim , and honeymooned where he buried her .
Oct. 7 , 2009  -- Scott Lee Kimball was released from prison to become a paid FBI informant , married the unsuspecting mother a young woman he had allegedly murdered , and spent their honeymoon camping and off - roading in an area where her daughter 's body was buried .
Kimball also used the alias " Hannibal " to befriend a prison cellmate 's girlfriend who vanished , allegedly murdered by Kimball and buried in a remote Utah canyon .
Kimball has been in jail since 2005 on related charges , but grisly new details emerged in an arrest affidavit released Tuesday in Boulder , Colo .
The court papers charge Kimball with being a serial killer , accused of murdering both missing women as well as a third woman and his own uncle .
Kimball , already sentenced to 48 years in prison on related charges , is being held on $ 2 million bail .
He will be arraigned on the new charges Thursday .
His alleged victims include his uncle Terry Kimball , Jennifer Marcum , Kaysi McLeod and LeAnn Emery .
Authorities believe the murders took place between August 2003 and September 2004 .
The plight of families searching for the missing women and the slow pace of the investigation was the subject of a John Quinones story on " 20/20 " last year .
Families also criticized the FBI for not keeping a better eye on Kimball after he was released to work as an informant .
Parents of the dead women say Kimball 's arrest has been too long in coming , but are thankful it 's finally happened .
" I'm ecstatic , " said Kaysi 's father Rob McLeod told ABC News .
" Happy is the wrong word , but I can't think of another one . "
Jennifer Marcum 's father Robert said he 's glad that Kimball has finally been charged in the crimes , and says he 'll make the trip from Illinois to Colorado for Kimball 's arraignment .
Even though Kimball is expected to plead guilty , Marcum says he 'll believe it when he sees it .
" The real thing will come when he 's convicted of murder .
Until then , I 'm not getting my hopes up , " Marcum said .
" This guy has buffaloed people for so many years . "
Marcum 's remains have never been found .
Her father hopes Kimball will have something to say about that in court .
" I want to hear if he 'll say something we do n't know , and I 'd really like to know " he said .
" She is really missed and loved and we are so unhappy it 's unbelievable . "
Kimball convinced authorities to let him out of prison in December 2002 in order to work as an informant in a murder - for - hire plot involving former cellmate Steven Ennis and his girlfriend , Jennifer Marcum , the 25 - year - old mother of a 4 - year - old boy .
A few months later , Marcum disappeared .
According to the affidavit another former cellmate , Brett Lee Gamblin , told police that Kimball asked Gamblin if he thought breast implants could be traced .
Gamblin wondered why anyone would be concerned with breast implants when a body could be identified by fingerprints or teeth .
Despite repeated searches , Marcum 's remains have never been found .
In August 2003 , Kaysi McLeod went missing .
Kimball Honeymooned Where He Buried Bride 's Daughter
Kimball told a former cellmate that a member of the Sons of Silence motorcycle gang had hired him to kill McLeod , 19 , because she was set to testify as a witness in a drug trial against the gang 's leader .
Kimball claimed , the cellmate says , that in order to get close to Kaysi , he started dating her mother Lori .
After Kaysi's disappearance , Kimball married Lori during a ceremony in Las Vegas .
They apparently honeymooned at an RV park near Kremmling , Colo. , and went off - roading in a remote area .
The affidavit says that after Kaysi 's remains were located in 2007 , " Lori McLeod stated that she believed the site where she was taken to camp , in September 2003 , was in the immediate area of the site where Kaysi McLeod 's remains were eventually located . "
Cell phone records show Kimball was in the area where Kaysi 's body was found at the time she disappeared , according to the affidavit .
Kimball is also suspected in the death of LeAnn Emry , the girlfriend of another Kimball cellmate named Steven Holley .
LeAnn 's father , Howard Emry , discovered that through Holley his daughter had been introduced to Kimball .
LeAnn apparently knew Kimball , who insisted she only call him " Hannibal , " was dangerous .
" If Hanable ( sic ) knew I was talking to you he'd have me killed in a second , " she emailed her cousin on Jan. 10 , 2003 .
" Plus , he'd have you killed too . "
Kimball , the affidavit says , befriended LeAnn and helped her write bad checks and misuse credit cards until her abandoned car was found near Moab , Utah , on Jan. 30 , 2003 .
In March of this year , Kimball led investigators to the site where LeAnn was buried in a box canyon in eastern Utah .
A .40 caliber bullet fragment found at the scene of LeAnn 's remains matched a gun Kimball owned in 2003 .
In August 2004 , Kimball 's uncle Terry also disappeared .
The affidavit says Kimball spread a story that Terry had won the Ohio State Lottery and moved to Mexico with a stripper named Ginger .
A year after disappearing , Terry supposedly sent an email from Mexico claiming he was doing well there and never wanted to come back to the United States .
Scott Kimball Sentenced to 48 Years as Habitual Offender
The affidavit says a search of Scott Kimball 's computer found a login for a Yahoo email account for Terry Kimball .
Other records show that Scott Kimball wrote bad checks in Terry 's name and used his uncle 's credit cards to pay for hotels and a rental car during a trip to Alaska in September 2004 .
The FBI later found bloodstains at a Broomfield , Colo. , house where Scott Kimball once lived .
DNA tests showed that the blood was a match for Terry Kimball .
In January of 2009 , Scott Kimball provided authorities with a handwritten map to a location west of Vail Pass in Colorado .
Investigators had to wait until the snow melted in June , but were able to locate the remains of Terry Kimball at the precise location Scott Kimball had drawn on his map .
Kimball was already in custody before his arrest on murder charges .
In December 2008 , he was sentenced to 48 years in prison on theft and habitual offender charges .
At that time , the affidavit says he signed a " memorandum of understanding " that he would plead guilty to one count of second - degree murder , but be immune to further prosecution for other murders .
A condition of the memorandum was that Kimball lead authorities to the remains of Jennifer Marcum , LeAnn Emry , and Terry Kimball .
Kaysi McLeod 's remains had already been recovered without Kimball 's help .
Catherine Olguin with the Boulder District Attorney 's office told ABC News that she could not comment on why Kimball is being charged with two counts of second - degree murder given the memorandum of understanding .
Prosecutors plan on holding a press conference after Kimball 's arraignment Thursday .
There are fears in Japan that a potentially deadly Australian invader is beginning to close in on some of the country 's most crowded urban areas .
It is believed redback spiders originally hitched a ride in a container ship , possibly one carrying woodchips .
A few months ago a six - year - old boy from Osaka was bitten by a redback in the first case where anti-venom was used in Japan .
His case is just one of a dozen this year in which Japanese have been nipped by this Australian arachnid , which is spinning its silk web from Nagoya to Fukuoka , to Osaka .
In fact the Environment Ministry says redbacks have now been reported in 16 of Japan 's 47 prefectures .
And in Osaka prefecture alone this year , 12 people have been bitten .
The managing director of the Aichi Prefecture Pest Control Association , Takesada Ohashi , is concerned by the trend .
" If redback numbers keep increasing and they spread throughout Osaka city , then I 'll be very worried that more people could be bitten , " he said .
He says the big fear is they may even be bitten without knowing .
Serious risk
If people are bitten they will need anti-venom , but it has not yet been officially approved for use in Japan .
Only a handful of hospitals in western Japan stock the anti-venom and luckily for the six - year - old Osaka boy , the anti-venom was in stock .
A former researcher at the Osaka Institute of Public Health , Masahiro Yoshida , says the Japanese government has done nothing .
" They only deal with the redback problem after someone is bitten , " he said .
" Accidents must be prevented , so I think homes should be checked . "
Dr Yoshida warns that someone will die if no steps are taken to halt the spider 's spread .
Chopstick defence
Mr Ohashi has a uniquely Japanese approach to dealing with the deadly pests .
" In the case of big factories , we must move in and exterminate at once , " he said .
" But in the case of households , we can use pesticides , although I 'd rather pick up the redbacks with chopsticks and then kill them .
" Pesticides can flow into water supplies . "
What is alarming many in Japan is that redbacks can survive the biting Japanese winter , which officially begins next week , mostly by nesting near heating systems .
And with electrically warmed toilet seats in almost every home , it may be best for the Japanese to check carefully before sitting .
Turning cars electric , cheaply ( Image : Comstock / Getty )
IT COULD take a “ perfect storm ” to create electric cars that match gas - powered cars ’ range – a mix of motor - industry investment , infrastructure change and advances in battery technology .
Instead of waiting , a new project aims to build cheap vehicles good enough for short commutes .
Huge effort has been expended on untested new technology , says Illah Nourbakhsh , leader of the Charge Car project at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
He suggests an alternative : “ Let ’s use the cheapest hardware possible by making the smartest possible management software . ”
His team has designed a novel electric - car architecture that …
LET US START with a little quiz .
How many of these conditions have you heard of ?
Taijin kyofusho , hikikomori , hwa - byung , or qi-gong psychotic reaction .
If your score was 0 out of 4 , do not feel bad : your culture may be to blame .
The first two conditions are mental illnesses largely endemic to Japan ; the second two are endemic to China .
Psychological disorders , or at least our labels for them , differ across cultures .
But are these and other non-Western conditions truly distinct from those in the U.S. and Europe ?
Or does every mental malady , no matter how foreign - sounding in name , vary only in minor ways from a problem that is more familiar to us , such as depression or schizophrenia ?
The evidence to date strongly suggests that culture can influence the expression of mental illnesses .
Whether radically different cultures can give rise to entirely new psychiatric disorders , however , is a matter of fierce debate .
This issue is of more than academic importance .
Psychotherapists often consider cultural differences in their treatment , to be sure , but they typically assume that depression , for example , looks pretty much the same everywhere with minor exceptions .
If so - called culture - bound syndromes — mental illnesses that are specific to a particular society — are merely variations of Western disorders , then mental health professionals in Western countries can safely continue to draw on existing knowledge about familiar disorders to treat them .
In contrast , if some psychiatric ailments are entirely distinct from those in Western countries , psychologists and psychiatrists may need to start from scratch in figuring out how best to treat them .
Similar Syndromes
In the past century the presumed role of culture in mental illness has swung from one extreme to the other .
For decades many cultural anthropologists , sociologists and psychologists assumed such enormous diversity in psychiatric disorders across the globe that they were skeptical of any attempts to classify them .
But that viewpoint came under serious scrutiny in 1976 , when Harvard University anthropologist Jane Murphy reported powerful evidence that some syndromes did , in fact , seem to cross cultural lines .
Murphy examined two very different societies — a group of Yorubas in Nigeria and a group of Inuit Eskimos near the Bering Strait — that had experienced essentially no contact with modern culture .
Yet these populations had names for disorders that appeared strikingly similar to schizophrenia , alcoholism and psychopathy .
For example , the Inuit used the term “ kunlangeta ” to describe someone ( usually a man ) who lies , cheats and steals , is unfaithful to women and does not obey elders — a sketch very much like that of a Western psychopath .
When Murphy asked one of the Inuit how the group typically dealt with such an individual , he replied that “ somebody would have pushed him off the ice when no one was looking . ”
Apparently the Inuit are no fonder of psychopaths than we are .
Later research bolstered Murphy ’s conclusion .
But the idea that some mental illnesses are present in both Western and non-Western cultures does not preclude the possibility that some disorders might exist only in certain societies .
Indeed , in 1994 the American Psychiatric Association introduced an appendix of 25 culture - bound syndromes into the fourth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) .
But just as soon as this appendix appeared , many scientists contested the notion that culture - bound syndromes are unique conditions , arguing that some or perhaps even all might be variants of disorders already known in Western culture by different labels .
For example , some seal hunters in Greenland experience a condition called kayak angst , characterized by feelings of panic out in the ocean , along with an intense need to seek security back on land .
Although kayak angst appears on some lists of culture - bound syndromes , it strongly resembles the Western condition of panic disorder with agoraphobia , which is marked by extreme fear of situations in which escape would be difficult in the event of a sudden surge of overwhelming fear .
Another possible Western illness in disguise is taijin kyofusho , which appeared in our quiz and is also listed in the DSM - IV appendix of culture - bound syndromes .
Taijin kyofusho is an anxiety disorder , common in Japan , marked by a fear of offending other people , typically by appearance or body odor .
Taijin kyofusho may be an Asian form of social phobia ( also called social anxiety disorder ) , in which people dread behaving in a fashion that is potentially embarrassing — say , making a gaffe when speaking or performing in public .
Because Japanese tend to be more concerned with group harmony and cohesiveness than are Westerners , taijin kyofusho may be a form of social phobia in a culture that is especially sensitive to the feelings of others .
Distinct Disorders ?
Nevertheless , some culture - bound syndromes may be sufficiently different from Western disorders to merit separate diagnostic criteria .
In the bizarre condition of koro , found primarily in Southeast Asia and Africa , people fear that their sexual organs are disappearing or shrinking .
Koro sometimes spreads in waves of mass panic and is triggered by marked anxiety .
In the Malaysian condition of amok , which has given rise to the expression “ running amok , ” afflicted individuals , almost all of whom are males , often respond to a perceived slight by withdrawal and brooding , followed by frenzied and uncontrolled violence .
And in the disorder of “ 2 - D love , ” recently reported in Japan and some other countries , men develop what appear to be amorous relationships with animated female characters ; they may carry around pillows or other tangible reminders of these characters wherever they go .
Whether these mysterious maladies bear any underlying commonalities to well - documented Western psychiatric illnesses is unknown .
Koro , for example , could be a type of hypochondriasis ( hypochondria ) , but this possibility has received little systematic research .
Scientific disagreements aside , experts concur that culture can shape the overt expression of mental illness in significant ways .
As a consequence , psychotherapists ought to give further consideration to learning more about cultural influences on mental illness and incorporating them into their treatment plans .
Meanwhile scientists should use personality and laboratory tests to investigate the causes and manifestations of culture - bound syndromes to determine which of these disorders , if any , are distinct from those in Western culture .
If some of these syndromes turn out to be unique , mental health professionals may need to construct and implement psychological interventions that differ in significant ways from those we recognize .
Joshua Donnelly is reunited with Kenny after nine years apart
A dog has been reunited with his owners more than nine years after going missing from his Essex home .
Kenny , a cross bichon frise , was found wandering alone in Epping Forest by a passer - by .
His owners were traced using a microchip .
He was aged two when he went missing and the dog's owners presumed that he had been stolen .
Joshua Donnelly , Kenny 's owner 's son , said : " I had long since given up hope of ever seeing Kenny again . "
He added : " I was overjoyed to be reunited after such a long time . "
It is not known where Kenny spent his missing years .

Puzzle
Buffon 's needle is a popular probability problem .
Rule lines on the floor a distance d apart and toss a needle of length l wikipedia but it involves a double integral and some trigonometry .
Nowhere does it mention that there is a less familiar but much simpler proof , though if you follow the links you 'll find it .
In addition , the usual solution involves π but gives little intuition as to why π appears .
The simpler proof reveals that it appears naturally as a ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter .
I 've known this problem since I was a kid and yet I had n't seen the simpler proof until a friend sold me his copy of Introduction to Geometric Probability for $ 5 a few days ago .
So instead of solving Buffon 's needle problem we 'll solve what appears to be a harder problem : when thrown , what is the expectation of the number of times a rigid curved ( in a plane ) wire length l ( no restriction on l ) crosses one of our ruled lines d apart ?
Here 's an example of one of these ' noodles ' .
It crosses the ruled lines three times : Expectation is linear in the sense that E( A+B ) = E ( A ) + E( B ) .
So if we imagine the wire divided up into N very short segments of length l/ N the expectation for the whole wire must be the sum of the expectations for all of the little pieces .
If the wire is well behaved , for N large enough the segments are close to identical straight line segments .
Here 's a zoomed up view of a piece of our noodle :
For a small straight line segment the expectation must simply be a function of the length of the segment .
The expectation for the whole wire is the expectation for one segment multiplied by the number of segments .
In other words , the expectation is proportional to the length of the wire and we can write E( l ) =kl for some constant k.
Now we know it 's proportional to the length , we need to find the constant of proportionality , k .
We need to ' calibrate ' by thinking of a noodle shape where we know in advance exactly how many times it will cross the ruled lines .
The following picture gives the solution : A circle of diameter d will almost always cross the lines in two places .
The length of this wire is πd so E ( πd ) =2 and k=2/πd .
The expected number of crossings for a wire of length l is 2l / πd .
A needle of length l solution is 2l / πd.
No integrals needed .
The expected number of crossings is an example of an invariant measure , something I 've talked about before .
There are only a certain number of functions of a noodle that are additive and invariant under rotations and just knowing these facts is almost enough to pin down the solution .
Now I can leave you with a puzzle to solve .
In the UK , a 50 p coin is a 7 sided curvilinear polygon of constant width .
Being constant width means a vending machine can consistently measure its width no matter how the coin is oriented in its plane .
Can you use a variation of the argument above to compute the circumference of a 50 p coin as a function of its width ?

The basic chemistry for life has been detected in a second hot gas planet , HD 209458 b , depicted in this artist 's concept .
HD 209458 b , bigger than Jupiter , occupies a tight , 3.5 - day orbit around a sun-like star about 150 light years away in the constellation Pegasus .
The basic molecules required for life as we know it havebeen detected in a second hot gas planet beyond our solar system .
The planet , which orbits a sun-like star about 150 light - yearsaway in the constellation Pegasus , is not habitable but it has the samechemistry that , if found around arocky planet in the future , could indicate a world that might support lifeor the presence of life .
" It 's the second planet outside our solar system inwhich water , methane and carbon dioxide have been found , which are potentiallyimportant for biological processes in habitable planets , " said researcherMark Swain of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Detecting organic compounds in two exoplanets now raises the possibilitythat it will become commonplace to find planets with molecules that may be tiedto life . "
The first planet in which organic molecules were detected wasHD 189733 b , a hot , Jupiter - sized planet .
The discovery was made by Swainand his colleagues in December 2008 .
Swain 's team used data from two of NASA 's orbiting GreatObservatories , the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope , to studyanother hot planet bigger than Jupiter , HD 209458 b , and characterize it as thesecond knownexoplanet with organic signatures .
The detections were made through spectroscopy , which splitslight into its components to reveal the distinctive spectral signatures ofdifferent chemicals .
Data from Hubble 's near - infrared camera and multi-objectspectrometer revealed the presence of the molecules , and data from Spitzer ' sphotometer and infrared spectrometer measured their amounts .
" This demonstrates that we can detect the moleculesthat matter for life processes , " Swain said .
Astronomers can now begin comparing the two planetaryatmospheres for differences and similarities .
For example , the relative amountsof water and carbon dioxide in the two planets is similar , but HD 209458 b showsa greater abundance of methane than HD 189733b .
" The high methane abundance is telling ussomething , " Swain said .
" It could mean there was something specialabout the formation of this planet . "
Other large , hot Jupiter - type planets can be characterizedand compared in the same way .
The techniques used are also similar for thosethat will be required to shortlist rocky Earth - like planets where thesignatures of organic chemicals might indicate the presence of life .
Rocky worlds are expected to be found by NASA 'sKepler mission , which launched earlier this year , but astronomers believewe are a decade or so away from being able to detect any chemical signs of lifeon such a body .
If and when such Earth - like planets are found in the future , " the detection of organic compounds will not necessarily mean there 's lifeon a planet , because there are other ways to generate such molecules , " Swain said .
" If we detect organic chemicals on a rocky , Earth - like planet , we will want to understand enough about the planet to rule out non-lifeprocesses that could have led to those chemicals being there . "
RALEIGH , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Virtual economies set up in videogames as players trade items are being used as case studies to track and model real - world economies .

As more people join massively multiplayer online ( MMO ) videogame worlds like Activision Blizzard ’s “ World of Warcraft , ” NCsoft ’s “ Aion ” and Atari ’s ” Champions Online , ” real money is being used to purchase virtual items through micro-transactions .
As a result , game worlds are creating virtual economies .
With the global recession impacting consumer spending -- and the sales of videogames -- a research group is using Sony Online Entertainment ’s “ EverQuest II ” as a case study to explore how virtual economies mirror real - world economies .
Researcher Edward Castronova , professor of telecommunications at Indiana University , said researchers can learn almost anything about human society in games as they really are human societies .
However unlike real society they can be observed and tweaked .
“ We can do controlled experiments in virtual worlds , but we ca n’t do that in reality , ” said Castronova .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ Controlled experimentation is the very best way to learn about cause and effect .
We are on the verge of developing that capacity for human society as a whole . ”
Researchers found the average age of “ EverQuest II ” players is 31 compared to 35 for the general population .
Eighty percent of players are male versus 50 percent for the general population and they skew more white than the overall population .
“ Everquest II ” players are also wealthier than the general population with an average mean household income of $ 84,000 versus $ 57,000 for the general population .
After studying 314 million transactions within the fantasy world of Norrath in “ EverQuest II , ” including trading in - game goods like armor , shields , leather , herbs and food , the researchers were able to calculate the GDP of one of the game servers ( the back - end computer that hosts thousands of players in one world ) .
As more people opened accounts and flocked to Norrath , spending money on new items , researchers saw inflation spike more than 50 percent in five months .
Fellow researcher Dmitri Williams , assistant professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication , said the rapid economic changes may not be due to the economy being virtual but as it has volatile elements .
“ We have seen that kind of volatility during times of war and in developing nations in the real world , ” said Williams .
“ Our own economy has turned out to be less stable than we ’d all assumed . ”
The real - world recession has also sparked a rise in the number of gamers going to free - to - play MMO games like Nexon ’s “ Maple Story , ” NHN Games ’ “ Soldier Front , ” and Sony Online Entertainment ’s “ Free Realms . ”
Rather than charging players to buy the game and pay a subscription , revenue is generated through the purchase of in - game items .
“ I think as the economy has experienced its ups and downs , we ’re seeing business models reflect those changes giving people more choices , and that ’s a good thing , ” said John Smedley , president of Sony Online Entertainment .
“ We ’ve gone from box - only products with free play components to monthly subscription models , and now we ’re seeing an evolution to hybrid models that are very similar to the great number of choices seen in the music industry . ”
JP Morgan says European banks may have to raise $ 78 bn ( £ 48 bn ) in fresh equity over the next six months .

Green roofs are not just a load of greenwash .
That ’s according to a new study which has measured the amount of carbon absorbed by 13 different green roofs .
“ I ca n’t imagine why anyone would n’t want a green roof , ” says Kristin Getter , who carried out the research with colleagues at Michigan State University in East Lansing .

Getter ’s team examined 12 existing green roofs and grew their own Sedum - covered roof .
They found that the roofs absorbed up to 375 grams per square metre over the two years of their study .
That may not sound like much , but it adds up .
If a city the size of Detroit , Michigan , with around a million inhabitants , were to switch to green roofs , it would remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as taking 10,000 mid-sized SUVs and trucks off the road for a year .
There ’s a catch , though : starting a garden on the roof wo n’t immediately lower your carbon footprint .
Greening conventional roofs requires special materials , which come at a carbon cost .
It takes seven years for the roof to offset the carbon used for its building materials and become truly carbon negative .
Developing low - carbon building materials could bring it down to two or three years , says Getter .
Jon Sadler of the University of Birmingham , UK , says green roofs have many benefits , such as increased biodiversity , but is unconvinced by their potential for absorbing carbon .
“ You need a big area to make it work , ” he says .
“ It ’s not a quick fix . ”

NASA 's Interstellar Boundary Explorer , or IBEX , spacecraft has made it possible for scientists to construct the first comprehensive sky map of our solar system and its location in the Milky Way galaxy .
The new view will change the way researchers view and study the interaction between our galaxy and sun .
The sky map was produced with data that two detectors on the spacecraft collected during six months of observations .
The detectors measured and counted particles scientists refer to as energetic neutral atoms .
The energetic neutral atoms are created in an area of our solar system known as the interstellar boundary region .
This region is where charged particles from the sun , called the solar wind , flow outward far beyond the orbits of the planets and collide with material between stars .
The energetic neutral atoms travel inward toward the sun from interstellar space at velocities ranging from 100,000 mph to more than 2.4 million mph .
This interstellar boundary emits no light that can be collected by conventional telescopes .
The new map reveals the region that separates the nearest reaches of our galaxy , called the local interstellar medium , from our heliosphere - a protective bubble that shields and protects our solar system from most of the dangerous cosmic radiation traveling through space .
" For the first time , we 're sticking our heads out of the sun 's atmosphere and beginning to really understand our place in the galaxy , " said David J. McComas , IBEX principal investigator and assistant vice president of the Space Science and Engineering Division at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio .
" The IBEX results are truly remarkable , with a narrow ribbon of bright details or emissions not resembling any of the current theoretical models of this region . "
NASA released the sky map image Oct. 15 in conjunction with publication of the findings in the journal Science .
The IBEX data were complemented and extended by information collected using an imaging instrument sensor on NASA 's Cassini spacecraft .
Cassini has been observing Saturn , its moons and rings since the spacecraft entered the planet 's orbit in 2004 .
The IBEX sky maps also put observations from NASA 's Voyager spacecraft into context .
The twin Voyager spacecraft , launched in 1977 , traveled to the outer solar system to explore Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
In 2007 , Voyager 2 followed Voyager 1 into the interstellar boundary .
Both spacecraft are now in the midst of this region where the energetic neutral atoms originate .
However , the IBEX results show a ribbon of bright emissions undetected by the two Voyagers .
" The Voyagers are providing ground truth , but they 're missing the most exciting region , " said Eric Christian , the IBEX deputy mission scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " It 's like having two weather stations that miss the big storm that runs between them . "
The IBEX spacecraft was launched in October 2008 .
Its science objective was to discover the nature of the interactions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium at the edge of our solar system .
The Southwest Research Institute developed and leads the mission with a team of national and international partners .
The spacecraft is the latest in NASA 's series of low - cost , rapidly developed Small Explorers Program .
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center manages the program for the agency 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA and the European and Italian Space Agencies .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , provides overall management for Cassini and the Voyagers for the Science Mission Directorate .

Milton Mbele is marrying four women at the same time in South Africa .
The marriage - which is legal in Zulu culture - involves this white wedding , followed by a traditional ceremony in KwaZulu - Natal .
Anna Holligan reports .
What are we going to do with Sir Alex Ferguson ?
No , let 's be more precise .
What is football , and what passes for its authority , going to do ?
No doubt the rest of us passed our verdicts some time ago .
We love him or loathe him .
We love him for his life - enhancing lust for glory , his absolute commitment to the idea of winning football matches .
We loathe him for his bullying tone and because when things go against him he increasingly displays the grace and the objectivity of a ravening wolverine .
The vital point , though , is that while we can enjoy the luxury of extreme ambivalence football can't .
Not , at least , as long it likes to pretend that no one , not even arguably the most successful manager in the history of English football , can stand above the game , making his own rules and flaunting his own prejudices .
This is what is happening at the moment and what it is doing to the Football Association 's campaign to win more respect for match officials is tantamount to rolling it up as though it is a piece of grubby paper and tossing it into the nearest bin .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So far Ferguson has made two apologies , if we want to stretch the term to its outer limits , for his outrageous attack on referee Alan Wiley , and when one hara - kiri inclined sports reporter had the nerve to raise the issue the other day he was told he had posed a " silly question " .
It was n't a silly question .
It was a highly pertinent probe into the possibility that the great man had had sufficient time to reflect on a verbal assault on a match official probably more damaging than any since Jose Mourinho 's career - ending diatribe against Swedish referee Anders Frisk .
Plainly not , and this impression can only be intensified by the fact that on Sunday , after his team had failed quite woefully to meet the predictable " wounded animal " ferocity of Liverpool at Anfield with anything like the resolve of reigning champions , he found another scapegoat referee , this time the relatively inexperienced Andre Marriner .
As it happened , Ferguson 's irritation on this occasion was a lot easier to understand .
While Wiley 's performance during Sunderland 's visit to Old Trafford was virtually flawless to most neutral eyes , the same could hardly be said of Marriner's .
He made several crucial errors , almost all of them in favour of Liverpool , and most potentially decisive when he refused to hand Jamie Carragher , the last defender , a red card for bringing down Michael Owen .
However , Wiley and Marriner unquestionably shared one misfortune .
It was to preside over games in which United performed sufficiently below their normal standards to enrage any manager , let alone the most combustible of them all .
Ferguson 's device , though , of shifting attention from the deficiencies of his team on any passing day with criticism of the referee has done more than wear thin .
It is becoming a sustained challenge to football authority – one which recent evidence suggests is hardly likely to be met with any significant force when the FA comes to render its decision on the Wiley affair .
Really , the question is quite simple .
Does the FA have the cojones to take on Ferguson , tell him that no one can separate himself so frequently from some basic demands of discipline – and of setting a proper example in a game which is so relentlessly cheapened by the one - eyed self - interest so rampant in most corners .
This is n't to say that referees should be immune from criticism , they are professionals in a game which can punish , ruinously , poor performance .
But the manner of Ferguson 's attack on Wiley , its essential unfairness and the damage and hurt it inevitably caused , was way beyond any reasonable level of censure .
Referees should not be sacred cows , no more than anyone else in the game , but nor should they be chopping blocks for the ire of managers for whom a match has gone sour .
It means , surely , that when the disciplinary commission comes to pass judgement it simply cannot afford to be seen to be deferential to one of the most powerful , and influential , men in football .
Nor should anyone be in any doubt about the extent of that influence .
It is inevitably vast because when a man wins so much , and shows himself to be so impervious to the opinions of others if they happen to collide with his own , he is bound to collect disciples as a magnet does filings .
One problem is the grisly prospect of a whole generation of Fergie imitators , men who have swallowed the idea that they should take the best of the great manager and live with the rest .
The point here , though , is that Ferguson , like his late compatriot Bill Shankly , is beyond imitation .
His strengths are so often his weaknesses if you stretch them beyond the narrow confines of the matter of winning and losing .
Ferguson sees what he wants to see , and how else can we explain his enduringly ferocious appetite for the action and unbreakable belief that victory almost invariably can only be denied by malign circumstances .
Here , you have to remember the stunning post - game verdict of Shankly after Liverpool had conceded five goals to Ajax on a misty night in Amsterdam .
" The most defensive team we 've ever played , " rasped Shankly .
Ferguson , too , is capable of such assaults on logic and perhaps , who knows , it is part of the requirement of a great manager because if he does n't believe , at all times , in the rightness of his cause , who will ?
This is not to challenge the essential shrewdness of Ferguson 's assessment of any given football situation .
He knew as well as anyone that his team had underperformed grievously at Anfield at the weekend , but for his own reasons – as most always – he chose to blur the issue .
He was right , no doubt , to believe that the referee had seemed vulnerable to the intensity of a crowd which normally prides itself in its respect for classic values and achievement in the game but on this occasion reserved its greatest fury for the re-appearance of one its most distinguished former players , Owen .
Yet Sir Alex Ferguson , of all people , can scarcely complain about unacceptable levels of partisanship .
Recently , he has been striding away in the One-eyed Stakes .
It means that the FA is obliged to stop his gallop .
Either that , or fish around for a white flag .
Can rugby survive rates of attrition ?
It is both ironic and a little poignant that when English rugby union is posting casualty figures that might have come from a sporting equivalent of the Somme , a point of optimism is the latest resurrection of Jonny Wilkinson .
No one paid a heavier price for the increase in physical pressure created by the march of the professional game than the man who so willingly crossed the old demarcation line separating the behemoths at the front and the cavaliers at the back .
Yet if Wilko 's endurance has proved phenomenal , and his success in France one of sport 's most inspiring stories , it should be remembered that it is the result of both unique character and resilience .
In terms of speed and physical strength rugby has made remarkable progress in the professional era .
But is it sustainable ?
Has it become too quick , too physical for its own good ?
Recent events , in the hospital wards as well as the courts of discipline , are not exactly reassuring .
Gibson an undeserving victim of Boro backlash
Gareth Southgate has received a flood of sympathy , much of it sentimental , with his dismissal as manager of Middlesbrough .
There are some good reasons and not least that Southgate is an engaging , civilised young football man in a game that does n't always seem to be overpopulated with such figures .
However , translating regret for Southgate 's hopefully temporary setback into animus towards his former boss Steve Gibson seems to be an excessive leap in the business of partiality .
Southgate had three years to impress Gibson that he was the right man for the job , and that he failed to do so is unfortunate for the ex-manager but hardly reason to question the instincts and attitudes of a chairman who has given so unstintingly for so long to his local club .
He once kept the young manager Bryan Robson around while at the same time turning to the experienced Terry Venables in order to fend off relegation .
Now , with promotion back to the Premier League the challenge and many of his millions given up to the cause , he has turned to another older hand , Gordon Strachan .
In the demonology of football , this surely still leaves Gibson some considerable way out of the picture .
The best league in the world is back .

Homeboy Industries sees 12,000 people come through its doors every year
By Claire Bolderson
BBC News , Los Angeles
The bakery at Homeboy Industries is spotlessly clean and runs like clockwork .
The supervisor , Louis Lula Rivera , walks quickly from ovens to packing table to mixing machines making sure everyone knows what they are doing .
He stops and patiently explains the oven temperature controls to recent recruit
Art before listing all his new qualifications in food safety and preparation .
Mr Rivera spent time in jail and is now the supervisor Mr Rivera is clearly proud of them and of the fact he is in charge of 20 workers .
They all have something in common .
From Mr Rivera down , the men making bread rolls or pouring muffin mixture into baking trays are former members of Los Angeles ' notorious gangs .
Art , recently released after a prison term for transporting Marijuana , rattles off his old gang 's name when asked .
" East Side 213 , " he says .
Some of the bakery employees are former rivals who would have fought each other in the past if they had met on the street .
Now they work alongside each other , several sets of beefy tattooed arms lifting bags of flour and mixing the dough .
" It 's a good feeling , we 're all working together , making an honest living , " Mr Rivera says .

He was tired of the violence that was wrecking whole neighbourhoods and taking too many young lives .
Gang members we 've gotten jobs for in the private sector are the first to be laid off
Father Greg Boyle , Homeboy Founder
The Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office says that more than 1,400 criminal street gangs exist in Los Angeles County .
Gang crimes range from graffiti to murder and extortion .
Homeboy Industries has since grown to include a silkscreen printing business , another that sells Homeboy merchandise and a solar panel fitting operation as well as the bakery .
Then there is the Homegirl cafe where young women with similarly troubled backgrounds serve fresh meals that include produce they have grown themselves .
The industries provide just a fraction of the jobs needed for the 12,000 people who walk through Father Greg 's doors every year .
Eight thousand of them are gang members looking for the basic education , parenting classes and numerous counselling services that Homeboys provides .
Some come for free removal of the tattoos that mark them out as gang members .
But most importantly they come for jobs .
When it cannot directly provide those jobs itself , Homeboys tries to find them work in the private sector .
But with unemployment in California rising ( it now stands at nearly 12 % ) the former gang members can not compete .
' Payroll to payroll '
The recession means there is now a pool of people looking for jobs who have got a good work history and plenty more to offer .
So as Father Greg sees it , " the employer is not going to choose the gang member who 's just been released from prison , they 're going to choose the person with the skills " .
And worse , he says , " gang members we 've gotten jobs for in the private sector are the first to be laid off , mainly because they have n't been there long enough or their skills are n't valuable enough . "
So now they are coming back to Homeboys to ask for help .
It is now harder for former gang members like Art to find work Homeboy Industries is stretched to the limit trying to help them .
Forty per cent of the budget comes from private foundations and corporations and as Father Greg puts it , that money has evaporated in the recession .
" They [ the donors ] say , boy , we can't do it this year , probably not even next year , " he says .
Trying to keep the place going at the moment is " a white knuckle ride .
I do n't sleep very much at night , we 're just going from payroll to payroll , " he says .
If Homeboys had to suspend its programmes he feels it would be disastrous not just for all the individuals who have turned their lives around but for the city and county as well .
" Because we really do release the steam on the pressure cooker which is the gang issue here in LA , " Father Greg says .
Back in the bakery , 26 - year - old new recruit Art agrees .
Why did he come to Homeboys ?
For his daughters , he says , and because he was " tired of putting my mom through all the dramas .
I told my mom I 'd change my life around just for them . "
It will not be easy .
Several of the men describe lives of drug and alcohol addiction .
To work in a Homeboys business they have to stay clean .
And they have to get on with former members of rival gangs .
Art says he knows that and he is determined the crime and violence of his youth are over .
" I put that behind me .
We all of us here put that behind us , " he says .

The CDC has followed in the footsteps of British health authorities by warning neurologists to look out for cases of the nerve disease Guillain - Barre syndrome caused by the swine flu vaccine .
Doctors in Britain were advised last month by the government to carefully track cases of the disease and report each one to the Health Protection Agency .
A letter sent by 600 neurologists indicated that “ there is concern at the highest levels that the vaccine itself could cause serious complications , ” according to a Daily Mail report .
During the 1976 swine flu scare in the U.S. , which prompted the government to order a mass vaccination program to cover the entire population , the vaccine caused more deaths than the actual virus , prompting a public backlash that cost the then director of the CDC his job .
SImilar concerns about the vaccine are now being replicated over 30 years later .
[ efoods ]
“ The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Neurology have asked all neurologists to report new cases of Guillain - Barre in people who get vaccines this fall and winter to the Food & Drug Administration ’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , ” reports The Oregonian .
Guillain - Barre syndrome can cause paralysis and breathing difficulties and is sometimes fatal .
It also produces a tingling sensation and weakens limbs .
As we have previously documented , the swine flu vaccine is being rushed through safety procedures while governments have provided pharmaceutical companies with blanket immunity from lawsuits arriving out of the vaccine causing deaths and injuries .
It was previously revealed that some batches of the vaccine will contain mercury , a toxin linked with autism and neurological disorders .
The vaccine will also contain the dangerous ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome and a host of other debilitating diseases .
Several surveys have revealed that huge numbers of health professionals all over the world will refuse to take the swine flu vaccine despite government plans to institute mass vaccination programs .
A new poll released yesterday found that just 6 per cent of pregnant women would “ definitely ” take the vaccine following concerns about its safety .

Today , most high - end microprocessors have two or more cores .
Multi - threaded applications take advantage of multi-core processors by running multiple threads simultaneously .
If you are running four threads simultaneously on a processor with four cores you get four times as much work done per time unit .
Some processors take multithreading even further by running two threads in each core .
This is what Intel calls hyperthreading ( also called simultaneous multithreading ) .
For example , the Intel Core i7 processor with four cores can run eight threads simultaneously - two in each core .
Apparently , the more threads you can run simultaneously the more work you get done in a given time .
But there is a problem here :
The two threads running in the same core are competing for the same resources .
If each of the two threads gets only half the amount of a limiting resource then it will run at half speed , and the advantage of hyperthreading is completely gone .
Two threads running at half speed is certainly not better than a single thread running at full speed .
I have made some tests of hyperthreading to see how fast each of the two threads is running .
The following resources are shared between two threads running in the same core : Cache
Branch prediction resources
Instruction fetch and decoding
Execution units Hyperthreading is no advantage if any of these resources is a limiting factor for the speed .
But hyperthreading can be an advantage if the speed is limited by something else .
To be more specific , each of the two threads will run at more than half speed in the following cases :
If memory data are so scattered that there will be many cache misses regardless of whether each thread can use the full cache or only half of it .
Then one thread can use all the execution resources while the other thread is waiting for a memory operand that was not in the cache .
If there are many branch mispredictions and the number of branch mispredictions is not increased much by sharing the branch target buffer and branch history table between two threads .
Then one thread can use all the execution resources while the other thread is waiting for the misprediction to be resolved .
If the code has many long dependency chains that prevent efficient use of the execution units .
In these cases , each of the two threads will run at more than half speed , but less than full speed .
The total performance is never doubled by hyperthreading , but it may be increased by e.g. 25 % .
On the other hand , if the performance is limited by any of the shared resources , for example the instruction fetcher , the memory read port , or the multiply unit , then the total performance is not increased by hyperthreading .
Actually , in the worst cases the total performance is decreased by hyperthreading because some resources are wasted when the two threads compete for the same resources .
A quick google search reveals several examples of applications that run slower with hyperthreading than when hyperthreading is disabled .
I have tested two microprocessors with hyperthreading : the Intel Core i7 and the Intel Atom .
The Core i7 has four cores .
This processor is quite powerful .
The execution units of each core are so powerful that a single thread will rarely utilize the full potential of the processor .
Therefore , it makes good sense to run two threads in the same core .
Unfortunately , the instruction fetch unit is less powerful , and this is likely to be a bottleneck even in single - threaded applications .
With hyperthreading enabled , the Core i7 can run eight threads simultaneously .
This can give an impressive performance in favorable cases , but how many applications are able to keep eight threads busy at the same time ?
The Intel Atom is a small low - power processor which is used in small netbook computers and embedded applications .
It has two cores capable of running two threads each .
The execution units of the Atom are much smaller than the i7 .
It sounds like a weird idea to share the already meager execution units between two threads .
The rationale is that the Atom lacks the out - of - order capabilities of the bigger processors .
When the execution unit is waiting for an uncached memory operand or some other long - latency event , it would have nothing else to do in the meantime unless there was a second thread it could work on .
The details of these processors are explained in my microarchitecture manual www.agner.org/optimize/#manuals.
Obviously , it can be quite difficult for a software programmer to predict whether hyperthreading is good or bad for a particular application .
The only safe way of answering this question is to test it .
Ideally , the programmer should test his or her application on several different microprocessors with several different data sets and with hyperthreading turned on and off .
This is a large burden indeed to put on software developers , and very few programmers are willing to spend time and money on testing how hyperthreading affects their application .
If it turns out that hyperthreading is not good for a particular application then comes the next problem of how to turn it off .
Telling the user to turn off hyperthreading in the BIOS setup is not an option .
The average user may not have the skills to do so ; the feature may not be supported in the BIOS ; or it may be that hyperthreading is good for one program and bad for another program running on the same computer .
The programmer has to put the " avoid hyperthreading " feature into the program .
First the program has to detect whether the computer it is running on has hyperthreading or not .
Later versions of Windows have system functions that can give this information .
In Linux you have to read a configuration file .
If hyperthreading is detected then lock the process to use the even - numbered logical processors only .
This will make one of the two threads in each processor core idle so that there is no contention for resources .
Unfortunately , you cannot prevent the operating system from using the idle threads for something else .
There is no way to tell the microprocessor to give one of the two threads in a core higher priority than another .
Sometimes it happens that the operating system lets two threads with very different priority run in the same processor core .
This has the unfortunate consequence that the low - priority thread steals resources from the high - priority thread .
I have seen this happening even with the new Windows 7 .
It is the responsibility of the operating system to avoid putting threads with different priority into the same core .
But unfortunately , operating system designers have n't fully solved this problem yet .
What the application programmer needs is a system call that tells the operating system that " This application wants to run no more than one thread in each core and I do n't want to share any core with any other processes " .
Unfortunately , current operating systems have no such system call to my knowledge .
Other microprocessor vendors use hyperthreading as well .
In fact , there are rumors that AMD will use hyperthreading in some of their processors in the future .
Hyperthreading does indeed give a measurable advantage that shows in benchmark tests .
This is a strong sales argument that may convince the confused consumer .
But the microprocessor designer should also take into account that few applications are able to handle hyperthreading optimally .
This is a technology that places a considerable burden on software developers as well as on operating system designers .
We may ask whether the silicon space that is used for implementing hyperthreading might be better used for other purposes ?

Du 16 au 18 novembre se réunit à Rome , au siège de la FAO ( Organisation des Nations unies pour l'agriculture et l'alimentation ) un sommet mondial sur la sécurité alimentaire .
Un de plus , dira - t - on !
En effet , en juin 2008 , Rome avait déjà été le théâtre d'un sommet du même type , et quel sommet !
4.800 délégués , 53 chefs d'Etat s'étaient retrouvés dans la capitale italienne , parmi lesquels le funeste Robert Mugabe , grand confiscateur des droits de l'homme dans son pays .
Un pays naguère grenier de l'Afrique australe , qu'il a réduit à la famine et qui ne peut plus , aujourd ' hui , nourrir que la moitié de sa population .
Un nouveau sommet , donc .
La presse italienne , qui s'était alors offert le plaisir de publier le prix de la suite présidentielle de Mugabe — 900 euros par nuit — sera - t - elle cette fois aussi sarcastique ?
Autant de chefs d'Etat feront - ils le déplacement de Rome ?
C'est , à ce jour , impossible à prévoir .
Pourtant , les enjeux ne sont pas moins importants qu'ils ne l'étaient il y a dix - huit mois , bien au contraire .
A la crise alimentaire , qui venait alors de révéler son ampleur , s'est ajoutée la déflagration économique et financière dont le monde ne parvient pas à sortir .
La seconde ajoutant ses effets à la première , la malnutrition frappe désormais un milliard d'êtres humains , un niveau encore jamais atteint dans l'histoire de l'humanité .
Sur ce milliard , près de 650 millions vivent en Asie du sud , 265 millions en Afrique subsaharienne , 53 millions en Amérique latine , le reste se répartissant entre le Moyen - Orient , l'Afrique du Nord et les pays développés .
Bien entendu , les premières victimes de la malnutrition sont les plus vulnérables des humains , à savoir les enfants .
Le sommet de Rome se réunira juste avant les célébrations du 20e anniversaire de la convention internationale sur les droits de l'enfant , qui permettra quelques durs rappels : la malnutrition ne se borne pas à tuer quelque cinq millions d'enfants de moins de cinq ans par an .
Elle laisse aussi derrière elle d'innombrables séquelles : pour ne prendre que ces exemples , près de 200.000 enfants perdent la vue chaque année d'une carence en vitamine A ; la déficience en iode — responsable d'arriérations mentales irréversibles — frappe à des degrés divers plus de 300 millions d'enfants à travers le monde , alors que la quantité d'iode nécessaire à une vie entière tient dans une cuillère à café .
Que peut - on espérer d'un sommet comme celui qui va s'ouvrir à Rome , sinon une prise de conscience , une seule : la famine est politique .
Elle relève avant tout de décisions aberrantes qui se sont succédé depuis plus de quarante ans et que seuls les politiques peuvent modifier .
Certes , le réchauffement climatique y joue son rôle , le nier serait absurde .
Mais ne relève - t - il pas lui aussi , pour une grande part , de causes profondément politiques , de l'aveuglement collectif qui a permis à l'économie mondiale de s'organiser sans tenir aucun compte des exigences de l'environnement ?
Les causes de la situation nutritionnelle de la planète sont d'abord à rechercher du côté du modèle « industrialiste » de l'agriculture qui a misé l'essentiel des investissements , y compris dans les pays du sud , sur les productions agricoles « de rente » au détriment des cultures vivrières .
Les productions issues des grandes plantations , indispensables à l'agro - industrie dénuées de tout effet nutritionnel sur les populations du sud , ont livré l'agriculture au monde spéculatif .
L'on a donc pris l'habitude de traiter le soja , le riz , le blé comme l'étain , le minerai de fer ou le pétrole , la spéculation a fait flamber les cours , à Chicago , Londres ou Genève au point de rendre inaccessibles ces mêmes biens agricoles à ceux qui les produisent .
Tous les ingrédients des émeutes de la faim étaient ainsi réunis .
Ils le sont encore .
Ce schéma industrialiste de l'agriculture est aussi à l'origine du développement des agro-carburants , co-responsables de la situation nutritionnelle actuelle puisqu'ils détournent de l'alimentation humaine d'immenses terres arables et d'énormes quantités d'eau .
A titre d'exemple , un quart du maïs produit aux Etats - Unis est aujourd ' hui transformé en agro- carburants , alors même que le pays fournit à lui seul un tiers du maïs mondial .
La forêt amazonienne , au Brésil , subit des trouées mortelles pour l'environnement pour produire de la canne à sucre .
Les émeutes de la faim de 2008 , qui ont éclaté dans certains des pays les plus peuplés du monde ont effrayé les politiques , d'où le sommet réuni à la hâte , cette même année , à Rome .
La crise actuelle n'aura fait qu'exacerber leurs craintes : aujourd ' hui , la situation nutritionnelle est incontrôlable dans plusieurs pays parmi les plus fragiles politiquement , singulièrement toute la Corne de l'Afrique ( Ethiopie , Somalie et Soudan ) , auxquels s'ajoute le Kenya : dans tous ces pays , les ferments d'instabilité politique et tribale ne peuvent qu'ajouter à l'inquiétude .
La crise économique et financière contribue à rendre la situation plus explosive encore : les diverses diasporas des pays pauvres , elles aussi frappées par le chômage et la stagnation des salaires , rencontrent de plus en plus de difficultés à envoyer des subsides à leurs familles restées au pays .
Or de tels envois de fonds jouent un rôle vital dans l'économie de pays comme l'Inde , la Pakistan , le Bangladesh ou Haïti .
L'aide publique au développement se contracte elle aussi malgré les engagements , purement verbaux , des pays donateurs .
Pourtant , chacun sait que la planète comptera , en 2050 , 9 milliards d'habitants et qu'il faudra bien les nourrir .
La FAO estime qu'il faudra , pour cela , augmenter la production alimentaire mondiale de 70 % , surtout si les habitudes alimentaires continuent d'évoluer vers une demande croissante de viande , comme c'est le cas en Chine .
Il faut en effet produire trois fois plus de céréales pour produire des calories animales que végétales .
Malgré le fait que seulement 10 % des terres émergées soient cultivées , les experts estiment que l'augmentation de la production agricole viendra davantage d'une hausse de la productivité des terres déjà cultivées que de l'extension des surfaces plantées .
Ce qui suppose d'énormes investissements en engrais et pesticides , en travaux d'irrigation , en matériel de stockage et en moyens de transport .
Tout cela devra se faire en reconstituant progressivement une agriculture de type familial , seule capable de lutter efficacement contre la malnutrition .
C'est donc d'une rupture avec les conceptions industrialistes de l'agriculture qu'il s'agit , d'une révolution dans les pratiques et dans les conceptions actuelles , rien de moins .
Il y faut , en effet , quelques sommets mondiaux .
Celui de Rome , les 18 et 19 novembre , en fournira - t - il l'occasion ?

Great Programmers
I 've seen a lot of discussion of great programmers , usually centering on how to find them , but usually what people really want to know is how to become one .
Since I 'm widely considered to be a great programmer , I 'll give some advice .
First of all there 's raw coding ability .
For this , practice makes perfect .
Implementing lots of algorithms from , say
There are only two coding skills which mostly people who are completely self - taught as a programmer miss out on : proper encapsulation , and unit tests .
For proper encapsulation , you should organize your code so that changes which require modifying code in more than one module are as rare as possible , and for unit tests you should write them to be pass / fail so that all unit tests can be run as a comprehensive suite .
And now you know everything you need to about those two things .
Anyone who is taught the above guidelines , and decides they really want to learn those skills , will with sufficient practice become good at them .
Coding skill is all well and good , and you can't become a great programmer without it , but it 's far from everything .
I 'm decent at raw coding , but I know many people who are better , and some of them are abysmal programmers .
I in particular can't deal with being tasked with fixing up spaghetti code .
My brain simply locks down and refuses to make any modifications which it is n't convinced will work , which is of course impossible when the source material is an incurably bug - ridden mess .
What truly separates the great programmers from the journeyman programmers is architecture .
What 's puzzling is that architecture appears to be one of the simplest parts of the whole process , requiring in most cases little more than some pencil and paper calculations and a willingness to change .
The simplest architectural problems to solve are the ones which for lack of a better theory most people ascribe to emotional or psychological problems .
These are decisions for which there 's no rational justification whatsoever .
For example , writing a non-speed - critical program ( which is most of them ) in C or C ++.
A few years ago you could justify that because the other languages did n't have such extensive libraries , but today it 's ludicrous .
Another one is building one 's protocol as a layer on top of webdav .
And another one is building a transactional system for retrieving any subsection of any point in the history of an arbitrarily large file in constant time when that is n't part of project requirements .
Yes , I 'm making fun of subversion here .
It 's a great example of a project permanently crippled by dumb architectural decisions .
Half of these ' emotional ' architectural decisions are dogmatically using a past practice in situations where it 's inapplicable .
The other half are working on interesting problems which have little or no utility in the finished product .
Once decisions like these have been made , questioning them can become a political impossibility .
If someone new comes in to a project with many man-years on it , and in their first week learns that there 's a networking call which includes a parameter as to whether it should be blocking or non-blocking , and immediately declares that the entire codebase is a mess and difficult if not impossible to maintain , they 'll almost certainly be correct and justified , but their opinion will likely be disregarded as as brash and ill - informed .
After all , they have n't spent the kind of time on the codebase than everybody else .
I 've actually had this happen to me , and while others have claimed that there are more political ways of approaching such problems , my experience has been that once the truth becomes unthinkable a couple people need to get fired before any improvement can be made .
My advice about technically unjustifiable architectural decisions is to not do them .
If you find yourself doing them , you probably need to get laid or see a shrink or have a beer .
But what if you 're emotionally well - adjusted , and want to get better at software architecture ?
Logging more hours at work will get you nowhere .
When I wrote BitTorrent multiple other people were working on the exact same problem , most of them with a big head start and a lot more resources , and yet I still won easily .
The problem was that most of them simply could not have come up with BitTorrent 's architecture .
Not with 20 code monkeys working under them .
Not with a decade to work on it .
Not after reading every available book on networking protocols .
Not ever .
Clearly this is n't because BitTorrent 's architecture is terribly difficult to understand .
The entire approach can be understood without any really hard thinking in about an hour , with the possible exception of the state machine for the wire protocol , and even that is extremely simple as state machines go .
The realy difficulty in coming up with something like BitTorrent is that it involves fundamentally rethinking all of your basic approaches .
This is very difficult for humans to do .
We attack any new problem we encounter with techniques we already know , and try small modifications if difficulties turn up .
My suggestion for learning software architecture is to practice .
Obviously you can't practice it by doing hundreds of projects , because each one of them takes too long , but you can easily design a hundred architectures for problems which only exist on paper , and where you strive to just get the solution to work on paper .
Start by modifying the requirements of a problem you 're working on .
What if the amount of bandwidth or CPU was a hundredth what it currently is ?
What if it were a thousand times ?
A million ?
What if you had a thousand times as much data ?
A million ?
A billion ?
What if the users were untrusted and you had to either prevent them from damaging the system or have a means of fixing things when they did ?
It does n't matter if these scenarios are totally unrealistic , what matters is that they 're different and that when you try to find architectures for handling them you take the inputs just as seriously as if you were about to start writing a system with those requirements for work .
Try to find as many different approaches as you can , and come up with scenarios in which the stranger ones would be better .
Learning these skills takes time , but is definitely worth it .
I could n't have come up with Codeville 's architecture without first having spent a lot of time working on voting algorithms .
Not that voting algorithms have anything to do with version control , but the process of coming up with example scenarios and defining the behavior which should happen in each of them carries over very well .
I 've seen a lot of discussion of great programmers , usually centering on how to find them , but usually what people really want to know is how to become one .
Since I 'm widely considered to be a great programmer , I 'll give some advice .
First of all there 's raw coding ability .
For this , practice makes perfect .
Implementing lots of algorithms from , say Introduction to Algorithms can help sharpen your technical abilities , but really the important thing is to have some experience .
Anyone with enough natural talent will get good at basic raw coding .

That depends what sort of programmer you wish to become .
If you want to dabble in computers because computers seem important to you , I suggest learning Python .
If you want to learn computers because you 're fascinated by their inner workings , I suggest learning C ( not C++ , that has a lot of extraneous cruft ) .
Most people fall into the first category .
BitTorrent took two years of full time work to get to the not sucking stage , and another year to become reasonably mature .
That depends what sort of programmer you wish to become .

( Anonymous ) : Codeville architecture
So how about a post about Codeville architecture , then , eh ? ;-)
Your competito ^Wcolleagues are curious !
( I guess the answer might be " then go to CodeCon " , but while Graydon and I talked about it some , he 's busy then and I was busy now ( and do n't really have $ 80 to throw at it anyway ) , so no Monotone submission .
Maybe some other time . )

bramcohen Codeville 's documentation , especially its architectural documentation , has lagged far behind its implementation , mostly because implementation is a higher priority that documentation , especially when we have n't even hit 1.0 yet , and there 's still the occasional significant change .
What I 'd really like to see is a paper comparing the architectures of Darcs , Monotone , and Codeville , although I 'm not sure that there 's a single person who 's grokked two out of those three systems .
Are you local to the San Francisco area ?

darkcode I can't help wondering - I 'm 16 , and in high school in San Diego , CA .
I 've been programming for perhaps 2 years , and have gotten fairly good at it for a kid , but nothing compared to most of the programmers I meet and talk to .
After studying code in college , for example , does writing applications ( especially with GUIs ) get easier ?
Or should I give up for " not having the gift " ?
I know you 're not a counselor , but answering this question would mean quite a lot to me .

( Anonymous ) : Re : Age and development I learned how to program GUIs while I was still in high school .
In fact , I had only known C++ for 5 months at the time .
I think the key is the API you choose .
I learned the BeOS API which was ( is ? ) quite easy to wrap one 's head around .
I would recommend Qt nowadays .
As for the college question , nothing I learned in college really applies to GUI programming .
College exposed me to many other languages and programming paradigms .
While those are good experience , they are n't quite the same as learning an API .
So really , what I 'm trying to say is that you are as ready to learn GUI programming now as you ever will be .
Studying programming in in college is just 4 years of practice with fundamental theory thrown in for good measure .

( Anonymous ) : Subversion Another one is building one 's protocol as a layer on top of webdav .
And another one is building a transactional system for retrieving any subsection of any point in the history of an arbitrarily large file in constant time when that is n't part of project requirements .
Yes , I 'm making fun of subversion here .
It 's a great example of a project permanently crippled by dumb architectural decisions .
Subversion also has a non-webdav server " svnserve " which uses the TCP based svnserve protocol .
It 's much faster .
Many open source project repositories use plain svnserve .
Not sure what you meant with your comments on transactions .

Well , they 've now gone halfway to admitting that using webdav has been a failure .
The other half would be to stop supporting the webdav version .
Unfortunately for them , the webdav view of the world was the basis for how files are handled , as a result of which subversion does n't support file renames , and never will .
Do n't believe the feature list .
Subversion does ' renames ' as a copy and a delete of the old version , as a result of which if one person moves a file and another one modifies it the change will be dropped , which is even worse behavior than cvs has .
The whole transactional file store thing is covered in Tom Lord 's post Well , they 've now gone halfway to admitting that using webdav has been a failure .

One thing not covered in that post is that the way that data structure is built on top of berkeleydb is also comically stupid , even if you assume that it's a worthwile thing to build , which it is n't .

People regularly ask for the ability to run a repository on a remote - mounted filesystem ( or worse , they try , using BDB , and get bizarre failures ) .
Baldly asserting that it 's not an important feature does n't make it so .
Anyway , go ahead and finish writing Codeville .
I think you 'll find that a version control system that scales beyond basement projects is a lot tougher than you think , and that the vast majority of the user base does n't have the same priorities as you do .
If you 're right and I 'm wrong , I 'm sure you 'll be able to revisit this thread in a few years and be proud .

It 's not a high priority , but it 's definitely on the slate for the future . )

I 'm glad to see that someone of your caliber is sharing my opinions about software development .
It 's basically comes down to choosing the right approach ( from practice and experience ) and the suitable environment ( e.g. the proper programming language for the job ) .
I also think that ' evolutionary ' development with rapid prototyping is sometimes most likely to brings you closer to the solution instead of a full - fledged top - bottom design .

mr_mediocracy
Hello there ,
I try to grasp the meaning of your statement about " emotional or psychological problems " and being " emotionally well - adjusted " when doing architectural decisions .
Could you please elaborate on what you mean with that .
How do emotions lead to technically unjustifiable architectural decisions ?
Cheers

There are only two coding skills which mostly people who are completely self - taught as a programmer miss out on : proper encapsulation , and unit tests .
While this is true , I believe that the top two skill that self - taught programmers are missing are documentation and naming , and decomposition .
Good naming and good documentation can only be learned from working with others .
Just yesterday I was reviewing someone 's class for our new team ( call it team Foo ) .
He called it FooEngine .
I pointed out that we 're already in a " Foo " directory -- and this is general code not specific to our team -- so he changed it to Engine .
If you were a stranger and you saw a class called Engine , would you have the faintest idea what it was doing ?
It actually exports individual lines of a CSV file , with retries ... if we were n't going to break it up into three classes ( see below ) then I 'd call it ExportCsvLinesWithRetry .
Decomposition is another thing you rarely learn on your own .
If only one person is working on the code at a time , you have to pay a moderate cost for decomposing your design into disconnected parts , and you do n't see the benefit .
But a key to cooperation with others and to maintainable software in general is to decompose the design into the smallest reasonable pieces .
In the case above , when you split up the Engine into three parts , it turned out that there were good solutions to each of the three parts already in the codebase .
So in fact nothing might need to be written , but more likely , we 'll add some useful new functionality into a couple of places where other people can use it .
