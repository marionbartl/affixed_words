One day after federally rescued insurance giant AIG announced that it was suspending its lobbying , Sen .
Dianne Feinstein has announced a bill to prevent other rescued companies from using taxpayer dollars for lobbying .
" Federal dollars were not intended to be used for lobbying , and it would be unconscionable for these companies to misuse taxpayer dollars in this way , " Feinstein said in a statement .
The legislation would prevent government loans that companies received as part of the recent bailout package from going to lobbying .
What it does n't do is impose a total ban on lobbying , so its effect is unclear .
" I do n't know what kind of impact it 's going to have , " said Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 , a nonpartisan government watchdog organization .
" The banks are left free to use other resources to pay for lobbying expenses . "
ProPublica reported earlier this month that AIG was still lobbying after the federal government gave the company $ 120 billion in bailout loans last month .
The Wall Street Journal later reported that AIG 's continued lobbying included a push to relax new regulations against mortgage fraud .
In response , Feinstein ( D - CA ) and Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - FL ) sent a letter to the company ’s chief executive , Edward Liddy , asking him to stop AIG ’s lobbying efforts .
Feinstein plans to introduce her plan when Congress returns to session after the election .

This might be the most important monetary discussion of the past few decades , and Ed Bugos should get a lot of credit for starting it with the excellent Who�s Bailing out Whom ?
I agree with Mr. Bugos wholeheartedly although I believe the situation might be even more precarious than he states .
I urge all of my readers to at least read the piece by Ed Bugos and as much of the below discussion as you can stomach .
Also , I would ask that you forward this to as many people as you know so they too will have a chance to understand the truth before it smacks the U.S. and the rest of the world in the face .
The Federal Reserve is bankrupt .
The U.S. Treasury Department quietly rescued � actually , took over � the world�s largest Central Bank on September 17 .
The idea that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke could fly his helicopter was a fraud ; the Fed simply didn�t have any helicopter fuel .
The U.S. Treasury Department , on the other hand , has copious amounts of helicopter fuel in the form of undiscounted government debt , and this fuel has now been made available to Mr. Bernanke .
The more fuel the Treasury provides , the closer the U.S. dollar will get to its death .
Just released Fed data confirms that initial test flights of Ben�s helicopter have been spectacularly successful .
Up to $ 150 billion has been loaded on the helicopter so far and may already be fluttering down into the Monetary Base as I write this .
The inflation of �high power� money by more than 15 % in the course of 2 weeks ( an annual rate of 300 % or more ) is unprecedented .
Inflation of the Monetary Base is leveraged by fractional reserve lending .
Should the banks actually start to lend again , we could very well see hyperinflation in the U.S. over the next 18 months .
This is obviously bullish for gold and silver and bearish for the dollar , although it could take the markets a while to realize it ( by which time an even more incredible sequence of events could overshadow this one , although I doubt it ) .
I think the markets might need 2 - 3 weeks more to absorb what just happened .
I wrote last Thursday�s post about the Federal Reserve�s bankruptcy right before the new Factors Affecting Reserve Balances report came out with data as of October 1 , which confirmed my statement that the Federal Reserve is a dead man walking .
The Reserve Balances report supports what Ed Bugos and several of my readers pointed out on Friday : a massive jump in the Adjusted Monetary Base during the second half of September .
Here is a chart of this data : Notice the vertical line at the end of the chart .
That �s a $ 75 billion increase in the past two weeks .
Given the parabolic rise of the Adjusted Monetary Base since 1970 , perhaps you might think that $ 75 billion is not particularly special , but the just - released Factors Affecting Reserve Balances report indicates that the size of the vertical line could more than double to $ 150 billion when this chart is updated next week .
See the Ed Bugos article for more charts with vertical lines .
Monetary Base Set to Explode
To get an idea of what is in store , let�s examine the latest Factors Affecting Reserve Balances report a bit more closely .
The relevant number we need to look for in this report is called � Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks � .
Reserve Balances are claims by the banking system on cash held in the vaults of the Federal Reserve Banks .
The most important thing about Reserve Balances for our purpose is that the Monetary Base includes these Reserve Balances as well as cash in circulation ( including coins and Federal Reserve Notes in bank vaults and in the hands of the public ) .
The Monetary Base , as the name implies , is the first layer of the fractional reserve banking system .
Generally speaking , an increase in the Monetary Base is multiplied several times as it propagates through the money supply .
Here are the figures for � Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks � since the beginning of September : September 3 , 2008 : $ 3.8 billion
September 10 , 2008 : $ 25.0 billion
September 17 , 2008 : $ 81.7 billion
September 24 , 2008 : $ 87.9 billion
October 1 , 2008 : $ 171.5 billion
We can see from this data that around $ 63 billion of the $ 75 billion increase in Adjusted Monetary Base as of the two weeks ended September 24 was the result of a rise in Reserve Balances .
Let me note that another $ 7 billion was apparently the result of an increase in Federal Reserve Notes in circulation while much of the remainder was the result of the Adjusted Monetary Base being a weekly average ( not end of period ) calculation .
Indeed , if we look at another important Fed report , Aggregate Reserves of Depository Institutions and the Monetary Base , we can confirm the leap in the Adjusted Monetary Base figures .
There are some differences in accounting and averaging that make the actual amounts of Reserve Balances included in the Monetary Base and the Adjusted Monetary Base somewhat different from report to report , but what matters is the rate of change between periods .
To wit , there has been an increase in the Monetary Base of $ 65 billion for the two weeks ended September 24 according to the latest Aggregate Reserves of Depository Institutions and the Monetary Base report .
We can also see from the data I provided above that Reserve Balances almost doubled this past week ( after September 24 ) , rising by $ 83.6 billion to $ 171.5 billion .
Thus , we should expect both the Monetary Base and the Adjusted Monetary Base to rise by a very substantial amount when new Monetary Base data is published this next week .
The Dam Broke Two Weeks Ago
Up until two weeks ago when the $ 700 billion bailout package came out of virtually nowhere , the Federal Reserve seemed content to continue swapping its liquid Treasury securities portfolio for the illiquid assets of banks , slowly destroying the Fed�s balance sheet in the process .
But the impending failure of AIG and the actual failure of Lehman Brothers apparently did some serious damage to the Fed�s plans , because the most important monetary decision of this entire crisis was made in a big hurry , with virtually no fanfare .
I suspect the Fed finally started looking more than a few days ahead and suddenly realized that it might quickly and completely run out of Treasury securities ( see below ) .
So , the Fed and Treasury announced a seemingly innocuous Supplementary Financing Program on September 17 .
In reality , it was nothing less than a clandestine federal bailout , a de facto government takeover of the Federal Reserve that will officially materialize as such only at a later date .
This radical �program� , which is by far the most extreme of all the Fed and Treasury actions in terms of monetary consequences , has received very little coverage so far in the media , on Wall Street , on Main Street , in the Capitol , or on the Internet .
But I suspect this could soon change now that the $ 700 billion bailout package has been penned into law .
Indeed , the Treasury bailout legislation seems to be the fuel for the Supplementary Financing Program , which is nothing less than the biggest monetary helicopter lift since the Weimar experiment with the printing press .
Supplementary Financing : An Unprecedented � Program �
Here is how the Supplementary Financing Program is alleged to work .
The U.S. Treasury Department sells Treasury securities in a public auction and deposits the cash proceeds with the Federal Reserve .
The Federal Reserve thus has �cash for use in the Federal Reserve initiatives� .
Sounds simple enough , but do not be fooled !
That is only a part of the story .
If the Treasury securities were merely sold into the market and the proceeds were loaned to the Federal Reserve , there would be no impact on Reserve Balances or the Monetary Base .
Or as Ed Bugos likes to say , the liquidity would be �sterilized� .
In other words , the operation would merely represent a shift of existing money supply within the financial system , not an injection of new cash .
Yet what we have witnessed in the past few weeks is a massive increase in Reserve Balances to the tune of over $ 160 billion .
And that can only mean one thing : the Fed is now monetizing bank assets , or at least is preparing to do so , on behalf of the Treasury .
This is a bona fide helicopter operation , the first of its kind during the current credit crisis and certainly the largest in the history of First World central banking since the Great Depression .
What we don�t know is if these Reserve Balances will turn into Federal Reserve Notes and get stuffed under the mattress as panicked depositors continue to withdraw cash from the banking system or if these Reserve Balances will get loaned out by the banks whose assets are being monetized .
If the former , the hyperinflation will be delayed until the cash is taken back out from under the mattress , which will happen once the bank runs have abated .
If the latter , hyperinflation could come fast and furious .
In effect , what �s really happening is that the Treasury is borrowing money into existence at the Monetary Base level .
This is exactly the same thing that Weimar Germany did .
What the Germans ( and the Argentinians , Zimbabweans , etc. ) found out , and what our �benevolent � leaders will also soon discover , is that the printing press is a slippery slope to oblivion .
The worst - case outcome of giving into this temptation is almost unfathomable .
And here we all thought the $ 700 billion bailout package had to actually be approved by the elected representatives of the people before the Fed and Treasury could commence their bailout plan .
Silly us !
In fact , it looks like the Fed and Treasury have been preparing to go forward via the back door regardless of what our legislators decided .
I suppose this is why Secretary Paulson insisted that passage of the bailout was necessary to restore confidence to the credit markets , but no specifics were provided about how exactly the process would work .
Now we know why .
The bailout was the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig , and the pig is the Supplementary Financing Program through which the Fed can already monetize bank assets .
Legislative approval was essentially a rubber stamp , a mere formality .
The Executive branch under Bush Jr. has once again usurped powers not granted to it under the U.S. Constitution .
If the above is not crystal clear to you , perhaps the hard numbers will put things in perspective .
The Treasury has provided over $ 150 billion of Reserve Balances so far under the Supplementary Financing Program ( out of $ 344 billion in special auctions ) whereas the initial Treasury authority to purchase troubled bank assets under the Congressional bailout legislation is $ 250 billion .
In other words , most of the initial authority has already been loaded on the helicopter in the past couple of weeks and is ready to be dropped from the sky .
Here is the thing that bothers me the most .
The idea that the Treasury would buy distressed bank assets using taxpayer money is hugely unpopular with Americans , but the unpopularity itself became the blindfold that kept everybody from asking exactly how the Treasury would actually do this .
In fact , several hundred economists ( all of them apparently Keynesians ) have written letters to Congress urging them not to vote for the bailout because it would not work , mainly on the grounds that banks will need to be recapitalized with banking reserves instead of just having bad assets taken off their books .
Well , guess what ?
Recapitalization of banking reserves was apparently the plan all along !
I find it curious that some members of Congress have said of the bailout , as a way of expressing that there is much work left to do , that it is the end of the beginning and not the beginning of the end .
My two cents is that Thursday , September 24 , 2008 could in fact mark the beginning of the end : the end of the U.S. Dollar as a liability of the Federal Reserve system .
I suspect we will look back on this as a day of infamy , the day we found out that Ben�s helicopter is fueled up , ready to fly and itching to drop piles of money from the sky .
Helicopter in Action
The helicopter is why , out of nowhere , the Reserve Balances and the Adjusted Monetary Base jumped by $ 75 billion or so in the past two weeks .
And the helicopter is why these amounts have jumped and will jump by another $ 75 billion or more by next week .
As you consider the situation , please realize that up until this September , the Monetary Base had barely changed since the beginning of the credit crisis last year .
That proves more than anything that the helicopter was grounded until now .
Indeed , all the credit facilities created by the Fed from the Term Auction Facility to the Term Securities Lending Facility to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility to the Bear Stearns Maiden Lane facility and to the AIG credit facility have had no actual effect on the Monetary Base or money supply .
This is because the credit facilities are essentially just swaps of assets , not money creation .
The banks simply obtained assets they could sell ( Treasury securities ) in exchange for assets they could not sell ( loans , MBS , CDO , etc . )
This is the reason some observers are confused about why the Federal Reserve has not been inflating money supply in the face of a credit crisis that has deepened every month since last August .
So why exactly has Ben�s famous helicopter not flown , much less made money drops , until the past two weeks ?
There are several reasons .
For one , even Mr. Bernanke recognizes the inflationary implications of a helicopter drop and he was willing to use it only as a last resort .
But there is a more fundamental reason .
You see , the helicopter didn�t have a stable fuel supply .
What fuel there was in the form of Open Market operations or purchases of bank assets was simply too unstable and would probably cause the helicopter to crash .
Furthermore , it turns out the Fed cannot monetize bank assets effectively without assistance from the U.S. Treasury Department .
See the Appendix to this essay for a detailed explanation .
What I �m saying is that the idea � as suggested by the Fed Chairman himself � that the Fed is capable of flying the helicopter all by itself is fraudulent .
Moreover , anybody claiming that the Fed had already flown the helicopter before September is simply wrong .
The various Federal Reserve reports that I reference in this commentary back me up on this .
For example , the Aggregate Reserves of Depository Institutions and the Monetary Base shows that as recently as September 10 , when the total borrowings by banks under the various Fed credit facilities stood at $ 170 billion :
The Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks was still under $ 10 billion ( as it had been throughout the crisis since early 2007 ) ; The Monetary Base was still around $ 850 billion ( up only $ 20 billion since August 2007 ) ; and Federal Reserve Notes outstanding were still around $ 800 billion ( also up a corresponding $ 20 billion since August 2007 ) .
I would note that the $ 20 billion increase is approximately 2.5 % per year , well below the trend of the past few years .
By contrast , just three weeks after September 10 , the Reserve Balances now stand at $ 170 billion and the Monetary Base is perhaps pushing $ 1 trillion ( each up a staggering $ 150 billion in two weeks ) .
If and when the Fed and Treasury really start to ramp up their bailout operation , we will likely see these numbers rise even more .
What a difference a couple of weeks can make !
It took the Treasury coming into the picture and starting to issue new federal debt under the Supplementary Financing Program � ostensibly to provide cash for the Federal Reserve to use in �initiatives� � to get banking reserves and the Monetary Base to �finally � start growing .
Why was the Treasury necessary ?
Because as I explain in the Appendix below , the banking system as a whole is incapable of generating adequate collateral for banking reserves on its own .
And the banking system certainly cannot create sustainable banking reserves out of thin air .
Stated another way , neither banks nor the Fed can create banking reserves without collateral .
It is collateral , and only collateral , that can serve as fuel for the monetary helicopter .
And the only collateral that matters is Treasury securities .
Once again , this is explained in greater detail in the Appendix .
For those not wishing to delve into the specific details provided in the Appendix below , perhaps I can sufficiently advance the above argument by pointing out that the Federal Reserve cannot simply accept banking assets as collateral for Reserve Balances or Federal Reserve Notes because withdrawal of these banking reserves by the public � accomplished by literally putting Federal Reserve Notes under the mattress � would create a fatal problem for the banking system : not enough money in circulation to repay outstanding bank loans , including the loans used as collateral for the newly created Reserve Balances .
We can use the cliche �pushing on a string� to describe the inability of the Fed to effectively monetize bank assets that were created through fractional reserve lending .
Cliche or not , it is precisely the act of �pushing on a string � that has forced the Fed to beg the Treasury to borrow money � and thus banking reserves � into existence .
The Secret Death of the Fed The problem of lacking helicopter fuel aside , the Federal Reserve had another problem a couple of weeks ago that required immediate Treasury intervention .
The Fed had bled Treasury securities from its portfolio to the tune of $ 300 billion by early September with no end in sight .
Indeed , as of October 1 the Fed has given away over $ 500 billion of Treasury securities from a portfolio that held $ 800 billion just last year .
If something wasn�t quickly done , the Fed was in very real danger of exhausting its ammunition for �lender of last resort� duties .
In my estimation , the Fed exhausting its Treasury securities portfolio is tantamount to insolvency � nay , bankruptcy .
Indeed , the Fed seems to have become prescient about its impending doom just in the nick of time given that the latest Factors Affecting Reserve Balances report shows as of October 1 that the Fed has acquired $ 538 billion of banking assets which now support around 67 % of the $ 804 billion of Federal Reserve Notes outstanding .
By my calculation , the Fed has as little as $ 241 billion of Treasury securities left to lend under its credit facilities , which is barely enough to fund the recently - announced $ 150 billion increase in the Term Auction Facility .
That leaves less than $ 100 billion .
Look , I was an auditor for 8 years and I can tell you what we would have already called this situation in early September : A GOING CONCERN .
I have no doubt that the Fed , were it to be a normal business enterprise , would have needed to file for bankruptcy protection this past week if the Treasury had not come to the rescue on September 17 .
For all intents and purposes other than appearances , that means the Fed is now effectively bankrupt .
This is ultimately why Helicopter Ben made the choice to ask the Treasury to give him fuel to fly his helicopter .
It was now or never .
I would assume that Mr. Bernanke is pleased with the net result of his helicopter flying so far : a $ 150 billion increase in the Monetary Base in just a couple of weeks .
If the banks do get back into the business of lending and they maintain a reserve requirement of 10 % on new loans , that could mean an increase of up to $ 1.5 trillion in the money supply at the M1 and M2 level .
M1 is currently $ 1.5 trillion ( $ 700 billion excluding currency ) whereas M2 is currently $ 8 trillion , so such an increase would not be a trifling amount .
In addition , there is still another $ 550 billion to go under the bailout package approved by Congress .
Should most of it be used as helicopter fuel , that could mean a nearly doubling of the present money supply over the course of a few months as the Monetary Base increases from around $ 900 billion to perhaps as much as $ 1.6 trillion .
The gentlest way to describe this is hyperinflation .
Conclusion Sure , there is a chance we could see a delayed reaction from the markets until people start to get what Ed Bugos , I and others have laid out here .
There is even a chance that somehow this crisis gets averted ( temporarily ) so that the massive increases in the Reserve Balances and Monetary Base can be drained back out of the financial system before they become entrenched .
At the same time , there is an even better chance that most of the $ 700 billion bailout just approved by Congress will be used by the U.S. Treasury under the Supplemental Financing Program ( or more likely something else that replaces it ) to provide fuel for Ben�s helicopter .
It seems that given the choice of inflate or die , the decision has been made to inflate .
With the first $ 150 billion loaded on the helicopter and all systems go , it remains to be seen what people will do with all this new money when it flutters to the ground .
Will they stuff it under their mattresses ?
If so , the hyperinflationary effect of the helicopter drop would be temporarily neutralized .
But that would also mean even larger helicopter drops will be needed to stem the growing deflationary tide .
If the drops are ultimately successful and the monetary system does not suffer a deflationary collapse , then at some point a true monetary tidal wave will be released and that could very well create a hyperinflationary collapse .
How many times have we heard false warnings about monetary tidal waves in the past to the point where now it�s like crying wolf ?
Well , this time there really is a wolf !
The good news for debtors is that the sudden flood of hyperinflated money into circulation will probably wash away the unmanageable debt burdens in both the public and private sectors .
The bad news for creditors is that the monetary flood could destroy all those who have �saved � wealth in fiat form .
Whatever happens , the real beneficiaries in the long term will be gold and silver because they provide , as monetary metals , the safest and perhaps only alternative for wealth preservation .
But they will also react as the battle between deflation and hyperinflation rages back and forth , so it will be critical to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve data to determine where the monetary waves seem to be heading .
In conclusion , those who follow my writing closely know that I�ve been talking about this stuff as if it will happen at some point in the far future .
Frankly , I didn�t think the deflation - hyperinflation battle would happen so soon .
Sure , I �m a bit surprised .
But I �m also prepared .
Are you ?
It �s about to happen right here , right now .
APPENDIX What Is the Monetary Base ?
The Monetary Base consists of currency in circulation ( coins and Federal Reserve Notes ) , cash held in bank vaults , and cash held by banks at the Federal Reserve�s vaults in the form of Reserve Balances .
Reserve Balances can be converted to coin or Federal Reserve Notes to be delivered to the bank�s vault at any time .
In addition , the U.S. Treasury Department can hold Reserve Balances at the Fed. Treasury Reserve Balances are created when the Treasury sells Treasury securities directly to the Fed .
This is the equivalent of �running the printing press� whereby the Fed uses the Treasury securities as collateral for the issuance of Reserve Balances to the Treasury .
The Treasury would then spend the Reserve Balances into the economy , thus placing the newly printed money into circulation .
If and when Treasury Reserve Balances are converted to Federal Reserve Notes , the Treasury securities issued to the Fed would serve as collateral for those as well .
This is what is meant by �borrowing money into existence� .
There is an important distinction , however , between borrowing money at the Monetary Base level and at the fractional reserve level .
Essentially , the Monetary Base is the money that banks �start out with � and then sequentially loan out under the fractional reserve lending system .
Fractional reserve lending expands the money supply ( checking accounts , savings accounts , money market accounts , etc. ) with the Monetary Base serving as , well , the base .
For this reason and others , a change in the Monetary Base is probably the most sensitive indicator of both monetary and price inflation .
It is �high power� money .
The Monetary Base is also the only component of the money supply that the Federal Reserve can directly act upon .
By raising reserve requirements , for example , the Fed can force banks to keep more cash in their vaults ( or the Fed�s vaults ) and therefore to reduce lending .
Lowering reserve requirements , on the other hand , allows banks to use excess reserves to make new loans .
Not only that , the reserve requirement affects the size of the money multiplier ( see below ) , which ultimately determines the total amount of money that can be created through bank lending activities .
The periodic adjusting of reserve requirements by the Fed is what creates the Adjusted Monetary Base that is shown in the chart at the beginning of this essay .
I�m not going to get any more specific about this because for our purposes we can substitute Adjusted Monetary Base for Monetary Base and vice versa .
How Does the Monetary Base Relate to Money Supply ?
Please allow me to provide an example to illustrate how reserve requirements and the multiplier effect work in relation to the money supply .
For the sake of simplicity , I�ll ignore complications like the fact that certain bank deposits have no reserve requirements and that a portion of the Monetary Base has been permanently withdrawn from the domestic economy in the form of Federal Reserve Notes hoarded ( under a mattress ) or held offshore .
Let �s assume the Fed requires 10 % of bank deposits to be held in the form of reserves .
The theoretical limit on money creation in this instance would be 10 times the Monetary Base ( or 900 % increase ) .
This is because only 90 % of the balance can be loaned out each time .
So , if we start with $ 100 Monetary Base , a bank can loan $ 90 on that , then $ 81 ( 90 % of $ 90 ) , then $ 72.90 ( 90 % of $ 81 ) , etc .
Don�t worry if you �re having difficulty picturing this because I will dive into even more excruciating detail below .
For now , what �s important to recognize is that each time the diminishing loan proceeds are deposited in a bank � it doesn�t matter if it is the same bank that issued the loan or another bank � there is a reserve requirement that reduces the amount that can be subsequently loaned out .
The sum of the diminishing loan balances with a 10 % reserve requirement is equal to $ 1,000 .
But if the Fed lowers the reserve requirement to 5 % , the theoretical limit on money creation becomes 20 times ( a 1900 % increase of ) the Monetary Base , or $ 2,000 using our example of $ 100 initial Monetary Base .
By adjusting the reserve requirement , we can see that the Federal Reserve can directly influence the money supply because banks will lend out more ( inflate ) or less ( deflate ) of their banking reserves .
The Federal Reserve , however , has not adjusted the reserve requirement for most deposits since 1992 .
To do so now would be pointless .
Raising the reserve requirement in order to make sure that banks are better protected against loan write - offs would cause the money supply to contract and this would make the deflationary threat even worse .
On the other hand , lowering the reserve requirement in order to stimulate the money supply would further expose banks to the risk of insolvency since they would have even lower banking reserves to absorb loan losses .
Why , Specifically Then , Are Banking Reserves Rising ?
It turns out that there are other ways that banking reserves can be adjusted .
Recall that Reserve Balances represent the claims of the banking system and the U.S. Treasury Department on the cash held in the vaults of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks .
A bank can choose to hold cash in physical form in its own vaults or as electronic Reserve Balances representing cash located at the regional vaults of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks .
Reserve Balances in the Treasury�s account , meanwhile , are held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Together , vault cash held by the banks and vault cash held at the Fed as Reserve Balances constitute total banking reserves for purposes of the reserve requirement .
Each bank must decide how much cash to hold in the bank vault vs. how much cash to hold in the form of Reserve Balances with the Fed .
The decision depends on the amount of demand for cash by depositors ( this cash obviously needs to be held in the bank�s branch vaults or in ATMs ) as well as the volume of transactions clearing through the Federal Reserve payment system ( which requires cash to be held as Reserve Balances at the Fed ) .
Fortunately , the Federal Reserve ( still ) publishes reports on a weekly and bi-weekly basis that allows us to track changes in how the banking system as a whole maintains its banking reserves .
For example , these reports allow us to assess the extent to which depositors are demanding cash , which could indicate whether or not a bank run is occurring ) .
Over the next few weeks , it will be critical to examine these Federal Reserve reports as they are issued in order to determine if either ( 1 ) the recent rise in Reserve Balances is being converted to Federal Reserve Notes or ( 2 ) Reserve Balances are being used by banks to make new loans .
If the former , that means deflationary risk is growing and it would not be very bullish for gold and silver in the short term .
If the latter , that means hyperinflationary risk is growing and it would be very bullish for gold and silver in both the short and the long term .
In any case , since the Federal Reserve must stand ready to convert electronic Reserve Balances to Federal Reserve Notes at any time , the two forms of banking reserves ( vault cash and Reserve Balances ) are essentially the same thing .
The only difference is the location of where the cash is actually being held .
Okay , we�ve talked a lot about Reserve Balances but we are still no closer to explaining why precisely they have grown so much in the past couple of weeks .
So let me do that now without further delay .
Reserve Balances are growing because the U.S. Treasury Department has made available $ 344 billion or so of Treasury securities to the Fed over the past couple of weeks ( Factors Affecting Reserve Balances ) under the Supplementary Financing Program .
Of this $ 344 billion , approximately $ 180 billion has likely been used in Foreign Exchange Swap Lines involving other central banks and as part of the various credit facilities that the Federal Reserve has made available to the banking system .
As explained elsewhere in this essay , these swaps and credit facilities are �money neutral� or �sterilized � in terms of their effect on the Monetary Base and money supply .
They represent merely a movement of cash between accounts within the banking system , or between central banks .
But that still leaves approximately $ 160 billion of funds provided so far by the Treasury under the Supplementary Financing Program .
And it is these funds that have been surreptitiously used to boost the banking reserves of the Federal Reserve system and its constituent banks through the direct creation of Reserve Balances ( printing money ) in the Treasury�s account .
While it is not clear that these Reserve Balances have made their way down to the individual accounts of the banks themselves , the funds are certainly available for that purpose .
Under the $ 700 billion bailout plan , the Treasury is supposed to have control over these Reserve Balance , not the Fed , but my guess is that it is Ben Bernanke who will actually be flying the helicopter .
If not , he will at least be the co-pilot .
In any case , the signing of the bailout plan into law last Friday means that the Fed and Treasury are now in a position to determine how and where these new banking reserves will be used .
By �used� , I mean the actual step of monetizing certain bank assets by dropping money from the helicopter on specific targets .
The net result will be the transfer of Reserve Balances from the Treasury�s Fed account to the Reserve Balances account of whichever bank is �lucky � enough to be targeted .
From there , the Reserve Balances will either be used to make new loans or to pay out depositors in the form of Federal Reserve Notes .
Banking Reserves and Shareholder Equity
It will perhaps help some of you to think of banking reserves as shareholder equity .
The two concepts aren�t exactly interchangeable since a bank�s shareholder equity is actually called its capital , which must meet certain minimum requirements apart from reserves .
In fact , a bank�s capital is calculated as a percentage of bank assets while a bank�s reserves are calculated as a percentage of bank liabilities .
But there are enough similarities that we can use the analogy for illustrative purposes especially if we look at the shareholder equity of the banking system as a whole and not just that of an individual bank .
In a corporation , there are essentially two ways to increase shareholder equity and two ways to decrease shareholder equity .
Equity can be raised by generating earnings or by shareholder infusions of capital .
Equity can be reduced by generating losses or by paying dividends ( or less frequently , by repurchasing and retiring stock ) .
It is for the most part the same in the banking system when viewed as a whole .
An individual bank may elect to maintain its � shareholder equity � in the from of banking reserves ( vault cash and Reserve Balances ) , or to lend it out at interest , as long as it maintains the minimum banking reserves specified by the Fed .
The opportunity to lend at interest is the obvious reason why banks do not maintain Reserve Balances very much in excess of the required amount .
Even holding low - yielding U.S. Treasury Bills is typically a better option than holding a bunch of non-yielding cash in the vault .
From a practical standpoint , however , it is usually easier for banks to lend excess Reserve Balances to other banks on an overnight basis at the so - called Fed Funds Rate ( this is accomplished with a simple book entry at the Fed that transfers Reserve Balances from one bank to another ) .
Banks can also use Reserve Balances to buy assets from other banks .
In effect , this is what the Treasury appears ready to do now with its newly - created Reserve Balances .
An Even Closer , More Painful , Look at Banking Reserves I will now explain why banks themselves cannot increase banking reserves and therefore why Treasury intervention is required .
To continue the analogy above , banking reserves have a direct relationship to shareholder equity .
This means that the banking system cannot increase shareholder equity by simply refusing to lend funds and hoarding cash .
Doing so may increase banking reserves at some banks , but it will come at the cost of decreasing banking reserves at other banks .
Such changes in banking reserves net out at the system level .
In other words , the banking system as a whole � as historical Fed reports demonstrate � is not able to generate banking reserves through its own lending and deposit - taking activities .
Over time , banking reserves can certainly be built up as a result of earning the interest differential between loans and deposits , but this is a gradual process .
Simply put , the banking system did not generate $ 160 billion in earnings during the past two weeks .
Indeed , when we look at the banking system up close , we find that every dollar of banking liability ( such as a checking deposit ) actually represents a dollar of fractional reserve money supply .
Converting that dollar from electronic form ( deposits ) to paper form ( vault cash and banking reserves ) means that it is no longer available to the banking system .
Thus , attempting to turn money supply into banking reserves is sort of like a hamster running inside a suspended wheel : the hamster is running , but it is n�t getting anywhere .
Moreover , due to the fractional reserve multiplier effect , removing one dollar from the fractional reserve money supply and holding it as excess banking reserves in the form of vault cash will actually reduce money supply by several multiples ( up to $ 5 decrease in the case of a 20 % reserve requirement and up to $ 20 decrease in the case of a 5 % reserve requirement ) .
Strictly speaking , the decision by one bank to increase its banking reserves by one dollar means other banks will have to reduce their banking reserves by one dollar .
At the same time , there would also be a decrease in the overall money supply .
To understand this more clearly , let�s look back at the concept of reserve requirements I discussed above .
If the Federal Reserve were to increase the reserve requirement from 10 % of deposits to 20 % , what the banks would do is reduce the amount of loans .
This would cause banking reserves to increase but only as a percentage of bank deposits , not as an absolute amount .
The reason for this is the multiplier effect of fractional reserve lending .
Recall that each dollar loaned out of banking reserves will eventually result in several dollars of growth in money supply ( deposits ) .
This necessarily means that a dollar added back into banking reserves will result in several dollars of reduction in money supply .
It is the reduction in money supply ( deposits ) , not a change in the gross banking reserves , that accomplishes the increase in banking reserves from 10 % to 20 % .
In other words , total banking reserves stay the same while deposits are reduced by one - half .
I understand this might seem pretty confusing , so let me take it a step further and provide a detailed example .
Let�s go back to the 10 % reserve requirement and start out with Bank A having $ 100 Monetary Base in the form of Reserve Balances .
Further , let�s assume Bank A has no loans and just one deposit account with a balance of $ 100 .
The $ 100 deposit balance represents a depositor who opened an account with $ 100 in Federal Reserve Notes .
Bank A , when it received the $ 100 in Federal Reserve Notes , delivered this cash to its regional Federal Reserve branch so now the $ 100 in Federal Reserve Notes is held at the Fed�s vault and Bank A has $ 100 in Reserve Balances .
Now , let �s assume Bank A makes a loan .
Given the 10 % reserve requirement , it can only lend $ 90 of its $ 100 Reserve Balances .
So Bank A makes a $ 90 loan to Joe , who has a checking account at Bank B .
What do we have after the loan is disbursed ?
Bank A : $ 100 Deposit , $ 90 Loan , $ 10 Reserve Balances ( 10 % reserve )
Bank B : $ 90 Deposit , $ 90 Reserve Balances ( 100 % reserve )
Total Deposits : $ 190
Total Reserve Balances : $ 100
System - wide Banking Reserve : 52.6 % ( $ 100 / $ 190 ) Now , let�s assume Bank B loans out the $ 90 deposit in Joe�s checking account to Bob , whose account is with Bank C. Remember , Bank B can only loan out $ 81 because it needs to keep a 10 % reserve level .
Here is how it looks now : Bank A : $ 100 Deposit , $ 90 Loan , $ 10 Reserve Balances ( 10 % reserve )
Bank B : $ 90 Deposit , $ 81 Loan , $ 9 Reserve Balances ( 10 % reserve )
Bank C : $ 81 Deposit , $ 81 Reserve Balances
Total Deposits Bank A+B+C : $ 271
Total Loans Bank A+B : $ 171
Total Reserve Balances : $ 100
System - wide Banking Reserve : 36.9 % ( $ 100 / $ 271 )
This can continue with Bank D , E , F , etc. until the total deposits reach $ 1,000 , total loans reach $ 900 , and the system - wide banking reserve decreases to the 10 % reserve requirement .
This is the multiplier effect in action .
Note , however , that the banking reserve itself has not decreased , only the banking reserve as a percentage of deposits has decreased .
In other words , the Reserve Balances never changed from $ 100 .
It has merely been redistributed between the banks that have received deposits as a result of fractional reserve loans being made throughout the banking system .
If you work the above example in reverse you will see that an individual bank can boost its own banking reserves only by shrinking the overall money supply ( deposits ) .
Yet there would be absolutely no change in the reserves of the banking system as a whole .
The above means that Reserve Balances are not � in fact , cannot � be created by the banking system itself .
In addition , it also means that individual banks are not increasing their banking reserves despite fears expressed by the Treasury Secretary , Federal Reserve Chairman and so many pundits that banks are hoarding cash and no longer lending to each other .
They might not be lending , but they are also not hoarding cash as indicated by the latest Money Stock Measures report issued by the Federal Reserve , which indicates that money supply has in fact been stable to growing in all deposit categories up to and including the past two weeks .
Once again , this leaves the Treasury as the only source of the recent massive increase in banking reserves .
Moreover , when you truly understand how the Federal Reserve and U.S. banking system actually work as described above , you will recognize that the recent increase in banking reserves is a form of capital infusion by the Treasury .
In effect , this is the same thing as the temporary recapitalization of the banking sector by the Treasury that many Keynesian economists have been arguing for .
The trick is that instead of making an equity investment as a shareholder , the U.S. government will create equity by purchasing bank assets at book value instead of realizable value .
The result is exactly the same : an increase in the bank�s shareholder equity ( capital ) and reserves .
The difference is that existing shareholders get to keep their full equity stake under the Treasury proposal and the banking system is not nationalized .
How to Capitalize a Bank Without Getting the Upside of Equity Despite the Treasury�s odd approach , the conventional method to inject capital into the banking system is the same as it is for any other corporation : funds provided by common or preferred shareholders .
For example , foreign investors including sovereign wealth funds were making direct investments in some U.S. banks earlier this year .
Alas , they have consistently said �no� in the recent past .
When lacking outside or inside investment � by inside , I mean a government investment that results in partial or complete nationalization � there is really only one other way to increase banking reserves under a currency regime where both the fractional reserve money supply ( deposits ) and the Monetary Base ( Federal Reserve Notes , Reserve Balances ) are created through borrowings .
You guessed it , by borrowing !
And since banking reserves are a component of the Monetary Base , it is the Monetary Base that has to be borrowed into existence .
Although you will find this in papers and textbooks written about the Federal Reserve system , it turns out there is no point trying to increase banking reserves by making loans and then attempting to pledge them as collateral to the Federal Reserve in exchange for Reserve Balances .
Yes , theoretically an individual bank should be able to pledge any eligible loan to the Fed as collateral in order to obtain banking reserves , but there is a critical consideration that blows the theory into smithereens .
It is the fact that the Federal Reserve is required to discount loans and other bank assets that it receives as collateral .
By contrast , the Federal Reserve is not required to discount Treasury securities .
As a result , the only form of liquidity injection into the banking system that will work both in large amounts and on a permanent basis is the acquisition of Treasury securities by the Fed .
Before getting to Treasury securities , let�s take a closer look at the alternative described above : sales or pledges of bank assets to the Fed in exchange for reserves .
A bank presumably needs to increase banking reserves because it is anticipating withdrawals by depositors or it needs to replace capital lost due to loan defaults or bad investments .
Typically , however , a bank does not need help from the Fed to do this .
The bank could simply sell loans to other banks or stop making loans in order to increase its reserves as long the anticipated withdrawals or losses are gradual enough .
There is no need for Fed liquidity injections in this case .
If , however , withdrawn cash is not deposited at another bank but rather placed under the mattress , total banking reserves will necessarily decrease over time and the money supply will necessarily shrink by a multiple of the withdrawn cash as the fractional reserve lending process operates in reverse as described above .
Still , while this would be deflationary , there is nothing wrong with the sequence of events from the perspective of the banks themselves because deposits and loans would remain in balance and the banking system would remain solvent .
Should the deflationary risk to the economy exceed comfort level , however , the Fed could conduct temporary or permanent Open Market operations to boost banking reserves by acquiring Treasury securities and issuing newly printed Federal Reserve Notes .
The result is replacement of the liquidity that was lost when the cash was withdrawn from circulation .
As a result , loan balances need not be reduced .
And although there are inflationary implications to the creation of new money , they will not manifest themselves until the cash that has been placed under a mattress is brought back into circulation .
At that time , the Fed could presumably reverse its Open Market operation and drain excess liquidity back out of the banking system , but of course that doesn�t ever seem to happen .
Alternatively , let�s see what happens if the bank tries to sell loans to the Federal Reserve in exchange for Reserves Balances .
This , by the way , is the textbook explanation of how money is initially created .
It is how the creation of Federal Reserve Notes is described by the Fed and Treasury in their own websites and by their own staff .
It is also how academic papers describe base money creation .
Yet despite all the expert nods , money creation through loan purchases by the Federal Reserve doesn�t actually work .
Why not ?
Let�s go back to the bank�s need for the banking reserves in the first place .
The bank clearly doesn�t need the banking reserves for lending purposes if it already has perfectly good ( performing ) loans on its books .
Why then would the bank take performing loans ( the only type the Federal Reserve is allowed to accept ) and offer them to the Fed at a discount ?
It is either because the bank needs to increase banking reserves to make up for losses that have drained its capital or to make up for deposit withdrawals that have reduced the banking reserves themselves .
In all cases except a complete withdrawal of cash from the banking system , however , all that has occurred is that the banking reserves has shifted from one bank to another .
It �s harder to see this in case of a loan loss , but just consider that the loan proceeds had to go somewhere and unless they were withdrawn from the banking system , these loan proceeds are still sitting in a bank account somewhere .
That means another bank now has excess reserves while the bank with the loan or deposit losses has inadequate reserves .
Once again , however , banking reserves across the banking system as a whole have not changed .
Therefore , the issue is n�t inadequate reserves in the banking system but the issue is rather how the reserves can be redistributed in the most efficient manner from banks with excess reserves to banks with inadequate reserves .
In other words , the bank with the losses will either have to attract new deposits or it will have to sell assets .
And this is precisely where selling assets to the Federal Reserve will almost never make sense .
Why not ?
Again , it has to do with the fact that all assets other than Treasury securities must be discounted by the Fed .
That means the selling bank will receive cents on the dollar for its assets .
Acquiring Reserve Balances from the Fed in exchange for discounted assets will definitely boost the bank�s cash reserves , but this will also generate additional losses for the bank .
For example , if the bank pledges or sells a $ 100 loan to the Fed , it will receive $ 90 or less in exchange even though the loan is perfectly good .
Even if the loan is to Bill Gates ( unless the loan is commercial paper or a mortgage loan on his house ) .
The Fed�s collateral discounting is required by the Federal Reserve Act , the legislation that created the third American central bank in 1913 , and necessarily results in a decreasing amount of banking reserves , shareholder equity and capital ratios .
If repeated enough , it is a sure path to insolvency for any individual bank and the banking system as a whole .
In fact , the �dirty secret� of the current Federal Reserve credit facilities program is rooted in the very concept of discounting .
You see , banks and dealers that swap assets under the Term Auction Facility or any of the other Fed credit facilities are allowed to keep these swapped assets on their books at full value even though the Fed only gives them a discounted collateral value in exchange .
For example , Fed advances under credit facilities maturing in more than 28 days �cannot exceed 75 percent of the lendable value of its available collateral� .
I would note here that the �lendable � value is already a discounted collateral value .
As the Fed�s margin table [ PDF ] shows , bank assets without a market value are generally discounted to 90 % with only a few exceptions ( 95 % for commercial paper , 93 % for Agency guaranteed loans and 91 % for 1 - 4 family residential loans ) .
By contrast , if the Fed were instead to buy outright such bank assets without market values ( and therefore without markets ) , that would generate an immediate loss of 5 % , 7 % , 9 % or more .
Such a move would probably wipe out shareholder equity and capital considering many banks have capital ratios under 10 % to start with .
It gets even worse if a cash withdrawal is headed for a mattress .
In this case , the banking system has actually lost reserves as a whole .
The proper corrective action would be to liquidate loans ( or not issue new ones ) across the banking system until banking reserves are restored to an adequate level .
In the alternative , the Fed should conduct temporary Open Market operations by acquiring Treasury securities in the open market on an undiscounted basis .
The Open Market operation should be reversed as soon as the cash is returned to circulation from under the mattress .
If , instead , banking reserves are created by selling discounted loans to the Fed that could otherwise have been liquidated ( or paid back ) at full undiscounted value at some point in the future , a rather serious monetary imbalance is created .
Because of discounting , the newly issued money would not be sufficient to repay loan balances outstanding across the banking system including the loans that were sold at a discount to the Fed .
A condition where outstanding loans cannot be repaid with existing money in circulation means that the banking system is essentially underwriting a loss equal to the discount whereas the Fed ( and ultimately the government ) is guaranteeing that the default rate will not exceed the discount rate .
This arguably would work under a gold standard and perhaps even under a monetary standard that allows only short term commercial paper to be discounted , but otherwise it is a recipe for major disaster .
Aside from the horrid consequences for interest rates , the creation of a Federal Reserve Note that is then placed under the mattress means that the Federal Reserve Note is no longer available to repay any loan , including the loan that was pledged in order to bring that particular Federal Reserve Note into existence .
As a result , more and more new loans will be required to repay existing loans regardless of the economic circumstances .
At the same time , if Federal Reserve Notes were continually removed from circulation and kept under a mattress , as would likely happen given the highly unstable banks that would exist under such a monetary scheme , there would be less and less money in circulation to repay loans .
The net result would be hyperinflation of prices amid a collapse of economic activity .
In other words , precisely the crisis we now face .
The bottom line is that only entities that can borrow at zero discount ( for default and repayment risk ) are able to provide the dollar - for - dollar credit necessary to increase the Monetary Base on a permanent basis .
In the case of the U.S. dollar , this is the Treasury Department of the U.S. government .
It seems the effects of discounting are being overlooked by most monetary commentators and experts as they seek to understand the current credit crisis .
This is not surprising to me given that none of them apparently have realized the true reason why there has been so much monetary inflation in the U.S. up to this point .
Simply put , the Monetary Base has been gradually removed from the U.S. economy over time as Federal Reserve Notes are exported offshore or literally placed under the mattress .
The movement to a �cashless � economy of debit and credit cards has largely obscured the ugly truth but the current crisis may very well expose it .
Ultimately , Only Government Can Borrow a Fiat Monetary Base Into Existence
I hope that I�ve been able to convince you that only government borrowing � via the direct issuance of Treasury or other securities that the Federal Reserve can hold as collateral at full par value for new issuances of Federal Reserve Notes � can reliably increase the fiat Monetary Base while providing an unlimited amount of collateral to the banking system regardless of what happens to each newly - created Federal Reserve Note .
Any other approach ( that does not involve constant currency controls and market interventions ) would result in the monetary system collapsing back on itself or being hyperinflated away .
I suppose this is the key to the Federal Reserve�s relative longevity and also probably the reason why the U.S. dollar is still the world�s reserve currency despite the mess that it is .
But that looks to change soon now that the ugly truths are popping up all over the place .
It hasn�t always been this way .
When the Federal Reserve was founded , its Notes were intended to circulate only when rediscounted ( the discount being split by the lending bank and the Federal Reserve ) commercial paper was available to be pledged as collateral .
This was a nod to the Real Bills doctrine as advocated by Professor Antal Fekete , even though the Federal Reserve provided a fiat backing of only 40 % gold .
The effect was to increase the Monetary Base while the commercial paper was outstanding and to reduce the Monetary Base when the commercial paper was repaid .
The creation of money under this classic Federal Reserve system was clearly temporary in nature .
It was a system that could actually have worked if given a chance .
But the temptation of the government � not the bankers themselves � to get something for nothing was too great and so this early version of the Federal Reserve was soon bastardized .
In its modern incarnation , the Fed uses Open Market operations to increase or decrease the Monetary Base ( ( e.g. during the holidays ) .
Moreover , the Fed has used Open Market operations almost exclusively in the past several decades to permanently increase the Monetary Base as shown in the chart at the beginning of this article .
Basically , this involves the Fed buying Treasury securities from Wall Street dealers and paying for the securities with newly issued Federal Reserve Notes ( which are credited to the seller�s bank in the form of Reserve Balances ) .
This has the effect of immediately boosting the Monetary Base .
Moreover , none of this growth in Monetary Base would have been possible without an increasing amount of Treasury securities available to serve as collateral for the Fed�s issuance of Reserve Balances and Federal Reserve Notes .
The bottom line is that it is ultimately the growth in government debt that has supported the increase in the U.S. dollar Monetary Base and vice versa .
And the need for the growth in government debt resulted , at least in part , from the exporting of Federal Reserve Notes offshore .
Why the Federal Reserve Is ( Was ) a Fraud
Yet if Open Market operations have worked so �well � in the past , you�d think the Fed would have used them all along to deal with the current banking crisis in order to boost the Monetary Base and to increase liquidity .
Well , you�d be wrong .
One reason for this is the Fed does not want to be blamed for creating hyperinflation , assuming it can still be avoided .
It is perfectly willing , however , to let the Treasury and the U.S. government take the blame .
This is precisely what seems to be happening given that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is considered to be the author of the $ 700 billion bailout plan .
But make no mistake , even if the Treasury is providing the fuel , it is the Federal Reserve that will be flying the helicopter ( or at least co-piloting it ) .
Another reason for prior
Fed reluctance to fly the helicopter is that purchasing tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of eligible collateral on the open market would have influenced interest rates to the possible detriment of the Fed�s stated policy goals .
In effect , increased Fed demand for Treasuries might drive credit yields below Fed interest rate targets and actually reduce the banking system�s appetite to lend .
That is not what you want when liquidity is already tight .
At the same time , Fed Open Market operations could also serve to remove some of the highest quality debt securities from the credit markets .
This ironically might result in a net reduction , not increase , in liquidity .
So , the Fed has opted , at least until 2 weeks ago , to fight the credit crisis using so - called credit facilities which have consisted of the Fed exchanging its liquid assets ( U.S. Treasury securities ) for banks � illiquid assets ( various agency and non-agency debt securities for which demand has shrunk to almost nothing as a result of reduced appetite for risk in the markets ) .
These illiquid bank assets have in turn been used to collateralize existing Federal Reserve Notes that were previously collateralized by ( relatively ) risk - free Treasury securities .
Of course , the financial institutions the Fed has been bailing out with these �facilities � sell the Treasury securities into the market as soon as they receive them in order to obtain cash to meet liquidity needs .
The added benefit of the �facility - based � approach has been that the sale of Treasury securities into the market ( vs. their purchase as part of Open Market operations ) boosted overall market liquidity .
Conclusion ( The Final One , I Promise )
As preferable as the credit facilities have been compared to helicopter flights , the Federal Reserve essentially destroyed its own balance sheet during the past two weeks , which is why the Fed reached out to the ultimate lender of last resort , the U.S. government .
Yet it might be too late for a cure .
We�ll find out in a few weeks whether or not the Fed�s ill condition has deteriorated beyond the point of no return .
If so , the U.S. dollar as a Federal Reserve liability will shrivel up and die as more and more people discover the truth .
Sooner or later the Treasury will have to provide an acceptable monetary alternative because formally nationalizing the Fed will accomplish nothing if the Fed has already been effectively nationalized as of September 17 , 2008 .
Under the circumstances , there is a good chance that gold and silver in the hands of the public will rise to the occasion .
My next essay on this subject will describe the most likely approach that the Treasury will take to move back toward a Market - Based Monetary Standard ( hint : I think it will involve gold . )

Among the seven trillion people who are - at least officially - Cooperative citizens , you are nobody .
So far , anyway .
You 've got a ship , some weapons , and enough spare cash to get started - and one day , you might get the fame , wealth or glory you want .
Perhaps one day , everyone might know your name .
If , that is , you can survive that long .
The two thousand star systems of the Cooperative once enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity , and perhaps the wealthiest of them can still pretend to .
The trade ships that once safely travelled between planets now have to be well armed and escorted to fend off pirate attacks , from small - time criminals desperate for their next meal , to powerful robber barons extracting tithes from everyone who passes through their space .
The Cooperative 's police force , concentrated near a few influential planets , can no longer maintain order .
The mercenaries they hire for a few credits a kill are too few , too unreliable to do so either .
And in the darkness between the stars , an old enemy lurks , fearless , perhaps waiting for order to collapse entirely .
Good luck , Commander .
Oolite is inspired by the 8 - bit classic Elite , and many aspects of gameplay will be familiar to players of that game .
In the tradition of open - world games , there 's no overall story : you can be a millionaire trader , a veteran combateer , a feared pirate , a lonely miner , a notorious smuggler , or all of them , or something else entirely , based on your own actions .
For those new to the game , the getting started page has some hints for beginners to see you safely through your first flight , and suggests ways to continue in future .
One of the most important aspects of Oolite is customisation : almost all parts of the game can be modified using simple free text and graphics tools , and over five hundred expansion packs are available , ranging from minor tweaks such as a new ship or replacement sound effects , all the way up to giant missions it could take you weeks to play through .
Oolite runs on Mac OS X ( 10.6 or later ) , Windows ( Vista Service Pack 2 or later ) , and Linux .
It is designed not to need the latest hardware , and requires only a 1GHz processor , 1GB of RAM , and an Open GL - capable graphics card for basic performance ( though a higher specification is recommended , and some expansion packs may require a more modern computer ) .

Michelle Malkin and World Net Daily have made a lot of noise today about the fact the Gwen Ifill , the moderator of Thursday 's VP debate , has a new book coming on Inauguration day about Barack Obama and the politics of race -- it 's now leading on the front of Drudge .
Fox 's Greta Van Susteren reports that the McCain campaign did n't know about it .
" I am stunned …. the campaign ( actually both ) should have been told before the campaign agreed to have her moderate .
It simply is not fair -- in law , this would create a mistrial . "
But one did n't have to go the lengths of oppo research to find out about a book that was hiding in plain sight on Amazon and the Random house website .
Not to mention , Ifill discussed it with Howard Kurtz last month in the Washington Post , in the only profile she 's done before the debate .
( And I 'd imagine someone in the campaign should have read it ) .
To the extent she can carve out any spare time , Ifill is working on a book called " Breakthrough : Politics and Race in the Age of Obama . "
She focuses on the Democratic nominee and such up - and - coming black politicians as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Newark Mayor Cory Booker .
" We 're very lazy when we think about race in this country , " Ifill says .
" We try to put it in a box .
It 's Jesse versus Al , or Jesse and Al versus everyone else , " she says , referring to Jackson and Sharpton .
" We love simplistic conflict .
There 's a whole group of people who have Ivy League degrees and immense accomplishments who actually benefited from the things their parents were fighting for . "
Regardless , the story 's getting major play on cable news , especially Fox .
This morning with Bill Hemmer , Fox analyst Juan Williams spoke admirably of Ifill as a journalist but admitted that " it looks like she has some investment " in the outcome of the election , and that " there 's a perception problem . "
The FoxNews.com headline : " VP Debate Moderator Pens Pro-Obama Book . "
I think Malkin and other critics have a right to raise questions about whether Ifill should be moderating , but at the same time , it 's not as if the veteran PBS journalist has been keeping the book under wraps until now .
It 's also a logical question to ask whether an Obama book would sell better or worse depending on the outcome of the election .
I do n't think I 'm going out on a limb to say that if Obama 's sworn in on the Jan. 20 pub date , a book with " Obama " in the title will sell more copies .
Legitimate questions , indeed .
So why is this coming up less than 36 hours before Palin and Biden hit the stage ?
( h/t TVNewser who had this clip of Ifill discussing the book ) .
UPDATE : A spokesperson for PBS 's NewsHour said that Ifill is en route to the debate in St. Louis .
When asked whether Ifill might disclose that she 's writing this book during the debate , the spokesperson said he had no knowledge that she would , and declined to comment further .
I also have a call into the Commission on Presidential Debates , and will update if they have a comment .

Suppose John McCain had been in the White House in October 1962 , facing one of the great tests of the modern presidency .
If so , we might remember that period not as “ the Cuban missile crisis ” but as “ World War III . ”
As Mr. McCain demonstrated in Friday evening ’s debate , he is a serious foreign policy thinker who has traveled widely , and he certainly showed vision and bipartisanship in helping to repair relations with Vietnam .
But it ’s equally clear that in recent years Mr. McCain has become impish cubed  impulsive , impetuous and impatient  and those are perilous qualities in a commander in chief .
Although he is frantically trying to distance himself from President Bush , Mr. McCain , by his own accounting , would be more Bushian in foreign policy than even Mr. Bush is now .
While Mr. Bush has been forced to accept more sensible policies in his second term , Mr. McCain has become steadily more of a neocon in the cowboy role that Mr. Bush played in his first term , prone to solving problems with stealth bombers rather than United Nations resolutions .
Judging from Mr. McCain ’s own positions , he might well revive a cold war with Russia and could start a hot war with Iran or North Korea .
In those three hot spots , Mr. McCain could constitute a dangerous gamble for this country :

Iran seems determined to continue its uranium enrichment and will be vexing for any president .
But Mr. Bush , under the influence of Bob Gates and Condoleezza Rice , has realized that the best hope is diplomacy and negotiation .
In contrast , Mr. McCain denounces Barack Obama ’s call for direct talks with Iranian leaders and speaks openly about the possibility of bombing Iranian nuclear sites .
I have worked really to avoid writing a headline like that , but watch this video where she basically says , " If you do n't support me , you 're going to hell . "
Incredible .
Sarah Palin 's message to undecided women is " Support me , or burn . "
Is she out of her mind ?
Has she mistaken Sean Hannity for America ?
Does she really think this is going to sway women who are on the fence ?
Does she think Madeline Albright is going to give her cover ?
Does she have any concern for her own career ?
But that is n't even the half .
McCain -- equally stupid -- has somehow gotten it in his head that Palin is an effective attack dog -- but she has no credibility , why would anyone believe her ?
She basically represent a profane , thuggish populism -- but nothing else .
George Bush had " compassionate conservativism " and " the ownership society . "
What else do these guys have ?
They 're just running on a kind of tribal neandrathalism -- nothing else .
UPDATE : What manner of Christianity is this ?
I can't talk because I 'm not exactly a believer , but seriously -- is claiming to know who will burn for eternity Christ - like ?
If you 're a serious Christian is n't this offensive ?
There 's something almost Taliban - like about it .
Imagine Barack Obama saying " there 's a special place in hell for black people do n't support other black people . "

The environment and interior ministries in Peru have announced plans to set up a special task force to safeguard forests and monitor the rivers in the Amazon basin .
The special force will be made up of around 3,000 officers to be known as the Environment Police .
The force will oversee 373,000 sq km of Amazon rainforest and patrol rivers to combat illegal logging and the unauthorised clearing of forest .
Peru ’s Environment Minister Antonio Brack said that until now the issue , “ a problem of organized crime , morality and oversight , ” has not been adequately addressed due to a severely understaffed police force running to just 240 men .
The Amazon rainforest covers almost a third of Peru and is highly prized by companies seeking to exploit the lax enforcement regime to harvest precious hard woods like mahogany .
For many years , ecologists have voiced deep concern over the rapid depletion of Amazon biodiversity and say that , at the present rate of deforestation , the basin , home to an incredible array of flora and fauna ( much yet to be discovered ) , could be harmed beyond repair in coming decades .

Less than a week ago , Sarah Palin was a little - known rookie governor of a remote state , a working mother of five with an infant son , a woman whose life has been forged in the splendor and isolation of the Alaskan wild .
Tonight , as she takes center stage at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Arizona Sen .
John McCain 's running mate is a world removed from that life and facing what 's likely to be her biggest challenge ever :
To introduce herself to a national audience still assessing who she is and what she believes .
Her campaign acknowledges that her speech is a crucial moment as she tries to gain control of the debate churning around her .
" I think it 's a unique opportunity , given the swirl , " McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Tuesday .
" It 's a chance for her to get out and tell her own story , and to get beyond some of the media fog of the past few days . "
Conscious of the stakes , Palin has been sequestered this week in her Minneapolis Hilton hotel suite working out the words that will form the public 's first impressions of her as the Republicans ' answer to the Democrats ' mantra of change .
Palin suddenly finds herself with a lot of explaining to do .
The 44 - year - old self - described hockey mom and heroine to social conservatives has reignited a debate about working mothers , not least by being forced to reveal that her unmarried 17 - year - old daughter Bristol is five months pregnant .
" This is uncharted territory , " said University of Minnesota political scientist Kathryn Pearson , a scholar of women in politics .
Palin faces other questions as well .
An anti-corruption crusader , she 's being investigated in Alaska .
Legislators there are examining allegations that Palin tried to have her ex-brother - in - law fired from the State Patrol .
The McCain campaign has used the revelation of her daughter 's pregnancy to burnish the Palin family 's credentials on opposing abortion , emphasizing the girl 's decision to keep the baby and marry the father .
But that message of personal responsibility might be harder to control amid the teenage flotsam on the Internet , including a MySpace page purportedly belonging to the young father and high school hockey star , identified as Levi Johnston , calling himself a " [ expletive ] redneck . "
News reports from Alaska Tuesday indicated Johnston is heading to St. Paul to join the Palin family .
His appearance could provide the convention a tabloid element McCain could do without .
In preparation for Palin 's speech , the McCain camp released a video highlighting the week 's most favorable reviews of Palin .
That was followed by a prime - time speech by former Sen.
Fred Thompson of Tennessee , forcefully rebutting criticism against her .
" She is from a small town , with small - town values , but that 's not good enough for those folks who are attacking her and her family , " said the former " Law & Order " star .
" Some Washington pundits and media big shots are in a frenzy over the selection of a woman who has actually governed rather than just talked a good game on the Sunday talk shows , " he said .
Then , adding a folksy touch , he added , " I can say without fear of contradiction that she is the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to properly field dress a moose ... with the possible exception of Teddy Roosevelt . "
Sexism over experience ?
While some pundits said that Palin had not been thoroughly vetted , McCain supporters have been reveling in what he promised would be an unconventional pick .
Like McCain , Palin is often described as an outsider who shook up the GOP in her ascent .
One of her first acts as governor was to use eBay to sell the lavish jet plane of her predecessor , fellow Republican Frank Murkowski .
During her first legislative session , she pushed an overhaul of the state 's ethics laws and a competitive process to construct a gas pipeline .
A hunter , snowmobiler , and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association , Palin has 80 percent approval ratings in Alaska .
But her pre-gubernatorial biography consists mainly of her two terms as City Council member and two terms as mayor of Wasilla ( population 9,200 ) , a suburb of Anchorage .
There she was able to take credit for cutting property taxes , an act made possible by the area 's rapid growth and rise in sales taxes .
As governor , she has vetoed millions of dollars in state capital projects , though Alaska , sitting atop a multibillion - dollar fund from its North Slope oil royalties , faces few of the fiscal problems of other states .
Many Republicans also smell a whiff of sexism in questions about Palin 's scant experience in national politics .
" The facts are that Sarah Palin has made more executive decisions as a mayor and governor than Barack Obama has made in his life , " said Republican National Committee Victory 2008 chairwoman Carly Fiorina .
" Because of Hillary Clinton 's historic run for the presidency and the treatment she received , American women are more highly tuned than ever to recognize and decry sexism in all its forms .
They will not tolerate sexist treatment of Governor Palin . "
Full - throttle attacks Pearson , the U of M professor , said Palin 's quest for higher office with a Down syndrome baby raises the issue of traditional family values and how women should balance family and work .
Even less clear is how Palin with play with swing voters .
" Moving from Hillary Clinton to Sarah Palin is a big jump ideologically , " said Carleton College political scientist Steven Schier .
Meanwhile , the Democrats put out a steady of unflattering revelations Tuesday .
Among them : Palin had employed a lobbying firm to secure almost $ 27 million in federal earmarks as mayor of Wasilla , which does not fit with McCain 's image as a pork - buster .
While some Republicans have watched the vetting process unfold with some trepidation , her core conservative backers remain enthusiastic .
" There are no scandals here , " said U.S. Rep.
Michele Bachmann , a Minnesota Republican who dined with Palin on a recent tour of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , where both support expanded oil and gas drilling .
" People say it was a gutsy move on McCain 's part , and I agree with that . "
It is urgent and essential that YOU contact your legislators in congress today to demand that they reject the bailout deal Henry Paulson has proposed .
Let them know approval of it will be as bad as , maybe worse than their approval of the Iraq war and you do n't want to see them screw up again .
They need to hear this from MILLIONS of Americans .
A handful of plutocratic corporatists created this economic disaster .
The Dem leadership seems to be ready to allow Bush to turn a disaster into law and furtherance of the disaster capitalism Naomi Klein has described .
It will take a massive bottom up wave of outraged demands to make it clear to the dems in congress and the purported new leader of the Democratic party , Barack Obama , that the Paulson plan has been outed as a plan to loot the American taxpayer and is totally unacceptable .
From Dailykos to Firedoglake to OpEdNews , TalkingPointsMemo to Paul Krugman ( No deal ) , Glen Greenwald , the Nation , MYDD , Atrios , Huffingtonpost , the voices of the left , representing millions , probably tens of millions of readers , are in agreement -- Paulson 's bailout proposal is NO DEAL and the frightened Democrats in congress better not spinelessly respond to the bogus warnings of disaster this time like they did in response to warnings of Iraqi WMDs .
The approach varies , but all basically say that the Bush admin is setting up a deal that has no accountability , that is a huge gift to Bush and friends .
Glen Greenwald and I brought up the spineless dem response to Iraq as an earlier example of the same cowed cooperation .
If Obama ever had a shot at showing he really is a force for change , rejecting the Paulson plan is an extraordinary opportunity to again ( like he rejected the Iraq war ) stand out as an independent thinker , apart from his party .
Here is where Barack can play a leadership role .
He IS running to be the new leader of the Democratic party .
If he tells the leaders in congress they 're making a huge mistake , he will be serving the middle class -- the people who Reid , Pelosi , Dodd , Schumer and friends are getting ready to saddle with such enormous debt .
An evening update : I went to a " peace event , " and had a few conversations .
A few people cited what I was just citing a few days ago , that the powers that be are " socializing debt and losses and privatizing profit . "
But I 've read a bit more , had more conversations and now I realize , it 's not socialism .
It 's fascism .
The corporations are n't being taken over by the government .
They are infecting the government and taking it over and that , my friends , is Mussolini type fascism , where the corporations run the government .
Here are excerpts from the progressive bloggers :
Glen Greenwald ,
The complete ( though ever - changing ) elite consensus over the financial collapse
... the fact that Democrats are on board with this scheme means absolutely nothing .
When it comes to things the Bush administration wants , Congressional Democrats do n't say " no " to anything .
They say " yes " to everything .
That 's what they 're for .
They say " yes " regardless of whether they understand what they 're endorsing .
They say " yes " regardless of whether they 've been told even the most basic facts about what they 're being told to endorse .
They say " yes " anytime doing so is politically less risky than saying " no , " which is essentially always and is certainly the case here .
They say " yes " whenever the political establishment -- meaning establishment media outlets and the corporate class that funds them -- wants them to say " yes , " which is the case here .
And they say " yes " with particular speed and eagerness when told to do so by the Serious Trans - Partisan Republican Experts like Hank Paulson and Ben Bernake ( or Mike McConnell and Robert Gates and , before them , Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell ) .
... regardless of whether this nationalization / bailout scheme is " necessary " or makes utilitarian sense , it is a crime of the highest order -- not a " crime " in the legal sense but in a more meaningful sense .
What is more intrinsically corrupt than allowing people to engage in high - reward / no - risk capitalism -- where they reap tens of millions of dollars and more every year while their reckless gambles are paying off only to then have the Government shift their losses to the citizenry at large once their schemes collapse ?
We 've retroactively created a win-only system where the wealthiest corporations and their shareholders are free to gamble for as long as they win and then force others who have no upside to pay for their losses .
Watching Wall St. erupt with an orgy of celebration on Friday after it became clear the Government ( i.e. , you ) would pay for their disaster was literally nauseating , as the very people who wreaked this havoc are now being rewarded .
More amazingly , they 're free to walk away without having to disgorge their gains ; at worst , they 're just " forced " to walk away without any further stake in the gamble .
How can these bailouts not at least be categorically conditioned on the disgorgement of ill - gotten gains from those who are responsible ?

Sexy Not Selling Well ?
Victoria 's
Secret is re-thinking super sexy image , going more feminine instead .
Feb. 29 , 2008  -- Victoria has a new secret :
You can be too sexy .
The racy lingerie chain , whose catalogue , store windows and hot runway shows have become a favorite for some men , intends to tone it down because disappointing 2007 sales indicate that it has become less of a favorite of women shoppers .
Sales at Victoria 's Secret fell 2 percent overall for 2007 , and 8 percent in the fourth quarter .
But it 's not easy to stop being sexy .
" It would be easier for Britney Spears to change her image than for Victoria Secret to change their image , " said advertising executive Jerry Della Femina .
" They are trying to disprove the old adage : sex sells , " he said , adding that he thinks it 's doubtful the store will succeed in shaking its hyper - sexy reputation .
Since the 1990s , the brand has become decidedly more racy .
In the latest catalogue , the word " sexy " is used more than 75 times , but the pictures alone tell the story .
Compare these 1996 images with the current Victoria 's Secret advertising campaign .
CEO Sharen
Turney says one problem is that the word " sexy " is used too much .
Turney said Victoria 's Secret wants to increase its level of sophistication .
" We will also reinvent the sleepwear business and focus on product quality , " she said .
The company is hoping to continue to focus on younger shoppers with its successful Pink line of lingerie and loungewear , created for college - age women .
Roy Raymond launched the chain in 1977 in San Francisco .
He said he was embarrassed trying to buy lingerie for his wife and hoped to provide a comfortable place for men to shop .
Initially Victoria was marketed as an aristocratic woman who lived in London .
ABC News Correspondent Andrea Canning asked women in New York yesterday if they thought Victoria has gotten too sexy .
" Who wears lingerie pajamas with high heel shoes ? " one woman responded .
Last month 's Super Bowl ad was may have been a preview of the more - clothed looks to expect .

• Durham charges with 2006 revenge killing over ice cream truck • Judge agreed to deal to save state cost of trial and appeals
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
After almost two years in prison , New Yorker Tremayne Durham could stand it no longer .
His craving for a decent bit of nosh was so intense that he agreed to pay a high price - a life sentence .
Durham , 33 , struck a plea bargain last month in which he was guaranteed a meal of KFC chicken , Popeye 's chicken , mashed potato , coleslaw , carrot cake and ice cream - in return for pleading guilty to murder .
As part of the deal , and after receiving a life sentence this week in court in Portland , Oregon , Durham will also get a second feast , this time on an Italian theme , with calzone , lasagne , pizza and ice cream .
The judge , Eric Bergstrom , is understood to have accepted the bargain because it would save the state of Oregon thousands of dollars in hosting a trial and possible subsequent appeals .
The murder happened in June 2006 as a revenge killing .
Durham travelled from New York City right across the country to confront an Oregon company from whom he had ordered a truck costing $ 18,000 .
He had been intending to enter the ice cream business , but when he changed his mind the company refused to give him a refund on the truck .
In a blaze of fury , he intended to collar the owner of the truck company but instead came across a former employee , Adam Calbreath , and shot him dead .
He will now have 30 years behind bars before he is given any chance of parole and the opportunity for another KFC feast .

Milky Way Road Trip

Explanation :
In search of planets and the summer Milky Way , astronomer Tunç Tezel took an evening road trip .
Last Saturday , after driving the winding road up Uludag , a mountain near Bursa , Turkey , he was rewarded by this beautiful skyview to the south .
Near the center , bright planet Jupiter outshines the city lights below and the stars of the constellation Sagittarius .
Above the mountain peaks , an arcing cloud bank seems to lead to the Milky Way 's own cloudy apparition plunging into the distant horizon .
In Turkish , Uludag means Great Mountain .
Uludag was known in ancient times as the Mysian Olympus .
Brightkite , one of the most popular location - based social networks , has announced an upcoming release of a Brightkite app for the iPhone .
This is a much anticipated announcement because the union of Brightkite 's services with the iPhone 's GPS feature appear to be a match made in digital heaven .
The auto geo-location feature will be the heart of the new app along with some new offerings called Place Snapping and Pick a Place .
Both options allow you to more easily pinpoint and identify where you are thanks to the built - in GPS service for the iPhone .
The ability to see nearby Brightkite users will also be much appreciated .
You can look at a map and see everyone in the area that you specify .
It can be anywhere from local vicinity to several miles .
Once you locate users you can even initiate communication and possibly arrange to meet somewhere .
There are a bunch of other cool things you 'll be able to do with this new app such as track your friends and their activity feeds and locations , search for people , places and posts .
You can also check your messages and post your photos and notes from your iPhone .
There 's a slew of apps for the iPhone , but this one has been heavily requested by Brightkite users , so there will be a large user base waiting to grab this one .
It seems to be a perfect pairing , so one wonders what 's taken so long to get this out on the street ( literally ) .

A new report suggests that with an aggressive replacement program , compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) could drastically cut global lighting demand and begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions immediately .
Fresh off the recent announcement that the European Union had banned incandescent light bulbs , the report , prepared by the Worldwatch Institute , suggests that replacing incandescents with compact fluorescents could reduce global lighting energy demand by 40 % .
By 2030 , these savings would add up to 16.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide — more than twice the amount released in the United States every year .
Accurate global data is not available for total CFL use , but strong growth in CFL production and sales can be seen worldwide .
Sales of CFLs in the U.S. alone rose by more than 300 percent early in the decade , growing to 397 million units in 2007 .
At the same time , the total number of CFLs in use worldwide nearly doubled from an estimated 1.8 billion to 3.5 billion in 2003 , the report found .
Of course , one of the most persistent criticisms of CFLs is that they contain dangerous levels of mercury , and without aggressive recycling programs that keep CFLs out of the landfill , the potential environmental impact could be devastating .
Several large recycling initiatives have been launched including from the two large retailers Home Depot and Ikea .
But the report also points out that for consumers who rely on coal - fired electricity , one of the largest sources of mercury emissions , the increased energy efficiency of these bulbs means that over its lifetime a CFL - even if it is broken or thrown away - will release significantly less mercury into the environment than an incandescent bulb would .
A global campaign would need to be an aggressive one , especially in the developing world , where the incentive to install the more expensive compact fluorescent bulbs is primarily economic .
Some organizations have begun educating consumers in developing countries about CFLs , focusing largely on the money - saving benefits of installing energy efficient light bulbs , but the area seems ripe for more .
What do you think ?
How can simple and relatively inexpensive technologies like these be more quickly diffused and introduced in places where they can have the greatest and most immediate impact ?

Once upon a time , the ultimate put - down to a bright spark was to say , ' well , if you 're so smart , how come you 're not so rich ? '.
Wall Street Crash 2.0 has rather undermined this ploy , by making it clear that an awful lot of very rich folks were anything but smart .
It turns out that we were unduly dazzled by the Masters of the Universe , but we had to wait until they had vaporised the US economy before getting wise to the fact .
Actually , this was just a special case of a more general human weakness - our tendency to lose all capacity for critical thought when confronted by great wealth or power .
This ' aphrodisiac effect ' seems to be ubiquitous .
One saw it , for example , in the way leggy females used to throw themselves at Henry Kissinger , a stumpy troglodyte who just happened to be US Secretary of State .
And we see it in the way even hardened hacks go weak when offered an audience with Bill Gates , Warren Buffett or even , God help us , Steve Ballmer , chief of Microsoft .
Ballmer was in town last week , graciously granting audiences and genially talking through his hat .
Yet his every word was reverentially chronicled .
The BBC's Rory Cellan - Jones reported Ballmer 's metaphorical comparison of Microsoft ( annual revenues , $ 60 bn ; 90,000 staff ) as ' David ' in comparison to Google 's ' Goliath ' ( annual revenues $ 20 bn ; 19,000 staff ) .
Commenting on Google 's just - launched Android platform for mobile phones , Ballmer declared that 'an open - source solution would not be attractive to phone manufacturers , and predicted that Windows mobile phones would stay ahead of BlackBerry , Apple 's iPhone and Google Android in the smartphone market ' .
And he went on to say that Windows Vista had been ' the most popular operating system that Microsoft had ever introduced ' .
This hooey was conscientiously relayed by Cellan - Jones , who was too polite to ask why , if Vista is such a success , Ballmer is to unveil its successor , Windows 7 , to the Microsoft developers ' conference at the end of this month .
Microsoft is such a powerful company that it never seems to occur to reporters that its leaders might be fantasising .
It 's the aphrodisiac effect again .
But Microsoft has become an embarrassing shadow of its former self .
Once it was a lean , mean , agile and ruthless .
Now it is a middle - aged , bloated , sluggish company having difficulty keeping up with internet - driven change .
Watching it trying to play catch - up with Google , social networking and ' cloud computing ' is a bit like watching one 's maiden aunt trying to be cool on Facebook .
The company 's response to cloud computing - the provision of email , word - processing , spreadsheets and presentation software via the browser - is especially interesting .
From the outset , this presented a clear threat to Microsoft 's core businesses - the Windows operating system and the Office software package which generate the bulk of its revenues .
If people could do their word - processing using a free service provided by Google , say , why would they bother paying for Microsoft Word ?
So Ballmer &
Co pooh - pooed cloud computing as unreliable , insecure and unduly dependent on network connectivity .
But then it became clear that cloud computing was rather popular with punters , who liked the idea of being able to access their documents from anywhere .
So the Microsoft strategy changed .
What was needed - its executives explained - was a blend of Microsoft software running on the user 's PC , plus a cloudlike service run by Microsoft .
And so Windows Live was born .
All of this was reported deadpan by reporters - apparently hypnotised by the belief that Microsoft is too big to make silly mistakes : the aphrodisiac effect again .
But then last week it transpired that Microsoft has concluded that cloud computing is the Coming Thing after all .
During his whistle - stop visit to London , Mr Ballmer announced that the company would unveil its own ' cloud operating system ' at the forthcoming developer conference .
' We need a new operating system designed for the cloud , ' he said , ' and we will introduce one in about four weeks , we 'll even have a name to give you by then .
But let 's just call it for the purposes of today " Windows Cloud " .
The last thing we want is for somebody else to obsolete us ; if we 're gonna get obsoleted , we better do it to ourselves . '
This is not a company that knows what it 's doing .
Ballmer and Gates were once masters of their universe .
But nothing lasts forever .
Ask Lehman Brothers .
As anyone within shouting distance of David Letterman knows , two weeks ago Republican presidential nominee Sen.
John McCain ditched the " Late Show " host in order , the senator said , to help fix the financial crisis .
To the delight of many viewers , and Democrats , Letterman did not take this slight well .
This week , the New York Post reported that the two former friends could have an on - air make - up session next week , when McCain is in New York to debate Barack Obama for the last time .
But in tonight 's " Late Show , " Letterman once again spouted off about the feud .
And in the process of scornfully recounting it -- " war hero , " " economy , " " rush back to Washington , " " spent the night in New York , " " Katie Couric , " yadda , yadda -- he revealed details about the negotiations to bring McCain back that ... well , it 's hard to imagine that the McCain campaign will like this .
Here are excerpts of Letterman 's remarks that we bring to you exclusively .
And , FYI , when he mentions " that big - headed kid , " he means MSNBC's Keith Olbermann :
" So now , in an attempt to save his campaign , they ’re talking about coming back .
You see what I ’m saying ?
So we said , ' Sure , we would love you to come back . '
And even on the phone , he said , ' I ’ll bring … Sarah . '
But they ’re being squirrely .
Politicians can be squirrely .
Because we have a date picked .
We do this show every afternoon at 5:30 .
He wants to do the show at 5 .
So one –- we have no guarantee he ’s going to show up , period .
And we ’ve kind of already rearranged our schedule on his behalf to save the economy , right ?
By getting that big - headed kid in here to talk about the politics .
You know what I ’m driving at ?
I just do n’t know if we can trust him .
And by the way , I do n’t need to remind you that the road to the White House runs right through here . "
The full transcript of Letterman 's rant is after the jump .

An original , creative layout goes a long way to improving the user experience of a website , although not letting your creativity get in the way of usability is important .
As usual , we have to put ourselves in the users ’ shoes :
What do we want them to see first ?
How will your message be best communicated ?
We have to ask these questions before we start designing , because the layout will shape the rest of the design .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Well , the following websites have some quite… unusual layouts .
They are n’t necessarily perfect ; still , browse through them , and maybe , just maybe , your creative genius will be sparked .
Original Web Layouts
Beurre & Sel
This website is just beautiful .
The automatic slideshow plays in the background , with the main navigation bar at the top .
As you scroll down , the navigation shrinks but remains fixed at the top .
Below is a colorful list of the different cookies the company makes , but these also serve as buttons in a submenu .
When you click on a flavor , information overlaps this submenu , allowing you to click through the assortment of cookie flavors .
The navigation bar at the top and the submenu are confined to the middle column of a three - column grid , maintaining the user ’s focus at the center .
Hackery , Maths & Design
As the page loads , a fun 3D line animation starts to fill the screen .
The arrows indicate movement and fluidity and encourage the user to scroll down toward the content .
The content below is laid out in a three column grid with two main columns and one smaller side bar .
However , it does n’t feel boxy and constrained but has a more open feel — this is due to the ample space given and the use of rounded corners .
The layout of this site is comfortable for the user .
The Drawing Room I love this layout , simple yet so visually interesting .
The studio ’s work is displayed in diamond shapes of different sizes that fit together .
The center diamond is the nameplate , which is n’t too prominent and so does n’t detract from the work .
As you hover over a diamond , it fills with a description of the work .
This single - page website has an original and clean layout that it easy to use .
We Love Noise Luke Finch ’s portfolio has a fun and friendly layout .
The work seems to be haphazardly scattered , breaking away from too clean and predictable an approach .
The transitions tell you a bit about the projects , and you can navigate using the arrows .
The little heart in the top - left corner is the navigation for the whole website , it swivels into an “ i ” on the home page .
When viewing a project , you can exit by hovering over the heart .
Ende
This layout is dynamic .
Upon loading , it greets you with a quirky photograph and prompts you to scroll down , where the navigation appears and eventually affixes to the top .
I really like the transparent navigation bar , which opens the page up a little , revealing the content underneath .
The content is scattered around the page , although the website does have structure ; each section is set off by a different background color .
The projects are prominently displayed in a three - column grid , but the section for the team members breaks away from the grid and uses the space in an interesting way .
Edward Carvalho Monaghan
How ’s about some color ?
This portfolio website has some serious personality , and the work is loud and lively as it moves about .
Most effective is the consistency in style .
The website coheres as a complete work , representing the designer while supporting the individual portfolio pieces — which is precisely what such a website should do .
The color palette is incorporated in the nameplate , and the flashing animation brings energy to the website .
Huys
This site has an original take on layout with the right side of the page acting like a kind of letterhead , providing all the necessary information like who they are and what they do .
The left side of the page scrolls vertically and resembles the layout of the windows of the condominiums they build .
Once you click , you are directed to a more blog - style layout which is easy to navigate .
KathArt KathArt has a great video layout .
The personality just about oozes from this simple yet highly effective design , as you meet the members of this team .
The team members are introduced as they ’re working , as though you ’re in the office with them !
The navigation as a timeline is clever because you can track the progress of the video easily .
Wacom Wacom targets a wide audience of both professional and non-professional creatives with its website .
The layout is an integral part of this and creates a user - friendly experience .
The navigation on the left minimizes when hovered over , and it shows the various categories available .
The user is in control and can choose which products to look at ; they are not coerced or subjected to a sales pitch .
The layout of the home page is simple and guides the user to the product that best suits their needs .
I like the subtle hand - drawn elements that accompany the products .
Amsterdam Dance Event
The layout here really helps to showcase the attitude and spirit of this event .
The navigation runs down the left side , becoming a reference point across the website .
A slideshow of strong , visually stimulating images rotates , with teasers for the event ’s festival , playground and conference .
This is an effective way to engage users .
As you scroll down the page , the content below slides over the slideshow , bringing the submenu from the bottom to the top .
Each section of the website has a banner that runs across the screen , making for a visually appealing introduction to that section .
The rest of the articles are laid out in a grid .
The rows in the grid do n’t line up perfectly ; each column starts slightly lower than the last — another small yet effective visual device .
Cropp Cropp has a big and bold personality , and the layout showcases it .
As you hover over an image , the image pixelates beyond recognition , which grabs your attention .
The navigation bar at the top is consistent across all pages , and the home page is basically a loud , visual representation of the options in the navigation .
The layout captures the idea of pixellation , and all photographs and videos are laid out in blocks , like a pixelated image .
Neue Yorke
The grid layout for Davy Rudolph ’s portfolio is simple and minimalist — pretty straightforward and natural to the user .
Each page has only two colors , unique to that page .
When you click on one of his projects , the showcase takes precedence , and the main navigation panel disappears .
What I like about this approach to a portfolio website is that , while it has personality , the personality does not detract from the designer ’s work .
Juliana Bicycles Juliana has a rather unusual and innovative design for a bicycle store .
Upon loading , a beautiful photograph fills the screen with richness and warmth .
The website is laid out in four sections , which are kept hidden behind the navigation icon .
The design seems to have a more feminine touch , and the typography is bold and strong with a bit of flair .
The 3 - D hover effect on the bicycles is a nice touch as well .
Esquire
The layout here is simple , clean and accessible .
Esquire ’s identity is a monochromatic black and white .
The article teasers are in color , drawing the reader ’s eye .
The hover effect is also simple , with a description below the teaser caption .
The navigation is in the middle of the website , functioning much like a newspaper , where the reader becomes intrigued by the content above the fold .
The images , color and brief headlines grab the user ’s attention .
Institut Choiseul Intitut Choiseul has an attractive block layout that fits together like a puzzle .
The layered look with the slabs of color help to establish the identity .
Further down the page , the layout transitions to a more traditional grid , although each story is in a different - sized block , creating an interesting and dynamic aesthetic .
The different blocks of color set off the different parts of the website , making it easy to navigate and read .
The website has a sophisticated and refined quality , suited to its purpose .
Award Award celebrates creativity , and its neutral design aesthetic sets the stage for the designers ’ work effectively .
The grid layout does n’t have any trim or frills that would detract or clash with any of the designs being featured , but the interesting hover effect has a nice pixelated drop - shadow .
The navigation is fixed to the left of the page , and the search and filter functions are fixed at the top .
This navigational arrangement is best suited to showcase the contents of the website .
Harry ’s
The experience of this website is lovely .
The designers make great use of the grid , which has a classic appeal appropriate to the target market .
The open , clean , structured design makes for a pleasant user experience .
Being a website that sells men ’s razors , Harry ’s features images that are sophisticated and manly without feeling brutish .
The King ’s of Summer This Tumblr website conveys the charm of this movie with the layout of photographs , the occasional GIF , and quirky lines from the movie .
It has a structured yet not uniform layout that is fun to scroll through , and the handwritten type for the title helps to establish a scrap - book feel .
The unique arrangement of content blocks creates an interesting visual , with pictures and GIFs overlapping every now and then , guiding the user ’s eye around the website .
A movie website should convey the complex personality of a feature - length film , and although I have n’t seen this movie , I definitely have an idea of its personality .
World Baking Day
The layout of World Baking Day requires interaction of the user right from the get - go .
As the page loads , you are prompted by an animated hand - drawn arrow to choose your baking level .
If you choose to view all recipes across all levels , instead of one at a time , then you ’ll be greeted with an entire screen full of delicious , mouth - watering recipes .
The layout treats food like a work of art , showcasing photographs of the baked goods on most of the page and redirecting you to another page for the recipe itself .
The recipes are neatly laid out in three columns : ingredients on the left , instructions in the middle , and information about the contributor on the right .
Paper & Paint
The layout and interaction of Paper & Paint is original .
As you navigate , the website almost snaps from section to section , and the layout and structure are appropriate to the product .
The navigation is hidden and appears when you select a color scheme .
The images are prominently displayed as you scroll through , and the top of each subsequent image teases the user , inviting them to scroll to see more .
I love the way the images move inward as you scroll down the page , making for an interesting visual dynamic .
Another nice interactive feature is “ painting ” the wall different colors using your mouse , which adds a bit of fun .
Newsweek
This layout is anything but conventional for a news website .
The home page of Newsweek is simple yet bold , with the photograph for the lead story set as the background image .
The small red tabs throughout signpost the website , indicating the types of stories being featured .
The layout is broken up into sections that do n’t all follow the same grid .
The “ Newsmakers ” section makes use of a standard grid but breaks away from the conventional table look , with some of the images appearing as circles , instead of the usual squares .
As you scroll down , the same pattern for each day ’s news is laid out in this way , which creates a consistency that is easily understood by the reader .
Abby Putinski
An original approach to a portfolio site , Abby Putinski seperates herself as a creative illustrator and graphic designer .
Upon loading , an animated introductory window falls onto the screen inviting the user to explore her work .
Once you close the window you move around a map compiling all her adventures .
This site does n’t really have a layout and is free and open with no clear boudaries , making it so interesting to navigate .
When you click on a work , the image in a postcard - type frame falls onto the page , reiterating the idea of adventure and travel .
The navigation is always available and fixed to the top in the same illustrative aestheic .
Baumastisch
This tight grid layout is a nice way to showcase a portfolio of work .
When you hover over each piece , the title is given but when you click on a work , a “ front page ” for the work appears .
This page provides all the necessary information about the project , such the date , the client , the desinger ’s role etc. which is consistent throughout all the projects .
You have to click through a slideshow that fills the screen to view the project .
I think it ’s a really effective way to showcase work .
Norwich University of the Arts
The strong photography and beautiful images do a great job of showcasing the artistic talent at this university right from the start .
The background image on the home page tells a story , drawing the user in .
I like the layout of the navigation to the side ; it is different but works well and does n’t overpower the image or layout .
The labels are all yellow , creating a consistent visual identity .
The drop - down menus take prominence when a category is clicked , which the layout accommodates well .
The logo also caught my attention , with its neat Helvetica lettering .
It is n’t overpowering , but the tilt of the “ N ” adds something different , a little spunk .
Our first impression is established by the large background image , but then an arrow invites us to scroll down to view the various stories , which are featured as large thumbnails with captions .
The rest of the page is fairly conventional .
Trask Industries Trask Industries is a viral website for the new X - Men movie .
The layout is simple but effective .
It is divided into three parts , with the navigation sidebar fixed to the left , a video in the center , and the main content scrolling vertically on the right .
The video used here works well to create anticipation for the movie .
The animated hover effect in the navigation icons is a nice touch .
The point of the website is clear , as demonstrated by the prominence given to the video .
The transitions are rather nifty , as the content sections slide out and back in .
Also , try resizing your browser to see how the layout changes — the navigation is hidden , with the content visible as you scroll down the page .
Adam Hartwig
This website is really interesting for its seeming lack of layout .
It is created with Flash - like animated typography that continues to autoplay throughout the website .
Even without clicking through the various categories , the user gets an idea of the designer ’s work through the animated slideshow .
The animation is consistent , and the illustrations are cute and do a great job of illustrating the designer ’s creative personality .
Contad Everything here — the CSS , HTML , JavaScript and SVGs — animates as you scroll .
It ’s crazy !
The bright colors are stimulating , and the design is made up of intricate illustrations .
The downside is that the website was developed only for desktop computers with a mouse , and it works only in Chrome .
National Academy Museum
This layout has a layered feel , exhibiting a modular approach .
The different elements on the page seem to overlap one another ; for instance , the navigation bar stops about three fourths of the way across the page .
The photograph lies below the navigation , and the buttons and captions are written in colored blocks , adding to the modular layering aesthetic .
I also like the drop - shadow effect with the drop - down menus in the navigation , which creates an interesting depth .
Andrew McCarthy Andrew McCarthy ’s portfolio has a unique layout .
Bands of color wash the page , and more information about the designer is revealed as you scroll down .
A clever stop-motion graphic of a pixelated feline runs in place as you scroll .
I love the movement created by this simple idea .
Incidentally , the website also relies on the interaction of the user .
Mikael Edwards Animation , when used wisely , can really contribute to the functionality of a website .
Mikael Edwards uses animation that is both visually appealing and functional .
We ’re designing for the Web , right ?
There is no need to squash everything onto the page or wrap text around images .
Why not include interactive animation and make it fun ?
This idea works well here as a hover effect .
The blue dot represents the cursor ; as you move the mouse in , the image shifts , making space for the text .
Designer ’s Friend
Not quite what you were expecting from a designer ’s website , right ?
Designer ’s Friend looks like the HTML code behind the website itself .
Everything you need to know is right there in the code , with the tags acting as headings .
The “ Tip of the Day ” box is a wonderful device that guides the user through the website .
Hatched
The layout for Hatched is anchored by the navigation and sections that run wide across the screen , creating a boldness and openness .
The responsive navigation is interesting .
On a smaller screen , it could look clumsy ; but here , the navigation , including the social network buttons , is kept to one menu button .
Institute for Emerging Issues
This website has nice consistent transitions , with the circles popping up as the page loads .
The website is well structured , and the circles create a friendly counterpoint to the statistics below .
The captions in the “ Challenges ” section look like speech bubbles , adding to the friendly atmosphere .
The hover effect on these captions is visually appealing as well as functional .
The user is not bombarded with statistics because the numbers are hidden and revealed only when hovered over .
Into The Arctic
The layout of Into the Arctic engages the user and incorporates their interaction .
The video in the background captivates the user and illustrates its cause .
The style of the navigation is different — as you hover over it , it folds out with more information , like a pamphlet .
The typography is also alluring , and the pull quotes are particularly strong .
The design of the website is just really well executed .
John Jacob
This portfolio has horizontal scrolling , which is very unusual .
When you click to view a work , it unfolds to the middle of the screen , with an enlarged view and a short explanation of the work .
The descriptions and list of work are short and concise ; you do n’t feel like you ’re constantly being redirected to other pages .
I really like the navigation , clustered in the top - left corner with the designer ’s social network links in the bottom - right corner , framing the page .
The designer uses the space effectively , and the swivel effect is interesting .
Impress
The white space here is refreshing and creates an openness and friendliness .
White space allows the user to read and navigate comfortably and to use the website effectively .
The hover effect is different ; it is as though half the paper folds up .
When clicked , the button folds over like a book to reveal more information .
Postable Postable has a cute concept ; it sends beautifully designed thank - you cards by email for you , and the design of the website has a real snail - mail look .
The design and layout throughout play an integral part in communicating the concept .
The background has a real paper texture , with a top border resembling an old - school envelope .
The authentic real - life feel is a lovely touch on the Web form , as though you ’re scribbling your information on a sheet in a notebook .
National LGBT Museum
This website has a new take on single - page layouts .
The scrolling mechanism here is really cool ; the page splits in half , with the two halves scrolling in different directions , creating a dynamic effect .
The sections are in different colors and snap together as you scroll .
Lucas Nikitczuk
I really like the layout of Lucas Nikitczuk ’s portfolio because it showcases his skill .
It gets straight to the point , with a short biography of the designer and his work right there on the home page .
The circles create a friendly and fluid aesthetic .
The paint spills in the background add to this and create an openness and freeness to the website ’s identity .
The navigation is pretty simple and works the same throughout the website .
Another nice touch is that you can navigate with the arrow keys , which is helpful for laptop users .
Conclusion
The layout is the foundation of your website and a crucial part of any creative endeavor .
Consider the user and how they will interact with the website .
Will they likely be viewing your website only on a mobile device ?
How would that affect the layout ?
I hope you ’ve gleaned some inspiration to tackle some layout designs yourself !

9 -11 Truther speaks truth to power in New North tunnel
Apparently Red Square is not the only place where people can combine chalk and free speech rights .
Georgetown now has its own 9 - 11 conspiracy theorist , and he or she has taken to the brick walls of the tunnel under New North .
Hopefully the theorist will hide in the darkness of this tunnel instead of finding 9 - 11 Truth Movement members to “ educate ” us and expose government lies as we stroll through Red Square .
THE NEW ID CARD Anti-forgery measures include colour changes when tilted , embedded ultra-violet design and other features visible only from certain angles
The first identity cards from the government 's controversial national scheme have been unveiled .
The biometric card will be issued from November , initially to non-EU students and marriage visa holders .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the cards would allow people to " easily and securely prove their identity " .
Critics say the roll - out to some immigrants is a " softening up " exercise for the introduction of identity cards for everyone .
The card will also include information on holders ' immigration status .
" We want to be able to prevent those here illegally from benefiting from the privileges of Britain , " she said .
Employers and colleges want to be confident people are who they say they are , she said , and immigration and police officers want to verify identity and detect abuse .
" We all want to see our borders more secure , and human trafficking , organised immigration crime , illegal working and benefit fraud tackled .
ID cards for foreign nationals , in locking people to one identity , will deliver in all these areas , " she added .
The UK Border Agency will begin issuing the biometric cards to the two categories of foreign nationals who officials say are most at risk of abusing immigration rules - students and those on a marriage or civil partnership visa .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Both types of migrants will be told they must have the new card when they ask to extend their stay in the country .
The cards partly replace a paper - based system of immigration stamps - but will now include the individual 's name and picture , their nationality , immigration status and two fingerprints .
Immigration officials will store the details centrally and , in time , they are expected to be merged into the proposed national identity register .
The card cannot be issued to people from most parts of Europe because they have the right to move freely in and out of the UK .
The Conservatives oppose the UK 's identity card scheme but say they support the use of biometric information in immigration documents .
FOREIGN NATIONAL ID CARDS Students and marriage applicants first Others to follow over coming decade 50,000 cards by next April Costs £ 311 m to 2018 Visa charges to cover costs " The Government are kidding themselves if they think ID cards for foreign nationals will protect against illegal immigration or terrorism - since they do n't apply to those coming here for less than three months , " said shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve .
Liberal Democrat shadow home secretary Chris Huhne said identity cards " remained a grotesque intrusion on the liberty of the British people " and the scheme " will prove to be a laminated Poll Tax " .
" The government is using vulnerable members of our society , like foreign nationals who do not have the vote , as guinea pigs for a deeply unpopular and unworkable policy , " he said .
SNP Home Affairs spokesman Pete Wishart MP said his party had opposed ID cards from the outset but the government 's " abysmal record on data protection " was reason enough to cancel them .
He said the government looked " absurd " for pushing ahead with such a costly project .
The Home Office is trying to salami slice the population to get this scheme going in any way they can
Phil Booth , No2ID
" These cards will not make our communities more secure , they will not reduce the terrorist threat and they will not make public services more efficient , " said Mr Wishart .
Phil Booth , head of the national No2ID campaign group , attacked the roll - out of the cards as a " softening - up exercise " .
" The Home Office is trying to salami slice the population to get this scheme going in any way they can , " Mr Booth told the BBC .
" Once they get some people to take the card it becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
" The volume of foreign nationals involved is minuscule so it wo n't do anything to tackle illegal immigration . "
But Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK said the cards should be supported .
" We welcome the introduction of ID cards for foreign nationals as part of wider measures to tackle illegal immigration , " he said .
" These reforms are essential if we are to restore order to our immigration system as the public certainly wish to see . "

Send Files via FTP Using PHP
Sending files to a server via FTP is an essential ability of any web developer or designer .
Of course , we all use glossy FTP clients like WS_FTP and FireFTP , but what about FTP automation ?
You can use PHP to FTP files from one server to another .
Let me show you how .
The PHP
$ connection = ftp_connect ( $ server ) ; $ login = ftp_login ( $ connection , $ ftp_user_name , $ ftp_user_pass ) ; if ( !$ connection || ! $ login ) { die ( ' Connection attempt failed !' ) ; } $ upload = ftp_put ( $ connection , $ dest , $ source , $ mode ) ; if ( ! $upload ) { echo ' FTP upload failed !' ; } ftp_close ( $ connection ) ;
Obviously , the first task is to connect to the other server .
Once the connection is created , you pass the login credentials .
Once you 're logged in , you can use the ftp_put ( ) function to send the file .
That 's it !
What would you use this for ?
Well , you could set up a cron to create a database backup and send it to an offsite server .

Just when you thought it could n't get any worse , Sarah Palin told KUSA , an NBC affiliate that the Vice President is ' in charge of the United States Senate , ' and can ' make a lot of good policy changes ' .
The question was in response to a question sent
to the network by a third grader at a local elementary school .
" They are in charge of the United States Senate , so if they want to , they can get in there with the Senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family , " said Palin .

Oh dear .
The United States Constitutions states that the Vice President has a very limited role in terms of exercising power , and can't usually vote in the Senate : The Vice President of the United States shall be President of
the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided .
Palin's notion that she could stride into the Senate and do some ' good ol ' reforming ' is constitutionally unfounded , and another indication that she is incredibly unqualified to run for office in any way .
The malaise on Wall Street simply will not lift .
Despite cheaper oil , a stronger dollar and looser credit , stock investors on Wednesday could not shake their fears about the consequences of an economy that many believe is already in a recession .
Worries that slowing growth will pummel the corporate sector sent the Dow Jones industrials down more than 500 points for the day .
The broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index fell 6.1 percent , a decline that in any other financial environment would be considered extraordinary .
Instead , it counted only as the worst loss since last Wednesday , when the S.& P. plunged 9 percent .
The slump overshadowed a milestone for oil prices , which tumbled to $ 66.75 a barrel , a 16 - month low , and strong gains in the American dollar against foreign currencies .
In the stock market , the bloodletting began after corporate bellwethers from a range of sectors across the economy  including Boeing , Merck and Wachovia  warned of a bleak outlook for the remainder of the year as they reported disappointing earnings for last quarter .
DENVER -- Police detonated a suspicious backpack found in downtown Denver Monday morning .
...
Bomb technicians determined the backpack was safe , but detonated the device as a precaution at about 3:45 a.m .
http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/17285415/detail.html
The backpack was determined to be safe , so I presume it had someone ’s stuff in it .
Then they blew it up anyway .
Why were they not of trying to locate the owner ?
Maybe the backpack was stolen and the police ’s responsibility should be to return the stolen merchandise to its rightful owner .
This reminds of a King of the Hill episode where the TSA blows up a turkey that Hank is taking to relatives for Thanksgiving .
Whistleblower breaks 15 - year silence to allege McCain hid wife 's drug abuse Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Cindy McCain 's addiction to prescription painkillers emerged into public view 14 years ago with a well - orchestrated PR campaign designed to preserve her husband 's political future .
Aside from a lengthy contemporary investigation from Phoenix 's alternative weekly and occasional mentions since then , the addiction back - story -- including ample questions about what John McCain knew , when he knew it and questions over whether he was complicit in the cover - up -- has gone largely untold .
Until now .
Tom Gosinski , a former employee of the medical - aid charity Cindy McCain used as personal supplier of Percocet and Vicodin , is speaking out publicly for the first time .
On Wednesday , Gosinski sat down with RAW STORY and other outlets to tell his story and distribute copies of his personal journal from his time with the American Voluntary Medical Team in the last half of 1992 , where he voiced ever more acute concerns and frustrations over McCain 's drug use and its impact on her mood and job performance .
" My journal was n't to trash Cindy or anything , " he says .
" My journal was kept because I came in contact with so many people .
It was a way of keeping an ongoing biography of all the people I met , so I could refer back to it . "
He says he can't buy the official McCain camp line that Cindy 's drug abuse was kept from her husband , he saw and heard too much for any of their stories to make sense -- like the time Cindy was allegedly taken to the hospital after an overdose and John rushed in to berate the doctors and nurses there before moving Cindy to their secluded Sedona ranch .
Then there were the Hensley family interventions and the fact that Cindy 's drug abuse came to be something of an open secret among employees of the charity .
" I have always wondered why John McCain has done nothing to fix the problem , " Gosinski wrote on July 27 , 1992 .
" He must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it . "
Less than a month later , Gosinski was clearer about McCain 's knowledge of his wife 's problem : " John McCain has known about it for some time , " he wrote on Aug. 14 .
In confessing to her drug abuse in orchestrated interviews with friendly journalists in 1994 , Cindy McCain said she had kept her problem hidden from her husband and sought treatment at some point in 1992 .
Questions remain about the validity of those assurances , and Gosinski's contemporary journal shares a story suggesting John McCain knew of his wife 's problem earlier than anyone has suggested .
In an Oct. 5 , 1992 , entry , Gosinski writes about a story that circulated just a few days after Cindy McCain 's parents , Jim and Smitty Hensley , confronted her about her drug abuse .
Last Friday , late in the afternoon , Miss Jeri ( Cindy's aunt ) was visiting with Dalton Smith , the Hensley 's Pilot about Jim and Smitty confronting Cindy about her drug problem .
During the conversation Dalton mentioned an incident which took place a couple of years ago -- Cindy had taken too many pills and had been rushed to a hospital near their home on Oak Creek .
John McCain was rushed to the hospital and rather than helping Cindy obtain help he had her dismissed from the hospital and taken to the Cabin .
I had assumed the entire family knew of the incident as Kathy Walker had mentioned it to me many months ago but come to find out Jeri and the Hensleys knew nothing of it .
Needless to say it was very painful for Miss Jeri to find this out and she was very concerned about what the news of this occurrence would do to Jim and Smitty .
Whatever the outcome , I doubt that Jim and Smitty will ever be able to respect John McCain again Even now , more than a decade - and - a - half later , Gosinski says he 's not convinced that Cindy has cleaned herself up .
Asked if her behavior in public and on the campaign trail this year mirrored his experiences in 1992 , Gosinski agreed .
" I 'm probably looking too closely , [ but ] I would say yes , " he said in an interview .
But I 've got a biased opinion on that . "
From July 2 , 1992 , until Gosinski's termination the following January , he grows increasingly agitated at McCain 's behavior and becomes convinced she is using the charity more for self - promotion than as a means to aid the poor .
" I have mixed emotions about what I believe should happen to AVMT , " Gosinski wrote in one of his last journal entries in December 1992 .
" It does not deserve to continue to exist as it is currently being operated -- it is a very expensive toy for a very disturbed lady .
Cindy has use ( sic ) the organization for self - promotion and as a source for the drugs to which she is addicted . "
Gosinski , who believes he was fired because he had learned too much about McCain 's drug abuse , says he has remained quiet out of fear of retribution from John McCain or his political allies .
After he was fired from AVMT , Gosinski , a lifelong Republican , says he was " black balled " from future political jobs .
Furthermore , McCain and his Keating Five lawyer John Dowd orchestrated an extortion investigation aimed at squashing a wrongful termination lawsuit Gosinski had filed .
" I think everybody knows that John McCain has a volatile ... temper , " Gosinski said Wednesday .
" And I do n't know how they can mess with my life .
They certainly tried to mess with it 15 years ago by making me unemployable and ruining my opportunity for a job in Republican politics in Arizona . "
By the time the wrongful termination suit was filed and the investigation launched , Gosinski already had been meeting for nearly a year with the Drug Enforcement Agency to detail Cindy McCain 's use of the charity as her own personal pain - killer depot .
Essentially , Gosinski could not have been blackmailing the rich , powerful and politically connected McCain family because he already had told the authorities what he knew .
Gosinski was fired after he complained about prescriptions Cindy McCain had ordered in his name , and he approached the DEA with a what if  scenario asking whether he could be held liable for not coming forward with information about the drug thefts .
Ironically , in their pursuit of a designated political enemy , McCain and his allies ended up setting in motion the process that would eventually expose Cindy McCain 's drug abuse .
" [ Neither ] my lawsuit , nor anything I did with the DEA , made the matters public , " Gosinski says .
" When John Dowd and John McCain tried to intimidate me " it put it into the public sphere because Dowd " pretty much directed the Maricopa County Attorney 's office " on how to pursue an extortion case .
The records of that case became a part of the public record and contained Cindy McCains admission of a drug problem while revealing the DEA was investigating her charity .
Several hundred pages of documents from the extortion investigation and Gosinski's lawsuit also were distributed Wednesday , along with excerpts from his journal .
No extortion charges ever were filed , and Gosinski says he eventually gave up on the lawsuit when he realized he was up against McCain 's relentless and well - funded Washington legal team .
Included in the documents are interviews with several McCain and Hensley associates and employees of the AVMT .
Smith , the Hensley pilot who mentioned Cindy 's alleged early 1990s overdose , clammed up when the Mariposa County attorney turned his questions toward her drug problem .
I asked Mr. Smith if he learned , from any source , that Cindy McCain may have had , or does have , a drug dependency .
Mr. Smith became upset and said , " I am not willing to discuss that . "
He said , " I did not come here [ to ] talk about Cindy , I came here to talk about Tom . " ...
He advised he will not answer the question and would rather have an attorney present if we were going to be talking about drugs .
When he started working for McCain 's medical charity , Gosinski says he quickly became friends with the McCains and the Hensleys -- Cindy 's family whose Hensley & Co. beer distributorship made them all incredibly wealthy .
Gosinski says he accompanied Cindy McCain to Bangladesh , where she decided to adopt her daughter Bridget ( he confirmed that the story of Mother Theresa 's involvement was completely fabricated ) , and he used to accompany McCain and her children on outings to the mall or the swimming pool .
The journal excerpts released Wednesday , though , portray a deep sense of pity on Gosinski 's part for the life McCain had made for herself , concern for the effect her addiction was having on her children and a growing disillusionment with her political persona .
" During my short tenure at AVMT , I have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate All American family , " he writes on July 27 , 1992 .
" In reality , I am working for a very sad , lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a US Senator has driven her to : distance herself from friends ; cover feelings of despair with drugs ; and replace lonely moments with self - indulgences . "
Several journal entries also mention McCain 's daughter Meghan , who was 7 when the journal was written .
Now 23 , Meghan blogs about pop culture and her father 's campaign and has recently written a children 's book .
Gosinski details a conversation with Jeri Johnson , Cindy McCain 's aunt , regarding Cindy 's nanny , Diane , in a July 28 , 1992 entry .
Diane voice concerns regarding Cindy 's use of drugs and the effect it is having on the kids .
Diane told Jeri that Meghan recently told her to " fuck off " after trying to discipline her .
She also told Jeri that she is concerned that Cindy is giving the kids drugs which unnecessarily sedate them .
I hope that is not happening .
Concerns that Cindy McCain is unnecessarily drugging her children appear again in a July 31 entry -- " Cari ( Cindy 's adopted daughter ) told the three that she fears Cindy gives the kids prescription drugs they do not need , " Gosinski wrote .
As summer turns toward autumn , the charity becomes an outgrowth of John McCain 's senate re-election campaign , with travel and scheduling coordinated by aides on his campaign and senate staffs , Gosinski writes .
" I have never been so aware of the amount of insincerity behind a political campaign as I am now with John McCain 's reelection campaign , " he writes on Sept. 3 , 1992 .
" Everything Cindy McCain does is politically motivated and driven by the almighty ' photo op . '
I am convinced that Cindy McCain could give a rat's ass about the citizens of the third world countries or the victims of natural disasters . "
The following videos were posted to YouTube by Open Left 's Matt Stoller , who spoke to Gosinski along with RAW STORY Wednesday :
Written in 2005 :
" First , I want to take notice of D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , the battle which set the stage for the defeat of fascism in Europe .
( Interestingly , the battle which turned the tide in the Pacific War occurred at roughly the same date , June 3 - 7 , off Midway Island , in 1942 .
U.S. planes destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers and even more importantly , the cream of Japanese naval aviation .
But that 's another story ) .
" This wait has almost always meant ' never . ' "
As we consider a day 61 years ago , it calls to mind the broad sweep of history , and various cyclical patterns of history -- those posited by Nicolai Kondratieff and Ralph Nelson Elliott .
For starters , let 's consider 1893 , 1932 and 1974 .
Interestingly enough , those bottoms of financial panics or depressions seem to operate on about 40 - year cycles .
If there is indeed a pattern there , we should get a humdinger of a depression around 2012 .
Kondratieff posited that an economic cycle of debt buildup and repudiation repeats every 50 - 60 years .
Given the enormous borrowing binge the world has gleefully embarked on during the past five years ( M - 3 expansion of around $ 2 trillion by some estimates , American homeowners tapping their equity to the tune of $ 1.6 trillion in new debt , Federal budget deficits on the order of $ 400 billion annually , etc. ) , it 's difficult to dismiss Kondratieff 's fundamental insight as entirely wrongheaded .
Many in his camp believe we are entering thephase which will culminate in a collapse or repudiation of all that debt .
It 's something to consider , given one irrefutable fact : no economy runs up forever in a straight line of unending growth . , says Robert Brusca , president of Fact and Opinion Research , Theseseem to suggest a severe and long - lasting downturn in the world economy is close at hand , based on the fundamental insight that the enormous mountains of debt which have been accumulated must now be repudiated in order to set up the next cycle of growth .
There is another eerily repetitive pattern of change which has occurred on 40 - year cycles in the past century : one of social tumult and change .
Consider the explosion of artistic freedoms in film and music of the 1920s , and the concurrent lifting of social constraints , and then note the similarity to the 1960s ( ending either with the disasterous Rolling Stones concert at Altamont in 1969 , or Watergate in 1974 , depending on your taste in history ) .
If the 40 - year pattern holds , we are in the midst of , or at least entering , a similar decade of social turmoil .
We could posit that the cycle began on Septemebr 11 , 2001 , ushering in a period not of artistic expression but of new constraints and paranoia .
The rise of the religious right as a political force could be seen as the penumbra of the 1960s , just as the rise of a radically reactionary Islam could be seen as a reverse analog of the big- power Communist threat the U.S. faced in the 60s .
Where the 60s were all about questioning the conformity which had dominated social and political life in the 1950s , this decade seems to be about reining in the chaos , both outside the national borders and within .
A newethic has replaced the paternalistic state ideal of the 1960s , and each new excess in the popular culture ( hideously violent Playstation games , crudely misogynist hip - hop music is matched by a shrill new constraint ( banning medical marijuana , stem cells , etc . ) .
Even more troubling , the divide between the wealthy elites and the middle class is widening ; as the economy stumbles toward breakdown , the wealth of the nation has flowed to the top 5 % of citizenry .
As the average Schmoe relentlessly taps his home equity to support a lavishly foolish " upper - middle class lifestyle " filled with the spiritual rot of gimcrack distractions and useless toys , ( ) the real wealth of the nation aggregates in the elites ' hands .
As tax rates for the wealthiest plummet to all - time lows , medical insurance becomes a luxury for everyone not independently wealthy or employed by a government agency .
The nation careens down the path of a fiscal policy of endless deficit , transferring whatever wealth remains in the hands on the young to the elderly via unsustainably expensive Medicare benefits , and yet the citizenry are strangely complacent , as if their internal compasses have been scrambled .
The events of the decade ahead may provide a lodestone for the dazed American citizenry ; as things fall apart , they may find their internal compasses re-set , and the distractions of consumerism less mesmerizing .
Can it happen too soon ?
I think not .

We've fixed the elections and cooked all of the books .
We 've militarized the police and suspended habeas corpus .
We 've got secret continuity of government plans to bypass the normal government system altogether .

In my twenties , I was a truly budget backpacker .
I traveled with few plans other than a need to be somewhere by a certain date , usually months ahead — perhaps to start a job , or to catch a plane to another continent .
I carried everything I needed on my back in one pack , tied my hair back unattractively each day and did n’t bother too much if my clothes got dirty .
Getting a cheap night to stay somewhere was important ; buying a new handbag was not .

Now that I ’ve hit my thirties , I ’m almost afraid to say , I ’ve noticed my travel habits changing a little bit .
These days I ’ll pay a bit more for a private bathroom and a room of my own often opting for a cheap hotel , rather than lining up with everyone else ; but I do n’t mind if this is a private room in a hostel .
Sometimes I travel with a suitcase rather than a backpack .
And I tend to wear clothes that I would n’t be ashamed to be seen in at my local supermarket late on a Friday night .
OMG : I ’m Now a Flashpacker
What I did n’t know until recently is that I ’ve grown up from a backpacker to a flashpacker .
Heck , this word is even defined in Wikipedia :
A flashpacker shares some of the characteristics of a backpacker : a sense of independence , no fixed itinerary and relatively long periods of travel to more exotic and far - flung destinations .
Whereas backpacking is traditionally associated with budget travel and destinations that are relatively cheap , flashpacking has an association of more disposable income while traveling and has been defined simply as backpacking with a bigger budget .
Does this sound like you , too ?
If you ’re flashpacker , or even just a wannabe , then I ’ve got some tips on successful flashpacking for you .
5 Ways to Be a Successful Flashpacker
# 1 : Do n’t Forget Your Roots
Nearly all flashpackers used to be backpackers .
Do n’t forget this carefree attitude to travel you have honed , and if things do n’t go according to plan on your travels , just remember that it ’s all about the journey , not the destination .
Do n’t find yourself complaining about a too - hard or too - soft pillow in your hotel — a decade ago you did n’t use a pillow at all .
# 2 : Do n’t Overplan Your Flashpacking Trip
Sometimes flashpackers are squeezing a vacation into annual leave from a job or some other tight timeframe , and the temptation then is to plan your itinerary minute - for - minute to make the most of your relatively short available time .
Do n’t .
You did n’t when you backpacked and you do n’t need to now .
Sure , you might need to book more accommodation or transport ahead of time , if you do n’t have the luxury of being able to wait around a few days until the next ferry departs , but make sure you do n’t fill every minute of your days .
Remember that finding daily activities spontaneously is one of the best ways to ensure you have a memorable trip .
# 3 : Do n’t Feel Guilty for Taking Shortcuts
On your flashpacking trip , you ’re bound to come across backpackers who are spending a year traveling across Europe and can’t believe you ’re about to board a budget flight from Berlin to Barcelona when they ’re going to do it overland .
But you ’ve done this before and do n’t need to feel guilty that you ’re taking a shortcut .
It all depends on the goal of your trip and the time you have available , and if you want to see a couple of cities in detail without dealing with long bus and train rides in between , that ’s absolutely alright .
# 4 : Do n’t Be Ashamed to Splash Out
Flashpackers typically have a much bigger budget than backpackers , usually because they ’re older , in more stable jobs and have had a chance to save some money after those young years of penniless travels got them home broke .
This usually means that while you do n’t have so much time at your disposal , you do have more liquidity , and you deserve to enjoy this .
If that means that your dream is to buy up big on expensive ( but truly delicious ) Belgian chocolates from a corner chocolatier in Brussels , do it ( yep , that ’s my dream ) .
If you want to try each of the most expensive types of beer at a brewery in Munich , go for it .
# 5 : Do n’t Forget the Technology ( and the Chargers )
If you ca n’t travel without your laptop , iPod , digital camera and cell phone — and probably a bunch more technology — you have probably graduated from backpacker to flashpacker .
Whether it ’s to stay in touch with home ( or even work ) , or to be able to transmit text and pictures of your adventures as you go , most flashpackers can be found right next to the backpackers in an internet café , but they ’re more likely to be logging on with their own laptop .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
# 6 : Do n’t Forget to Give Something Back
Perhaps the best thing about being a flashpacker is that now when you see some injustice or inequity in your traveling world , you have both the cash and the ideas to actually help out a bit .
Now that I ’ve got some cash to spare , for example , I buy the latest Big Issue magazine from every homeless vendor I see selling it .
I still do n’t give to beggars in the street in Asia , but I ’m savvier about researching how I can help them and donating funds to worthwhile NGOs .
And volunteer vacations are much higher on my list now since I can finally afford some of the fees they need to stay sustainable .
Are You A Flashpacker , Too ?
Flashpackers represent a new generation of travelers , and the definition is still evolving .
Do you consider that you ’re a flashpacker ?
I ’d love to hear about the other characteristics of being a flashpacker , so let us know in the comments .
Bill would cut weatherization help WASHINGTON 
A bipartisan group of senators from cold - weather states on Thursday criticized plans to cut the federal program helping low - income families make their homes more energy efficient .
While winter heating costs have soared , support for the federal assistance program has dramatically declined .
Last February , President Bush proposed eliminating the program altogether .
An Energy Department spending bill before the Senate would provide $ 201 million for the fiscal year beginning in October , $ 26 million less than this year and $ 40 million less than Congress supplied in 2007 .
With the upcoming winter expected to have record high heating costs , this is not the time to reduce a program that helps poor people save in their heating bills , the senators argued in a letter to the leaders of the Appropriations Committee considering the legislation .
The committee advanced the spending measure Thursday without increasing the energy - related assistance program , but senators are expected to push for additional funds when the bill is considered by the full Senate .
" I hear from Mainers throughout my state that they are panicked about how they are going to heat their homes this winter and deal with the skyrocketing price of home heating oil , " said Sen.
Susan Collins , R - Maine , one of the 13 senators who wrote the letter .
Wholesale fuel oil costs have increased from $ 2.57 a gallon last December to more than $ 4 a gallon , according to the Energy Information Administration .
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association , which represents state agencies that help low - income families meet energy costs , estimates that this winter heating costs for people using fuel oil will soar to nearly $ 2,600 on average - or about $ 1,100 more than just two year ago .
Homes using natural gas can be expected to see a 20 percent increase to an average of $ 978 .
Funding for the weatherization program should be restored at least to last year 's levels " to help address the crisis facing low income families as they confront continually increasing energy costs , " the senators wrote .
Besides Collins , the letter was signed by : _ Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , Sherrod Brown of Ohio , Ted Kennedy and John Kerry , both of Massachusetts , Charles Schumer of New York , and Robert Menendez of New Jersey .
_ Republican Sens. Norm Coleman of Minnesota , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , Olympia Snowe of Maine and John Sununu of New Hampshire .

On the same day that Barack Obama shattered fundraising records and won the endorsement of Colin Powell , John McCain held a pair of lackluster rallies in Ohio , a battleground state that the Arizona Republican insists he must win if he is to capture the White House on Nov. 4 .
This morning 's crowd at Otterbein College , near the capital of Columbus , covered an indoor basketball court , but the adjoining court was left empty .
McCain 's afternoon event , at a half - filled convention center in Toledo , seemed even more desultory .
The crowd barely responded at times to his applause lines .
McCain gave them little cause for excitement .
He delivered the same stump speech both times , almost word for word , with little emotion .
He rushed through both so quickly that he left both events ahead of schedule .
Perhaps he was upset about who did n’t attend : Joe the Plumber .
McCain first mentioned Samuel J. Wurzelbacher , the Ohio man ’s real name , during the final presidential debate last Wednesday .
McCain hailed him 21 times that night , and has praised him dozens of times since in interviews and speeches .
Wurzelbacher , as the world now knows , had approached Obama to complain that he wanted to buy the two - man plumbing company where he worked , but feared paying higher taxes .
Obama , who had been canvassing Wurzelbacher ’s street in Holland , Ohio , outside Toledo , responded that wealthier people pay higher tax rates under the U.S. system to help “ spread the wealth . ”
McCain seized on the comment to lambaste his Democratic opponent as a leftist -- and to paint Wurzelbacher as a typical working man who would face higher taxes under Obama .
Never mind that independent reviews concluded that Wurzelbacher actually would receive a tax cut under Obama 's plan .
On Friday , McCain aide Brooke Buchanan raised the stakes when she told reporters that the candidate had telephoned Wurzelbacher that morning and “ would love it ” if he would campaign at McCain ’s side Sunday .
So where was Wurzelbacher today ?
Alas , gone for the bright lights of the big city .
He took his son and his father to New York City and appeared Saturday night as a guest on “ Huckabee , ” the Fox News talk show hosted by former GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee .
Not to worry .
McCain is scheduled to campaign again in the Toledo area at midweek , and aides said the invitation still stands .

Reflecting concerns about the economy , crude oil prices fell 2.7 percent , to $ 86.59 a barrel .
OPEC , the oil - producing cartel , on Thursday called an emergency meeting for Nov. 18 to consider cutting an output in an attempt to arrest the 41 percent drop in oil prices in the last three months .
Asian markets also reacted strongly to the turmoil .
In Japan , the Nikkei 225 index was down 10 percent on Friday morning , after having plunged 9 percent on Wednesday .
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 7 percent and the market in Singapore was down 6.8 percent .
What has prompted the late - day sell - offs recently is a subject of intense debate and conjecture , even among market professionals , who also have been unnerved by the free fall of the week .
Some attribute it to mutual funds ’ waiting until midafternoon to execute sell orders from a growing number of investors who are cutting their exposure or bailing out of the market altogether .
Others say that hedge funds , which have leveraged returns in recent years by using borrowed money , are having to sell holdings to raise collateral against their borrowings .
Still others say computerized trading , which has grown significantly in recent years , often kicks in later in the day , when certain thresholds are breached .
But whatever the reasons for the late - day plunges , what is driving the market down is a lack of confidence by investors , who are skeptical that the many measures taken by the government to rescue the financial system will work .
Moreover , they worry that the government ’s trotting out a new initiative every day or two is a sign that maybe the situation is worse than many thought .
Some who have held on until now are starting to sell .
Since the start of the year , investors have removed more than $ 81 billion from stock mutual funds , with nearly 40 percent of that coming in the last six weeks , according to AMG Data Services .
SHENZHEN , China -- A Chinese company best - known for making cellphone batteries says it is on the verge of launching the country 's first mass - produced electric car and may also have lined up its first large purchase order .
In an interview , BYD Co. Chairman Wang Chuanfu said the car , known as the F3DM , will be on sale in China by the end of November , pending government approval .
Mr. Wang declined to provide a sales target or price range for the new electric car but said in Beijing earlier this year that the vehicle could carry ...
Religious believers sometimes struggle to explain exactly how miracles work .
This is understandable .
Explaining something that does n't exist can be tough .
Fortunately , I found two Christians who were at least willing to try amidst a sad story from Florida .
Maybe we can learn something about miracles together .
The driver of a tractor - trailer , talking on his cell phone while driving like virtually every bad driver I see on the road these days ( can you tell this is a pet peeve ? ) , collided with a school bus .
One child died , but passers - by were able to rescue others before they burned to death .
I 'm sure you can see where this is going .
After all , you have heard similar scenarios more times than you can count .
According to Jim Yancey , Marion County Superintendent of Schools , this incident was both a tragedy and a miracle .
Evidently , this is how miracles work .
An innocent child dies and others survive , and that 's a miracle .
Really ?
What do you think the parents of the dead 13 - year - old girl thought when they read your quote in the local paper , Superintendent ?
Do you suppose they would agree with you that this was a miracle , or might they have a different perspective ?
But Yancey was not to be alone in his superstitions .
One of the rescuers , James Horton , a father himself , had this to say :
The Lord put us all there for that reason — to save those children .
But not to save the sweet , innocent , 13 - year - old little girl who died .
God must have put her near the flames for a reason just like he made the truck driver use his cell phone at the perfect moment .
As The Stubborn Curmudgeon pointed out ( update : link no longer active ) , I cannot help wondering if this father of three believes that his god deliberately killed this innocent child for some mysterious reason .
If so , would this make a psychopath or just another misguided Christian ?
Religious believers often seem oblivious to how this sort of thought process leads to victim blaming and massive guilt for the family of the deceased .
Every time I read about something like this in the news , my heart goes out to the family of the deceased .
I wish they did not have to endure hearing about the " miracle " of other children surviving .
Senator Conroy has since last year 's election victory remained tight - lipped on the specifics of his $ 44.2 million policy but , grilled by a Senate Estimates committee this week , he said the Government was looking at forcing ISPs to implement a two - tiered filtering system .
The first tier , which internet users would not be able to opt out of , would block all " illegal material " .
Senator Conroy has previously said Australians would be able to opt out of any filters to obtain " uncensored access to the internet " .
The second tier , which is optional , would filter out content deemed inappropriate for children , such as pornography .
But neither filter tier will be capable of censoring content obtained over peer - to - peer file sharing networks , which account for an estimated 60 per cent of internet traffic .
Senator Conroy said Britain , Sweden , Canada and New Zealand had all implemented similar filtering systems .
However , in all cases , participation by ISPs was optional and the filtering was limited in scope to predominantly child pornography .
Colin Jacobs , chair of the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia said : " I 'm not exaggerating when I say that this model involves more technical interference in the internet infrastructure than what is attempted in Iran , one of the most repressive and regressive censorship regimes in the world . "
Critics of the ISP - level filtering plan say software filters installed by the user on their PC , which are already provided by the government for free at netalert .
gov.au , are more than adequate .
Mark Newton , an engineer at Internode , has heavily criticised the Government and its filtering policy on the Whirlpool broadband community forum , going as far as saying it would enable child abuse .
He said the plan would inevitably result in significant false positives and degrade internet speeds tremendously .
Those views were subsequently widely reported by technology media and blogs .
Although Newton identified himself as an employee of Internode - as Whirlpool 's rules stipulate - he always maintained his views were personal opinions and not necessarily shared by the company .
On Tuesday , a policy advisor for Senator Conroy , Belinda Dennett , wrote an email to Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) board member Carolyn Dalton in an attempt to pressure Newton into reining in his dissent .
" In your capacity as a board member of the IIA I would like to express my serious concern that a IIA member would be sending out this sort of message .
I have also advised [ IIA chief executive ]
Peter Coroneos of my disappointment in this sort of irresponsible behaviour , " the email , read .
It is understood the email was accompanied by a phone call demanding that the message be passed on to senior Internode management .
Newton said he found the bullying " outrageous " and Senator Conroy was " misusing his influence as a Commonwealth Minister to intimidate a private dissenting citizen into silencing his political views " .
A spokesman for Senator Conroy said Newton 's accusation that the Government was promoting child abuse was " disappointing and irresponsible " .
He said the purpose of the email was " to establish whether Mr Newton 's views were consistent with the IIA position " .
Ironically , Senator Conroy has himself accused critics of his filtering policy of supporting child pornography - including Greens Senator Scott Ludlam in Senate Estimates this week .
ACMA released a report in July detailing the results of laboratory tests of six unnamed ISP - level filters .
Only one of the filters tested resulted in an acceptable speed reduction of 2 per cent or less .
The others caused drops in speed between 21 per cent and 86 per cent .
The tests showed the more accurate the filtering , the bigger the impact on network performance .
However , none of the filters were completely accurate .
They allowed access to between 2 per cent and 13 per cent of material that should have been blocked , and wrongly blocked between 1.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent of websites that should have been allowed .
" Why would you want to damage the performance and utility of the internet and not actually keep the bad stuff out anyway , " said John Lindsay , carrier relations manager at Internode .
In Senate Estimates , Senator Ludlam expressed concern that all sorts of politically - sensitive material could be added to the block list and otherwise legitimate sites - for example , YouTube - could be rendered inaccessible based on content published by users .
" The black list ... can become very grey depending on how expansive the list becomes - euthanasia material , politically related material , material about anorexia .
There is a lot of distasteful stuff on the internet , " he said .
Despite this , the Government - which distanced itself from the tests by saying they were initiated by the previous government - is pressing ahead with live trials of the filtering system and will shortly seek expressions of interest from ISPs keen to participate .
Earlier today Google released the Android 0.9 SDK r1 Beta , boasting of a pile of API updates and a visual refresh that moves it one solid step closer to actually , you know , showing up on a phone .
A long changelog and a few screenshots are great , but we 've fired up the SDK 's emulator for a guided tour of Android 's salient features .
Click to view0:02 : Main menu is contained in a drawer that slides from the bottom of the screen 0:08 : Multiple home screens can be flipped with touch gestures , a la the iPhone 0:20 : Icons can be dragged from the main menu to build customized home screens .
Dragging to the menu drawer trashes the home screen shortcut 0:38 : Dialer screen , followed by the call behavior .
Calls can continue in the background , and all functions that do n't require data transfer can work concurrently ( This is currently a software regulation , as 3g networks should theoretically allow for simultaneous voice and data usage ) .
0:53 : Ongoing calls and other notifications can be accessed by dragging the taskbar down .
1:20 : Browser displays Gizmodo .
Rendering is quite good , page navigation is a fairly intuitive rehash of current touch - control schemes .
It 's not terrible good at guessing column widths during double - tap zooming , but seems very usable .
Preview magnification feature is useful for smaller screens or text - heavy pages .
2:22 : " Tabbed " browsing feature lays out a grid of pages , with previews 2:45 : Google Maps app .
As you can see , this is among the more polished apps , and will feel familiar to anyone who has used Google Maps on the desktop or mobile devices .
3:30 : Google Maps Street View .
4:00 : Home screen include widgets ( Google Search , a clock and a picture frame are the only ones for now ) that can be dragged around the home screen (s ) .
4:23 : The music apps relies on a panel of icons ( a recurring theme in Android ) 4:30 : Message composition is unremarkable , but there is no sign of an on - screen keyboard at the moment .
This could be a customization catered the the first round of Android phones , at least one of which will have a slide - out keyboard .
5:12 : The camera naturally does n't work in the emulator , but there are currently very few options in its menus .
5:50 : Wallpaper switching .
This is one of the few areas where Android excels aesthetically .
Wallpaper scrolls as home screens are switched , but at a slower rate that the icons .
This creates a convincing illusion of depth .
6:11 : The home screen can also be modified via the system menu , where you can choose to add applications , widgets and shortcuts , as well as change the wallpaper .
It 's hard to pass judgment on Android in the condition it 's in .
What 's there is impressive , but there are so many glaring omissions , at least from a consumer standpoint .
There is a fantastic system for managing ongoing calls and system messages ( via the pull - down taskbar ) but no apps to take advantage of it .
Email and IM would suit such a configuration beautifully , but neither is included in this release .
And seriously , where is the calendar ?
The organizer ?
A video app ?
Youtube support ?
Sure , these things could be left to the developer community , but Google already has messaging , email , video and calendar services , so it 's reasonable to expect that they be included by default in Android .
Before a public release , Android should at least possess a feature set comparable to your average candy bar phone , courtesy of Google , so that the eager open - source development community can devote their effort to creating new , innovative apps and modifications for the OS .
Objections aside , the progress is promising .
In terms of usability , Android is much easier to navigate and customize than virtually all other mobile solutions .
With a few more apps , Android will be a clear choice over Windows Mobile , skinned or not .
You can download the SDK and play with the emulator yourself , if you want .
Just a word of warning , though — explaining to your family or significant other that you 're testing an emulated prerelease of an upcoming mobile OS is about as hard as it sounds .

The collaspe of Argentina and it's similarities to EXACTLY what 's happening to us
Someone shared this video with me .
I sat and watched with my eyes wide open .
Do what you want with this but in case you are unaware of the severity of our economic crisis , we are taking the same path as the Argentineans .
Yes we do have our every day lives to be concerned with but I always believe in being one step ahead and do many of you .
This is a 59 min video .
Watch in segments or when you have 59 min to spare .
I did n't have that kind of time so , I watched in 15 min. increments .
When you get to the site , scroll down a bit until you see the video and click on it .
Do n't forget National Day of protest on Nov. 22 for those who can go .
I 'm buying my megaphone soon .
Looking on ebay or craigslist , must protect my money .

At Brightcove I 've spent some time creating faster Flex 3 SDKs by merging some changes from the Flex 4 SDK .
It 's not a lot of changes , but it makes a fairly significant improvement in compilation speeds in Flex Builder .
I find for small changes in a large project , there 's about a 20 % 25 % speedup , but this varies greatly depending on what you 're doing .
I 'll give some performance numbers below and explain exactly what changed , but first I 'll show you how you can use these changes yourself .
Using the Changes
Here are the files you 'll need , with one zip file for Flex 3.0 , Flex 3.1 , and Flex 3.2 :
fast -3.0.zip
fast - 3.1.zip
fast -3.2.zip
Inside of the zip files you 'll find jars that should overwrite existing files in FLEX_SDK / lib , where FLEX_SDK is the location of the Flex SDK you are using .
If you are unsure of this location and you are using Flex Builder , you can find it in the " Properties " for your project .
Select " Flex Compiler " , then select " Configure Flex SDKs " .
If you " Edit " the SDK listed , you 'll see it 's location .
There 's another zip file that you can try out , which contains some more changes from Flex 4 .
Given the number of changes , I 've labeled it experimental .
There 's only a Flex 3.0 version :
fast - experimental -3.0.zip
Performance Numbers
For fast - 3.0.zip , I ran some tests on the building of the media module at Brightcove :
Changing the main MXML file : from 13 seconds to 8 seconds
Changing two UI classes : from 41.5 seconds to 34.5 seconds
Changing a ModelLocator : from 47 seconds to 39 seconds
Why I Did This
Now that I 've given out the files and shown the performance , I 'm sure I 've lost half of the readers as they go update their SDK .
But for those of you still here , I 'll explain things more .
As you may have seen in a recent post of mine about ways to speed up Flex Builder , I 've been working on strategies at Brightcove for increasing everybody 's ability to work quickly on Flex and AS3 projects .
As a part of this , I 've been very interested in the Flex 4 performance changes .
I talked to Paul Reilly and Pete Farland at Adobe a bit about my work , and they thought what I was planning to do made sense .
Paul also suggested that I try to use Flex 4 directly .
I did try this , but I ran some issues .
It also just would n't work out to have everyone use the pre-alpha of Flex 4 on a large codebase at Brightcove .
But I still wanted to use some of the performance changes .
That 's not a problem when a project is open source , thankfully !
I used svn to merge some of the changes back to Flex 3 , and we 've been using these changes at Brightcove since then .
More on the Changes
Here 's are the diffs for fast - 3.1.zip and fast - experimental - 3.0.zip .
I 'd have to remake the changes to get the diffs for fast - 3.0.zip , but I believe they 're identical to fast - 3.1.diff and fast - 3.2.diff .
fast - 3.1.diff
fast -3.2.diff

The 3.0.1.1092 version was used for the Flex 3.0 changes because 3.0.0.477 does n't have the asc compiler .
There are barely any changes between the two versions of the compiler .
The experimental version had a lot of merge conflicts that I 'm not positive I merged correctly .
I 've been using it myself a lot , and it 's definitely faster .
I can't wait to see the speed of Flex 4 , which has a lot more changes that I did n't try to merge .

McCain ’s unwillingness to make eye contact with Obama through the debate seems to be getting picked up by a lot of observers .
Here ’s an interesting exchange on the subject between Chris Matthews and the Post ’s Eugene Robinson …
Here ’s one comment we got from TPM Reader EO …
As a psychotherapist and someone who treats people with anger management problems , we typically try to educate people that anger is often an emotion that masks other emotions .
I think it ’s significant that McCain did n’t make much , if any , eye contact because it suggests one of two things to me ; he does n’t want to make eye contact because he is prone to losing control of his emotions if he deals directly with the other person , or , his anger masks fear and the eye contact may increase or substantiate the fear .
I noticed him doing the same thing in the Republican primary debates .
The perception observers are likely to have is that he is unwilling to acknowledge the opponent ’s legitimacy and / or is contemptuous of the opponent .
And here ’s another note from TPM Reader TB .
I guess I ’m really not sure quite how to characterize it …
I think people really are missing the point about McCain ’s failure to look at Obama .
McCain was afraid of Obama .
It was really clear–look at how much McCain blinked in the first half hour .
I study monkey behavior–low ranking monkeys do n’t look at high ranking monkeys .
In a physical , instinctive sense , Obama owned McCain tonight and I think the instant polling reflects that .
So McCain may have given away his status as a low - ranking monkey .
I ’d never even considered monkey rank .
Late Monkey Science Update :
In case anyone ’s wondering , I looked up TPM Reader TB ’s page at the University he teaches at .
And no doubt about it , he appears to be a genuine monkey scientist , or to be more specific a researcher on social cognition and behavior in primates .
I ’d link to his page .
But readers remain anonymous , save for their initials , until they tell us otherwise .
Consider all of McCain ’s and Palin ’s past ties to anti-Semites , this is especially telling .
A few months after the group mocked Jews ’ “ crocodile tears ” over the Holocaust never happening again , McCain attends group ’s dinner .
McCain is a brash , arrogant , hot head .
He likes to be his own man , and does n’t subscribe to the mainstream ’s standards of decency , respect for civil and human rights .
That ’s why he voted against the Martin Luther King holiday .
That ’s why he attended this despicable organization ’s dinner only months after it mocked Jews over the Holocaust .
And that ’s why he lied about disassociating himself from this group in 1984 , when he did no such thing .
There ’s a larger pattern emerging here of McCain as someone who is reckless and always looking to pick a fight – and as someone who likes to surround himself with people who pick fights first , and talk later .
He ’s a gambler at heart , a playboy really , and all that it entails .
And while the playboy / gambler / hot head is fun for the movies , it ’s dangerous in a president taking over during dangerous times .
This is n’t a Clint Eastwood movie .
From TPM Election Central :
Republicans embraced the last stimulus plan , and they might very well embrace another .
But their long - held position has been that the best way to give the economy a boost is through tax cuts at the corporate and individual level .
They also express concerns that some money funneled to the states would be spent inefficiently , for example on programs that would generate few jobs .
The Democratic proposal would provide tax relief in some form for families , the goal being to step up their spending , as the rebates were intended to do earlier this year .
In addition , unemployment insurance benefits would be extended beyond 39 weeks and the food stamp program would expand .
Both would channel money to people who would probably spend every penny to meet their needs .
But the biggest chunk , perhaps as much as $ 150 billion , would go to states and cities to sustain their everyday spending .
Image  We have to prop up consumption ,  said Representative Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .

The rationale for another stimulus package , particularly one that helps the states and cities , is compelling for many economists .
The nearly $ 1 trillion that Congress and the Federal Reserve are making available to the financial system is intended to make credit more available .
That props up the supply side .
But to make the economy grow , or stop contracting , demand is required .
Consumers , businesses and governments need confidence to spend their own incomes or tap credit from a repaired financial system .
In the case of states and cities whose revenue is shrinking , bigger federal subsidies would ease the need to cut so many jobs and services to balance their budgets .
“ That is the whole rationale for giving money to the states and cities , ” said Alan S. Blinder , a Princeton University economist who served in the Clinton administration and also as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .
“ Deciding not to cut spending is the functional equivalent of spending more .
Either one leads to more spending than you otherwise would have . ”
State and local spending accounts for 12 percent of nation ’s economic activity .
There is a widespread contraction in their spending now because of lower revenue and laws that require them to balance their budgets .
US vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin faces possible censure today with the conclusion of an investigation into allegations that she committed a serious abuse of power by sacking the head of the Alaskan police force when he refused to become involved in a family feud .
Republicans last night failed in suppressing the report after Alaska 's supreme court refused to shut down the investigation .
Palin is expected to be criticised for failing to cooperate with the inquiry into the Troopergate affair , so called because she is alleged to have dismissed the state 's public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan , after he refused to sack her former brother - in - law , a state trooper .
It is unclear whether the investigation will find that Palin , the governor of Alaska , is guilty of firing Monegan because he refused to move against the trooper , Mike Wooten , or whether it will accept her argument that she had other reasons to dismiss him .
Palin 's husband , Todd , attempted to shoulder much of the blame for the pressure Monegan faced after refusing to fire Wooten ; in a statement to the investigation on Wednesday he said : " I make no apologies for wanting to protect my family and wanting to publicise the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge . "
He said he had never instructed Monegan to sack Wooten , but his statement , made public by his lawyer , conceded : " We had a lot of conversations about a guy who threatened my family and verbally assaulted my daughter . "
His wife , he said , had finally told him to " drop it " .
Stephen Branchflower , a former prosecutor who is conducting the investigation on behalf of the Alaskan state legislature , is known to have examined emails from Mrs Palin to Monegan , including one complaining that " this trooper is still out on the street , in fact he 's been promoted " .
Some Palin aides are also expected to face censure .
They appear to have been unaware that Monegan 's Department of Public Safety ( DPS ) routinely recorded incoming telephone calls , with the result that Branchflower was able to obtain recordings of a number of conversations .
He is also thought to have obtained details of emails sent between Palin , her husband and a number of senior officials in her administration .
The investigation has focused on events leading up to Monegan 's sacking last July .
Wooten and the governor 's younger sister , Molly McCann , had been through an acrimonious divorce and child custody dispute , during which members of Palin 's family had accused him of a range of crimes and disciplinary offences .
In March 2006 Wooten was found guilty of a number of offences , including threatening behaviour and shooting his stepson with a Taser stun - gun on a low power setting .
He was briefly suspended and given a final written warning , but after Palin came into office nine months later , her aides are alleged to have repeatedly urged Monegan to reopen the case .
Monegan says his refusal to do so cost him his job .
Branchflower will present his conclusions today at a meeting of Alaskan state senators and representatives .
ADAMS TOWNSHIP , Pa. 
It is safe to say that last week was the first time the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania had ever filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a pole dancing instructor .
But Witold J. Walczak , the organization ’s legal director , said the issues involved were common to many of its cases .
“ Why is the A.C.L.U. here ? ” Mr. Walczak asked .
“ The simple reason is this involves teaching , and that is expression protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution . ”
The instructor , Stephanie Babines , 30 , was denied a permit to open a dance studio here .
The A.C.L.U. has sued to overturn that decision .

Race drives strategy , stirs uncertainty
Journalists by instinct tend to hedge their bets , so most do n’t say in public what they really think .
But our conversations with colleagues make clear what many think about the great race between Barack Obama and John McCain :
This election is just about over , and Obama is just about to be president .
There ’s a big difference , of course , between just about over and stick - a- fork - in - it over .
A lot could happen , after all , in the 29 days before Nov. 4 .
Advertisement
And that leads to something else that a lot of political reporters — and a lot of political operatives and elected officials from both major parties that we have spoken with — believe to be true but tend not to say when cameras are rolling .
By far the most likely thing that could derail Obama ’s victory is a racial backlash that is not visible in today ’s polls but is waiting to surge on Election Day — coaxed to the surface ( to the extent coaxing is needed ) with the help of coded appeals from McCain and his conservative allies .
Racial issues tend to hover in the background in much of the public analysis of the Obama - McCain horserace — often mentioned but not usually as the dominant factor .
By contrast , it is increasingly the subject of obsessive interest in the nonstop , not - for - attribution conversation that takes place between reporters , political analysts and campaign sources in the heat of an election .
As a result , much of the news coverage and commentary that the media will produce over the next month will flow from the assumption that racial antagonisms are an unexploded bomb in this contest .
By this logic , if Obama does not head into Nov. 4 with a lead of at least several points in the polls , there is a good chance he ’ll be swamped by prejudice that will flourish in the privacy of the voting booth .
“ If Obama loses a close race , ” James Carville told our colleague David Paul Kuhn , “ it is almost inevitable that [ racism ] will be a very big part of the interpretation of the race . ”
On the principle that someone who had bet against the conventional wisdom at every turn in this presidential race would have made a lot of money , Politico dispatched reporters to examine survey data and talk to voters in an effort to gauge the potential of a racial surge against Obama .
This reporting did not debunk the conventional wisdom .
But it did find reason for at least a measure of skepticism on a couple of fronts :
The Bradley effect
This is the phenomenon , named after former Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley , by which black candidates are thought to perform better in polls than they do on Election Day .
( Bradley lost a race for governor in 1982 that polls said he was supposed to win .
Similarly , Douglas Wilder barely won his race for Virginia governor in 1989 , despite a big lead in polls ) .
Kuhn ’s reporting , based on extensive conversations with several of the nation ’s top pollsters and political consultants , shows a complex picture .
The pollsters say the days of voters lying in large numbers to pollsters to disguise their racial concerns are largely over .
The only way the phenomenon of voters misleading pollsters will matter is if the race is very tight , they say .
“ I have a concern that going into Election Day , in a dead heat , there could be some drop - off in support of Obama , of one or two points , because some voters are conflicted about race in this election , ” said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi .
Buoyed by concerns about the financial crisis , Obama is building a big lead nationally and in key states – a lead that if it holds is probably big enough to compensate for any racial backlash , the pollsters say .
See story here :
Do voters lie about racial concerns ?
African - American turnout
There are signs that Obama is benefiting from a massive surge in voter registration and early voting among African - Americans — one that might be equal or greater than any white backlash .
The surge is happening in Georgia and North Carolina , in particular .
As Ben Smith reports in another piece , these efforts are being promoted with an under - reported campaign of Obama advertising aimed at the African - American vote .
As an Obama spokesman dryly told Smith , “ If you did n’t notice it , then you probably were n’t the target . ”
See story here : How Obama quietly targets blacks
The economy
Politico reporter Josh Kraushaar traveled to Scranton , Pa. , where many of the older , lower - middle class white voters who are supposedly susceptible to racially coded appeals live .
He found deep anxiety about the troubled economy but relatively little discussion about race .
It may take setbacks on Wall Street to reveal progress in racial attitudes on Main Street .
See story here :
It ’s not the racial issues , stupid
A word of warning about all of this .
Sometimes the conventional wisdom is right .
Politico ’s reporting found plenty of reasons to suppose that racial divisions could yet be a potent force next month .
A Democratic state legislator in a key Midwest swing state told us it is clear many older white voters , especially union members and those in rural reaches , will never vote for a black man .
Lorene Coates , a Democratic legislator in North Carolina , said voters tell her the same thing all the time .
“ We ’re a Southern state , [ and ] there are people who will not vote for a black man . ”
Lisa Boscola , a Democratic state senator in Pennsylvania , said voters usually are n’t that blunt .
She said they raise other concerns : experience , trustworthiness .
“ They ’re trying to find an excuse , ” she said .
The very murkiness of the race question is itself powerful evidence of changing times .
Racial polarization used to be the great constant in American politics .
In this election , instead , race is the great imponderable .
As long as that is the case , said Wilder , his friend Obama would be wise not to cut things close .
“ Racism has not gone away , not will it ever leave , ” said Wilder .
This means Obama had better build an insurmountable edge “ to offset the possibilities of racism or oversampling or people saying one thing and meaning another . ”

Since his conviction on fraud and conspiracy charges , former lobbyist Jack Abramoff has spent more than 3,000 hours helping more than 100 law enforcement agents in an ongoing federal corruption probe that has implicated " scores of other persons not yet charged , " attorneys said in court filings today .
The Post's James V. Grimaldi reports that the extent of Abramoff 's cooperation was described in documents from both prosecutors and defense lawyers .
They are seeking leniency from the judges who heard the two cases that landed the Republican influence broker in federal prison in Cumberland , Md .
If a federal judge in Washington accepts the recommendation from the Justice Department , Abramoff would serve no more than another three years and three months in prison , not accounting for credit for good behavior awarded by the Bureau of Prisons .
Abramoff 's attorneys are seeking even more leniency that could have him released from prison by 2010 .
In November 2006 , Abramoff began serving a sentence of five years and 10 months for fraud in his purchase of a Florida casino cruise line .
Attorneys for both sides are seeking a reduction to three years and nine months .
Abramoff 's sentencing in a parallel case of tax evasion , fraud and conspiracy to ply public officials with gifts in exchange for official actions had been delayed until he had mostly completed his cooperation with authorities .
The sentencing is set for Sept. 4 before U.S. District Judge Ellen S. Huvelle .
In the public corruption case , the Justice Department is asking Huvelle to sentence Abramoff to five years and four months rather than the maximum 11 years and three months he'd be eligible to receive .
The sentences in the two cases would be served at the same time .
The government also is seeking about $ 23 million in restitution .
Abramoff attorneys Abbe D. Lowell of Washington and Neal R.Sonnett of Miami noted in a memorandum that in addition to the meeting with FBI and other agents , Abramoff had reviewed more than a half - million documents .
They also noted that the ex-powerhouse lobbyist had helped convict more than a dozen people , in addition to admitting guilt himself , and his case had prompted reforms that the attorneys said were widely known as " Abramoff Ethics Rules . "
Among those who have pleaded guilty were former Rep. Robert Ney ( R - Ohio ) , who this month was released after he completed his prison sentence , and J. Steven Griles , the No. 2 official in the Interior Department .
The court papers indicate an extensive ongoing investigation by referencing a document that is sealed because it contains grand jury information .
Still under investigation are former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - Tex . ) and retiring Rep. John Doolittle ( R - Calif. ) , among others .
One new scheme revealed in the papers is that Abramoff and his team of K Street lobbyists padded their billing records -- not to cheat clients , most of whom had hired them on retainer , but to bilk additional bonuses out of their firm , Greenberg Traurig LLP , because " padded hours possibly resulted in higher bonuses , " according to a government brief signed by William Welch , head of the public integrity section , and prosecutor Mary Butler .
Abramoff 's attorneys also referred to a statement by Noel Hillman , former public integrity chief at Justice and now is a federal judge in New Jersey , who has said that Mr. Abramoff 's decision to plead guilty and cooperate and expose the wrongs he and others did was a ' watershed ' event in addressing public corruption .

On the heels of their acquisition of WiFi intrusion detection firm AirDefense last month , Motorola has updated its multiradio , multiband enterprise access points to allow one radio to be dedicated to bad players on and near the local network .
Motorola offers this feature in its AP - 5131 ( a/b/g , two radios ) and AP - 7131 ( a /b/ g/n , three radios ) .
AirDefense software is required .
Wireless intrusion detection looks for unauthorized access points and clients , along with a host of identifiable bad behavior by devices not connected to the network .
Most systems require either that access points time slice , sneaking in scans while also serving clients , or that an overlay of intrusion - only access points are installed .
Typically , you need substantially fewer intrusion detectors than regular radios because the detectors are attempting to listen very closely rather than maximize a network 's throughput .
In a Motorola - deployed network , this might mean one out of each several APs would turn over a radio to intrusion detector , rather than anything approaching one radio in each AP .
Another enterprise vendor , Xirrus , which uses massive arrays of radios , builds in a dedicated intrusion sensor that 's designed for global use , and can detect signals using channels that are both legal and illegal for use in a particular regulatory domain .
Motorola had a three - year history of working with AirDefense prior to its purchase , making it less of a surprise that the company was able to update its hardware so rapidly .
Existing owners of either enterprise AP can apply a software update to gain the feature .

python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms .
matplotlib can be used in python scripts , the python and ipython shell ( ala matlab or mathematica ) , web application servers , and six graphical user interface toolkits .
matplotlib is a :
The plots produced by maplotlib really are very pretty , on par with the plots generated by Matlab .
Installing matplotlib on Windows was a breeze .
All you need is the .exe installer from their website , plus the .exe installer of NumPy - a scientific computing package used by matplotlib .
That , in combination with a more advanced package named SciPy creates a quite serious contender to the title of " open- source Matlab replacement " .
maplotlib is very suitable for interactive plotting , just like Matlab .
The best support for this is with the IPython shell , but it is possible to make it work with PyCrust as well .
This worked for me : >>> import matplotlib >>> matplotlib.use ( ' WXAgg ' ) >>> matplotlib.interactive( True ) >>> from pylab import * >>> plot ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) Note the directive to use the WXAgg backend .
The WX backend did n't work for me , it throws an error when run from PyCrust .
Note the directive to use the WXAgg backend .
The WX backend did n't work for me , it throws an error when run from PyCrust .
The Windows .exe distribution does n't come with the examples directory , so make sure to download it separately - it 's very helpful .
I 'm using wxPython for the GUI , so naturally I 'm interested in embedding plots into wxPython applications .
matplotlib has some examples of how to do this .
I found the wxcursor_demo and printing_in_wx examples in the user_interfaces / directory most helpful .
There seems to be a general problem with the WX backend of matplotlib , but WXAgg seems to work well .
One of the best features of matplotlib is the interaction with the plots .
There are some great demos in the widgets / examples directory , and I wish there were more documentation on this topic , because it can make for some really great features when integrated into a GUI .
Unfortunately , the documentation for numpy and matplotlib is n't very comprehensive , and some of it is outdated .
So the best reference is probably the source code documentation , which can be browsed online .
Some random observations from a couple of hours of toying with matplotlib :
On the eve of Halloween and several days before the presidential election , a group of Bay Area residents dressed as Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin gathered in San Francisco 's Castro District .
A group photo was taken at the intersection of Market , Castro and 17th streets at about 5 p.m .
Thursday , under the neighborhood 's famous rainbow flag .
The plan after that was to " fan through the city looking for Joe Six - Pack , " organizers said .
Anyone was welcome to join , organizer Eve Moran said .
Moran , a 30 - year - old Saratoga resident , plans to vote for Democrat Barack Obama .
She said she is pleased to see a woman running for vice president but does n't agree with Palin 's stances on issues .
She dressed up as Palin for the first time in early October when the Alaska governor made a fundraising stop in Burlingame .
Moran wore an outfit she had bought at a Marshalls store in San Antonio , Texas while shopping with her grandmother .
" I got a little bit of notice from the press , " she said of the Burlingame event .
She met her fellow organizers at a Sarah Palin look - alike contest held Oct. 22 at the Brava Theater in San Francisco 's Mission District .
" That 's where I met all these Sarah Palins and they were such good sports , " Moran said .
The group has gained attention since , even posing for a photo shoot at the San Francisco Chronicle the other day , she said .
She encouraged anyone who wanted to participate in Thursday 's event to start shopping .
" Everybody should just go to Goodwill and grab a red blazer , " she said .
" Those rimless glasses are everywhere , all over the reading - glasses racks at Longs and Safeway . "
The McCain - Palin campaign did not return a call for comment .
Argentine President Cristina Kirchner announced this week that her government intends to nationalize the country 's private pension system .
If Congress approves this property grab , $ 30 billion in individually held retirement accounts -- think 401 ( k ) s -- managed by private pension funds will become government property .
That the state could seize retirement savings no doubt seems outrageous to Americans .
But it is a predictable development in a country where government intervention in the financial system is the norm .
With Washington ...
SPRINGFIELD , Ill . --
Facing a lawsuit over deceptive mortgage practices , Bank of America has agreed to modify tens of thousands of loans to keep people in Illinois , Washington and nine other states from losing their homes , the Illinois attorney general 's office said Sunday .
Borrowers stuck with mortgages they can't afford could see their interest rates reduced or have the loan principal cut .
Some might qualify for having to pay nothing but interest for a decade .
Even people who can't afford to keep their homes even with such changes will be able to get help moving to a new home .
" This is going to provide a tremendous amount of relief , " said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan .
Her office and officials from California negotiated the settlement .
Nine other states have also joined the settlement , and other states could sign on , said Deborah Hagan , chief of Madigan 's Consumer Protection Division .
If every state were to join , the settlement could provide $ 8.7 billion in relief to 400,000 borrowers , Hagan said .
In California alone , the settlement will offer $ 3.5 billion .
For Illinois that would translate to $ 190 million to about 10,000 .
The settlement applies to people who obtained their mortgages through Countrywide Financial Corp. , which Charlotte , N.C. - based Bank of America purchased in June , at the same time Illinois and California sued the company .
" Countrywide 's lending practices turned the American dream into a nightmare for tens of thousands of families by putting them into loans they could n't understand and ultimately could n't afford , " California Attorney General Jerry Brown Jr. said in a statement Sunday .
The other states joining the settlement are Arizona , Connecticut , Florida , Iowa , Michigan , North Carolina , Ohio and Texas .
Bank of America will launch the new mortgage aid program in December , said Barbara Desoer , president of Bank of America 's mortgage , home equity and insurance services .
In a statement , she called it " a comprehensive program that provides more solutions than ever before to assist trouble borrowers and put them back on the path to sustained home ownership . "
The mortgage aid includes revising customers ' payments so they do n't exceed 34 percent of income .
Other options include reducing interest rates and adjusting principal so that borrowers do n't wind up actually losing equity under some payment plans .
Countrywide will not charge loan modification fees and will waive prepayment penalties .
Madigan said she hopes the settlement could serve as a model for steps that other lenders could take to make up for misleading mortgage practices .
She stressed that the agreement involves no tax money but will help people keep their homes and keep money flowing to lenders .
" This settlement will help homeowners stay in their homes , which ultimately helps investors and also helps communities , " said Madigan , a Chicago Democrat .
This post is part of the Elements of Leadership series .
If you ’ve been following this series , you ’ve no doubt noticed that I view organizations more like teams than mere collections of people .
There ’s both a positive reason for this and a realistic one .
The positive reason is that people like being part of successful groups and being praised for what they do .
People are much more satisfied and motivated when they view organizational successes as personal success rather than just organizational victories .
“ Team ” captures that feeling more than company or group or any other word I know of .
The realistic reason is that an organization is a team , whether they are functional and happy or dysfunctional and miserable .
The efforts and setbacks from one part of the team affect other parts of the team — and at root , your group has at least one common goal .
Your job as a leader of your organization is to spread “ teamthink . ”
Teamthink moves members of your group from thinking just about their individual success to the success of the group — they move to saying “ we ” rather than “ I ” .
They begin to understand their interrelatedness and appreciate the different roles being played in the team .
They become accountable not to themselves , but to the team .
It can be tricky to pull off in some environments because we ’ve been socialized to compete with each other , but the following actions start the snowball a’rolling :
1. Use Team Terms in Your Interactions with Your Team
I once read somewhere that if you ’re having problems in your organization , start by making larger concentric circles around yourself .
The insight : if you want something to change in a group , start with what you ’re doing and what you ’ve done to make those changes .
That said , you have to understand and live your role in the team .
When it comes to hiring and firing , you may be the Boss and have that power .
But when it comes to working with your team , you must remember that you are part of the team , not above it .
The easiest way to start getting your mind right is to start making efforts to change the way you speak .
Rather than saying , “ You need to do this , ” say , “ This task is critical for us . ”
In a group whose roles are not well - defined , you will have to spend a lot more time indicating who needs to do what , but as things become more solid , people will understand who does what and you wo n’t have to make it clear — they ’ll know what they do in the team without anybody saying anything .
Use collective terms as much as you can in your speech .
Make the link between sub -groups of your organization and the organization visual so that people can see where they fit .
Even if there are good reasons for them to sit in a cubicle , make sure the intangible glue that unites them is far more forceful than the walls that divide them .
Do whatever you can to embody teamthink in your own actions .
One of the clearest ways to push this is to …
2. Give Public Credit to the Team , Attribute Blame to Yourself
“ Recognition for a job well done is high on the list of motivating influences for all people ; more important , in many instances , than compensation itself . ” — John M. Wilson .
Even if you single - handedly led your organization through some challenge , never say , “ I did this . ”
Any successes that your organization achieves is because of their hard work and will to succeed .
Even if they know you did it all , at the end of the day , they ’ll remember what they did , and they ’ll want to be a part of the success .
On the other hand , all setbacks for the organization are your fault .
If you had given better guidance , the team would n’t have failed .
If you would have given them more time , they would have succeeded .
If you ’d been more realistic in your planning , they would have been able to follow through .
For some reason , this seems to be the opposite of the way things happen in most organizations .
When things go well , the leader takes all the credit .
When things go poorly , some fall guy gets his pink slip .
You want your team to feel responsible for what they have done .
If they feel responsible for the team ’s success , they ’ll strive to keep it successful .
If they feel solely responsible for its setbacks , they ’ll be gun -shy the next time their turn comes up .
Push the good energy outwards towards your team and pull the bad energy towards yourself — such is the mantle and burden of leadership .
Sometimes , though , you need to direct attention to individuals within the team .
When you do so , remember to …
3. Praise in Public , Reprimand in Private
When the success of your team is due to the stand - out efforts of one individual ( not you ! ) , praise her in public .
Tell as many people as you can ( in front of her ) that she did a great job for whatever she did .
By doing so , you ’ve let her know how important she is and you ’ve given her something to live up to .
You ’ve also given others a living example of what the team is looking for .
If the setbacks of your team are due to the efforts , or lack thereof , of one person , NEVER make that public .
Do not chew your teammates out in front of their peers — this is especially true of your junior leaders .
Pull them away from the team ( out of sight and sound ! ) and discuss the situation with them .
A few pointers on this one :
Never attribute to malice what ignorance or incompetence adequately explains .
Few people wake up in the morning trying to figure out ways to screw their teammates over .
Most people want to be successful .
Before you begin your sit - down with the teammate in question , assume that she was either ignorant or not trained to do what she was asked to do .
Ask first , reprimand later .
I ’ve lost track of how many times I went to reprimand a teammate and found that they were doing something somebody else told them to do or what they thought I wanted them to do .
Sometimes they were doing something unexpected but good nonetheless and just did n’t have time to let me know they ’d changed paths .
Always get your facts before you begin your reprimand .
Failing to do so can make the difference between you being an effective leader and you making a really big ass of yourself .
Incorporate a positive element .
Unless you ’re dealing with a through - and - through assbag , they provide some value to your team in one shape or form .
Do n’t go into a reprimand session full of critiques and complaints when the reality is that your teammate deserves some recognition for the good things she has done .
The goal of one of these types of sessions is to positively influence behavior .
You want your teammate to come away thinking and feeling that whatever they ’re being reprimanded about is a bump in the road and not the road itself .
If you hand their ass to them and do n’t encourage them , you ’ve lost that teammate .
If you let them know how they can excel the next time and make that realistic for them , you ’ve mentored your teammate .
And that makes all the difference between you being an effective leader and an efficient manager .

Zimbra Collaboration Server : Open source messaging server for Linux / Mac with enterprise collaboration .
It 's been more than a year since Yahoo !
bought the open source mail server company Zimbra , and people are still talking about the technology .
We put the most recent version through the paces .
In the server software marketplace , open source software and commercial software often appeal to and target different customers .
Typically , enterprise - oriented servers are built around closed - source commercial software , while open source software is marketed toward enthusiast - driven organizations or smaller businesses with a strong interest in cost cutting .
In the messaging server segment , Microsoft Exchange has become something of a de facto standard , and it , like many of its competitors , sells traditional closed - source solutions .
Zimbra Collaboration Server ( ZCS ) separates itself from the pack in several ways .
First and foremost , it occupies a newly emerging niche of " commercial open source " products .
That is , the base version of ZCS is open source software , free to acquire or modify .
Zimbra recently passed the first anniversary of being acquired by Yahoo !
By most measures , the acquisition has been a success .
The mail technology is being integrated in both directions , and Zimbra 's client base has grown steadily , John Robb , vice president of marketing and product management , told ServerWatch .
ZCS , therefore , is more than just open source .
Licensed versions offer additional functionality above and beyond the open source version are also available .
These may appeal to customers with particular messaging needs .
Plus , ZCS runs primarily on Linux - based platforms , although it is also available for Mac OS X .
There is not a Windows version , but the server can certainly interoperate with clients on Windows platforms .
An open extension framework is also available that enables two - way interoperability with leading collaboration platforms , including Microsoft Exchange Server , Lotus Domino Messaging Server and Meeting Maker .
Installing the 350MB ZCS download requires administrator access and some familiarity with using the command - line .
You may need to install additional system libraries for the ZCS installation script to pass its preliminary checks .
You will also need to configure your hosts file with accurate FQDN syntax .
Although it is accurate to describe ZCS as an open source messaging server , it is even more accurate to describe it as a bundled suite of open source products , including Apache Tomcat , MySQL , Lucene and Postfix .

Search the ServerWatch Glossary
Zimbra has already done the heavy lifting of stringing together these disparate open source products into one integrated bundle .
The installer script sets up each module , and it offers to configure some optional components , such as archiving and discovery services , which require a separate license to enable .
ZCS is administered through its AJAX - based Web interface .
Navigating the administration menus is straightforward , helped by a clear layout and built - in " help desk " resources .
Like most collaboration servers , ZCS provides users with e-mail , contacts , calendaring , tasks and shared document storage .
Each component features strong functionality .
For example , e-mail includes full searching and tagging ; calendars include free / busy management , users can host multiple calendars , and subscribe to external calendar feeds ; and documents can be composed in place with rich editing tools and shared privately or published to a public URL .
The open source ClamAV anti-virus kit is integrated into ZCS , so there is no third - party subscription needed to keep your virus database up - to - date .
However , you can optionally employ third - party commercial scanners .
Consistent with its open source pedigree , SpamAssassin is the anti-spam defense of choice .
Although both ClamAV and SpamAssassin are well regarded defenses and commonly found even in commercial products , some commercial servers do offer a wider range of additional defenses , particularly against spam .
The Linux version of ZCS offers an additional form of security for attachments by rendering certain file formats , like Word documents , in HTML inside the message pane rather than requiring the user to launch a separate application .
In addition to the usual collaboration tools , ZCS offers a novel feature called the " zimlet . "
The Zimlet architecture enables developers to integrate third - party products with Zimbra , somewhat like " gadgets " in OS X or widgets in Windows .
Several zimlets are includes with ZCS , such as Yahoo !
Maps , which can display a contact 's address on a map , and the Flickr zimlet , which simplifies attaching photos from a Flickr account to a new message .
For end users , the ZCS server is reachable with any standard e-mail client .
To take advantage of collaboration features the best choices are either Outlook on the desktop or Zimbra 's own Web - based client .
To its credit , Zimbra has designed an AJAX - based Web client which is nearly as full - featured as a desktop client , with drag and drop and right - click support .
For users with lesser connectivity , one click lets you switch to a standard HTML client , and even a mobile friendly client .
Support for push - style mobile e-mail to devices like smartphones requires licensing a separate product , Zimbra Mobile , which can interact with Java - based smartphones , plus the iPhone , Windows - based phones , Symbian - based phones , and Blackberries .
Mobility features require a license for either the Standard or Professional edition .
Likewise , you will need a licensed edition to support enterprise features like clustering and product rebranding .
Only the Professional edition supports syncing to Outlook and Apple iSync .
Although Zimbra is entirely functional as a turnkey collaboration server , its real appeal lies in its open source foundation and the opportunity for developers to customize a Zimbra platform precisely to their organization 's needs .
Pros : Open source foundation ; High - volume handling ; excellent AJAX Web client .
Cons :
Not quite plug - and - play for the novice administrator ; Could use more anti-spam defenses ; No Windows version .

Blogging is as varied in its applications as using the telephone or taking a picture .
The tool does n’t predict the output .
You might be using your blog to post recipes , or to inform the local community about information you find elsewhere on the web .
Maybe you ’re just trying your hand at writing , and the web is as good a place as any .
If you ’re looking to go beyond that , however , you ’ll need to take steps to improve your blog from at least five different perspectives .
In 50 Ways to Take Your Blog to the Next Level , I wanted to share my thoughts on how you should consider your goal , your design , your content , how you promote it , and the business aspects of your blog .
Please add to these ideas in the comments , and let ’s grow the list out .
Make Your Goal and Target Audience Crystal Clear
My point with this entire post , but most especially this section is to ask you to admit what your real goals are with your blog .
If you ’re not sure , that ’s fine .
You might not really want to take your blog to the next level just yet .
But if you ’re feeling as if you want to get serious ( in whatever direction that takes your efforts ) , give strong consideration to the following .
If your goal is to be an entertainment or news blog , be very clear that it ’s that and not a “ fun ” blog .
Consider splitting off your personal or fun blog .
If your blog is to be your business , treat it like that .
Get into stats .
Get into building audience .
Get into delivering something unique .
Do n’t straddle back and forth on this .
If the goal is to be a great community resource , mix your blogging time with time spent reaching out to the community you propose to serve .
If that ’s an offline opportunity , like something local , be there .
Be active .
Be a connector .
If you ’re going to be a professional about your blog , carve out the time to do it right .
Never , ever , ever post a “ sorry I have n’t posted lately ” blog post again .
Ever .
Up the ante on delivering original material .
Get outside the echo chamber .
Writing a me - too blog is n’t the way to build your blog to the levels you seek to attain .
It ’s okay to use a personal voice .
In fact , there ’s no point blogging if you ’re going to write like a cold robot .
But keep personal and useful in balance .
If you are attempting to do real business via your blog , look for ways to convert readers into customers .
If it ’s just an ad revenue business , compete , and be honest about that .
Compete with others in your space for audience , value , and better deals .
My point in this regard is that going halfway into the water does n’t make you less wet .
If your blog is the premier source of information for nonprofits , for photographers , for whatever , then be sure you ’re scouring news feeds and finding information outside the blogosphere to keep that relationship informed .
Make a point of engaging your community often in the comments section , on their blogs , on the other social networks where you cross paths .
Beauty Is More Than Skin Deep
Consider the design elements of your blog .
They do change the way people perceive your work .
And , they can help you improve your potential business opportunities .
Get your own unique URL .
It matters in the long run , especially should you choose to change hosts .
For instance , if you move off a blogger account at *.blogspot.com , you lose all link equity and page rank for that domain .
This means you ’d have to start again from scratch .
Already in that position ?
Make the switch now .
Consider moving to a hosted blog .
You can get a hosted WordPress blog set up and running for only $ 10 USD a year at Bloghost.me .
( Note : if you use code “ brogan , ” you can get it for $ 9 a year .
Andy ’s a friend . )
Consider using a professional theme .
I am an advocate for Thesis by Chris Pearson .
There are other premium themes out there , as well .
Consider getting a customized WordPress theme .
That link goes to Nico Pin , who designed [ chrisbrogan.com ] .
There are others who do this kind of work , obviously .
Are there several unnecessary widgets on your blog ?
Review them and decide which add value to your audience .
Is your layout readable ?
Are your fonts clean and easy to read ?
Are your color choices all they can be ?
A little time with your stylesheet goes a long way .
If you have ads , are you choking your community with them ?
Do you actually endorse the products on them ?
How effective have they been ?
Is your blog design and layout configured well for SEO ?
Several blogging platforms now have SEO plug - ins / add - ons to help with this .
That does n’t beat having a professional take a swing at improving your blog ’s SEO , but it ’s a good first step .
A logo and matching favicon does n’t hurt .
You can find various price points for this , and many different people offering the service .
Mine was created by Justin Evans and his team at StressLimit Design .
I also have friends in California that I highly recommend , as well .
Consider the graphics you post on your site .
Do they add to the story you ’re trying to tell ?
If not , seek upgrades .
There are many freely available graphics at Flickr , if you search by the appropriate Creative Commons license level .
Make Your Content Top Notch
Growing quality blog posts is n’t magic .
We do n’t sprinkle cookies all over the house and hope that the Blogging Fairy comes along and writes us posts in exchange for the cookies .
It takes lots of work , and a strong commitment .
And if it does n’t come naturally , you CAN learn how to improve .
Put your blog posts on a diet .
Read them with your audience in mind .
Can you thin them out ?
Remove unnecessary words .
Make them tight .
Lead with the main point .
If you ’re attempting to be a quality news or opinion blog , make your main point at the top of the post .
Do n’t make us dig .
Link .
If you ’re writing about another person , post , or website , link appropriately and thread the web .
It fleshes out the story , gives us places to explore , and shows a “ good neighbor ” practice .
Vary up post lengths .
If you write a “ feature length ” post , have something brief come next to avoid reader fatigue .
( Unless you ’re writing an essay - length blog all the time , and hey , good luck . )
Read .
Read .
Read .
Get outside the blogosphere .
Find sources of information that span far beyond what your competitors are covering .
Get on a regular writing / posting schedule .
Extra points for writing a few posts ahead of time for those days when you ca n’t get to it right away .
Work on your titles .
A great title drives visits , but also informs us as to what we ’re going to learn .
Refrain from “ me too ” posts .
If you ’ve got something to add , do that and link to the original post , but if you ’re moving up to the next level , lose the “ pointer ” posts .
( Your mileage may vary on this one ) .
Consider video , audio , and rich media .
If you ’re doing a text - mostly blog , consider mixing it up from time to time .
It might find you new audience , and it might also give people a more dimensional sense of who you are .
Review your blog posts monthly to see if you ’re covering the same ground .
If you are , consider building an editorial calendar to post from , so that you do n’t overlap and repeat topics too often .
Promoting Your Blog
No one loves someone who talks about themselves all the time , but if you ’re going to work on bringing your blog up a few notches , make sure your efforts are n’t for nothing .
Use a social bookmarking plugin like AddThis or Share
This on your blog posts so that people who like your work can share it easily .
Make a very prominent option to subscribe by email available on your site .
More than 50 % of my readers do so via email .
Add your blog URL to your email signature .
Make sure your blog URL is on your twitter profile , your facebook profile , added into Friendfeed , and several other outposts .
This helps people discover you who might not have noticed your work before .
( Note : Steve Rubel said that to me many months back .
He told me that he “ discovered ” my blog via Facebook .
I ’ve been a believer ever since . )
If you ’re going to promote your blog via places like Twitter , be sure to do it tastefully instead of just dumping links into the stream .
Consider asking a question , or pointing out a rather insightful comment .
Make sure you ’re doing the basics , like listing your site in Yahoo ! , Google , DMOZ , and claiming it in Technorati.com ( each of those sites shows you how via the help function ) .
Commenting on other well - known blogs in your same space in a not - spammy way is a great way for people who might like your work to discover you .
Do n’t put blatant links or otherwise be rude .
Just be thoughtful and helpful to the community at that site , and leave a useful comment .
They ’ll come , if they like what you said .
Do n’t forget posting the occasional blog post in LinkedIn ’s status message .
It reaches some interesting people from time to time .
Is it fair to Digg or Stumble your own posts ?
There are mixed opinions on this .
I ’ve had little to no success with Digg in this regard .
StumbleUpon is a different story .
Decide for yourself if you think this is okay to do .
I ’ve heard it called “ patting yourself on the back in public . ”
Write the occasional post that ’s worthy of bookmarking .
When someone adds a blog post of mine to Delicious , I often get lots more traffic than from other promotional angles .
Building Business From Your Blog
You might be trying to make money from your blog directly , perhaps through advertising or affiliate marketing .
Or you might be seeking to establish thought leadership and promote consulting opportunities .
You might be simply looking to drive even better awareness of a social cause or have a nonprofit or educational motive in mind .
In any case , think of “ business ” to mean “ value beyond the blogging itself . ”
Build conversion opportunities .
If you ’re selling something directly , think of clever ways to post about it that educate , inform , and encourage a call to action .
Make sure your blog design points people towards the action you want them to take .
( See Financial Aid Podcast for an easy example ) .
Ask for the sale .
If you ’re selling something , do n’t be shy .
Ask for it .
Do so in a blog post , or in an ad of your own creation .
Be direct and honest about this .
Mix free value and additional opportunities .
If you ’re selling something that ’s not unlike what ’s available on your blog for free , demonstrate the dividing line .
Even consider giving a hint of what ’s on the other side .
Make it easy to opt in .
Like asking for the sale , make sure you help your prospective customers / cleints / partners know how to get into your sales funnel , should they be interested .
Make content that sells .
If you ’re blogging or posting video to promote a business objective , work at building the content such that it drives that end decision .
Too 1.0 for you ?
At least open conversations up about what you ’re trying to accomplish .
Make it very easy to contact you .
Make your About page very clean and easy to read .
Put some real human names on the website , and even consider adding a photo , so that people know who they ’re addressing .
( I say this all the time , but I see so many examples daily of people who could use this advice . )
Build relationships with similar blogs and share opportunities .
If you ’re blogging about real estate , get to know the other real estate bloggers and learn from each other .
Give “ serving suggestions ” on your blog .
If you ’re blogging a particular kind of offering , is there a way to share what it does , or how you want to be involved ?
Remember : even if your blog ’s main goal is selling , be human , be interesting , be involved .
This is n’t the old Internet .
We have these nifty social tools that remind us to be human .
Let ’s use them that way .
My goal in writing this was to offer advice and suggestions for how one might transform their blog from “ another one in the pack ” to something of a destination on the web .
It ’s not my opinion that we should all be following this advice .
There are several blogs that I love exactly the way they are , and I ’m sure their respective owners do , too .
We all do this for different reasons , and one size does not fit all .
For those of you who DO intend their blog to be an authoritative , professional - minded presence on the web , I hope this helps .
Do you have something more to add ?
What ’s your take ?
What have I missed completely ?
What other questions to you have ?

Travel is fun , but only if you do n’t end up lugging a ton of stuff around the world .
The problem is that most people have no idea how to pack effectively .
They end up carrying way more than they ever need , and this often leads to frustration , arguments between travel buddies and unnecessary stress .
I ’m a self confessed travel junkie and have been fortunate enough to have traveled the world many times over .
Travel is addictive and many seasoned travelers agree that once you start , it is hard to stay in the one place for too long .
For some reasons , the travel bug is very contagious and hard to cure .
Not that I ever want to do this anyway .
I love traveling and over the years I have learned a thing or two about traveling light .
Hopefully my tips will help you to travel light the next time you pack your bags .
Holdall vs. Suitcase on Wheels
This one is easy to decide .
Holdalls ( or large gym bags ) are cumbersome and complicated to carry .
They become a huge annoyance if you travel long distance because of their shape and design .
You are much better off with a suitcase on wheels , preferably small and compact .
We tend to carry large suitcases by design because we always fear that we will run out of clothes and stuff while on the road .
In fact , you are much better of taking as little as possible .
At the most you only want to have enough clothes for 7 days as there are washing machines where most people go .
If on the odd occasion you end up off the beat track , nobody really cares if your shirt is dirty or even smells a bit .
Backpack for Word Travelers
If you decide to travel around the world you want to take a well fitted backpack .
Unless you travel 5 - star all the way of course .
In that case , a sturdy suitcase on wheels will do the job just nicely .
These days backpacks are designed to be comfortable and many do come with in built wheels for the odd inner city transfer .
The problem with a backpack is that the more stuff you take , the heavier they will get as we tend to buy things that are often unnecessary .
If I was to travel the world again on a backpacking trip I would only ever take a max of 40 l rucksack .
I believe you can buy clothes at your destination and they are often cheaper than buying them at home and having to log them around with us .
Roll Your Clothes
Did you know that by rolling your clothes into a tight roll you can actually fit them into a much smaller suitcase or backpack ?
I use cubes I buy at the camping store to store my clothes according to needs .
I can quite easily travel with a small suitcase on wheels for two weeks without ever running out of clothing .
Pack Half
Get into the habit of packing a day early for your trip and then take out half the stuff and leave it at home .
Do you really need a pair of trousers for every day of the week ?
Or how about taking 10 books ( you might be bored ) , your iPod , your phone charger , batteries , and half of your office desk with you .
You will hardly need all the stuff you THINK you need while away .
Unless your destination has no shops of any kind , forget about all the extras .
Buy at Your Destination
Not only is it cheaper to do that ( unless you live in a third world country or your currency is otherwise in the tank ) , but you will be so much more relaxed while other people around you stress over carrying far to much luggage on them .
If you fancy to travel in true spirit , do so with as little clutter as possible .
Travel Size Bottles
Forget your usual bathroom necessities .
If your trip only lasts a week there is no reason to take that whole bottle of shampoo and shower gel .
Instead , go to your drug store and buy little refillable travel sized bottles .
Then fill them with your shower essentials .
It is also advisable to take a bathroom utility bag that can be hung up as often there is little room to place things in hotel bathrooms or hostels .
Plus , it will keep your gear clean .
Pack Multi Purposes Clothes
Multi purpose clothes are cool .
Today they come in many different styles and fashion .
Gone are the days when you looked like a dog in a rag if your wore your cargo pants while dining at a decent restaurant .
Today you can wear the same pant for this purpose while hiking a mountain the next day .
I also love the wide range of breathable shirts available from camping stores these days .
Best of all , many of them do n’t even have to be ironed anymore .
What is your travel tip ?
Feel free to share with us please .
Burglary suspect dies in Telegraph Hill fall SAN FRANCISCO
Man falls 200 feet after leap over wall on Telegraph Hill
A suspected car burglar , trying to elude police officers , died after the unidentified man jumped over a retaining wall at the end of Alta Street ( left ) on Telegraph Hill and fell 200 - feet below in San Francisco , Calif. , on Thursday , Sept. 11 , 2008 .

A car - burglary suspect fell to his death early Thursday after he climbed over a wall on San Francisco 's Telegraph
Hill while trying to flee from police , apparently unaware that on the other side of the wall was a 200 - foot cliff , authorities said .
The man was identified by the San Francisco medical examiner 's office as James Ronald Cockrum Jr. , 38 , of Daly City .
His grandmother said Cockrum was the married father of a 2 - year - old girl .
He was an Army veteran who had spent time in prison for drugs .
The incident began at 12:30 a.m. when police received reports of someone breaking into a car on Alta Street near Montgomery Street , east of Coit Tower .
Plainclothes officers set up surveillance in the area and spotted Cockrum getting out of an Audi , said police spokesman Sgt. Neville Gittens .
Police tried to stop him , but he took off running .
At one point , he stumbled and a screwdriver fell out of his pocket , police said .
Cockrum jumped over a 3 - foot wall at the end of Alta Street and plunged the equivalent of 20 stories .
He was pronounced dead at the scene , west of Sansome Street .
Officers found that a Subaru and possibly a third car had been broken into , Gittens said .
Louie Mandecote , a caregiver for a resident on Alta , said the incident was unnerving because " this neighborhood is so quiet . "
Mandecote added , " It 's a long - way drop from where Alta Street is .
He probably does n't live here if he did n't know that . "
Two - block - long Alta is one of the oldest streets in San Francisco , dating from the 1850s .
In March 1992 , a cliffside Art Deco building on Alta fell down the same slope over several days as a result of heavy rains .
Cockrum 's grandmother , Geraldine Cockrum of Merced , agreed that he was not familiar with the area and would not have leapt over the wall had he known what was on the other side .
" Oh , heck no , " she said , adding that he was " big and strong .
He thought he could do anything . "
She said her grandson 's life had deteriorated as a result of drug use .
" When he was not on drugs , he was the kindest , sweetest guy you ever met , " she said .
" When he was on drugs , he was n't mean .
He was just stealing . "
Cockrum was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced in 2006 to two years in state prison .
He was paroled Feb. 6 of this year , according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Geraldine Cockrum said her grandson attended high school in Merced , joined the Army and served in the Middle East during the Persian Gulf War .
He began using drugs in high school , she said .
" I think he just fell in line with some of his high school buddies , " Cockrum said .
" It 's just been on and off drugs ever since . "
He leaves behind his wife and their daughter , who turned 2 in July .

You ’ll be thrilled to know that despite economic uncertainty and panic over the failed bailout , San Francisco ’s infamous Folsom Street Fair went off over the weekend without a hitch .
Or rather , with plenty of hitches .
And the whitewashers at the San Francisco Chronicle lapped it all up :
S.F. kinky naked romp a spanking success
They held the world ’s biggest celebration of leather , bondage and sexual fetish in San Francisco on Sunday , and due to the event ’s interactive nature , many people are now walking gingerly .
“ Enough is enough , ” said Lowell Clark , pulling up his blue jeans after emerging from one of dozens of spanking booths at the 25th Folsom Street Fair .
Clark , a 30 - year - old San Francisco waiter , conceded he was a novice at the booths , where men and women in search of stimulation were struck with whips , paddles or bare hands .
Clark was last spanked at the age of 6 at the hands of his mother in Oklahoma .
A stolen pack of chewing gum was involved .
“ I still do n’t think I ’ll steal anything , ” Clark said .
Still , he called the spanking a “ stinging pleasure ” that he would try “ maybe once a year . ”
It was just another scene from the city ’s most unabashed bash – a public display of all things kinky that covered 13 blocks in the South of Market neighborhood and drew hundreds of thousands of people , many of them not wearing leather in key places .
There were naked people selling bondage gear and naked people seeking support for measures on the Nov. 4 ballot .
There were naked people with cameras , taking pictures of other naked people .
One man wore only an 11 - foot Burmese albino python , which curled around his waist .
The arrangement seemed risky .
The fair is fun but also important , said Al Waddell , a 58 - year - old entrepreneur from Oregon whose Paddle Daddy flogging implements were available in mahogany , hickory and walnut .
“ It brings kink out of the closet , ” he said as he tried to coax visitors a step further – onto his $ 645 leather sex sling , complete with metal frame and stirrups .
Palin's ' Reformer ' Myth When John McCain trotted out Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate , his campaign and much of the U.S. news media depicted the Alaska governor as an ethics “ reformer ” whose meteoric political rise came from her confronting corruption within her own state Republican Party .

But a closer look at Palin 's short political career reveals that she committed some of the same ethical lapses that she has attacked , especially during her unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2002 .
She also has shown herself to be a thin - skinned politician quick to see herself as the target of conspiracies .
In 2002 , Palin – still mayor of Wasilla with a population of about 6,700 – ran much of her campaign for lieutenant governor out of Wasilla City Hall on city time , according to documents first obtained in July 2006 by an editor for Voice of the Times newspaper in Anchorage .
( I obtained some of those documents from former Wasilla city officials this week . )
The documents show that Palin used city computers to manage her campaign and billed taxpayers for mailings , phone calls and literature .
Palin also had her city secretary , Mary Bixby , print 75 thank - you notes to campaign donors and book a campaign related trip Ketchikan in May 2002 while on city time .
Former city officials said Palin and her campaign staff worked upwards of 10 hours a day using Wasilla City Hall as her campaign headquarters where campaign faxes were sent and received , and campaign staffers used city phones to solicit donations .
On Palin ’s lieutenant governor candidate registration form with the Alaska Public Offices Commission , she used the e-mail the city gave her — sarah@ci.wasilla.ak.us — for “ campaign chairperson ” contact information and the Wasilla City Hall fax telephone number for " candidate information . ”
Palin ’s mayoral schedule for June 12 , 2002 showed that she met with Herold Advertising Products in her office at City Hall .
Soon after , the company faxed the city ’s deputy administrator , John Cramer , " Sarah Palin Lieutenant Governor " artwork and an invoice for the work .
Former city officials said they were unaware whether Palin reimbursed the city for funds she used to promote her campaign .
Neither spokesmen at the governor ’s office in Alaska nor McCain - Palin campaign representatives returned telephone calls and e-mails for comment .
Building the Myth
Working at her city computer , Palin also sent three e-mails to Randy Ruedrich , the state ’s Republican Party chairman , complaining about several endorsements she did not receive .
Ironically , as chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , Palin reported Ruedrich , a fellow commissioner , to Gov. Frank Murkowski ’s administration , accusing him of an ethics breach for conducting work for the state GOP on government time .
To obtain evidence of Ruedrich ’s alleged malfeasance , Palin hacked into his computer , an ethical lapse in its own right .
In January 2004 , she resigned from the commission in protest over what she billed as corrupt practices .
Palin ’s ethics complaint against Ruedrich gave her a reputation as an anti-establishment reformer at a time when the Alaskan Republican hierarchy was coming under scrutiny for corruption .
Reudrich paid a $ 12,000 fine after an investigation revealed he had violated state ethics rules .
But in July 2006 , Paul Jenkins , an editor for the conservative Voice of the Times , confronted Palin about her own apparent ethical breaches four years earlier .
Her response was to insist , without explanation , that her situation was different than Reudrich's .
“ I asked how her using a city computer for her campaign business was any different than Ruedrich 's use of a state computer at the AOGCC to do Republican Party business , ” Jenkins wrote in a column on July 7 , 2006 .
“ Not the same , she said , simply not the same .
“ Then , she shifted gears and asked , ‘ Is this what they 've got to destroy my campaign ?
E-mails from 4 1/2 years ago ?’
We had barely hung up — and I was wondering if there was any story in all this — when her campaign fired off a ‘ news ’ release headlined : ‘ Palin Campaign Sees First Signs of Rumored Smear Campaign . ’
Good grief .
Frankly ... I 've never seen a politician come unhinged so quickly as Palin when asked a few straightforward questions . ”
Jenkins excoriated his Alaska media colleagues for lapping up Palin ’s “ reformer ” talking points .
He said her “ campaign [ was ] rooted in one thing : the perception that Palin somehow wears a halo and is not your average , run - of - the - mill politician . ”
This editor for Voice of the Times , which bills itself as “ A Conservative Voice for Alaska , ” concluded with a reality check that could very well apply to the GOP talking points being used today to sell Palin to the American electorate .
“ When her goody - two - shoes act starts to crumble — and going nuts because of a few obvious questions seems a first crack — folks may see her for the rank politician she is , and not necessarily a good one at that , ” Jenkins wrote .

Root Causes of the Financial Crisis : A Primer by Wendell Cox 10/28/2008
It is not yet clear whether we stand at the start of a long fiscal crisis or one that will pass relatively quickly , like most other post - World War II recessions .
The full extent will only become obvious in the years to come .
But if we want to avoid future deep financial meltdowns of this or even greater magnitude , we must address the root causes .
In my estimation two critical and related factors created the current crisis .
First , profligate lending which allowed many people to buy overpriced properties that they could not , in reality , afford .
Second , the existence of excessive land use regulation which helped drive prices up in many of the most impacted markets .
Profligate lending all by itself would not likely have produced the financial crisis .
It took a toxic connection with excessive land - use regulation .
In some metropolitan markets , land use restrictions , such as urban growth boundaries , building moratoria and large areas made off - limits to development propelled house prices to unprecedented levels , leading to severely higher mortgage exposures .
On the other hand , where land regulation was not so severe , in the traditionally regulated markets , such as in Texas , Georgia and much of the US Midwest and South there were only modest increases in relative house prices .
If the increase in mortgage exposures around the country had been on the order of those sustained in traditionally regulated markets , the financial losses would have been far less .
Here is a primer on the process : The International Financial Crisis Started with Losses in the US Housing Market :
There is general agreement that the US housing bubble was the proximate cause for the most severe financial crisis ( in the US ) since the Great Depression .
This crisis has spread to other parts of the world , if for no other reason than the huge size of the American economy .
Root Cause # 1 ( Macro - Economic ) : Profligate Lending Led to Losses : Profligate lending , a macro-economic factor , occurred throughout all markets in the United States .
The greater availability of mortgage funding predictably led to greater demand for housing , as people who could not have previously qualified for credit received loans ( “ subprime ” borrowers ) and others qualified for loans far larger than they could have secured in the past ( “ prime ” borrowers ) .
When over - stretched , subprime and prime borrowers were unable to make their mortgage payments , the delinquency and foreclosure rates could not be absorbed by the lenders ( and those which held or bought the " toxic " paper ) .
This undermined the mortgage market , leading to the failures of firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the virtual failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In this era of interconnected markets , this unprecedented reversal reverberated around the world .
Root Cause # 2 ( Micro - Economic ) : Excessive Land Use Regulation Exacerbated Losses : Profligate lending increased the demand for housing .
This demand , however , produced far different results in different metropolitan areas , depending in large part upon the micro-economic factor of land use regulation .
In some metropolitan markets , land use restrictions propelled prices and led to severely higher mortgage exposures .
On the other hand , where land regulation was not so severe , in the traditionally regulated markets , there were only modest increases in relative house prices .
If the increase in mortgage exposures around the country had been on the order of those sustained in traditionally regulated markets , the financial losses would have been far less .
This “ two - Americas ” nature of the housing bubble was noted by Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman more than three years ago .
Krugman noted that the US housing bubble was concentrated in areas with stronger land use regulation .
Indeed , the housing bubble is by no means pervasive .
Krugman and others have identified the single identifiable difference .
The bubble – the largest relative housing price increases – occurred in metropolitan markets that have strong restrictions on land use ( called “ smart growth , ” “ urban consolidation , ” or “ compact city ” policy ) .
Metropolitan markets that have the more liberal and traditional land use regulation experienced little relative increase in housing prices .
Unlike the more strongly regulated markets , the traditionally regulated markets permitted a normal supply response to the higher market demand created by the profligate lending .
This disparate price performance is evidence of a well established principle of economics in operation – that shortages and rationing lead to higher prices .
Among the 50 metropolitan areas with more than 1,000,000 population , 25 have significant land use restrictions and 25 are more liberally regulated .
The markets with liberal land use regulation were generally able to absorb from the excess of profligate lending at historic price norms ( Median Multiple , or median house price divided by median household income , of 3.0 or less ) , while those with restrictive land use regulation were not .
Moreover , the demand was greater in the more liberal markets , not the restrictive markets .
Since 2000 , population growth has been at least four times as high in the traditional metropolitan markets as in the more regulated markets .
The ultimate examples are liberally regulated Atlanta , Dallas - Fort Worth and Houston , the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the developed world with more than 5,000,000 population , where prices have remained within historic norms .
Indeed , the more restrictive markets have seen a huge outflow of residents to the markets with traditional land use regulation ( see : http://www.demographia.com/db-haffmigra.pdf).
Toxic Mortgages are Concentrated
Where there is Excessive Land Use Regulation :
The overwhelming share of the excess increase in US house prices and mortgage exposures relative to incomes has occurred in the restrictive land use markets .
Our analysis of Federal Reserve and US Bureau of the Census data shows that these over - regulated markets accounted for upwards of 80 % of “ overhang ” of an estimated $ 5.3 billion in overinflated mortgages .
Without Smart Growth , World Financial Losses Would Have Been Far Less :
If supply markets had not been constrained by excessive land use regulation , the financial crisis would have been far less severe .
Instead of a more than $ 5 Trillion housing bubble , a more likely scenario would have been at most a $ 0.5 Trillion housing bubble .
Mortgage losses would have been at least that much less , something now defunct investors and the market probably could have handled .
While the current financial crisis would not have occurred without the profligate lending that became pervasive in the United States , land use rationing policies of smart growth clearly intensified the problem and turned what may have been a relatively minor downturn into a global financial meltdown .
Never Again :
All of the analyst talk about whether we are “ slipping into a recession ” misses the point .
For those whose retirement accounts have been wiped out , or stock in financial companies has been made worthless , those who have lost their jobs and homes , this might as well be another Great Depression .
These people now have little prospect of restoring their former standard of living .
Then there is the much larger number of people whose lives are more indirectly impacted – the many households and people toward the lower end of the economic ladder who have far less hope of achieving upward mobility .
All of this leads to the bottom line .
It is crucial that smart growth ’s toxic land rationing policies be dismantled as quickly as possible .
Otherwise , there could be further smart growth economic crises ahead , or , perhaps even worse , a further freezing of economic opportunity for future generations .

The police team , led by Superintendent Keith Niven , were invited to the Caribbean island by the local police chief , who has admitted that his force has been stretched by the investigation .
' Code of silence '
The couple , both 31 , were attacked on the 27 July , the last day of their two - week honeymoon , in what is believed to have been a bungled robbery .
Antigua police say a " person of interest " is being interviewed .
Island police commissioner Gary Nelson said he is confident of catching the gunman .
" We are turning over all the stones to find the person responsible , " he told the BBC News Channel .
Mr Nelson has also said the police were being hampered by a " code of silence " or lack of trust in police on the island .
Police have now questioned more than 30 people in the investigation .
A reward of £ 67,000 has been offered for information leading to the conviction of the killer .

What are these ?
( – promoted by navajo )
Sandia Pueblo , near Albuquerque in NM - 01 , happens to have an excellent location for a casino .
They ’ve come a long ways since their modest Bingo Room back in the 1990s .
Casino proceeds have built a variety of community facilities , placed a computer in every home , and plowed a lot back into additional economic development .
This is their newly - opened resort :
The mountains behind it are the Sandia Mountains , traditional spiritual place for the small Tiwa - speaking tribe .
That piece of turf was claimed by the US after the Mexican - American War and later incorporated into the National Forests .
The tribe was involved in ongoing efforts to protect their interests and traditional activities in the Sandias .
When the the money started coming in from gaming , they decided to hire a lobbyist .
Who did they hire ?
To the tune of $ 1.7 million ?
Jack Abramoff .
And who presided over the associated Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearings ?
And sealed 98 % of the hearing ’s documents ?
John McCain !
Cross-posted at Daily Kos and Democracy for New Mexico .
McCAIN’s INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEARINGS
This ties back to McCain .
Why ?
Because of the Indian Affairs Subcommittee hearings on matters Abramoff during 2006 .
Back then , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) chaired the committee , and presided over the hearings .
By the time the dust settled , Congressman Bob Ney ( R ) of Ohio went to jail , Richard Pombo ( R , CA - 11 ) and others got fired by the voters , and a bunch of other Republicans decided to retire .
That ’s a big part of why the Democrats stand to move up in the legislative branch this year – prominent Republicans like Sens.
John Warner ( VA ) and Pete Domenici( NM ) are retiring ( and a lot of not - quite - so - prominent ones , too . )
“ Maverick ” McCain points to these hearings as proof of bucking his party .
Let ’s keep in mind that the hearings put all members of the House and Senate off - limits as part of the ground rules .
It did look into the Interior Department , and so touched upon the portion of the Abramoff operation relating to Indian gaming .
But the vast majority of the documents accumulated in the conduct of those hearings have been sealed .
Only about 2 % of the documents were released for public scrutiny .
More on that to follow below .
It has been hypothesized that there ’s some kind of a coverup going on .
The Bush justice department has pursued the matter .
Rep. Bob Ney from Ohio did go to jail .
Pombo and others were not re-elected .
John Doolittle ( CA - 04 ) and others decided not to run for another term .
This week there was a new arrest in the case : One Kevin Ring , former Doolittle staffer , later a lobbyist working for Abramoff .
( The full 46 - page indictment is available in PDF form . )
There ’s a lot about Representative 5 in there , John Doolittle .
And some talk about a [ New Mexico tribe ] .
Doolittle might end up in jail yet , and it would not be undeserved .
But a bit of a back burner story .
Not like Doolittle ’s running for re-election or anything .
And no wonder – it ’s his former Chief of Staff , after all .
From MSNBC :
At one point in 2000 , Doolittle ’s then - chief of staff told Ring in an e-mail that Doolittle had said he felt like a “ subsidiary ” of Abramoff ’s firm , the indictment says .
Doolittle ’s attorney , David Barger , defended the congressman in a statement Monday .
“ It is clear that portions of the Kevin Ring indictment were designed to make gratuitous references to the congressman and his wife .
This appears to have been done to titillate the public , with the foreseeable and therefore intended consequence of attempting to embarrass and pressure the congressman , ” the statement said .
Turns out there ’s a New Mexico angle in this indictment , too .
HEATHER WILSON
Sandia Pueblo is within the boundaries of NM - 01 , the district of Rep. Heather Wilson , the failed Senatorial candidate .
2 – On or about December 20 , 2001 , defendant RING sent an email captioned ” [ New Mexico tribe ] ( sp ? ) ” to Abramoff in which he wrote , “ Need to talk to you about a potential new client .
Would need Scanlon , too . ” A few months later , on or about February 14 , 2002 , Abramoff sent an email to Scanlon in which Abramoff informed Scanlon that “ [ 0 ] ur Kevin Ring New Mexico Ship has just arrived !!
We have a meeting 11 am Wednesday next week with the [ New Mexico tribe ] here in DC .
They are desperate and rich .
Kevin is desperate for some $ and a big client .
We ’z gonua be rich ( er ) … ”
It ’s kinda quaint , really .
How the names are all “ disguised ” .
The names of all the tribes involved have long been known .
The only one in New Mexico was Sandia Pueblo .
Similarly , covering up the names of the governmental officials is curious .
But such are the rules of the game we play by .
Turns out , deep in the 46 - page indictment is a presumed reference to our own NM Rep.
Heather Wilson .
Sandia ’s in her district , so I guess we should n’t be surprised .
Looks like ol ’ Nipplegate Heather follows basketball as well as football .
( Note that “ Governor ” is the title for the head of NM Pueblo tribes ’ governments . )
155 .
On or about July 17 , 2002 , defendant RING emailed the New Mexico tribe ’s governor and others to inform them that the executive branch official had called a U.S. Senator to support the settlement agreement .
156 .
On or about January 30 , 2003 , a lobbyist at Firm B emailed a staffer for the New Mexico tribe ’ s U.S. Representative , “ Sorry I could n’t hangout last night .
I greatly appreciate your taking the time to han [ g ] out with the [ New Mexico tribe ] .
It meant a lot to [ K ] evin and I [ sic ] .
BTW , you should be all set for the [ Los Angeles ] Clippers [ basketball ] game . ”
And in today ’s Albuquerque Journal , Heather Wilson has felt moved to respond :
Mr. Kevin Ring hosted a fundraising lunch at Signatures Restaurant to benefit my campaign for re-election in May 2003 and contributed $ 1,000 to my campaign on June 2 , 2003 .
When we discovered that Mr. Ring had not submitted a bill for the cost of the fundraiser to my fundraising consultant , our consultant sought to pay the bill and , when unsuccessful because the restaurant was no longer in business , my campaign made an equivalent contribution to charity as required by Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) rules .
She did help the tribe get the land settlement , which she should have done anyhow , as Representative for a tribe supposedly covered by Federal Trust responsibilities .
She and her staff did get stuff of value from the tribe ’s lobbyist .
Quid pro quo ?
We ’ll probably never know
At any rate : Wilson ’s name had n’t been linked in with the Abramoff web before .
The Sandia part of the story was almost a sidebar .
The tribe did n’t spend much money , dropped the lobbyist , and managed to get a land - claim settlement they could live with .
At the time the Abramoff scandal busted open , the Albuquerque Journal reported ( you have to watch an ad to follow the link for free ) :
Stuwart Paisano , who served as Sandia ’s governor until last week , said Tuesday the pueblo was in legal settlement negotiations with the firms and could not talk about specifics of Sandia ’s monetary arrangement .
He said the pueblo paid more than $ 1 million to the two men .
“ Our council has no ill feelings , ” he said .
“ We were able to get the mountain back , which was our only goal .
Obviously we made some poor choices in who we hired . ”
Presumably , this part of the story was in the Indian Affairs subcommittee ’s millions of sealed documents .
And , one wonders , what other “ dirt ” on various Republicans got buried .
And before anyone gets wound up and says “ What about corrupt Dems ? ” , it is probably good to remember that the Abramoff operation was part of the Republican plan for a “ permanent majority ” .
Democrats were completely shut out .
Abramoff only dealt with Republicans .
And that , my friends , is why this story matters .
Abramoff is in jail .
Ring is arrested .
Doolittle and Wilson are n’t standing for re-election .
But John McCain presided over burying a lot of evidence in the course of those hearings .
There were a coupla sacrificial animals : Abramoff and some of his crew had to go ; a few people left their jobs at Interior ; and Bob Ney got snagged .
Plus Delay & Pombo and others were driven from office .
Is McCain sitting on favors in all those sealed documents ?
( Favors bordering on extortion ? )
In keeping Wilson ’s name out of the news , he could be credited with her keeping her seat .
She won by a very narrow margin of 105,986 - 105,125 .
A few headlines tying her to this scandal during 2006 could easily have made the difference .
For all the good it did .
She ’s OUT this year anyhow .
She had other help , too .
The US Attorney scandal , Albuquerque chapter , was all wrapped up in it , too .
She and Domenici were both damaged for their interference with David Iglesias .
Less often mentioned was the Bob Perry - funded ad campaign mounted in the weeks before the election attacking Wilson ’s challengers NM Attorney General Patricia Madrid over the same case Iglesias got fired over – for not producing indictments as fast as would be helpful to the needs of the effort to re-elect Heather .
BACK TO McCAIN
This new association of a sitting member of Congress with the Abramoff scandal brings the question of those sealed Indian Affairs Committee documents front and center .
What other stories and ties have been hidden from the public ?
Who else did McCain spare from sunlight on Abramoff ’s many tentacles into the Republican majority in Congress ?
It ’s not clear to me why , now that there ’s a Democratic majority , these materials all remain sealed .
I ’ve called the new Chairman of Indian Affairs , Senator Dorgan ’s ( D - ND ) office , was referred to the Committee .
But all the reception I was afforded was to have my query referred to voice mail .
I ’ve heard nothing back .
It ’s this kind of thing that disappoints me about the Democratic majority .
This kind of thing really should be seeing sunlight .
TIMELINE ( background info )
Correction : I got an email with a link to the first Washington Post story about the Abramoff scandal .
It was in 2004 .
Sadly , the story did n’t get enough traction then to change the 2004 election outcome .
It ’s probably good to keep the timeline of all this in mind .
The Abramoff scandal blew up with some Washington Post stories in December 2005 .
McCain got his hearings up and down in 2006 , and all the documents were sealed .
Republicans lost the House and the Senate in 2006 , and the US Attorney scandal came to light in early 2007 .
From MSNBC again – some related summary :
To date , the ongoing Abramoff investigation has resulted in 13 guilty pleas by various lobbyists and public officials , including former lobbyist Michael Scanlon , who pleaded guilty in November 2005 to conspiracy to commit bribery and honest services fraud .
Former lobbyist and congressional staffer Tony C. Rudy pleaded guilty in March 2006 to conspiring with Abramoff , Scanlon and others to commit honest services fraud , mail and wire fraud , and a violation of conflict of interest post - employment restrictions .
In April 2007 , Mark D. Zachares , a former high - ranking aide to the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and in June 2008 , John C. Albaugh , a former chief of staff to a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives pleaded guilty to the same charge .
In April 2008 , Robert Coughlin , a former Department of Justice employee , pleaded guilty to a conflict of interest .
Scanlon , Rudy , Albaugh , Coughlin and Zachares are all cooperating and awaiting sentencing .
In addition , Ohio Congressman Robert Ney pleaded guilty in September 2006 to conspiracy to commit multiple offenses , including honest services fraud , making false statements in violation of his former chief of staff ’s one - year lobbying ban , and making false statements to the U.S. House of Representatives .
Ney was sentenced to 30 months in prison .
Neil Volz , former lobbyist and chief of staff to Congressman Ney , pleaded guilty in May 2006 to honest services fraud and violating the one - year lobbying ban and William Heaton , former chief of staff for Congressman Ney , pleaded guilty on February 26 , 2007 , to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud .
Volz and Heaton cooperated in the government ’s investigation and were each sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay a $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 fine , respectively .
McCain ’s hearings were in 2006 .
There was some flashy stuff , and names like Italia Federici ( with ties to Gale Norton & Steven Griles at Interior ) had their 15 minutes of fame .
It garnered , actually , many hours of coverage on C - SPAN , and a few bits on the cable channels .
And then the report came out , and the documents were sealed .
A few were punished , and many more were protected .
John McCain might like to brag about his corruption - fighting ways .
But it ’s fair to say that he likely protected many more than were punished , even with a wrist slap .
Meanwhile , Wilson – who more likely than not benefited from McCain ’s sealed documents – is busy supporting his campaign . ”
From TPM muckraker :
Wilson has been a stalwart supporter and prominent surrogate for John McCain , painting him as a crusader against Washington corruption .
Just last night , she appeared on MSNBC ’s Hardball to make the case for him , and last week she told NPR : “ John McCain has chosen a reformer … to be his running mate and I think that ’s a perfect complement to who he is and what he ’s done in his life . ”
Ralph Reed , too , was tied up in the Abramoff imbroglio , and lost his bid to become Lt. Governor of Georgia because of it .
Even Garrison Keillor got in on the act !
Ralph Reed now , too , serves as a surrogate for the McCain campaign .
Plus whatever he ’s pulling behind the scenes .
So much for rooting out corruption !
He ’s got it right in his campaign .
And really , before McCain gets too much credit for those hearings , the 98 % of the hearing documents that have been sealed need to see the light of day .
Doolittle , and now Wilson , have had their names tied to the scandal .
It ’s likely John McCain ’s sealed documents are the only reason we ’ve not seen Wilson ’s name publicly associated with the “ permanent majority ” machine before , even though she has benefited from it , and supported it like a good soldier .
I ’m guessing that McCain will come out smelling not so sweet when all that content comes to light .
And who knows who else ’s involvement has been buried in those sealed documents ?
Red or green ?

A dusty maze of concrete , sheet metal and scrap wood , Diepsloot is like so many of the enormous settlements around Johannesburg , mile after mile of feebly assembled shacks , the impromptu patchwork of the poor , the extremely poor and the hopelessly poor .
Monica Xangathi , 40 , lives here in a shanty she shares with her brother 's family .
" This is not the way I thought my life would turn out , " she said .
Her disappointment is not only with herself ; she is heartsick about her country .
Fourteen years after the end of apartheid , South Africa - the global pariah that became a global inspiration - has lapsed into gloom and anxiety about its future , surely not the harmonious " rainbow nation " so celebrated by Nelson Mandela on his inauguration day .
" If only I could make Nelson Mandela come back , " Xangathi said .
" If only I could feed him a potion and make him young again . "
This longing to propel the past into the present is rooted in more than fond reminiscence .
Two weeks ago , a vicious power struggle culminated in the governing African National Congress deposing one of its own , President Thabo Mbeki , and replacing him with a stand - in for Mbeki 's archrival , Jacob Zuma .
The past year has been more than acidic politics that have soured the national mood .
Economic growth slowed ; prices shot up .
Xenophobic riots broke out in several cities , with mobs killing dozens of impoverished foreigners .
The country 's power company unfathomably ran out of electricity and rationed supply .
Gone was the conceit that South Africa was the one place on the continent immune to such incompetence .
The rich purchased generators ; the poor muddled through with kerosene and paraffin .
Appalling violence
Other grievances were ruefully familiar .
While there is no dispute that South Africa has a high crime rate , the cruelty of the lawbreaking is more alarming than the number of incidents .
Robberies are often accompanied by appalling violence .
The poor apply padlocks in defense .
The rich surround their homes with concrete and barbed wire - and there are suggestions that more are simply fleeing the country .
In great measure , the tough realities of South Africa 's long haul after apartheid have simply replaced the halo of liberation 's first days .
Likewise , while Mandela seemed a saintly figure to many , his successors seem all too human .
" We are not the world 's greatest fairy tale , but rather a young , messy and not - always - predictable democracy , " said Mark Gevisser , a journalist and the author of " Thabo Mbeki : The Dream Deferred . "
Messy and unpredictable , yes .
Scandalous , too .
Mbeki was president for nine years , and his image slowly warped from someone aloof but well intentioned to someone secretive and conniving .
Mbeki's political nemesis is Zuma , whom he once fired as deputy president and who has image problems of his own .
In 2006 , he was tried on rape charges and acquitted .
More may be emigrating
The onslaught of unsettling news has proven too much for some with the means to flee .
No reliable numbers are kept on emigration , but it is believed to be on the increase .
Since 1996 , the black population has risen to a projected 38.5 million from 31.8 million .
The white population has dropped to a projected 4.5 million from 4.8 million .
John Loos , an economist at First National Bank of South Africa , who tracks the reasons given by people who sell homes in white suburban markets , said 9 percent cited emigration in the last quarter of 2007 .
In the first quarter of 2008 , the number rose to 12 percent and in the second quarter to 18 percent .
Minority groups , which include whites , Asians and people of mixed race , " are prone to overreacting about anything , " Loos said .
" We have people with the mind - set that this country is just another Zimbabwe in the making . "
It is easy to tap into such naysaying .
But there is a case to be made that pessimistic South Africans are looking at a glass that is actually more than half full yet describing it as near - empty .
Not so long ago , people feared that the end of apartheid would set off civil war and a bloodbath .
More jobs , higher incomes
Adam Habib , a political analyst , finds it understandable that the marginalized complain , and he invokes the term " relative deprivation . "
The gap between the rich and the poor may be widening , but the lot of the poor is improving , he said :
The unemployment rate , however horrendous , is in decline ; the incomes of the poor , however meager , are on the rise .
While some critics have likened Mbeki 's exit to a Stalinist purge , Habib , a deputy vice chancellor at the University of Johannesburg , pointed out that the transition was smooth and nonviolent .
" Our democracy is only 14 years old , " he said .
" Rather than calling this a crisis , people ought to ask how our institutions came together so well in so short a time . "
Sept. 11 ( Bloomberg ) -- John McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate sent a signal that he would end business as usual and cronyism in government .
Her record shows the Alaska governor engaged in some of the same practices she and McCain now condemn .
Palin's office approved a state job for a friend and campaign aide with whom she shared a land investment , financial records and interviews over the past two weeks show .
She hired a former lobbyist for a pipeline company to help oversee a multibillion - dollar deal with that same company .
She named a police chief accused of harassment to head the state police .
And she sent campaign e-mails on her city hall account while serving as mayor of Wasilla -- conduct for which she later turned in an oil commissioner on ethics charges .
These incidents raise ``some serious questions about her judgment and serious questions about her standards of ethics in public service , '' said James Thurber , director of American University 's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies in Washington .
Suggesting a real estate investment partner for a job ``may be acceptable in Alaska ; it would not be acceptable in Washington , D.C. , a place whose norms she wants to change . ''
Palin defeated an incumbent governor , a fellow Republican , in 2006 charging that her party 's old guard had committed ethical lapses and become too cozy with special interests , including oil companies .
A central theme in this year 's presidential campaign has been that Palin 's record demonstrates the change a McCain administration would bring to Washington .
Recent statements by the governor may erode that claim .
In her acceptance speech last week , she suggested that she opposed the infamous ``Bridge to Nowhere , '' a $ 223 million earmark for a bridge to an island where only 53 people lived .
For It , Against It
When Palin , 44 , campaigned for governor , however , she said she was in favor of the bridge .
In 2007 , she canceled the project in the face of national outrage .
The state never returned the money allocated by the federal government , with some of the funds going toward other state and local projects .
And as mayor of Wasilla , a job she held for six years until 2002 , Palin hired lobbyists to get federal funding for local projects .
Wasilla secured $ 27 million in earmarks for the town of about 9,000 that included a rail project and a youth center .
Shortly after she was elected governor , Palin 's office signed off on hiring Deborah Richter -- who attended college for a year then worked in bookkeeping and finance jobs -- as director of a division that distributes dividends to Alaskans from the state 's oil - wealth savings account .
Richter , who said she 's known Palin for 13 years , was Palin 's gubernatorial campaign treasurer and ran her inaugural committee .
Sharing an Investment
The Richters and Palins also shared an investment : 30 acres of rural property near a lake in Petersville , Alaska , worth $ 47,300 , according to Matanuska - Susitna Borough data .
`` It sounds like a patronage deal for someone who ran your campaign ; that 's pretty normal , '' said Bill Buzenberg , executive director of the Center for Public Integrity in Washington .
`` What 's not normal is that they have business dealings together . ''
No evidence has emerged to suggest that laws were broken in the appointment , and Richter said she ``did n't go in there with any promises from the governor or the chief of staff or anybody .
I turned in my resume '' to the governor 's transition team ``and I did n't know if anyone was going to call me . ''
`` She was qualified , '' said Pat Galvin , commissioner of the Department of Revenue and Richter 's boss .
Galvin said he also interviewed other people for the job and that Richter has done well .
He said Palin 's office approved his selection of Richter .
Not Palin's Decision
Palin 's gubernatorial spokesman , William McAllister , said the decision to hire Richter was Galvin's .
``I have no knowledge of land ownership or college degrees , '' he said .
Deborah Richter gave up her share of the property last September in a divorce settlement that followed an affair with Palin 's legislative director , John Bitney .
Bitney and Richter both acknowledged the affair in interviews .
Bitney said Palin fired him over it ; Richter is still on the job .
They are now married .
Last month , Palin signed a law granting TransCanada Corp. , Canada 's largest pipeline company , an exclusive state license and up to $ 500 million in subsidies to proceed with work on a $ 27 billion pipeline , which would carry natural gas from Alaska to other U.S. markets .
Once a Lobbyist
Marty Rutherford , the chief coordinator behind Palin 's pipeline effort , once worked as an Alaska lobbyist for a TransCanada pipeline subsidiary , according to state records .
Rutherford , deputy commissioner at the Alaska Department of Natural Resources , earned $ 40,200 as a lobbyist for 10 months in 2003 working for Foothills , the subsidiary .
Rutherford said in an interview that she only did consulting work for the company , including reviewing natural gas legislation .
She said the work had no bearing on her future job as coordinator of Palin 's pipeline team .
``I intended to leave state government when I went to Jade North , but as time went on I realized my heart was in government , '' she said , referring to the firm she briefly worked for .
Palin told the Anchorage Daily News last December that Rutherford 's work with Foothills was n't a conflict because it had been five years earlier .
Trooper Investigation
The governor already has triggered an investigation by the Alaska legislature into whether she fired the state commissioner of public safety , Walt Monegan , for not removing a state trooper involved in a contentious divorce from Palin 's sister .
Palin has denied exerting any pressure on Monegan and said she dismissed him because she wanted to take the department in a new direction .
Since McCain picked Palin , seven Palin aides have declined to be interviewed on the matter by an investigator hired by the Alaska legislature , according to the House and Senate Judiciary committees .
Earlier this year , Palin found herself apologizing for her handling of Monegan 's replacement .
About six weeks before she learned McCain wanted her to be his vice president , she named Kenai , Alaska , police chief Charles Kopp to replace Monegan .
On July 25 , two weeks after being appointed , Kopp resigned amid scrutiny over a 2005 sexual - harassment complaint against him while he was chief in Kenai .
The complaint resulted in a letter of reprimand from the city , which Palin told reporters she never knew about and had believed that the allegations were unsubstantiated , according to the Anchorage Daily News .
Not a Harasser
In a July press conference , Kopp denied any harassment .
``I 've always done every job I 've ever done with honor and integrity , '' he said .
`` There is one thing I am not .
I am not a sex harasser . ''
Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful .
Asked about these episodes in Palin 's career , McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds lauded her reform efforts .
Bounds said Palin has allowed the public to scrutinize state financial information , ``cut wasteful spending by a quarter of a billion dollars just last year and ushered in landmark ethics legislation . ''
The moment that crystallized her image as a reformer came when she turned in state Republican chairman Randy Ruedrich after discovering he was using his state e-mail account to conduct party business .
Palin and Ruedrich were serving together as commissioners on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , a state regulatory agency , at the time .
Ruedrich resigned from the commission in November 2003 , and was later fined $ 12,000 , according to a 2004 article in the Anchorage Daily News .
In 2006 , Palin found herself asking forgiveness for a similar offense from her past , according to a July 28 , 2006 , article in the Anchorage Daily News .
She had sent campaign e- mails from her Wasilla mayor 's office in 2002 , when she made an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor .
``For any mistakes like that ( were ) made , I apologize , '' Palin said of the e-mail controversy in July 2006 , according to the Anchorage Daily News .
As of Sept 30th , the debt was $ 10,024,724,896,912.49 .
The surge in the National Debt over the last two weeks has been because of the Supplementary Financing Program ( SFP ) with the Treasury raising cash for the Fed 's liquidity initiatives ( announced a couple of weeks ago ) .
Even though this rapid increase in the debt is being driven by the Fed 's liquidity initiatives ( and should be paid back ) , crossing $ 10 trillion is still quite an achievement ...
Hat tip Buzz !
This week the United States achieved another milestone under the “ leadership ” of Donald Trump .
More than 200,000 Americans have died as a result of his negligence , incompetence , and deliberate malfeasance in responding to the coronavirus pandemic .
Add to that the 6.7 million people who contracted the disease , many of whom will suffer permanent , debilitating disabilities .
This is unarguably a record of abject failure that translates into tragedy for millions of people .
Yet somehow Trump gives himself a A + for ranking near the bottom worldwide for managing this crisis .
The only area that he concedes falling short is in public relations , for which he gives himself a D .
Trump deserves some credit for recognizing how terrible his White House communications operations are .
For the most part they have ignored the traditional duties of conveying important information to the American people , choosing instead to conduct itself as an arm of Trump ’s 2020 reelection campaign .
And he has repeatedly been at odds with the medical experts on his Coronavirus Task Force .
No wonder the cases and fatalities stack up even as other countries are returning to relative normality .
At the helm of Trump ’s communications team is his press Secretary , Kayleigh McEnany .
She ’s an accomplished liar who is ably filling the shoes of her weasley predecessors Sean Spicer , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , and “ alternative facts ” spinner , Kellyanne Conway .
As evidence of McEnany ’s prowess for falsehoods , observe this response to a question from CNN ’s Jim Acosta :
Acosta :
The country has had over 200,000 deaths from coronavirus .
What do you say to Americans who are outraged over this and blame this administration for so many lives lost in this country ?
McEnany : Well , as you ’ve heard several doctors on the task force note from this podium , we were looking at the prospect of two million people perishing from the coronavirus in this country .
We grieve when even one life is lost , but the fact that we have come nowhere near that number is a testament to this president taking immediate action .
After shutting down travel from China , when the other party , Democrats were saying that was xenophobic ; for shutting down travel for Europe ; for developing landmark therapeutics that are working , like Remdesivir .
.@acosta :
What do you say to Americans who blame this administration for 200,000 Covid deaths ?
McENANY :
The fact that we have come nowhere near 2 million deaths is a testament to this president taking immediate action pic.twitter.com /Y5rHBLanG6 — Aaron Rupar ( @atrupar ) September 22 , 2020
There ’s a lot to unpack in that brief commentary .
To begin with , we were never “ looking at the prospect of two million people perishing . ”
That was a baseline estimate of fatalities if nothing were done at all to mitigate the spread of virus .
While Trump did n’t do very much , many governors and mayors took independent actions to shut down hazardous activities and to promote safe practices such as social distancing and the wearing of facial masks , both of which Trump dismissed and even mocked .
The two million fatality estimate was never intended to be a benchmark for success .
Trump himself used smaller numbers , beginning with fifteen and rising with reported deaths to 60,000 .
It ’s now more than three times that , and growing .
That ’s a testament to failure .
Furthermore , Trump never shut down travel from either China or Europe .
His restrictions were full of exemptions and he applied them too late , after the virus was already spreading in the U.S.
The criticism of his xenophobia was connected to his focus on China – even calling it the China virus – despite the fact that most of the cases in the U.S. were traceable to Europe .
And finally , McEnany summed up Trump ’s accomplishments by giving him credit for developing Remdesivir , a drug developed by Gilead Sciences in 2009 .
It ’s easy to see why Trump ’s PR operations are held in such low repute , even by him .
In the exchange above , McEnany never even answered Acosta ’s question .
But Trump ’s own efforts are n’t helping .
Just this weekend he made some ludicrous and blatantly false remarks about the coronavirus and it ’s potential for transmission :
“ Now we know [ the coronavirus ] .
It affects elderly people , elderly people with heart problems and other problems .
If they have other problems , that ’s what it really affects .
That ’s it .
In some states , thousands of people , nobody young below the age of eighteen , like nobody .
They have a strong immune system .
Who knows ?
Take your hat off to the young , cause they have a hell of an immune system .
But it affects virtually nobody .
It ’s an amazing thing . ”
Trump falsely tells supporters COVID - 19 affects " virtually nobody . "
pic.twitter.com/gM7KCyMbS1 — TPM Livewire ( @TPMLiveWire ) September 22 , 2020
You ’ll recall that just last week Trump was heard on recordings by Bob Woodward for his book , RAGE , saying that COVID - 19 affects “ not just old … older .
Young people too .
Plenty of young people . ”
That was in addition to his admission that he knew from the start how deadly it was , but was playing it down .
200,000 are a lot of “ nobodies . ”
But it was always Trump ’s intention to trivialize the massive amount of suffering for which he is directly responsible .
That explains the fallacies disseminated by his PR team .
However , it is n’t because they performed poorly .
In fact , it was probably the best performing agency in his administration .
That ’s because they were saying precisely what Trump wanted them to say .
McEnany and company were lying on Trump ’s behalf and at his direction .
So it ’s unfair of him to grade them with a D , when they were just doing what they were told .
They may have been grossly misinforming the public and putting untold lives at risk , but they were doing exactly the job that Trump hired them to do .
Misconceptions About Biological Weapons
Anthrax
Biological Weapons Production
The Bottom Line
Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge , chief medical officer at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , told a congressional subcommittee on July 22 that the risk of a large - scale biological attack on the nation is significant and that the U.S. government knows its terrorist enemies have sought to use biological agents as instruments of warfare .
Runge also said that the United States believes that capability is within the terrorists ' reach .
Runge gave his testimony before a subcommittee on Emerging Threats , Cybersecurity , and Science and Technology that was holding a field hearing in Providence , R.I. , to discuss the topic of " Emerging Biological Threats and Public Health Preparedness . "
During his testimony , Runge specifically pointed to al Qaeda as the most significant threat and testified that the United States had determined that the terrorist organization is seeking to develop and use a biological weapon to cause mass casualties in an attack .
According to Runge , U.S. analysis indicates that anthrax is the most likely choice , and a successful single - city attack on an unprepared population could kill hundreds of thousands of citizens .
Later in his testimony , Runge remarked that many do not perceive the threat of bioterrorism to be as significant as that of a nuclear or conventional strike , even though such an attack could kill as many people as a nuclear detonation and have its own long - term environmental effects .
We must admit to being among those who do not perceive the threat of bioterrorism to be as significant as that posed by a nuclear strike .
To be fair , it must be noted that we also do not see strikes using chemical or radiological weapons rising to the threshold of a true weapon of mass destruction either .
The successful detonation of a nuclear weapon in an American city would be far more devastating than any of these other forms of attack .
In fact , based on the past history of nonstate actors conducting attacks using biological weapons , we remain skeptical that a nonstate actor could conduct a biological weapons strike capable of creating as many casualties as a large strike using conventional explosives — such as the October 2002 Bali bombings that resulted in 202 deaths or the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid that killed 191 .
We do not disagree with Runge 's statements that actors such as al Qaeda have demonstrated an interest in biological weapons .
There is ample evidence that al Qaeda has a rudimentary biological weapons capability .
However , there is a huge chasm of capability that separates intent and a rudimentary biological weapons program from a biological weapons program that is capable of killing hundreds of thousands of people .
There are many misconceptions involving biological weapons .
The three most common are that they are easy to obtain , that they are easy to deploy effectively , and that , when used , they always cause massive casualties .
While it is certainly true that there are many different types of actors who can easily gain access to rudimentary biological agents , there are far fewer actors who can actually isolate virulent strains of the agents , weaponize them and then effectively employ these agents in a manner that will realistically pose a significant threat of causing mass casualties .
While organisms such as anthrax are present in the environment and are not difficult to obtain , more highly virulent strains of these tend to be far more difficult to locate , isolate and replicate .
Such efforts require highly skilled individuals and sophisticated laboratory equipment .
Even incredibly deadly biological substances such as ricin and botulinum toxin are difficult to use in mass attacks .
This difficulty arises when one attempts to take a rudimentary biological substance and then convert it into a weaponized form — a form that is potent enough to be deadly and yet readily dispersed .
Even if this weaponization hurdle can be overcome , once developed , the weaponized agent must then be integrated with a weapons system that can effectively take large quantities of the agent and evenly distribute it in lethal doses to the intended targets .
During the past several decades in the era of modern terrorism , biological weapons have been used very infrequently and with very little success .
This fact alone serves to highlight the gap between the biological warfare misconceptions and reality .
Militant groups desperately want to kill people and are constantly seeking new innovations that will allow them to kill larger numbers of people .
Certainly if biological weapons were as easily obtained , as easily weaponized and as effective at producing mass casualties as commonly portrayed , militant groups would have used them far more frequently than they have .
Militant groups are generally adaptive and responsive to failure .
If something works , they will use it .
If it does not , they will seek more effective means of achieving their deadly goals .
A good example of this was the rise and fall of the use of chlorine in militant attacks in Iraq .
As noted by Runge , the spore - forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis is readily available in nature and can be deadly if inhaled , if ingested or if it comes into contact with a person 's skin .
What constitutes a deadly dose of inhalation anthrax has not been precisely quantified , but is estimated to be somewhere between 8,000 and 50,000 spores .
One gram of weaponized anthrax , such as that contained in the letters mailed to U.S. Sens .
Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in October 2001 , can contain up to one trillion spores — enough to cause somewhere between 20 and 100 million deaths .
The letters mailed to Daschle and Leahy reportedly contained about one gram each for a total estimated quantity of two grams of anthrax spores : enough to have theoretically killed between 40 and 200 million people .
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the current population of the United States is 304.7 million .
In a worst - case scenario , the letters mailed to Daschle and Leahy theoretically contained enough anthrax spores to kill nearly two - thirds of the U.S. population .
Yet , in spite of their incredibly deadly potential , those letters ( along with an estimated five other anthrax letters mailed in a prior wave to media outlets such as the New York Post and the major television networks ) killed only five people ; another 22 victims were infected by the spores but recovered after receiving medical treatment .
This difference between the theoretical number of fatal victims — hundreds of millions — and the actual number of victims — five — highlights the challenges in effectively distributing even a highly virulent and weaponized strain of an organism to a large number of potential victims .
To summarize : obtaining a biological agent is fairly simple .
Isolating a virulent strain and then weaponizing that strain is somewhat more difficult .
But the key to biological warfare — effectively distributing a weaponized agent to the intended target — is the really difficult part of the process .
Anyone planning a biological attack against a large target such as a city needs to be concerned about a host of factors such as dilution , wind velocity and direction , particle size and weight , the susceptibility of the disease to ultraviolet light , heat , dryness or even rain .
Small - scale localized attacks such as the 2001 anthrax letters or the 1984 salmonella attack undertaken by the Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh cult are far easier to commit .
It is also important to remember that anthrax is not some sort of untreatable super disease .
While anthrax does form hardy spores that can remain inert for a period of time , the disease is not easily transmitted from person to person , and therefore is unlikely to create an epidemic outside of the area targeted by the attack .
Anthrax infections can be treated by the use of readily available antibiotics .
The spores ' incubation period also permits time for early treatment if the attack is noticed .
The deadliest known anthrax incident in recent years occurred in 1979 when an accidental release of aerosolized spores from a Soviet biological weapons facility in Sverdlovsk affected some 94 people — reportedly killing 68 of them .
This facility was one of dozens of laboratories that were part of the Soviet Union 's massive and well - funded biological weapons program , one that employed thousands of the country 's brightest scientists .
In fact , it was the largest biological weapons program in history .
Perhaps the largest attempt by a nonstate actor to cause mass casualties using anthrax was the series of attacks conducted in 1993 by the Japanese cult group Aum Shinrikyo in Tokyo .
In the late 1980s , Aum 's team of trained scientists spent millions of dollars to develop a series of state - of - the - art biological weapons research and production laboratories .
The group experimented with botulinum toxin , anthrax , cholera and Q fever and even tried to acquire the Ebola virus .
The group hoped to produce enough biological agent to trigger a global Armageddon .
Its first attempts at unleashing mega - death on the world involved the use of botulinum toxin .
In April 1990 , the group used a fleet of three trucks equipped with aerosol sprayers to release liquid botulinum toxin on targets that included the Imperial Palace , the National Diet of Japan , the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo , two U.S. naval bases and the airport in Narita .
In spite of the massive quantities of toxin released , there were no mass casualties , and , in fact , nobody outside of the cult was even aware the attacks had taken place .
When the botulinum operations failed to produce results , Aum 's scientists went back to the drawing board and retooled their biological weapons facilities to produce anthrax .
By mid-1993 , they were ready to launch attacks involving anthrax ; between June and August of 1993 , the group sprayed thousands of gallons of aerosolized liquid anthrax in Tokyo .
This time , Aum not only employed its fleet of sprayer trucks but also used aerosol sprayers mounted on the roof of their headquarters to disperse a cloud of aerosolized anthrax over the city .
Again , the attacks produced no results and were not even noticed .
It was only after the group 's successful 1995 subway attacks using sarin nerve agent that a Japanese government investigation discovered that the 1990 and 1993 biological attacks had occurred .
Aum Shinrikyo's team of highly trained scientists worked under ideal conditions in a first - world country with a virtually unlimited budget .
They were able to travel the world in search of deadly organisms and even received technical advice from former Soviet scientists .
The team worked in large , modern laboratory facilities to produce substantial quantities of biological weapons .
They were able to operate these facilities inside industrial parks and openly order the large quantities of laboratory equipment they required .
Yet , in spite of the millions of dollars the group spent on its biological weapons program — and the lack of any meaningful interference from the Japanese government —
Aum still experienced problems in creating virulent biological agents and also found it difficult to dispense those agents effectively .
Today , al Qaeda finds itself operating in a very different environment than that experienced by Aum Shinrikyo in 1993 .
At that time , nobody was looking for Aum or its biological and chemical weapons program .
By contrast , since the Sept. 11 attacks , the United States and its allies have actively pursued al Qaeda leaders and sought to dismantle and defang the organization .
The United States and its allies have focused a considerable amount of resources in tracking and disassembling al Qaeda 's chemical and biological warfare efforts .
The al Qaeda network has had millions of dollars of its assets seized in a number of countries , and it no longer has the safe haven of Afghanistan from which to operate .
The chemical and biological facilities the group established in the 1990s in Afghanistan — such as the Deronta training camp , where cyanide and other toxins were used to kill dogs , and a crude anthrax production facility in Kandahar — have been found and destroyed by U.S. troops .
Operating in the badlands along the Pakistani - Afghan border , al Qaeda cannot easily build large modern factories capable of producing large quantities of agents or toxins .
Such fixed facilities are expensive and consume a lot of resources .
Even if al Qaeda had the spare capacity to invest in such facilities , the fixed nature of them means that they could be compromised and quickly destroyed by the United States .
If al Qaeda could somehow create and hide a fixed biological weapons facility in Pakistan 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas or North - West Frontier Province , it would still face the daunting task of transporting large quantities of biological agents from the Pakistani badlands to targets in the United States or Europe .
Al Qaeda operatives certainly can create and transport small quantities of these compounds , but not enough to wreak the kind of massive damage it desires .
Al Qaeda 's lead chemical and biological weapons expert , Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , was reportedly killed on July 28 , 2008 , by a U.S. missile strike on his home in Pakistan .
Al - Sayid , who had a $ 5 million dollar bounty on his head , was initially reported to have been one of those killed in the January 2006 strike in Damadola .
If he was indeed killed , his death should be another significant blow to the group 's biological warfare efforts .
Of course , we must recognize that the jihadist threat goes just beyond the al Qaeda core .
As we have been writing for several years now , al Qaeda has undergone a metamorphosis from a smaller core group of professional operatives into an operational model that encourages independent grassroots jihadists to conduct attacks .
The core al Qaeda group , through men like al - Sayid , has published manuals in hard copy and on the Internet that provide instructions on how to manufacture rudimentary biological weapons .
It is our belief that independent jihadist cells and lone - wolf jihadists will almost certainly attempt to brew up some of the recipes from the al Qaeda cookbook .
There also exists a very real threat that a jihadist sympathizer could obtain a small quantity of deadly biological organisms by infiltrating a research facility .
This means that we likely will see some limited attempts at employing biological weapons .
That does not mean , however , that such attacks will be large - scale or create mass casualties .
While there has been much consternation and alarm - raising over the potential for widespread proliferation of biological weapons and the possible use of such weapons on a massive scale , there are significant constraints on such designs .
The current dearth of substantial biological weapons programs and arsenals by governments worldwide , and the even smaller number of cases in which systems were actually used , seems to belie — or at least bring into question — the intense concern about such programs .
While we would like to believe that countries such as the United States , the United Kingdom and Russia have halted their biological warfare programs for some noble ideological or humanitarian reason , we simply can't .
If biological weapons were in practice as effective as some would lead us to believe , these states would surely maintain stockpiles of them , just as they have maintained their nuclear weapons programs .
Biological weapons programs were abandoned because they proved to be not as effective as advertised and because conventional munitions proved to provide more bang for the buck .
In some ways , the psychological fear of a " super weapon " — undetectable , microscopic , easily delivered and extremely deadly — shapes assessment of the threat , more so than an objective understanding of actual capability and intent ( not to mention the extreme difficulties of ever creating some sort of a super bug ) .
Conventional weapons systems , and unconventional tactics , continue to be the most cost - effective and proven methods of warfare , whether between state actors or between state and nonstate actors .
Nuclear weapons have also been shown to have true weapons of mass destruction power .
To help keep the cost - benefit calculation of a biological warfare program in perspective , consider that Seung - Hui Cho , the man who committed the shooting at Virginia Tech , killed 32 people — more than six times as many as were killed by the 2001 anthrax letters .
John Mohammed , the so - called " D.C. Sniper , " was able to cause a considerable amount of panic and kill twice as many people ( 10 ) by simply purchasing and using one assault rifle .
Compare Mohammed 's effort and expenses to that of the Aum Shinrikyo anthrax program that took years of work by a huge team and millions of dollars to develop but infected no one .
Now , just because biological weapons are not all they are cracked up to be does not mean that efforts to undermine the biological warfare plans and efforts of militant groups such as al Qaeda should not continue or that programs to detect such agents or develop more effective treatments and vaccines should be halted .
Even though an anthrax attack probably will not kill huge numbers of people , as we saw in the case of the anthrax letters , such an attack can be quite disruptive .
Cleaning up after such an attack is expensive and takes considerable time and effort .
Like a dirty bomb , an anthrax attack will more likely serve as a weapon of mass disruption and not a weapon of mass destruction .
Due to the disruption and the potential for some deaths as a result of an anthrax attack , the threat against the United States does remain a significant concern .
However , the threat it represents is not as great as that of conventional attacks using firearms and explosives against soft targets , and it certainly does not rise anywhere near the level of a threat posed by a terrorist attack using a nuclear weapon .
Homeland security resources are very limited and have been shrinking as we move further from 9/11 and as other items begin to take precedence in the federal budget .
This means that an array of different programs is being forced to scramble for an ever - shrinking piece of the funding pie .
In such an environment , it is often a temptation to overstate the threat .
Such overstatements are harmful because they can sometimes prevent a rational distribution of resources and prevent resources from being allocated to where they are needed most .

HOW I WORK
My formal charge in this essay is to talk about my " life philosophy " .
Let me make it clear at the outset that I have no intention of following instructions , since I do n't know anything special about life in general .
I believe it was Schumpeter who claimed to be not only the best economist , but also the best horseman and the best lover in his native Austria .
I do n't ride horses , and have few illusions on other scores .
( I am , however , a pretty good cook ) .
What I want to talk about in this essay is something more restricted : some thoughts about thinking , and particularly how to go about doing interesting economics .
I think that among economists of my generation I can claim to have a fairly distinctive intellectual style -- not necessarily a better style than my colleagues , for there are many ways to be a good economist , but one that has served me well .
The essence of that style is a general research strategy that can be summarized in a few rules ; I also view my more policy - oriented writing and speaking as ultimately grounded in the same principles .
I 'll get to my rules for research later in this essay .
I think I can best introduce those rules , however , by describing how ( it seems to me ) I stumbled into the way I work .
ORIGINS
Most young economists today enter the field from the technical end .
Originally intending a career in hard science or engineering , they slip down the scale into the most rigorous of the social sciences .
The advantages of entering economics from that direction are obvious : one arrives already well trained in mathematics , one finds the concept of formal modeling natural .
It is not , however , where I come from .
My first love was history ; I studied little math , picking up what I needed as I went along .
Nonetheless , I got deeply involved in economics early , working as a research assistant ( on world energy markets ) to William Nordhaus while still only a junior at Yale .
Graduate school followed naturally , and I wrote my first really successful paper -- a theoretical analysis of balance of payments crises -- while still at MIT .
I discovered that I was facile with small mathematical models , with a knack for finding simplifying assumptions that made them tractable .
Still , when I left graduate school I was , in my own mind at least , somewhat directionless .
I was not sure what to work on ; I was not even sure whether I really liked research .
I found my intellectual feet quite suddenly , in January 1978 .
Feeling somewhat lost , I paid a visit to my old advisor Rudi Dornbusch .
I described several ideas to him , including a vague notion that the monopolistic competition models I had studied in a short course offered by Bob Solow -- especially the lovely little model of Dixit and Stiglitz -- might have something to do with international trade .
Rudi flagged that idea as potentially very interesting indeed ; I went home to work on it seriously ; and within a few days I realized that I had hold of something that would form the core of my professional life .
What had I found ?
The point of my trade models was not particularly startling once one thought about it : economies of scale could be an independent cause of international trade , even in the absence of comparative advantage .
This was a new insight to me , but had ( as I soon discovered ) been pointed out many times before by critics of conventional trade theory .
The models I worked out left some loose ends hanging ; in particular , they typically had many equilibria .
Even so , to make the models tractable I had to make obviously unrealistic assumptions .
And once I had made those assumptions , the models were trivially simple ; writing them up left me no opportunity to display any high - powered technique .
So one might have concluded that I was doing nothing very interesting ( and that was what some of my colleagues were to tell me over the next few years ) .
Yet what I saw -- and for some reason saw almost immediately -- was that all of these features were virtues , not vices , that they added up to a program that could lead to years of productive research .
I was , of course , only saying something that critics of conventional theory had been saying for decades .
Yet my point was not part of the mainstream of international economics .
Why ?
Because it had never been expressed in nice models .
The new monopolistic competition models gave me a tool to open cleanly what had previously been regarded as a can of worms .
More important , however , I suddenly realized the remarkable extent to which the methodology of economics creates blind spots .
We just do n't see what we can't formalize .
And the biggest blind spot of all has involved increasing returns .
So there , right at hand , was my mission : to look at things from a slightly different angle , and in so doing to reveal the obvious , things that had been right under our noses all the time .
The models I wrote down that winter and spring were incomplete , if one demanded of them that they specify exactly who produced what .
And yet they told meaningful stories .
It took me a long time to express clearly what I was doing , but eventually I realized that one way to deal with a difficult problem is to change the question -- in particular by shifting levels .
A detailed analysis may be extremely nasty , yet an aggregative or systemic description that is far easier may tell you all you need to know .
To get this system or aggregate level description required , of course , accepting the basically silly assumptions of symmetry that underlay the Dixit - Stiglitz and related models .
Yet these silly assumptions seemed to let me tell stories that were persuasive , and that could not be told using the hallowed assumptions of the standard competitive model .
What I began to realize was that in economics we are always making silly assumptions ; it 's just that some of them have been made so often that they come to seem natural .
And so one should not reject a model as silly until one sees where its assumptions lead .
Finally , the simplicity of the models may have frustrated my lingering urge to show off the technical skills I had so laboriously acquired in graduate school , but was , I soon realized , central to the enterprise .
Trade theorists had failed to address the role of increasing returns , not out of empirical conviction , but because they thought it was too hard to model .
How much more effective , then , to show that it could be almost childishly simple ?
And so , before my 25th birthday , I basically knew what I was going to do with my professional life .
I do n't know what would have happened if my grand project had met with rejection from other economists -- perhaps I would have turned cranky , perhaps I would have lost faith and abandoned the effort .
But in fact all went astonishingly well .
In my own mind , the curve of my core research since that January of 1978 has followed a remarkably consistent path .
Within a few months , I had written up a basic monopolistic competition trade model -- as it turned out , simultaneously and independently with similar models by Avinash Dixit and Victor Norman , on one side , and Kelvin Lancaster , on the other .
I had some trouble getting that paper published -- receiving the dismissive rejection by a flagship journal ( the QJE ) that seems to be the fate of every innovation in economics -- but pressed on .
From 1978 to roughly the end of 1984 I focussed virtually all my research energies on the role of increasing returns and imperfect competition in international trade .
( I took one year off to work in the US government ; but more about that below ) .
What had been a personal quest turned into a movement , as others followed the same path .
Above all , Elhanan Helpman -- a deep thinker whose integrity and self - discipline were useful counterparts to my own flakiness and disorganization -- first made crucial contibutions himself , then talked me into collaborative work .
Our magnum opus , Market Structure and Foreign Trade , served the purpose of making our ideas not only respectable but almost standard : iconoclasm to orthodoxy in seven years .
For whatever reason , I allowed my grand project on increasing returns to lie fallow for a few years in the 1980s , and turned my attention to international finance .
My work in this area consisted primarily of small models inspired by current policy issues ; although these models lacked the integrating theme of my trade models , I think that my finance work is to some extent unified by its intellectual style , which is very similar to that of my work on trade .
In 1990 I returned to the economics of increasing returns from a new direction .
I suddenly realized that the techniques that had allowed us to legitimize the role of increasing returns in trade could also be used to reclaim a whole outcast field : that of economic geography , the location of activity in space .
Here , perhaps even more than in trade , was a field full of empirical insights , good stories , and obvious practical importance , lying neglected right under our noses because nobody had seen a good way to formalize it .
For me , it was like reliving the best moments of my intellectual childhood .
Doing geography is hard work ; it requires a lot of hard thinking to make the models look trivial , and I am increasingly finding that I need the computer as an aid not just to data analysis but even to theorizing .
Yet it is immensely rewarding .
For me , the biggest thrill in theory is the moment when your model tells you something that should have been obvious all along , something that you can immediately relate to what you know about the world , and yet which you did n't really appreciate .
Geography still has that thrill .
My work on geography seems , at the time of writing , to be leading me even further afield .
In particular , there are obvious affinities between the concepts that arise naturally in geographic models and the language of traditional development economics -- the " high development theory " that flourished in the 1940s and 50s , then collapsed .
So I expect that my basic research project will continue to widen in scope .
RULES FOR RESEARCH
In the course of describing my formative moment in 1978 , I have already implicitly given my four basic rules for research .
Let me now state them explicitly , then explain .
Here are the rules :
1. Listen to the Gentiles
2. Question the question
3 . Dare to be silly
4. Simplify , simplify
Listen to the Gentiles
What I mean by this rule is " Pay attention to what intelligent people are saying , even if they do not have your customs or speak your analytical language . "
The point may perhaps best be explained by example .
When I began my rethinking of international trade , there was already a sizeable literature criticizing conventional trade theory .
Empiricists pointed out that trade took place largely between countries with seemingly similar factor endowments , and that much of this trade involved intra-industry exchanges of seemingly similar products .
Acute observers pointed to the importance of economies of scale and imperfect competition in actual international markets .
Yet all of this intelligent commentary was ignored by mainstream trade theorists -- after all , their critics often seemed to have an imperfect understanding of comparative advantage , and had no coherent models of their own to offer ; so why pay attention to them ?
The result was that the profession overlooked evidence and stories that were right under its nose .
The same story is repeated in geography .
Geographers and regional scientists have amassed a great deal of evidence on the nature and importance of localized external economies , and organized that evidence intelligently if not rigorously .
Yet economists have ignored what they had to say , because it comes from people speaking the wrong language .
I do not mean to say that formal economic analysis is worthless , and that anybody 's opinion on economic matters is as good as anyone else 's .
On the contrary !
I am a strong believer in the importance of models , which are to our minds what spear - throwers were to stone age arms : they greatly extend the power and range of our insight .
In particular , I have no sympathy for those people who criticize the unrealistic simplifications of model - builders , and imagine that they achieve greater sophistication by avoiding stating their assumptions clearly .
The point is to realize that economic models are metaphors , not truth .
By all means express your thoughts in models , as pretty as possible ( more on that below ) .
But always remember that you may have gotten the metaphor wrong , and that someone else with a different metaphor may be seeing something that you are missing .
Question the question
There was a limited literature on external economies and international trade before 1978 .
It was never , however , very influential , because it seemed terminally messy ; even the simplest models became bogged down in a taxonomy of possible outcomes .
What has since become clear is that this messiness arose in large part because the modelers were asking their models to do what traditional trade models do , which is to predict a precise pattern of specialization and trade .
Yet why ask that particular question ?
Even in the Heckscher - Ohlin model , the point you want to make is something like " A country tends to export goods whose production is intensive in the factors in which that country is abundant " ; if your specific model tells you that capital - abundant country
Home exports capital - intensive good X , this is valuable because it sharpens your understanding of that insight , not because you really care about these particular details of a patently oversimplified model .
It turns out that if you do n't ask for the kind of detail that you get in the two - sector , two - good classical model , an external economy model need n't be at all messy .
As long as you ask " system " questions like how welfare and world income are distributed , it is possible to make very simple and neat models .
And it 's really these system questions that we are interested in .
The focus on excessive detail was , to put it bluntly , a matter of carrying over ingrained prejudices from an overworked model into a domain where they only made life harder .
The same is true in a number of areas in which I have worked .
In general , if people in a field have bogged down on questions that seem very hard , it is a good idea to ask whether they are really working on the right questions .
Often some other question is not only easier to answer but actually more interesting !
( One drawback of this trick is that it often gets people angry .
An academic who has spent years on a hard problem is rarely grateful when you suggest that his field can be revived by bypassing it ) .
Dare to be silly
If you want to publish a paper in economic theory , there is a safe approach : make a conceptually minor but mathematically difficult extension to some familiar model .
Because the basic assumptions of the model are already familiar , people will not regard them as strange ; because you have done something technically difficult , you will be respected for your demonstration of firepower .
Unfortunately , you will not have added much to human knowledge .
What I found myself doing in the new trade theory was pretty much the opposite .
I found myself using assumptions that were unfamiliar , and doing very simple things with them .
Doing this requires a lot of self - confidence , because initially people ( especially referees ) are almost certain not simply to criticize your work but to ridicule it .
After all , your assumptions will surely look peculiar : a continuum of goods all with identical production functions , entering symmetrically into utility ?
Countries of identical economic size , with mirror - image factor endowments ?
Why , people will ask , should they be interested in a model with such silly assumptions -- especially when there are evidently much smarter young people who demonstrate their quality by solving hard problems ?
What seems terribly hard for many economists to accept is that all our models involve silly assumptions .
Given what we know about cognitive psychology , utility maximization is a ludicrous concept ; equilibrium pretty foolish outside of financial markets ; perfect competition a howler for most industries .
The reason for making these assumptions is not that they are reasonable but that they seem to help us produce models that are helpful metaphors for things that we think happen in the real world .
Consider the example which some economists seem to think is not simply a useful model but revealed divine truth : the Arrow - Debreu model of perfect competition with utility maximization and complete markets .
This is indeed a wonderful model -- not because its assumptions are remotely plausible but because it helps us think more clearly about both the nature of economic efficiency and the prospects for achieving efficiency under a market system .
It is actually a piece of inspired , marvellous silliness .
What I believe is that the age of creative silliness is not past .
Virtue , as an economic theorist , does not consist in squeezing the last drop of blood out of assumptions that have come to seem natural because they have been used in a few hundred earlier papers .
If a new set of assumptions seems to yield a valuable set of insights , then never mind if they seem strange .
Simplify , simplify
The injunction to dare to be silly is not a license to be undisciplined .
In fact , doing really innovative theory requires much more intellectual discipline than working in a well - established literature .
What is really hard is to stay on course : since the terrain is unfamilar , it is all too easy to find yourself going around in circles .
Somewhere or other Keynes wrote that " it is astonishing what foolish things a man thinking alone can come temporarily to believe " .
And it is also crucial to express your ideas in a way that other people , who have not spent the last few years wrestling with your problems and are not eager to spend the next few years wrestling with your answers , can understand without too much effort .
Fortunately , there is a strategy that does double duty : it both helps you keep control of your own insights , and makes those insights accessible to others .
The strategy is : always try to express your ideas in the simplest possible model .
The act of stripping down to this minimalist model will force you to get to the essence of what you are trying to say ( and will also make obvious to you those situations in which you actually have nothing to say ) .
And this minimalist model will then be easy to explain to other economists as well .
I have used the " minimum necessary model " approach over and over again : using a one - factor , one - industry model to explain the basic role of monopolistic competition in trade ; assuming sector - specific labor rather than full Heckscher - Ohlin factor substitution to explain the effects of intraindustry trade ; working with symmetric countries to assess the role of reciprocal dumping ; and so on .
In each case the effect has been to allow me to tackle a subject widely viewed as formidably difficult with what appears , at first sight , to be ridiculous simplicity .
The downside of this strategy is , of course , that many of your colleagues will tend to assume that an insight that can be expressed in a cute little model must be trivial and obvious -- it takes some sophistication to realize that simplicity may be the result of years of hard thinking .
I have heard the story that when Joseph Stiglitz was being considered for tenure at Yale , one of his senior colleagues belittled his work , saying that it consisted mostly of little models rather than deep theorems .
Another colleague then asked , " But could n't you say the same about Paul Samuelson " ?
" Yes , I could " , replied Joe 's opponent .
I have heard the same reaction to my own work .
Luckily , there are enough sophisticated economists around that in the end intellectual justice is usually served .
And there is a special delight in managing not only to boldly go where no economist has gone before , but to do so in a way that seems after the fact to be almost childs ' play .
I have now described my basic rules for research .
I have illustrated them with my experience in developing the " new trade theory " and with my more recent extension of that work to economic geography , because these are the core of my work .
But I have also done quite a lot of other stuff , which ( it seems to me ) is also in some sense part of the same enterprise .
So in the remainder of this essay I want to talk about this other work , and in particular about how the policy economist and the analytical economist can coexist in the same person .
POLICY - RELEVANT WORK
Most economic theorists keep their hands off current policy issues -- or if they do get involved in policy debates , do so only after the midpoint of their career , as something that follows creative theorizing rather than coexists with it .
There seems to be a consensus that the clarity and singleness of purpose required to do good theory are incompatible with the tolerance for messy issues required to be active in policy discussion .
For me , however , it has never worked that way .
I have interspersed my academic career with a number of consulting ventures for various governments and public agencies , as well as a full year in the US government .
I have also written a book , The Age of Diminished Expectations , aimed at a non-technical audience .
And I have written a pretty steady stream of papers that are motivated not by the inner logic of my research but by the attempt to make sense of some currently topical policy debate -- e.g. , Third World debt relief , target zones for exchange rates , the rise of regional trading blocs .
All of this has n't seemed to hurt my research , and indeed some of my favorite papers have grown out of this policy - oriented work .
Why does n't policy - relevant work seem to conflict with my " real " research ?
I think that it 's because I have been able to approach policy issues using almost exactly the same method that I use in my more basic work .
Paying attention to newspaper reports or the concerns of central bankers and finance ministers is just another form of listening to the Gentiles .
Trying to find a useful way of defining their problems is pretty much the same as questioning the question in theory .
Confronting supposedly knowledgeable people with an unorthodox view of an issue certainly requires the courage to be silly .
And of course , ruthless simplification is worth even more in policy discussion than in theory for its own sake .
So doing policy - relevant economics does not , for me , mean a drastic change in intellectual style .
And it has its own payoffs .
Let 's be honest and admit that these include invitations to fancier conferences and speaking engagements at much higher fees than an academic purist is likely to get .
Let 's also admit that one of the joys of policy research is the opportunity to shock the bourgeoisie , to point out the hollowness or silliness of official positions .
For example , I know that I was not the only international economist to have some fun pointing out the absurdities of the Maastricht Treaty , and was not above some wicked pleasure when the ERM crisis I and others had long predicted actually came to pass in the fall of 1992 .
The main payoff to policy work , though , is intellectual stimulation .
Not all real - world questions are interesting -- I find that almost anything having to do with taxation is better than a sleeping pill -- but every couple of years , if not more often , the international economy throws up a question that gives rise to exciting research .
I have been stimulated to write theory papers by the Plaza and the Louvre , by the Brady Plan , NAFTA , and EMU .
All of them are papers that I think could stand on their own , even without the policy context .
There is , of course , always a risk that an economist who gets onto the policy circuit will no longer have enough time for real research .
I certainly write an awfully large number of conference papers ; I am a very fast writer , but perhaps it is a gift I overuse .
Still , I think that the big danger of doing policy research is not so much the drain on your time as the threat to your values .
It is easy to be seduced into the belief that direct influence on policy is more important than just writing papers -- I 've seen it happen to many colleagues .
Once you start down that road , once you begin to think that David Mulford matters more than Bob Solow , or to prefer hobnobbing with the Ruritanian finance minister to talking theory with Avinash Dixit , you are probably lost to research .
Pretty soon you 'll probably start using " impact " as a verb .
Fortunately , while I love playing around with policy issues , I have never been able to take policy makers very seriously .
This lack of seriousness gets me into occasional trouble -- like the time that a gentle parenthetical joke about the French in a conference paper led to an extended diatribe from the French official attending the conference -- and may exclude me from ever holding any important policy position .
But that 's OK : in the end , I would rather write a few more good papers than hold a position of real power .
( Note to the policy world : this does n't mean that I would necessarily turn down such a position if it were offered ! )
REGRETS
There are a lot of things about my life and personality that I regret -- if things have gone astonishingly well for me professionally , they have been by no means as easy or happy elsewhere .
But in this essay I only want to talk about professional regrets .
A minor regret is that I have never engaged in really serious empirical work .
It 's not that I dislike facts or real numbers .
Indeed , I find light empirical work in the form of tables , charts , and perhaps a few regressions quite congenial .
But the serious business of building and thoroughly analyzing a data set is something I never seem to get around to .
I think that this is partly because many of my ideas do not easily lend themselves to standard econometric testing .
Mostly , though , it is because I lack the patience and organizational ability .
Every year I promise to try to do some real empirical work .
Next year I really will !
A more important regret is that while the MIT course evaluations rate me as a pretty good lecturer , I have not yet succeeded in generating a string of really fine students , the kind who reflect glory on their teacher .
I can make excuses for this failing -- students often prefer advisers who are more methodical and less intuitive , and I all too often scare students off by demanding that they use less math and more economics .
It 's also true that I probably seem busy and distracted , and perhaps I am just not imposing enough in person to be inspiring ( if I were only a few inches taller ... ) .
Whatever the reasons , I wish I could do better , and intend to try .
All in all , though , I 've been very lucky .
A lot of that luck has to do with the accidents that led me to stumble onto an intellectual style that has served me extremely well .
I 've tried , in this essay , to define and explain that style .
Is this a life philosophy ?
Of course not .
I 'm not even sure that it is an economic research philosophy , since what works for one economist may not work for another .
But it 's how I do research , and it works for me .
Federal court blocks ACLU from Guantanamo torture documents Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union has condemned a Wednesday decision by a federal judge that prevents its access to unredacted records from the Bush administration related to the detention of 14 suspected " enemy combatants " at Guantánamo Bay .
The records of Combatant Status Review Tribunals contain the detainees ' personal accounts of interrogation tactics , including waterboarding , sleep deprivation , extreme temperature exposure and stress positions , that they endured while in custody at secret CIA detention facilities known as " black sites " for up to four years , and then Guantánamo in late 2006 .
Some records of the tribunals , which took place in March and April of 2007 , have been released , but none that contain said accounts .
" This decision allows the Bush administration to continue its illegal cover - up of its systemic torture policies , " said Ben Wizner , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
" The government has suppressed these detainees  allegations of brutal torture not to protect any legitimate national security interests , but to protect itself from criticism and liability .
It is unlawful for the government to withhold information on these grounds . "
The judge 's decision is available here ( .pdf ) .
The lawsuit , filed by the ACLU in March , called for the records from the Department of Defense and the CIA on First Amendment grounds and in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act , per the request submitted in April of 2007 .
" Since this FOIA request was submitted , " the complaint reads , " the government has formally confirmed that three of the fourteen prisoners were subjected to the brutal practice of ' waterboarding , ' a notorious torture technique and the most controversial of the so - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' employed against prisoners in CIA custody .
In light of this revelation , as well as many other disclosures about the treatment of these prisoners , any conceivable basis for withholding the prisoners ' accounts of their treatment in U.S. custody has been wholly eviscerated . "
A PDF copy of the ACLU 's complaint , dated March 13 , 2008 , is available at this link .

A 7 year - old Australian boy broke into a local zoo and fed a number of animals to a crocodile and killed several lizards for fun .
The violent act , caught on zoo camera , showed how the boy fed several live animals to the 11 - foot , 440 - pound crocodile .
There were a turtle , four blue tongue lizards , two bearded dragons , two thorny devil lizards and a 1.8 metre goanna among the animals .
The director of the zoo said that some of them are hard to replace .
The boy also beat several lizards to death with a rock and threw them to the crocodile .
Rex Neindorf , the zoo 's director , said that the camera footage at the Alice Springs Reptile Centre showed the smiling face of the boy , while he killing the animals and feeding them to crocodile named Terry .
'' By all accounts , he 's quite a nasty 7 - year - old and he comes from a family that 's got a history of violence , and he 's continued on with it and nothing can be done because he 's seven , ''he said .
Police found the boy , who lived nearby , but could not do anything because children under 10 years old cannot be accountable in the Northern Territory .
Neindorf is going to sue the parents of the boy to make them accept the responsibility for his behavior .

Not many things make the founder of the Ubuntu distro Mark Shuttleworth nervous , but recommending people replace Windows with Linux on their desktop , it seems , is one of them .
This coming from someone who 's been catapulted out of our atmosphere to spend time in the freezing vacuum of space .
Shuttleworth , though , reckons people should think about why they want to change Windows for Linux , and re-engineer their infrastructure and the way they are working , rather than doing a simple rip and replace .
" I 'm very nervous of encouraging people to substitute Windows for Linux , " Shuttleworth said during a recent interview .
" It 's great if you are able and willing to recraft the way you do things in your organisation , " such as adopting thin - client computing .
Where people just want to switch desktop operating systems , things get very difficult . "
Shuttleworth , of course , created a storm of debate this summer , when he said that Linux on the desktop had to out - pretty the Mac if it was to really beat Windows .
You can listen to more from Shuttleworth here , in a podcast interview at the recent Debconf8 in Mar del Plata , Argentina , with the chap leading Sun Microsystems ' relationship with the GNU / Linux communities Barton George .
Among other things , Shuttleworth reckons Ubuntu remains " strongly aligned " around Intel 's mobile Linux effort , even though Intel said it 's dropping Ubuntu for a Fedora - based stack in the next Moblin .
Also , he reckons Ubuntu will become " self sustaining " in the " next year or two " . ®

In the space of legitimate Rails full text plugins , the commonly mentioned choices are Sphinx ( via Thinking Sphinx or Ultra Sphinx ) , Xapian ( via acts_as_xapian ) , solr ( via acts_as_solr ) and ( shudder ) Ferret ( via acts_as_ferret ) .
Jim Mulholland does a great job of covering the various choices at a glance , so if you ’d like a good overview , starts with his blog about the choices .
To his commentary , I would add that Solr looks complicated to get running , appears to have been abandoned by its creator , and has n’t been updated in quite awhile .
It should also be mentioned that if you were to choose solr , every time you wished to talk about it online you ’d have the burdensome task of backspacing the “ a ” out of the name that your fingers were intent on typing in .
Xapian seems alright , but the documentation on it seemed lacking and not a little arcane .
Despite Jim ’s post on how to use it , it seemed like the Xapian Rails community was pretty sparse .
My impression was that if it did n’t “ just work , ” it would be I alone who would have to figure out why .
Also , from what I can tell in Jim ’s post , it sounds like one has to stop Xapian from serving search requests to run the index ?
Update : the FUD patrol informs me that you can concurrently index and serve , oh what joy !
Ferret sucks .
We tried it in our early days .
It caused mysterious indexing exceptions left and right , whenever we changed our models or migrated .
The day we expunged it from our system was the day I started programming our site and stopped worrying about what broke Ferret today .
Ultra Sphinx looks OK , but as you can read here , it ’s ease of use leaves something to be desired compared to the star of our blog post , who has now entered the building .
Ladies and gentlemen , may I present to you , hailing from Australia and weighing in at many thousand lines of code :
Thinking Sphinx !
There ’s a lot to like about Thinking Sphinx : it has easy to read docs with examples , it has an extremely active Google Group behind it , and it supports useful features like location - based searches and delta indexing ( e.g. , search updates in real time ) .
But if there is one reason that I would recommend Thinking Sphinx above your other choices , it ’s that you probably do n’t care a hell of a lot about full text searching .
Because I did n’t .
I care about writing my website .
This is where Thinking Sphinx really shines .
With the tutorials and Railscasts that exist for Thinking Sphinx , you can write an index for your model and actually be serving results from Thinking Sphinx within a couple hours time .
That does n’t mean its an oversimplified app though .
Its feature list is long ( most of the features we do n’t yet use ) , but smarts defaults are assumed , and its super easy to get rolling with a basic setup , allowing you to hone the parameters of the search as your situation dictates .
Also extremely important in choosing a full text search system is reliability .
Programming a full text engine ( and its interface into your application ) is rocket science , as far as I ’m concerned .
I do n’t want to spend my time interpreting esoteric error messages from my full text search engine .
It must work .
Consistently .
All the time .
Without me knowing anything about it .
Thinking Sphinx has done just that for us .
In more than a month since we started using it , it ’s been a solid , reliable champ .
A final , if somewhat lesser , consideration in my recommendation of TS is who you ’ll be dealing with if something goes wrong .
Being open source , my usual expectation is that if me and Google can’t solve a particular problem , it will be a long wait for a response from a random , ever - so - slightly - more - experienced - than - me user of the system in question who will hopefully , eventually answer my question in a forum .
Thinking Sphinxes creator Pat Allen blows away this expectation by tirelessly answering almost all questions on Thinking Sphinx in its Google Group .
From what I can tell , he does this practically every night .
This is a man possessed .
I do n’t claim to know or understand what ’s in the punch he ’s drinking ( probably not beginner ’s enthusiasm , since TS has been around for quite some time now ) , but whatever ’s driving him , I would recommend you take advantage of his expertise soon — before he becomes jaded and sour like the rest of us .
What About the Performance and Results ?
Performance : great .
Our usual TS query is returned in a fraction of a second from a table of more than 200,000 rows indexed on numerous attributes .
Indexing the table currently takes about 1 - 2 minutes and does n’t lock the database .
Nevertheless , we recently moved our indexing to a remote server , since it did bog down the system somewhat to have it constantly running .
I plan to describe in the next couple days how we got the remote indexing working , but suffice to say , it was n’t very hard ( especially with Pat ’s guidance on the Google Group ) .
Results : fine .
I do n’t know what the pertinent metrics are here , but you can use weighting for your results and search on any number of criteria .
Our users are happy enough with the search results they ’re getting with TS out of the box , and when we do go to get more customized with our search weighting , I have little doubt that TS will be up to the task , and it ’ll probably be easy to setup .
Final Analysis
If you want to do full text searching on a Rails model , do yourself a favor and join the bandwagon enjoying Thinking Sphinx .
It ’s one of the best written and supported plugin / systems I ’ve stumbled across so far in the creation of Bonanzle .

At least 64 people have been killed in a series of bomb explosions in India 's north - eastern state of Assam , the police say .
More than 300 others were injured in at least 18 blasts , the majority of them in the state capital , Guwahati .
The separatist United Liberation Front of Assam ( Ulfa ) denied any role in the blasts and blamed Indian " occupation forces " for engineering them .
Security forces have been fighting separatist rebels in Assam for decades .
The explosions in Guwahati and the towns of Kokrajhar , Barpeta Road and Bongaigaon occurred within an hour after 1100 local time ( 0530 GMT ) .
A huge blast hit the bus just before the one I was travelling in

Four of the explosions ripped through busy markets in Guwahati while three others went off in the western town of Kokrajhar .
Fourteen people were killed in the first explosion in front of the deputy commissioner 's office in Guwahati .
Twenty - two others were killed in the second explosion at Ganeshguri near the state secretariat and four in Panbazar in central Guwahati , police say .
They say that 17 people died in the three explosions at Kokrajhar and five more in another explosion at Barpeta Road 130 km ( 81 miles ) from Guwahati in the west of the state .
Another blast was reported from near the oil refinery at Bongaigaon , between the towns of Kokrajhar and Barpeta Road .
Angry crowds
Most of the bombs were planted in cars , police say .
" A huge blast hit the bus just before the one I was travelling in .
The bus got burnt at the front and pedestrians pulled out a lot of people hit by splinters and some suffering burns as well , " said engineering student Zinnia Brahma , an eyewitness in Guwahati .
A witness in Kokrajhar , Sanchaita Chakrabarty , told the BBC that a bomb went off just after she had bought vegetables from the local market .
Assam violence Q&A " It happened as I walked away , " she said .
" The man I had bought the vegetables from was dead , many others around him were seriously injured .
Just see how lucky I am to be alive . "
Angry crowds attacked the police with stones after the blasts in Guwahati .
Dozens of people were injured in the clashes , Reuters reports .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who represents Assam in the upper house of the Indian parliament , is going to the state on Friday .
Intelligence officials blamed Ulfa for the blasts .
But a statement issued by self - styled " lieutenant " Anjan Borthakur on behalf of Ulfa 's " Military Council " said that the group was in no way connected with them .
The statement said Ulfa had been blamed as part of a " disinformation campaign " against the separatist group .
Most fighters in one of Ulfa's " strike battalions " have announced a ceasefire with the government - but two other battalions have not laid down their arms and the security forces have attacked and killed many of them in recent weeks .
" So the Ulfa is striking back in a massive way by taking on soft targets , " Assam police chief RN Mathur said .
" No other group can trigger so many blasts in so many places in such a co-ordinated fashion . "
He said most of the bombs had been planted in cars .
For the past 10 years , Ulfa has been blamed for bombings targeting gas and oil pipelines , oil depots and areas populated by migrant workers .
Assam police intelligence chief Khagen Sharma told the BBC that the latest bombings proved that Ulfa was " desperate for survival and does not mind killing even local people indiscriminately " .
Failed peace talks
The group began an armed rebellion against what it describes as colonial rule by Delhi in 1979 .
Thousands of people have died in the violence .
An effort to start peace talks between the rebels and the Indian government broke down in 2006 .
The rebels are seeking a separate homeland for the Assamese people and demanding that non-indigenous people , particularly Hindi and Bengali speakers , leave Assam .
There have been a number of major bomb attacks in India in the past few months , many of them blamed on local Islamist groups .
But local separatists have been held responsible for recent explosions in north - eastern cities .
Two north - eastern state capitals - Agartala in Tripura and Imphal in Manipur - saw serial explosions this month .
At least 20 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the blasts .

It is an extremely common issue and I talked about it in the past quite a few times .
I have learned a lot since then , however , and I want to show you can create rich , complex , querying support with very little effort .
We will start with the following model :
And see how we can query it .
We start by defining search filters , classes that look more or less like our domain .
Here is a simple example :
public abstract class AbstractSearchFilter { protected IList < Action < DetachedCriteria >> actions = new List < Action< DetachedCriteria >>( ) ; public void Apply ( DetachedCriteria dc ) { foreach ( var action in actions ) { action ( dc ) ; } } } public class PostSearchFilter : AbstractSearchFilter { private string title ; public string Title { get { return title ; } set { title = value ; actions .
Add(dc => { if ( title. Empty ( ) ) return ; dc. Add( Restictions .
Like ( " Title " , title , MatchMode .
Start ) ) ; } ) ; } } } public class UserSearchFilter : AbstractSearchFilter { private string username ; private PostSearchFilter post ; public string Username { get { return username ; } set { username = value ; actions .
Add(dc => { if ( username . Empty ( ) ) return ; dc. Add( Restrictions .
Like ( " Username " , username , MatchMode .
Start ) ) ; } ) ; } } public PostSearchFilter
Post { get { return post ; } set { post = value ; actions .
Add( dc= > { if ( post== null ) return ; var postDC = dc. Path ( " Posts " ) ; //
Path is an extension method for GetCriteriaByPath ( name ) ?? CreateCriteria ( path ) post .
Apply ( postDC ) ; ) ; } } }
Now that we have the code in front of us , let us talk about it .
The main idea here is that we move the responsibility of deciding what to query to the hands of the client .
It can make decisions by just setting our properties .
Not only that , but we support rich domain queries using this approach .
Notice what we are doing in UserSearchFilter .
Post.set , we create a sub criteria and pass it to the post search filter , to apply itself on that .
Using this method , we completely abstract all the need to deal with our current position in the tree .
We can query on posts directly , through users , through comments , etc .
We do n't care , we just run in the provided context and apply our conditions on it .
Let us take the example of wanting to search all the users who posts about NHibernate .
I can express this as :
usersRepository .
FindAll ( new UserSearchFilter { Post = new PostSearchFilter { Title = " NHibernate " } } ) ;
But that is only useful for static scenarios , and in those cases , it is easier to just write the query using the facilities NHibernate already gives us .
Where does it shine ?
There is a really good reason that I chose this design for the query mechanism .
JSON .
I can ask the json serializer to serialize a JSON string into this object graph .
Along the way , it will make all the property setting ( and query building ) that I need .
On the client side , I just need to build the JSON string ( an easy task , I think you would agree ) , and send it to the server .
On the server side , I just need to build the filter classes ( another very easy task ) .
Done , I have a very rich , very complex , very complete solution .
Just to give you an idea , assuming that I had fully fleshed out the filters above , here is how I search for users name ' ayende ' , who posted about ' nhibernate ' with the tug ' amazing ' and has a comment saying ' help ' :
{ // root is user , in this case Name : ' ayende ' , Post : { Title : ' NHibernate ' , Tag : { Name : [ ' amazing ' ] } Comment : { Comment : ' Help ' } } }
Deserializing that into our filter object graph gives us immediate results that we can pass the the repository to query with exactly zero hard work .
TSKHINVALI , Georgia ( Reuters ) - Georgia offered Russia a ceasefire and peace talks on Sunday after pulling troops back from rebel South Ossetia ’s capital , and mediators began a mission to end the internationally condemned fighting .
Some fighting still gripped parts of the Caucasus region , however , and Russia demanded an unconditional Georgian withdrawal .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner arrived in Tbilisi at the head of an international team of mediators , the first top level diplomatic mission to fly to the region in an attempt to stem the bloodshed .
It was due to move on to Moscow on Monday .
After meeting Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , Kouchner said a “ controlled withdrawal of the troops ” was his main priority .
“ Coming back to the table , negotiations , peace talks , a political solution .
That ’s it .
Easy to say , very difficult to do , ” Kouchner told journalists in Tbilisi .
The United States maintained its strong criticism of Russia , condemning its “ disproportionate and dangerous ” military action .
Russian troops and tanks took control of Tskhinvali , the region ’s devastated capital , early on Sunday after a three - day battle .
Moscow said 2,000 civilians were killed and thousands made homeless in a “ humanitarian catastrophe ” .
There has been no independent confirmation of the number of dead and wounded throughout the region .
The simmering conflict between Russia and its small , former Soviet neighbor Georgia erupted late on Thursday when Georgia sent forces into South Ossetia , a small pro-Russian province which threw off Georgian rule in the 1990s .
Russia , which had provided support to the separatists and had peacekeepers stationed in the province , responded by pouring troops and heavy amour south through the Caucasus mountains into South Ossetia to drive back the Georgians .
The conflict alarmed the West , which views Georgia as a valuable , if volatile , ally because of its strategic location on an energy transit route carrying oil from the Caspian to Europe .
Saakashvili appeared smiling but disheveled to meet Kouchner , before showing him the night - time view of Tbilisi from a hillside .
“ It is the most surreal world crisis I could ever imagine , ” the Georgian leader told reporters .
FRENCH PRESIDENT TO VISIT MOSCOW
The office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy , current holder of the European Union ’s rotating presidency , said he would also visit Moscow in the next few days .
The French leader has produced a peace plan focusing on both sides pulling back to areas they held before the hostilities .
At the U.N. , Moscow and Washington traded barbs in the Security Council .
Slideshow ( 32 images )
U.S. ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad suggested Russia was seeking “ regime change ” by saying Saakashvili should leave office while Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin obliquely suggested some leaders became “ obstacles ” to their people .
The United States said any further Russian escalation of the conflict could have a “ significant , long - term impact ” on relations and called on Russia and Georgia to cease hostilities and return to their pre-conflict positions .
President Dmitry Medvedev said Georgia must withdraw from South Ossetia and formally pledge not to attack the region .
Meanwhile , fighting continued .
A Reuters reporter in the town of Gori , just south of South Ossetia , reported heavy bombardment of areas around Tskhinvali on Sunday evening , although it was not clear who was firing .
Slideshow ( 32 images )
Russian planes again bombed the Tbilisi military airport and a nearby aviation plant .
One bomb exploded near the runway of the civilian international airport , although Moscow denied targeting that facility .
A Reuters photographer entering Tskhinvali with Russian troops on Sunday saw dead Georgian soldiers lying in the streets and the ruins of buildings devastated in the fighting .
Georgia and Russia have accused each other of causing widespread civilian casualties since the fighting began .
State - controlled Russian television repeatedly spoke of a “ humanitarian catastrophe ” in South Ossetia after the Georgian attack , with more than 2,000 dead and thousands homeless .
A Georgian government source said on Sunday 130 Georgian civilians and military personnel had been killed and 1,165 wounded , many because of Russian bombing inside Georgia .
Russia denied hitting civilian targets .
DEVASTATION
Russian television showed what it said were pictures from Tskhinvali of burnt - out buildings , wounded civilians receiving medical treatment in dilapidated basements and weeping mothers complaining of a lack of food and water .
“ It started with severe bombing with artillery and planes and helicopters .
Our boys , with their guns , could do nothing , ” resident Alla Dzhiloyeva told RTR state television by phone .
“ They bombed us so may times all the houses are destroyed ...
On one street there is only one wall left . ”
Pictures on NTV television showed Tskhinvali ’s main hospital in ruins and most of its 200 patients crammed into the basement .
Patients , many wincing , underwent treatment on tabletops in what looked like unsanitary conditions .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin cut short his visit to the Olympics on Saturday and flew to a field hospital in North Ossetia , visiting wounded troops and evacuees , and denouncing what he termed Georgia ’s “ crimes against its own people ” .
Putin later briefed a Moscow - bound Medvedev on his trip , in a televised exchange which underlined Putin ’s continued dominance of Russian politics and government .
Potentially widening the conflict , Sergei Bagapsh , the leader of Abkhazia , another separatist region on Georgia ’s Black Sea coast , said he had ordered 1,000 troops to push Georgian forces out of the Kodori Gorge , a strategic pocket of territory .
He called up reservists .
Over the last few months we have gone through 30 of the worlds greatest mysteries but what we have n’t covered are ancient mysteries .
This list aims to put that right !
Here are ten great unsolved mysteries of science .
Do you have a theory that might solve one of these mysteries ?
If so , tell us in the comments !
10 . Rongorongo
While many people know of the Moai of Easter Island , not that many people know of the other mystery associated with Easter Island .
‘ Rongorongo ’ is the hieroglyphic written language of the region ’s earlier inhabitants .
Rongorongo is strange in that no other neighbouring oceanic people used a written language .
It appeared around the 1700s , though was unfortunately lost after the early European colonizers banned it because of its ties to the native islanders ’ pagan roots .
9. Lost City of Helike
In the late 2nd century AD , the Greek writer Pausanias wrote an account of how ( 4-500 years earlier ? ) in one night a powerful earthquake destroyed the great city of Helike , with a Tsunami washing away what remained of the once - flourishing metropolis .
The city , capital of the Achaean League , was a worship centre devoted to the ancient god Poseidon , god of the sea .
There was no trace of the legendary society mentioned outside of the ancient Greek writings until 1861 , when an archeologist found some loot thought to have come from Helike – a bronze coin with the unmistakable head of Poseidon .
In 2001 , a pair of archeologists managed to locate the ruins of Helike beneath the mud and gravel of the coast , and are currently trying to peice together the rise and sudden fall of what has been called the “ real ” Atlantis .
8. The Bog Bodies
This mystery may even be a problem for those legendary investigators from CSI and the like !
The bog bodies are hundreds of ancient corpses found buried around the northern bogs and wetlands of Northern Europe .
These bodies are remarkably well preserved , some dating back 2,000 years .
Many of these bodies have tell - tale signs of torture and other medieval “ fun ” , which have made some researchers postulating that these unfortunate victims were the result of ritual sacrifices .
7. Fall of the Minoans
The Minoans are best known for the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur , but it is in fact the demise of this once - great civilisation that is more interesting .
While many historians concentrate on the fall of the Roman Empire , the fall of the Minoans , who resided on the island of Crete , is an equal , if not greater mystery .
Three and a half thousand years ago the island was shaken by a huge volcanic eruption on the neighbouring Thera Island .
Archeologists unearthed tablets which have shown that the Minoans carried on for another 50 years after the eruption , before finally folding .
Theories of what finally ended them have ranged from volcanic ash covering the island and devastating harvests to the weakened society eventually getting taken over by invading Greeks .
6. The Carnac Stones
Everyone has heard of Stonehenge , but few know the Carnac Stones .
These are 3,000 megalithic stones arranged in perfect lines over a distance of 12 kilometers on the coast of Brittany in the North - West of France .
Mythology surrounding the stones says that each stone is a soldier in a Roman legion that Merlin the Wizard turned in to stone .
Scientific attempts at an explanation suggests that the stones are most likely an elaborate earthquake detector .
The identity of the Neolithic people who built them is unknown .
5. Who Was Robin Hood ?
The historical search for the legendary thief Robin Hood has turned up masses of possible names .
One candidate includes the Yorkshire fugitive Robert Hod , also known as Hobbehod or Robert Hood of Wakefield .
The large number of suspects is complicated further as the name Robin Hood became a common term for an outlaw .
As literature began to add new characters to the tale such as Prince John and Richard the Lionheart the trail became more obscure .
To this day no one knows who this criminal really was .
4. The Lost Roman Legion
After the Parthians defeated underachieving Roman General Crassus ’ army , legend has it that a small band of the POWs wandered through the desert and were eventually rounded up by the Han military 17 years later .
First century Chinese historian Ban
Gu wrote an account of a confrontation with a strange army of about a hundred men fighting in a “ fish - scale formation ” unique to Roman forces .
An Oxford historian who compared ancient records claims that the lost roman legion founded a small town near the Gobi desert named Liqian , which in Chinese translates to Rome .
DNA tests are being conducted to answer that claim and hopefully explain some of the residents ’ green eyes , blonde hair , and fondness of bullfighting .
3. The Voynich Manuscript
The Voynich Manuscript is a medieval document written in an unknown script and in an unknown language .
For over one hundred years people have tried to break the code to no avail .
The overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript suggests that it was meant to serve as a pharmacopoeia or to address topics in medieval or early modern medicine .
However , the puzzling details of illustrations have fueled many theories about the book ’s origins , the contents of its text , and the purpose for which it was intended .
The document contains illustrations that suggest the book is in six parts : Herbal , Astronomical , Biological , Cosmological , Pharmaceutical , and recipes .
2. The Tarim Mummies
An amazing discovery of 2,000 year old mummies in the Tarim basin of Western China occurred in the early 90s .
But more amazing than the discovery itself was the astonishing fact that the mummies were blond haired and long nosed .
In 1993 , Victor Mayer a college professor collected DNA from the mummies and his tests verified that the bodies were all of European genetic stock .
Ancient Chinese texts from as early as the first millennium BC do mention groups of far - east dwelling caucasian people referred to as the Bai , Yeuzhi , and Tocharians .
None , though , fully reveal how or why these people ended up there .
1. Disappearance of the Indus Valley Civilization
The ancient Indus Valley people , India ’s oldest known civilization had a culture that stretched from Western India to Afghanistan and a populace of over 5 million .
le —
India ’s oldest known civilization — were an impressive and apparently sanitary bronze - age bunch .
The scale of their baffling and abrupt collapse rivals that of the great Mayan decline .
They were a hygienically advanced culture with a highly sophisticated sewage drainage system , and immaculately constructed baths .
There is to date no archaeological evidence of armies , slaves , conflicts , or other aspects of ancient societies .
No one knows where this civilization went .
This list was derived from the excellent article of the same name at livescience
Posted by Pamela Fox , Maps API Team
One of the first concepts I explain to developers that are new to mapping APIs is geocoding : the process of converting an address into a latitude / longitude pair .
Approximately 99.9 % of developers will have to use a geocoder before they can get their data onto a map , and to let users of their map locate themselves .
Thankfully , we offer both the HTTP Geocoding service for server - side geocoding ( the former ) , and the GClientGeocoder class for client - side geocoding ( the latter ) .
Now , let me introduce the more advanced topic of reverse geocoding : the process of converting a latitude / longitude pair into an address .
A much smaller ( but important ) percentage of developers will want to use a reverse geocoder to let their map users know the address for a particular point on the map , perhaps to help them fill in a form faster ( why type when you can click ? ! ) .
For those developers , we 're now pleased to offer address - level reverse geocoding support to both our HTTP service and the GClientGeocoder class .
To make it super easy to use , the interface for reverse geocoding is nearly the same as forward geocoding - the only difference is sending in a lat / lng instead of an address .
Here 's a code snippet for doing client - side reverse geocoding , taken from this sample :
geocoder.getLocations ( latlng , function ( addresses ) {
if(addresses.Status.code != 200 ) {
alert ( " reverse geocoder failed to find an address for " + latlng.toUrlValue ( ) ) ;
} else {
var result = addresses .
Placemark [ 0 ] ;
map.openInfoWindow(latlng , result.address ) ;
}
} ) ;
As a live demo of the reverse geocoder , check out MeetWays , a site that mashes up the Google AJAX Local Search API with the Google Maps API and just a bit of math .
It calculates the point between two addresses on the map , uses the reverse geocoder to find out the address for that point , and then does a local search near that address to find places to meet that are halfway between .
Since reverse geocoding works in all the places that forward geocoding works , then you should be able to meet up with your friends in more than 70 countries .
For more information on this new service , read through the reference and sample code .
We 'd love to see the ways that developers will use the reverse geocoder , so please post a link to your reverse geocoding demo or website in the forum .
Now go forth and reversify !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A controversial technology is being adapted to help ferret out people and drugs crossing the U.S. border illegally .
A high - tech portal will scan cars for illegal immigrants or drugs at this busy border crossing south of San Diego .
A new type of drive - through portal will use backscatter , a form of low radiation X - rays , to scan personal vehicles for illegal immigrants or contraband hidden inside .
The image produced by backscatter can be so revealing that privacy advocates have called the scanning of passengers at airport security checkpoints an " an electronic strip search . "
However , a Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the portal used at the border will be much less revealing .
According to the manufacturer , American Science and Engineering , a backscatter image of a person in a car will show " a silhouette with no facial or body detail .
The system cannot be used to identify an individual , or the race , sex , or age of the person . "
The first Z Portal , as it is called , is being deployed Thursday at the San Ysidro port of entry on the U.S. - Mexico border south of San Diego .
All passenger vehicles referred for secondary inspection will be put through the portal , which is described as looking like a large drive - through car wash .
Drivers and passengers will be given the option of staying in the vehicle , or having a Customs and Border Protection agent drive it through .
Jenny Burke , a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection , said the portal is safe .
" It would take 2,000 runs to equal the radiation you would get in one test X - ray . "
The portal takes multiple images of a vehicle to better detect people or contraband hidden inside .
Border agents view the images in real time .
Even if nothing unusual is detected , agents will complete a secondary inspection , but CBP expects the scans to speed the process by targeting areas for manual searches .
The agency also hopes the technology will reduce the level of risk for border agents .
" They do n't have to deal up close and personal not knowing what might be there , " Burke said .
" They have more awareness if they go in to inspect a vehicle . "
Customs and Border Protection will be studying how the first portal performs at San Ysidro , but already anticipates that more will be deployed in the future .
Spokesman Mike Friel said , " It will make the process more efficient and , we think , more effective . "
CBP said it cost about $ 2 million to purchase and install the Z Portal at San Ysidro .

BUT - if it DOES passes , is everyone prepared to spend another ba-zillion dollars on PR and possibly wait 20 - 30 years to " win " equality in CA ?
AND - if it does NOT pass , which state will we focus on next so we can spend another ba-zillion dollars to purchase civil rights ?
I know I am virtually alone here ( except for Charles Merrill and his partner ) , but I think all of you are insane .
Truly crazy .... one step away from writing - on - the - wall - with - your - feces crazy .
Because if ALL of us truly believed we WERE equal , we would not be so patient as tax - payers and U.S. citizens .
We 'd simply KNOW we ARE equal , and refuse to pay into a system that not only denies our familes civil marriage but does n't even acknowledge our existence ( wait for the 2010 census ) .
I 'm 43 , and I will NOT wait until I 'm 73 for fair and equal treatment .
It 's OK for the country at large to be ignorant , bigoted , mid-guided , and mid-informed .

Ok everyone , far from me to write about something that might start an argument , but here goes :
The item below was found for sale on a New Zealand auction site .
I ’ll let the description speak for itself ( emphasis mine ) :
AUDIODESK Systeme CD lathe is a very effective CD sound improver .
It bevels and trues the edge of CD ’s to reduce laser reflection and vibration .
This is the biggest upgrade I ’ve heard for the CD format .
It ’s so obviously better from the first few seconds in a transparent system , my uncut discs are immediately recognizable now and sound less listenable and two - dimensional in comparison .
It gets CD closer to high - end vinyl reproduction .
Improves bass resolution , detail and dynamics , and reduces etch or glare .
Blackening the bevel adds weight and smoothness .
Soundstage depth and width and space around performers opens out .
Similar to the improvement of SACD over CD all without softening or compromising dynamics as some CD mats and other treatments tend to do .
Direct copies to cheap cut and blackened - edge CDRs ( without even cutting the original ) can sound significantly better than the original
Sound better than the original ?
Really !
How is this even physically ( or conceptually ) possible ?
Now , I ’m pretty into my audio quality ( although obviously not video quality , because I use $ 1.65 HDMI cables ) , but I ’m nowhere near the type of nut that buys this type of thing .
I really thought this was a joke when I first saw it – but it ’s apparently for real .
I ’m still wondering which crazy audio device is the biggest audio snake oil around ( Send your nominations ! ) , but I still do n’t think it could hold a candle to this little piece of technology .
They also go on to say :
This is a “ must have ” product for any really interested in maximizing the potential of their CD / SACD collection .
the price is reasonable and the construction and presentation of the product is outstanding .
This results are simply quite staggering .

McClatchy reports that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has reneged on the security agreement that his office negotiated with the Bush administration , and now says he will not sign it and will not submit it to parliament .
Instead , it is likely that Iraq will go back to the United Nations Security Council for a further mandate of six months to a year for the multi-national forces .
Aljazeera English reports on the security pact .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports in Arabic that the Christian representative in parliament is acusing a unit of the Iraq army , which has significant numbers of Kurds , of being behind attack on Christians in Mosul that have forced thousands of Christians to flee instability .
Mark MacKinnon profiles the American University in Iraq ( Sulaymaniya ) ,
Despite all the hype about it being calm now , Iraq faces significant violence :
‘ Last month , 98 Iraqi policemen were killed .
On about two days out of every three , a bomb killed two or more people .
Over all , those bombings killed 164 people and wounded 366 others .
These and other attacks killed 500 Iraqi civilians , about 17 a day . ‘
While the Bush administration was using Abu Nidal ’s presence in Baghdad to argue that the Baath government was dirty with terrorists , in fact the CIA was running him as an agent .
The headline says it all : “ Mentally Unstable Soldiers Redoplyed to Iraq . ”
Netbooks use various types of processors , but most of them are built around Intel ’s Atom processor and architecture .
There are more exotic options , such as the Chinese Longsoon processor , but those are quite rare and hard to come by – and certainly not as powerful .
Apparently , another contender is preparing to enter the netbook processor market .
Say hello to ARM .
Rob Coombs , director of mobile solutions at ARM , has told ZDNet that the company ’s upcoming Cortex A - 8 and Cortex A - 9 processors will find its way not only into smartphones , but also into netbooks .
“ In the future we ’re going to be in netbooks , ” Coombs said , “ Expect announcements in the next few months . ”
The Cortex A - 8 will be the successor to the ARM11 architecture , found mostly in smartphones ( like the iPhone ) and PDAs ( assuming people still buy those ) .
The company claims that the Cortex A - 8 goes into gigahertz territory , which is probably a requirement if you take a look at the competition ARM is facing .
The Cortex A - 9 is the multicore brother of the A - 8 , and will become available in 2010 .
The UK - based company will face Intel head - on on this one , but will obviously be in a bit of a pickle because Windows XP and Vista do not run on the ARM architecture – you ’d need Windows CE / Mobile / Embedded /etc./etc. for that .
Of course , Linux will run on and adapt to ARM just fine , so most likely , these netbooks will run Linux .
Funnily enough , Intel itself is an ARM - licensee , and the company has also announced plans to move into the smartphone territory with its next - generation Atom chips , expected late 2009 .
Has anyone heard of this story before ?
According to one of my friends , a little boy was home alone and a rapist broke into his parent 's house and shoved a broomstick so far up his anus that it struck a nerve and made the boy retarded .

Data breaches are becoming increasingly common and more sophisticated , putting consumers ' personal information and financials at risk .
Not only can these data breaches lead to identity theft , but some can even lead to money being siphoned out of bank accounts and illegal purchases made on credit cards .
The responsibility for preventing these breaches falls on many shoulders , including merchants , consumers , and even Internet service providers ( ISPs ) .
Once such ISP , Verizon , recently analyzed " four years of data from over 500 cases worked by the Verizon Business Investigative Response team , " to produce a report that gives an in - depth look into how data breaches are occurring in four major industry groups : financial services , food and beverage , retail , and technology services .
As expected , the majority of data breaches come from external sources , such as from hacking and coding errors , for all four sectors .
The second most - often sited source of data breaches for three out of four of the industry sectors is from partners --" partners include any third party sharing a business relationship with the organization , " such as " vendors , suppliers , [ and ] contractors . "
The food industry is especially susceptible to data breaches from its partners , with partner - originated data breaches at close to the same level as data breaches from external sources .
The least likely source of data breaches for three out of four of the industry sectors is from internal sources , such as " company executives , employees , and interns -- as well as other assets such as physical facilities and information systems . "
The one deviation from the norm here , however , is the technology services sector , which sees more data breaches from internal sources than from partners .
The Verizon report theorizes on the anomaly this way : " Tech services are often in the role of ' the partner ' to the other industries , providing management , hosting , and other services .
It stands to reason that organizations in the industry likely employ a high percentage of tech - savvy staff and grant them high levels of access to numerous systems .
Unfortunately , some find that access to sensitive and valuable resources us a temptation too hard to resist .
" As to the types of threats that the industries face , hacking is less of an actual threat for the financial and tech sectors than for food and retail .
This is likely a result of the more sophisticated security measures in place for the financial and tech sectors .
Threats resulting from errors , however , were high for all four industries .
The predominant source of errors for all four industries is from omissions , such as " standard security measures that were believed to have been implemented , but in actuality were not . "
The financial sector had the lowest incident of omission - related errors , while the technology services sector had the highest .
Although much less pronounced than omissions , errors from misconfiguration were the second most - likely source of errors for all four industries .
Threats from deceit were sited as a significant source for the financial industry , while misuse was a major threat source for the technical services sector .
The Verizon Business report breaks down data breach attack difficulty into four levels : None ( capable by the " average user " ) ; Low ( " low - level skills " ) ; Moderate ( " skilled techniques " ) ; and High ( " advanced skills " ) .
For the food and retail industries , the majority of the attacks were low - difficulty - level attacks .
The financial and technology services sectors saw more moderate - difficulty - level attacks .
The tech industry saw the greatest level of high - difficulty - level attacks of the four industries .
Credit card data is consistently the most frequent type of data that is breached for all industry sectors ; but it is especially egregious in the food and retail industries .
For all sectors , except for food , the second - most breached data type is personal information .
Authentication data is also a prominent breached data type for the financial and technology sectors , compared to the other industries .
Sadly , the overwhelming majority of data breaches for all sectors are discovered by third parties ; breach detection via internal event monitoring and log analysis are low for all industries , including financial and tech .
The report indicates that this " suggests that breach detection is an almost completely reactive process ...
It would be nice to see a little more proactive approach . "
The time it takes to discover data breaches can sometimes go on for months , or even years in the case of the retail industry .
" There is a striking difference between industries in the length of time that passes before an incident is discovered .
While we expected longer intervals in Food and Beverage , we were shocked to find that 90 percent of breaches go undiscovered for months .
Retail and Tech Services post better times but not by much .
Even though Financial Services firms become aware of breaches within days in 50 percent of the cases , a sizeable number still go undetected for weeks and months .
While this seems like an impressive feat relative to other groups , no industry can claim victory in the contest of timely breach discovery .
"
The takeaway from all this is going to be different depending on the specific industry .
It would appear that the retail and food industries have the greatest amount of work ahead of them in order to attempt to minimize data breaches .
But the tech and financial sectors are n't off the hook either -- they still have plenty to do as well .
Perhaps most disconcerting is how all of these industries appear to lack effective proactive means to discover and prevent data breaches .
Perhaps crime does pay ?

It has been a long time since we 've heard anything truly interesting out of Real , the content purveyor that seemed to float away long ago with the ATRAC3 format and Windows 98 .
To our surprise , however , Real recently pinged us with some news that turned our heads : it has a new app that can rip a DVD , download the relevant metadata , organize it all , and play it back from the comforts of a notebook on your couch or 30,000 feet in the air .
Naturally , we wanted to chat with Real about this , so we sat down with Eric Fox , Senior Product Manger for Media Software & Services .
Do not adjust that dial
Fox told Ars Technica that Real 's new app is simply called Real DVD , and it 's designed to be a one - stop DMCA - skirting shop for copying a DVD in its entirety to a hard drive and playing it back , CSS encryption and all .
Real DVD should work with any commercial DVD , though a beta testing period that launched Monday will help test the extent of that claim .
After creating a file ( not named " VIDEO_TS " ) that includes the feature film , DVD menu , extras , and anything else , Real DVD will dial up metadata servers to pull down things like album artwork , director , actors , a description of the film — all the usual stuff that most illegitimate apps have never done very well , if at all .
Quality purists should be pleased , as Fox told Ars , that " we do n't modify or change the files in any way .
We basically make a ' carbon copy ' from the disc to disk .
We never modify , compress , or change the content . "
Unfortunately , this also means that each movie Real DVD copies should gobble up around 4GB on a hard drive .
Real is n't worried about taking up too much space , however , as Fox explained that " drives are expanding , and gigabytes are getting cheaper than ever . "
Since users will need Real DVD to play back the movies it creates , Real built in some handy features to organize libraries across local and external storage space .
" Users can can keep files on external drives , " Fox said , " and they 'll seamlessly appear and disappear from the app library as the drive is mounted . "
Fortunately , each movie can also be customized depending on what you actually want to do with it .
Real DVD has options for skipping straight to the feature film when opening a particular movie , and it can even condense multi-disc sets like TV series when browsing the library .
Laughing in the face of danger
Naturally , one of our first questions for Fox was : " how ? "
That pesky DMCA has proven quite stringent in the past when it comes to ripping DVDs , so what makes Real so special ?
" We licensed the DVD technology for a legal right to play back DVD content , " Fox explained , " and our second layer of DRM does n't hurt , either . "
Indeed , Real DVD adds a new layer of DRM to each file — on top of the DVD 's native CSS , which is preserved within each file — to lock the file to the user and PC that created it .
While the company is allowing these files to be played on up to five computers , this limit may still scare away movie enthusiasts who own more PCs than John McCain owns houses .
A second layer of DRM is n't the only problem with Real DVD , however .
Fox explained that , unfortunately , files wo n't be playable on any portable devices other than a notebook .
Plus , while the files Real DVD creates are n't time - bombed in any way , Real DVD is required for watching them .
More on how much that 's going to cost you in a minute .
Could Real be ... too late ?
Real is opening up Real DVD with a beta Monday , so we 'll get our hands on it and let you know what we think .
We 've had some time to kick around what Real DVD brings to the table , though , and we have to admit , we were initially perplexed .
On the one hand , Real DVD feels about three years too late , since online video distribution has been maturing for a while now , and a number of new outlets ranging from the iTunes Store to Hulu offer great options for getting one 's video fix .
On the other hand , Fox had a point : " We 're going for the everyday consumer and business / casual travelers who want to watch a DVD they already own in a hotel room or on the couch , but do n't want to lug around lots of equipment . "
And therein lies the rub : DVDs have been selling really , really well for years , which means that there are millions of customers out there with bountiful DVD libraries that are ripe for ripping .
Until Real DVD , though , there has n't been a simple , legitimate , one - stop option for copying those DVDs to a computer , grabbing all the relevant box art and metadata , and then watching the films ( with output to a TV or HDTV , to boot ) .
So for all its faults and any features it may lack as a 1.0 product , Real DVD is the first legitimate option for consumers who want to put the DVDs they already own onto their PCs .
That said , Real DVD certainly is n't perfect , and we 'll have to see how warm a welcome consumers give it .
For now , Real is going to sell Real DVD at an introductory price of $ 29.99 , though that will rise to $ 49.99 somewhere down the road .
You can take Real DVD for a fully functional , anonymous demo for 30 days , and we 'll report back soon with our impressions once we can actually put it through its paces .
Regulators in New Jersey awarded the rights on Friday for construction of a $ 1 billion offshore wind farm in the southern part of the state to Garden State Offshore Energy .
The rights , which include access to as much as $ 19 million in state grants , is part of New Jersey ’s Energy Master Plan , which calls for 20 percent of the state ’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020 .
The decision comes on the heels of decisions by Delaware and Rhode Island to allow the installation of offshore wind farms .
Energy experts say that these approvals could prompt regulators in New York to support projects off the south shore of Long Island and New York City .
Garden State Offshore Energy is a joint venture that includes P.S.E.G. Renewable Generation , a subsidiary of P.S.E.G. Global , which is a sister company of the state ’s largest utility , Public Service Electric and Gas Company .
The proposal by Garden State Offshore Energy includes the installation of 96 turbines to produce as much as 346 megawatts of electricity , enough to power tens of thousands of houses , starting in 2013 .
The turbines would be arranged in a rectangle about a half - mile long by one - third of a mile wide and would be placed 16 to 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey ’s Atlantic and Ocean Counties , much farther out and in much deeper water than other proposed wind farms .
Deepwater Wind , which will work with P.S.E.G. to build the wind farm , said it could affordably build turbines in 100 feet of water with the same technology used to build oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and other places .

What 's the key to more Linux adoption on mobile devices ?
Intel wants to know .
The chipmaker is searching for answers with its Moblin 2.0 mobile Linux project .
The Moblin 2.0 effort includes a new user interface technology that Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) hopes will improve the user 's mobile experience .
That starts with a look and feel that pushes the envelope .
" We 're pushing down application logic under the UI ( user interface ) , literally separating experience from application logic and services , " Imad Sousou , the Director of Intel 's Open Source Technology Center , told InternetNews.com .
Intel is positioning Moblin as a way to build more adoption of its Atom - based chipsets for mobile devices .
So far , consumer devices ranging from Netbooks to in-vehicle entertainment systems are adopting the Atom CPUs .
Health Canada has ordered thousands of toys and children 's costume jewellery items off store shelves after a Star investigation found they contained dangerously high levels of lead .
One of the items is a baby pacifier that was sold at Everything For a Dollar in Scarborough .
Another is a scrapbook charm sold at Dollarama that was so poisonous Health Canada determined a child could die from swallowing the penny - sized bauble .
Using two types of high - tech tests , the Star found lead in about one in every four products bought at 18 retailers in the Greater Toronto Area .
Most were made in China .
We found the toxic metal in a shocking range of items – from a " Lead Free " jewellery kit to a cuddly stuffed animal dressed as a Mountie .
Health Canada issued the recall notices after its own tests confirmed high levels of lead in six of the seven items identified by the Star .
Hundreds , sometimes thousands , of each item have been carried in GTA stores .
Health Minister Tony Clement called the Star 's findings " deeply disturbing " and said enforcement of leaded products is not good enough .
He pledged to introduce a law to better protect consumers .
The recall notices were posted recently on the federal agency 's website , healthycanadians.ca .
The recalled products include :
• An orange mini hockey stick with " Canada " painted on the shaft in black letters .
The black paint contained 10 times the legal limit for lead .
Health Canada said that since April , 3,240 of the sticks had been distributed to retailers nationwide .
• A jewellery kit bought at west - end toy store Animal Crackers .
The kit , billed as " Lead Free , " contained a pendant that tested at nearly double the legal limit for lead in children 's jewellery .
The necklace clasp tested at 150 times the limit .
Health Canada says 5,940 of the kits have been sold across the country since September 2004 .
• A pewter scrapbook charm sold at Dollarama that tested at 77 per cent lead .
If swallowed , the penny - sized accessory – which has " laugh " engraved on one side – could be fatal .
Health Canada said that 11,776 of the items hit Dollarama shelves starting in May 2007 .
• A pacifier from the My Baby brand sold in Everything For a Dollar .
The orange plastic mouthguard of the pacifier contained more than 10 times the proposed legal limit of lead .
Health Canada announced that as a precautionary measure , importer OPC is extending the recall to include My Baby pacifiers with guards of all colours .
About 10,000 of the pacifiers were sold from April 2007 to October 2008 .
Clement told the Star he will consider a restriction on lead in pacifiers in any new law he introduces .
A " Super Dooper Charms " jewellery - making kit recalled by the government in July , but that the Star easily found and bought on chapters.indigo.ca in August .
Health Canada has issued another recall notice .
More than 900 of the items had been distributed nationwide since January 2006 .
Recalls are voluntary and it is up to the offending companies and parents to keep the dangerous items from children .
Health Canada has not punished a company for selling , importing or manufacturing dangerous children 's products in more than a decade .
Lead can damage the most vulnerable without warning .
Experts say sucking on or mouthing a lead - laced toy can cause damage that might not be readily apparent to caregivers or doctors .
Possible symptoms of lead poisoning – such as irritability , a drop in IQ and poor school performance – could easily be confused with other ailments .
Repeatedly sucking on or swallowing heavily leaded items can bring on a range of symptoms , from prolonged vomiting , diarrhea and cramping to possible death .
Clement had said that any new law should allow regulators to make recalls mandatory and to more easily fine offenders .
Of the seven products the Star featured in its recent investigation , the federal government issued recall notices for five and is in the process of issuing a recall notice for another – a cuddly , China - made husky dog dressed as a Mountie .
The Star bought the $ 20 stuffed toy in a souvenir store in Terminal 3 at Pearson airport .
Its belt contained lead .

When confronted with the Star 's findings last month , some retailers and importers said they would immediately pull the items from shelves and others said they would do their own tests .
The government did not recall a Hannah Montana bracelet bought at Wal - Mart .
The Star tested the bracelet 's rhinestones using two high - tech methods and found lead at 445 times the legal limit .
Health Canada said its test did not reveal lead over the federal limit .
Meanwhile , Wal - Mart Stores , Inc. issued a series of safety guidelines for its global suppliers , after a series of high - profile safety scares from Chinese factories and major recalls .
This is an outcome of a conversation I had recently .
Apparently saying that MVC is a fairly simple concept is some sort of blasphemy .
But it is .
You really do n’t need to use the almighty RAILS or a rails like framework like CakePHP in order to the whole Model , View , Controller separation .
That ’s the beauty of the idea – you can write your own MVC framework from scratch quite easily .
In fact , sometimes it is probably preferable to do so .
It ’s true that you should avoid reinventing the wheel but sometimes you just want lean , minimalistic code with as few dependencies as possible .
This is where you would do something like the example below .
This is a bare bones minimalistic core of a MVC system .
It ’s the index file – the driver or super - controller whatever you want to call it .
Users will hit this page , and it will hand off the control to an appropriate Controller class .
Thanks to the malleability of PHP this can be accomplished in just few simple lines :
Error : No Module Specified Sorry , no module was specified .
Please check your URL " ) ; if ( empty ( $ _GET [ " action " ] ) ) die ( " Error : No Action Specified Sorry , no action was specified .
Please check your URL " ) ; $ module = Util: : sanitize ( $ _GET [ " module " ] ) ; $ action = Util:: sanitize ( $ _GET [ " action " ] ) ; $ controller = $ module . " DefaultController " ; if ( file_exists ( " controllers /$controller.php " ) ) { include " controllers /$controller.php " ; $ active_controller = new $ controller ( ) ; if(!method_exists ( $active_controller , $ action ) ) die ( " Error : Action Not Defined
Sorry , the action $ action is not defined in $ module .
Please check your URL " ) ; else $ active_controller -> $ action ( $ _GET ) ; } else die ( " Error : Module Not Found Sorry , module $ module does not exist .
Please check your URL " ) ; ?>
Note that I ’m using some shortcuts here .
For example I assume that you can figure out for yourself how to sanitize user input strings .
I moved that functionality to the Util class which I import up top .
You probably figured it out already , but if you did n’t this is essentially the folder structure you will need to have in your webroot directory :
The rest of it should be straightforward .
For example , let ’s say you access this page with the following URI :
http://example.com/?module=user&action=view
This will trigger our file to try to locate the file user .
php in the sub - folder controllers and import it .
Then it will assume that the file contains a class user and will attempt to initialize it .
Note that I did this in PHP4 so I ’m using the old style constructors .
You can easily modify it for PHP5 .
Finally , it will check if the newly created instance contains the method view and will attempt to execute it .
The controller class would then initialize a model class which would query the DB for user information , do whatever processing needs to be done and then pull in a View class which would deal with the displaying of the data on the page .
It would probably utilize some templating scheme .
I ’d actually implement a base class ( let ’s name it DefaultController ) which would be the parent for all the other controller classes .
In it I would implement all the basic CRUD functions in the most generic way possible .
This way , when you decide to add a new controller to your project you can simply create an empty class stub which extends DefaultController and still have some functionality there .
A very simplistic controller class would look something like this :
class DefaultController { var $ model ; var $ view ; function DefaultController ( ) { // find out the name of this module so that we can apply it in other places $ module = substr ( get_class ( $ this ) , 0 , strpos( get_class ( $ this ) , " controller " ) ) ; $ model_name = $ module . " Model " ; $ view_name = $ module . " View " ; include " models/$model_name.php " ; include " views/$view_name.php " ; $ this -> model = new $ model_name ( ) ; $ this -> view = new $ view_name ( ) ; } function read ( $args ) { if ( empty ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ) $ this ->idError ( ) ; $ id = Util: : sanitize ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ; $ this ->model->populateFromDB( $id ) ; $ this -> view - > render ( " read " , $ this -> model ) ; } function update ( $args ) { if ( empty ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ) $ this ->idError ( ) ; if (!empty ( $ _POST ) ) { $ this ->model -> populate ( $ _POST ) ; $ this -> model -> update ( ) ; } $ id = Util: : sanitize ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ; $ this ->model->populateFromDB( $id ) ; $ this -> view - > render ( " update " , $ this -> model ) ; } function create ( $args ) { if ( !empty ( $ _POST ) ) { $ this -> model -> populate ( $ _POST ) ; $ new_id = $ this -> model - > create ( ) ; $ this -> view -> render ( " thankYou " , array ( " caption " => " Record Inserted " , " id " => $ new_id ) ) ; } else { $ this -> view - > render ( " create " , $ this -> model ) ; } } function delete ( $args ) { if ( empty ( $ _POST ) ) { if ( empty ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ) $ this ->idError ( ) ; $ id = Util: : sanitize ( $ _GET [ " id " ] ) ; $ this ->model->populateFromDB( $id ) ; $ this -> view - > render ( " delete " , $ this -> model ) ; } else { $ this -> model -> populate ( $ _POST ) ; $ this -> model - > delete ( ) ; $ this -> view - > render ( " thankYou " , array ( " caption " => " Record Deleted " ) ) ; } } function idError ( ) { die ( " No Record Specified
You need to specify a record ID to perform this action . " ) ; } }
Again , this is really minimalistic code .
As you can see there is no error checking and no validation .
Most of the time I ’m delegating control to other classes and making even more assumptions .
For example I ’m assuming that a model class would have methods such as populate ( which would essentially pre-populate it ’s fields from an associative array passed in as an argument ) and populateFromDB which would query the database and populate it by using the stored data .
You ca n’t really make the models too generic since their structure will be based on the database table layout .
You could probably try something clever – such as using an associative array instead of defining fields of all the database columns .
This way you could have a fairly generic structure .
class DefaultModel { var $ fields ; var $ table_name ; var $ db ; include COMMON." config.php " ; include COMMON . " MyDatabase.class.php " ; function DefaultModel ( ) { $ this -> table_name = substr ( get_class ( $ this ) , 0 , strpos( get_class ( $ this ) , " model " ) ) ; $ this -> fields = array ( ) ; // associative array // the database stuff is defined in config .
php imported above $ this ->db = new MyDatabase ( __DB_HOST__ , __DB_DATABASE__ , __DB_USER__ , __DB_PASSWORD__ ) ; $ this ->db->dbconnect ( ) ; } function populateFromDB ( $id ) { $ results = $ this ->db->query_into_array ( " SELECT * FROM " .$ this ->table_name . " WHERE id= ' $id ' " ) ; $ this ->populate ( $ results ) ; } function populate ( $ array ) { foreach ( $ this -> fields as $ key => $ val ) if ( @key_exists ( $key , $ array ) ) $ this -> fields [ $key ] [ " value " ] = $ array [ " $ key " ] ; } function insert ( ) { $ sql = " INSERT INTO " .$ this ->table_name . " ( submitted_on " ; foreach ( $ this -> fields as $ key => $ row ) if ( $key != " id " and $ key !=' submitted_on ' and $ key !=" last_updated_on " ) $ sql .= " , $ key " ; $ sql .= " ) VALUES ( NOW ( ) " ; foreach ( $ this -> fields as $ key => $ row ) if ( $key != " id " and $ key !=' submitted_on ' and $ key !=" last_updated_on " ) $ sql .= " , ' $ row [value ] ' " ; $ sql .= " ) " ; $ this ->db->query ( $sql ) ; return mysql_insert_id( $ this ->db->getLink( ) ) ; } function update ( ) { $ sql = " UPDATE " .$ this ->table_name . " set last_updated_on=NOW ( ) " ; foreach ( $ this -> fields as $ key => $ row ) if ( $key != " id " and $ key !=' submitted_on ' and $ key !=" last_updated_on " ) $ sql .= " , $ key= ' $ row [ value ] ' " ; $ sql .= " where id= ' " .
$ this -> fields [ " id " ] [ " value " ] . " ' " ; $ this -> db->query ( $sql ) ; } function delete ( ) { $ this ->db-> query ( " DELETE FROM " .$ this ->table_name . " WHERE id= ' " .$ this -> fields [ " id " ] [ " value " ] . " ' " ) ; } }
Note that I ’m using a made up wrapper class instead of calling MySQL functions directly .
This is just something that I did ages ago – I created a generic database class to interface with my code .
Now whenever I switch database engines all I need to do is re-implement that class using appropriate syntax .
Since all my SQL is going through that class I can even intercept it and correct illegal statements .
For example my code might be using MySQL specific keywords , but the Postgress implementation of MyDatabase will automatically transform these queries into something that Postgress understands .
Then again , you may not want to do that .
Parametrized queries may be a better idea here .
They would be yet another step of abstraction .
You could establish some common naming conventions then define parametrized queries in each database to follow them and simply have your wrapper class call them by name instead of actually building SQL queries .
Other than that the class is fairly generic – you will have to define the fields array on your own which can be easily done in the child class ’ constructor .
It ’s not ActiveRecord or anything so there will be a considerable amount of work involved setting it up each time but it is serviceable .
I ’m nor going to do a View class here because this post is getting crowded with code .
But you get the idea – I ’d use the same methodology as above , define as many generic methods as possible and then override them as needed in child classes .
I ’m not sure how projects like CakePHP implement their MVC model .
This is just an example of how I would go about developing one if I had to .
It is probably very simplistic and unsophisticated compared to the other stuff available out there .
But that ’s sort of the point .
Anyone can implement an MVC framework of sorts – for better or for worse .
This one is mine .
Yours may be very different but that ’s ok .
Constructive criticism is as always appreciated .
Just remember that I pretty much pulled it out of my ass during a lunch break sort of as a proof that it is really not that complicated .
Septic Tank That Waters Your Lawn Coming to California
October 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I ’m a huge proponent of using recycled wastewater , so I ’m happy to hear that Biokube is bringing its lawn - watering septic system to California .
And since the average American home uses a mind - boggling 15,000 gallons of water a year on lawns , the system is sorely needed .
Normal septic systems allow solids to settle down with gravity .
The water enters a tank with bacteria to clean it and it is then released into a leaching field for bacteria to clean it even further .
The Venus method is both more thorough and less complex .
The system cleans waste water by having it pass through numerous bioblocks ( membranes housing bacteria ) .
Afterward , no further filtering is necessary .
According to Patrick O’Regan , the head of Biokube ’s US Business Development Center , the six foot tall Venus tank can handle 7.5 liters of water every 15 minutes .
While a lawn - watering septic tank may not be the sexiest green innovation , it highlights an important point : we can drastically reduce our water consumption once we come to the realization that our lawns , toilets , and gardens do n’t need to use the same fresh water that we drink .

HIMACHAL PRADESH , India ( CNN ) -- Amar and Kundan Singh Pundir are brothers .
Younger brother Amar breaks rocks in a mine for a living .
Kundan farms their small piece of inherited land .
They live in a beautiful but remote hillside village in the clouds of Himachal Pradesh , India .
Kundar Singh Pundir , left , and his brother Amar , right , share Indira Devi , centre , as their wife .
Both aged in their forties , the two brothers have lived together nearly their whole lives .
They are poor and share just about everything :
Their home , their work and a wife .
" See we have a tradition from the beginning to have a family of five to 10 people .
Two brothers and one wife . "
Kundan says .
They practice what is known as fraternal polyandry -- where the brothers of one family marry the same woman .
Why ?
Tradition and economics .
Life is hard here .
The village is precariously perched on the side of a very steep hill about 6,000 ft up .
Most of the villagers survive off tiny plots of cropland .
In this difficult terrain there is n't enough land to go around .
So , instead of finding separate wives and splitting up their inherited property , the brothers marry the same woman and keep their land together .
Wife Indira
Devi says life with two husbands is n't easy .
" We fight a lot . "
But like any married couple they fight mostly over mundane stuff , except there are three spouses instead of two .
" Usually it 's about chores , why did n't you do this ?
Why did n't you do that ? " she says .
Watch Sara Sidner 's interview with the brothers »
One thing they agreed on was the need to have children ;
They have three .
So how does a married trio deal with sex ?
" We make shifts , change shifts and sleep on alternate days .
We have to make shifts otherwise it wo n't work , " Kundan says .
" To run our families we have to do this , overcome the hurdles as well and then we have to control our hearts from feeling too much , " Amar adds .
To outsiders their arrangement may seem odd , but in the village of about 200 it is the norm .
Typically the marriages are arranged and women have two husbands .
But some wives have three or four depending on how many brothers there are in a family .
Polyandry is illegal in India but socially acceptable here .
No one from the government seems to bother the villagers about the law .
" It 's been going on for ages .
My sister in law has two husbands , my mother in law also has two husbands , " Indira says .
And as to the question of which husband is the biological father of the children -- the Pundir 's do n't know and do n't care .
" For me everyone is the same , my mother and my fathers are the same .
My mother and my fathers are like God to me , " 17 - year old daughter Sunita Singh Pundir says .
Even as modern society arrives in this ancient village through satellite dishes and mobile phones , the Pundirs say they want their age - old tradition to continue with their children .
" Absolutely , " eldest son Sohna says .
He and his younger brother have already discussed it and will marry the same woman .
Daughter Sunita is n't so sure .
" I would like one husband , " she says .
But when asked if she will marry for love or tradition , Sunita 's answer makes it clear the tradition of marrying more than one man will continue with the next generation .
" I will never leave our tradition even if I have to forgo love .
I will never spoil my parents ' reputation and my brothers . ' "
Singing to females makes male birds ' brains happy
The melodious singing of birds has been long appreciated by humans , and has often been thought to reflect a particularly positive emotional state of the singer .
In a new study published in the online , open - access journal PLoS ONE on October 1 , researchers at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan have demonstrated that this can be true .
When male birds sang to attract females , specific " reward " areas of their brain were strongly activated .
Such strong brain activation resulted in a similar change in brain reward function to that which is caused by addictive drugs .
The brain of humans and other animals is programmed to have a positive emotional response to rewarding stimuli , such as food or sex .
A critical part of this reward signal is thought to be provided by increased activity of neurons containing dopamine in the brain ventral tegmental area , VTA .
Along with natural rewards , the same brain circuits can also be strongly activated by artificial rewards such as addictive drugs .
Previous studies in mammals have found that after animals are given drugs such as cocaine or amphetamine , the strength of synaptic connections onto dopamine neurons in VTA is strongly increased , or potentiated .
Such potentiation has been suggested to be an important long - lasting adaptation of brain function caused by drug use , and involved in maintenance of addictive behavior .
Whether such potentiation can also be caused by more natural rewards has been less studied .
Social interactions with others are critical for normal healthy life , and therefore should be rewarding for humans and also for other animals .
In the new study in PLoS ONE , Ya - Chun Huang and Neal Hessler of the Vocal Behavior Mechanisms Lab examined one specific social behavior , courtship singing of songbirds .
In the zebra finch , an Australian songbird , males sing in two different situations .
Most importantly , males sing " directed song " during courtship of females .
When males are alone , they produce " undirected song " , possibly for practice or to communicate with birds they can't see .
A previous study by this research group showed that only when males sang to attract a female , but not when they sang while alone , many unidentified neurons in the VTA were strongly activated .
Huang and Hessler now show , in the current study , that such a natural social interaction , singing to a female , can cause the same kind of synaptic potentiation of VTA dopamine neurons as use of addictive drugs , while singing solo did not affect these neurons .
Further study of this system should give insight into how both natural and artificial rewards interact with each other , and specifically how damage to brain reward systems during addiction can disrupt processing of natural rewards such as social interaction .
This study also provides the clearest evidence so far that singing to a female is rewarding for male birds .
This may not be surprising , as such courtship is a necessary step in producing offspring , and so should be a positive experience .
Other studies have provided some evidence that in mammals , including humans , sexual behavior and attachment ( as well as rewarding aspects of video games and chocolate ) also depend on the same brain reward areas and dopamine .
So , despite the distant evolutionary relationship between birds and humans , it may be that during such intense social interactions as courtship , both share some similar emotional state .
The evangelical movement is fearful on many fronts , Mark Hennessydiscovers in Colorado Springs
QUIETLY SPOKEN , religiously and politically conservative , and living in the heartland of evangelical Christianity in the US , Daniel Lopez pondered the end of time that could come if Barack Obama becomes president .
" When I think of it , it brings to mind the prophecies that the Bible tells us about , " said Lopez , sitting in the shade outside Focus on the Family 's headquarters in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
" On the one hand , it is exciting for us as conservatives because we can actually see what God prophesied coming about ; but on the other hand , it is frustrating to see somebody become president who is a blatant liar . "
Lopez and his family moved three years ago from California to Colorado Springs , which has over the past couple of decades become home to thousands of evangelical Christians , and more than 100 of their churches .
The most influential religious operation in the city is not , however , a church as such , but the sprawling Focus on the Family complex established by James Dobson , one of the US 's most influential figures .
Each year , he broadcasts to 200 million religious conservatives at home and abroad , and he reigns supreme in Colorado Springs since pastor Ted Haggard fell from grace after he was found to have solicited a male prostitute for sex and drugs .
The Haggard experience , and general suspicions that the press is everlastingly liberal , mean the evangelicals are not keen on journalists , even if they are polite about it .
" No sir , I 'm afraid there is no one you can talk to .
They are attending a meeting on homosexuality and I cannot disturb them .
It 's quite a sensitive subject , you know , " a Focus on the Family staffer gently , but firmly , told The Irish Times .
The evangelicals believe the world is swimming against a tide of filth : promiscuity ; homosexuality ; and the curse of relativism .
Eight years ago , and again in 2004 , the evangelicals , who number up to one - quarter of the US population , were on a political roll , and were crucial to the election of George W Bush .
Today , they are still influential , as can be judged by Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as running mate .
During the battle for the Republican nomination , the evangelicals ' dislike of McCain was evident , with Dobson saying he was convinced the Arizona senator was not a conservative .
" In fact , he has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are .
I cannot and will not vote for senator John McCain , as a matter of conscience , " he declared .
Times have changed since then , and Dobson , faced with the unacceptable prospect of a liberal in the White House , now says he is " supportive " of McCain 's campaign , even though he cannot bring himself to endorse it .
" It 's probably obvious which of the two major party candidates ' views are most palatable to those of us who embrace a pro-life , pro-family world view , " Dobson wrote in a weekly e-mail to supporters .
Palin , on the other hand , the evangelicals like .
Last week , the vice - presidential candidate , herself an evangelical , was interviewed by Dobson for 20 minutes on his syndicated radio show , which has 1.5 million daily listeners .
Describing herself as a " hardcore pro-lifer " , Palin voiced confidence that , by " putting this in God 's hands , that the right thing for America will be done at the end of the day on November 4th " .
The evangelicals ' main complaints about McCain are that he does not support federal constitutional bans on gay marriage and abortion , and he favours embryonic stem - cell research .
A ban on all three is Republican Party official policy , and Palin assured Dobson that McCain would follow it if the duo wins : " I do believe that , from the bottom of my heart . "
With time slipping away , evangelicals still hope McCain can win in Colorado , particularly because a state referendum that would grant " personhood " to a fertilised egg should rally the local conservative vote .
But Obama 's eloquence and campaigning skills , and a sense that the political winds in the US are running against them , have disconcerted the evangelical movement .
Fearful on many fronts , they particularly fear for Israel if Obama wins .
James Borja , a youth pastor , said : " Right now , we are one of the few nations giving them support .
They have the rightful ownership of that land , rather than the Arabs who covet it .
Once our support ends , you will see the end of Israel and the beginning of the end for America .
" Truly , the Bible says of Israel , ' I will bless those who bless you , and curse those who curse you ' . "
But Borja holds out hope that many Americans will act like his father - in - law in the campaign 's final days .
" He has always voted Democrat , a lifelong trade unionist .
But he says now that he is voting Republican .
He says , ' I can't vote for my pocket .
I 've got to vote with my conscience ' . "
However , the future is already written , said James Krause , who disagrees that evangelicals have reasons to be afraid if a Democrat takes the White House .
" God holds everything in his hand .
There is no doubt in my mind that what happens on November 4th has been pre-ordained , " he said .
Would United States Senator John McCain be a presidential contender if it were n't for his marriage to Cindy Hensley McCain , heiress to the Hensley liquor fortune ?
It 's doubtful .
The senator 's wife and -- more important -- his father - in - law , James Willis Hensley , are very wealthy people .
Like his father and grandfather before him , McCain was a career Navy officer .
His earning power and his inheritance were modest .
At its peak , his pay as a captain was about $ 45,000 .
But he retired from the military in 1980 , divorced his first wife , wed Arizona native Cindy Lou Hensley and moved here to plunge into the world of politics .
His first job in Arizona was as a public affairs agent for Hensley & Company , one of the nation 's largest beer distributors .
He was paid $ 50,000 in 1982 to travel the state , touting the company 's wares .
But he was promoting himself as much as he was Budweiser beer .
A better job description might have been " candidate . "
In 1982 , Cindy drew more than $ 700,000 in salary and bonuses from Hensley - related enterprises as her husband was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in his first political campaign .
Today , McCain is ranked the 26th wealthiest member of Congress by Roll Call magazine .
There are 535 members in the House and Senate .
From Day 1 , Hensley money has enabled McCain to be a full - time politician , free from financial concerns .
This story examines the roots of the Hensley fortune and John McCain 's implacable bond to the liquor industry -- how it has enriched him personally and as a politician , and how those ties have dictated his actions on questions of public policy .
John McCain 's political allegiances to liquor purveyors and his father - in - law 's interests are subtle .
That narrative is marked by a pattern of patronage .
The Hensley saga , meanwhile , swirls with bygone accounts of illicit booze , gambling , horse racing , deceit and crime .
James Hensley embarked on his road to riches as a bootlegger .
It was December 6 , 1945 .
World War II had ended a few months earlier .
Joseph F. Ratliff was just about to wrap up another day as office manager at United Distributors Company when two of his bosses , Eugene and James Hensley , paid a visit to Ratliff at the company 's Tucson liquor distribution warehouse around 5 p.m .
The Hensley brothers were partners with a powerful Phoenix businessman named Kemper Marley , who had cornered a large share of Arizona 's wholesale liquor business after Prohibition was lifted in 1933 .
Ratliff had gone to work for United Distributors in September 1944 .
His job was to oversee shipments of whiskey into and out of the United Distributors ' warehouse by keeping track of invoices , filing tax and sales reports with the federal government and monitoring cash flow .
During and after World War II , the sale of whiskey was tightly regulated by the federal government .
Demand for whiskey was high , particularly on the black market , where prices were more than double the regulated market price .
" ' Well , ' Gene Hensley says , ' It is five o'clock , why do n't you go home ?
It is time to close , ' " Ratliff told Assistant United States Attorney E.R. Thurman in sworn testimony in March 1948 .
Ratliff went home .
Upon his return to the warehouse the next morning , Ratliff found a disturbing sight .
" When the warehouse man came down and opened the warehouse , I started out through the warehouse to go to the men's room , and I noticed there was two rows of whiskey there the night before that was n't on the floor that morning .
So I went back to the office .
I thought we had been robbed . "
In his office , Ratliff found another surprise .
" There was a bunch of invoices in my desk that had been made out after I had left the office , apparently , " Ratliff testified .
The invoices appeared to be related to the whiskey -- about 50 cases -- that had disappeared from the warehouse overnight .
Ratliff went outside to empty some trash and noticed " a pile of empty whiskey cases out there . "
Tangled up in the pile of boxes were federal tax serial labels that were supposed to remain with the liquor when sold to a retailer .
Ratliff recognized the handwriting on the invoices as belonging to then - 25 - year - old James Hensley , who had become general manager of the Tucson operation in June 1945 after a three - year stint in the military .
James Hensley had served as a bombardier on a B - 17 and was shot down over the English Channel on his 13th mission .
Ratliff was n't sure what was going on until later that day , when James Hensley returned to his office .
" He came in and paid me for those invoices , " Ratliff testified .
" Cash sales . "
Ratliff dutifully marked the invoices as paid .
The seven invoices prepared by James Hensley -- after the warehouse was closed -- indicated the liquor had been sold and delivered to seven establishments in southern Arizona .
The Manhattan Club in Tucson supposedly got eight cases of Seagram 's and Walker Imperial .
Nu-Way Grocery in the Lowell district of Bisbee was credited with receiving 10 cases , while James Hensley showed the Merchants Cafe in Douglas to have received eight cases .
The Blue Room in Douglas was credited with buying 10 cases ; Lee Hop Grocery in Tucson got two .
The Ar - Jay Store in Tucson , six cases .
The Old Tumacacori Bar in Nogales , seven .
In fact , none of the liquor went to the retailers named in the invoices prepared by James Hensley .
Nobody but James Hensley knows where it really went , and he never told authorities .
He declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this story .
What is certain is that what occurred that December day was standard operating procedure for the Hensley brothers between April 1945 and January 1947 .
During this period , a 1948 federal criminal indictment charged , the Hensleys made approximately 1,284 false entries related to the sale of thousands of cases of liquor by their two companies -- United Sales Company in Phoenix and United Distributors in Tucson .
Ratliff 's testimony eventually led to James and Eugene Hensley 's conviction on federal conspiracy charges " with the intent and design to hide and conceal from the United States of America , the names and addresses of the person or persons to whom the said distilled spirits were sent , and the prices obtained from the sale thereof . "
A federal jury in U.S. District Court of Arizona in March 1948 convicted James Hensley on seven counts of filing false liquor records in addition to the conspiracy charge .
Eugene was convicted on 23 counts of filing false statements and the conspiracy count .
Eugene was sentenced to one year in prison , and James to six months .
Neither brother testified during the trial , relying instead on their lawyers , who included Louis B. Whitney , a prominent attorney who served as mayor of Phoenix from 1923 through 1925 .
After a two - week stint in the Maricopa County jail , the men were released on bond on May 17 , 1948 , pending an appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit .
The appeals court affirmed the conviction on February 8 , 1949 .
Two weeks later , a judge sentenced Eugene to one year in a federal prison camp near Tucson , but suspended James ' sentence , placing him on probation instead .
Both men were fined $ 2,000 .
United Sales and United Distributors were also convicted and fined $ 2,000 .
The criminal convictions had little immediate impact on the brothers ' fortunes .
James Hensley profited handsomely from his association with liquor magnate Kemper Marley , a man police suspect ordered the 1976 murder of Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles , who had written about Marley 's business and political dealings .
The man convicted of placing a bomb beneath Bolles ' car testified that Marley also wanted former Arizona governor and then - attorney general Bruce Babbitt murdered because Babbitt had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the liquor industry in 1975 .
( Marley , who died in 1990 , was never charged in the Bolles case .
Babbitt is now U.S. Secretary of the Interior . )
By 1955 , James Hensley had launched a Budweiser distributorship in Phoenix , a franchise reportedly bestowed upon him by Marley , who was never indicted in the 1948 federal liquor - law - violation case -- or a subsequent one -- despite his controlling financial role in the liquor distribution businesses .
James Hensley 's conviction did n't deter the State of Arizona from granting him a wholesale liquor license in the mid-1950s .
The Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control turned a blind eye to repeated liquor - law violations at the company .
State liquor regulators did nothing when James Hensley failed to disclose his federal felony conviction on a sworn 1988 disclosure statement to the department and the City of Phoenix .
Today , Phoenix - based Hensley & Company is the nation 's fifth - largest beer wholesaler -- a privately held business that 80 - year - old James Hensley still controls .
He built the Budweiser distributorship into at least a $ 200 million - a - year business , with annual sales of more than 20 million cases of beer .
James
Hensley owns nearly all of the voting stock , and most of the rest of the closely held securities are in trusts for his grandchildren or owned by his daughter , 45 - year - old Cindy Hensley McCain -- wife of U.S. Senator and presidential hopeful John McCain .
By now , many Americans know John McCain 's family story .
His best - selling memoir , Faith of My Fathers , chronicles the lives of the senator 's father and grandfather , distinguished admirals .
The book takes readers up through John McCain 's own military service , including his five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
But Faith of My Fathers ends there , a few years short of John McCain 's marriage to Cindy Hensley and the advent of his political career .
That 's only half the family story .
The rest could be called " Cash of My Father - in - Law , " a tale of how beer baron James W. Hensley 's money and influence provided a complement to McCain 's charisma and compelling personal story and launched him to a seat in Congress -- and perhaps to the White House .
Although Hensley wealth has helped propel McCain 's political career , the senator will never get his hands directly on the Hensley fortune because of an antenuptial agreement he signed before his 1980 marriage .
A centerpiece in McCain 's remarkable and sudden rise to national prominence is his promise of campaign - finance reform .
Yet McCain has relied heavily on the financial contributions from big corporate donors -- with the liquor and beer industry near the top of the list .
McCain won -- one could say bought -- his first election to the House of Representatives in 1982 with lavish sums of Hensley beer money .
In a rare 1988 interview , James Hensley gave a glimpse of his political savvy .
" The neo- prohibitionists are real active about trying to dry us up all the time , " he told the Phoenix Business Journal .
" They 're a constant battle .
They 're going after us in different ways now than they did in those days , trying to ban advertising , things like that ....
We 're legislatively involved very heavily ....
It 's a way of life to protect our industry . "
Since 1982 , Hensley & Company employees have donated almost $ 200,000 to federal political candidates and campaigns .
Since 1996 , they 've given Arizona state - level candidates more than $ 18,755 .
McCain himself has received more than $ 60,000 from James Hensley and his employees -- and tens of thousands more from other beer - related interests .
John McCain benefits from James Hensley 's money .
James Hensley benefits from John McCain 's political power .
While McCain blasts his colleagues for falling prey to the influences of campaign contributions , the senator 's record reveals his quiet support for the business that launched and has helped maintain his career .
McCain declined to be interviewed for this story .
Liquor spirited from the Hensley brothers ' warehouses helped fuel a lively nightlife at some of the Valley 's most exclusive clubs in the mid-1940s .
The Green Gables , the Silver Spur and the Cowman 's Club were recipients of black - market shipments , according to testimony presented at the 1948 federal trial of the Hensleys and their two companies , United Sales Company in Phoenix and United Distributors in Tucson .
Jack Baldwin , a salesman and supervisor at United Sales , testified at the 1948 federal trial that Eugene Hensley regularly instructed him to draw up false invoices , transfer scores of cases of liquor offsite and deliver premium whiskeys to selected black - market clients .
Baldwin testified he was ordered by Eugene Hensley in September 1946 to kick in a door at the United Sales ' warehouse on North 19th Avenue and take five cases of scotch for a black - market sale to the Green Gables .
In other instances , Baldwin testified that he took as many as 50 cases of whiskey from the United Sales warehouse and stashed them on the back porch of his central Phoenix home for later delivery to black - market buyers .
" I can name you 20 deals like that , " Baldwin testified .
When an order came in for black - market whiskey , Baldwin would fill the bill .
" Well , the Green Gables wanted 10 cases of Canadian Club and the only thing I would do is just send down and get it , that is all there was to it , " Baldwin testified .
To cover the illegal black - market sales , Baldwin testified that false invoices were prepared showing the liquor sold in small quantities to retailers throughout Arizona .
" It would be scattered over the state for two and a half and three cases at a time , " Baldwin stated .
" Why would you make invoices that did not show the true fact situation ? "
Assistant U.S. Attorney Thurman asked .
" The liquor went someplace else , " Baldwin stated .
" Under whose direction did you make these invoices ? "
" Gene Hensley , " Baldwin replied .
" After these were made out , these particular invoices , what did you do with them ? "
" I took them home , burned them usually , " Baldwin stated .
Information from the false invoices prepared by the Hensleys ' employees was provided to federal liquor regulators with the Alcohol Tax Unit at the U.S. Treasury Department .
When investigators compared the information reported by the Hensleys and what was actually delivered to retailers , they discovered a huge discrepancy .
Sometimes the Hensleys sold liquor to unlicensed individuals who would transport up to 55 cases at a time to states including Oklahoma and Utah .
Carl " Kid " Carter from Ogden , Utah , purchased dozens of cases of whiskey at a time , loaded them into a late - 1930s sedan , covering the illicit cargo with a blanket before heading home , 600 miles north .
" Sometimes he [ Carter ] would give me the money , and sometimes he would give Gene the money , " Baldwin testified .
Before the liquor was loaded in Carter 's car , Baldwin stated the federal serial numbers would be cut off the cases .
Carter did n't have a liquor license in Arizona or Utah .
" Do you know what prices were paid , say , by Kid Carter ? "
Thurman asked Baldwin . " ...
Would they pay more than the ceiling price ? "
" Oh , yes , " Baldwin testified .
Carter must have been a prodigious drinker .
He testified that he did make black - market purchases but was n't trying to make a financial killing .
" I drank a lot of it and gave a lot of it to my friends , " he told the court .
" Did n't you sell some of it ? " Thurman asked .
" No , sir . "
Another United Sales employee , Howard Wesson , worked as a warehouseman and truck driver from 1942 through 1945 .
Wesson testified that he occasionally loaded whiskey on the warehouse docks and removed the federal tax serial numbers at Gene Hensley 's instructions .
" He just had it come off so there would be no trace of it , or something to that sort , " Wesson stated .
Wesson recalled loading 25 to 30 cases of liquor into Kid Carter 's car and testified that Carter told him he had " doubled his money . "
It was n't unusual , Wesson testified , to leave cases of whiskey on the warehouse floor in the evening and return to work the next day to find the cases broken apart and the whiskey gone .
The heavy black - market sales made it difficult for employees to keep track of the liquor .
Richard Eckert , a United Sales warehouse foreman , told the jury , " I had some trouble keeping my records straight on it .
I could n't make my books balance on it sometimes . "
Eckert , who worked at the warehouse from 1941 through 1945 , testified that he told his bosses about the problem .
" I complained that I could n't keep the records with the salesmen and owners and one thing and another coming in there and taking whiskey away and giving it away and one thing and another and not billing it out , " Eckert stated .
While the bootlegging operation was in full swing , the Hensleys and Marley dissolved their partnerships and created two corporations in September 1946 -- United Sales Incorporated in Phoenix , and United Distributors Incorporated in Tucson .
At the time of incorporation , Eugene Hensley , 32 , was president of the companies , while James Hensley , 25 , served as secretary .
Kemper Marley , 39 , was listed as vice president of both companies .
Despite Marley 's title , federal prosecutors stated that Marley had purchased control of the companies in January 1946 .
Over the years , Marley built the companies , which became United Liquors , into Arizona 's largest wholesale liquor distributorship .
Along with his vast land holdings , political , gambling and prostitution ties , Marley built a fortune worth more than $ 39.2 million by 1980 .
On February 26 , 1953 , James Hensley once again found himself charged with federal liquor crimes .
This time , the government alleged that James Hensley and other officers of United Liquor Company and United Liquor Supply Company falsified records to reduce the company 's tax bill .
On the opening day of the trial in federal court in Tucson , Judge James A. Walsh granted a motion by Hensley 's attorney -- former Maricopa County Attorney Lynn Laney -- to dismiss all charges against Hensley and other individuals .
The case continued against the two companies .
The government alleged the companies falsely stated that about 400 cases of whiskey were transferred from Tucson to Phoenix on December 30 , 1950 , and December 30 , 1951 , to avoid paying higher liquor taxes levied in Pima County , where Tucson is located .
The government charged that the liquor never left the Tucson warehouses .
On the third day of the four - day trial , Kemper Marley -- owner of United Liquor and United Liquor Supply -- unexpectedly took the stand as a defense witness .
Prosecutors successfully halted his testimony , claiming it was immaterial and irrelevant .
Defense attorneys argued that although the liquor was never transferred to Maricopa County , all taxes were nevertheless paid to Maricopa County , therefore nothing further was owed .
Defense attorney Joseph Jenckes said the companies were simply trying to meet their tax obligations in the most practical way , according to an October 17 , 1953 , story in the Arizona Daily Star .
The next day , a jury acquitted the two companies on all 11 counts .
In December 1952 , James Hensley joined his brother Eugene in the purchase of Ruidoso Racing Association in south central New Mexico .
Prior to the purchase , Eugene Hensley operated a couple of nightclubs in Phoenix , including Hensley 's Horseshoe Bar on Van Buren Street , with his first wife , Billy .
The New Mexico venture proved to be more trouble for the Hensley brothers , who became embroiled in a controversy with the New Mexico Racing Commission over hidden ownership .
The commission was concerned about the Hensley brothers ' ties to Phoenix gambler Clarence E. " Teak " Baldwin ( no relation to Jack Baldwin ) .
The commission asked the New Mexico State Police to investigate in 1953 .
According to a March 26 , 1977 , article in the Albuquerque Journal , the 1953 New Mexico State Police report stated that Teak Baldwin was a " bookmaker for leading tracks . "
According to the Journal article , the police report stated that the Hensleys ' Arizona liquor business partner , Kemper Marley , " is reputed to be the financial backer for the bookies .... "
The Journal story appeared shortly after a group known as Investigative Reporters & Editors -- spurred to action by the murder of Don Bolles -- unleashed a series of 23 stories on organized crime , land fraud and political corruption in Arizona .
The Journal reported that the 1953 New Mexico State Police investigation stated that Marley " owned a wire service formerly operated in connection with bookmaking of the Al Capone gang . "
The Journal also reported that the state police report included a transcript of a phone conversation between an officer in Santa Fe and a Phoenix police officer who said , " ...
Our confidential files built up on Baldwin ( and others ) was loaned to some officials and never returned .
We 've never been able to locate them . "
With the police report in hand , the New Mexico Racing Commission grilled the Hensley brothers in May 1953 about their ties to Baldwin .
While the brothers were forthright in disclosing their liquor business ties with Marley and their subsequent federal felony convictions , they told the commission that Teak Baldwin had nothing to do with the track .
Eugene Hensley told the commission in May 1953 that Baldwin steered him to look at the track as a possible investment .
Former commission chairman Tom Closson told the Hensleys " the commission would not have Baldwin connected in any way , shape or form down there [ Ruidoso Downs ] , " the Journal reported .
The Hensleys denied that Baldwin had any interest in the track , the Journal reported .
But two years later , according to the Journal , records indicated that Baldwin actually had a one - third stock interest in the track with the Hensleys .
In November 1955 , trustees for Baldwin filed a federal lawsuit against Eugene Hensley to recover 362 shares of Ruidoso Racing Association stock .
The suit was settled for $ 40,000 and the stock was released to the Hensleys , the Journal reported .
Eugene Hensley told the Racing Commission that Baldwin operated a restaurant at the track and spent some of his own money for equipment .
Baldwin filed suit in federal court in Albuquerque in 1955 over a concession contract he claimed to hold at the track .
The suit was dismissed .
A year later , Baldwin was convicted of income tax evasion .
In April 1955 , James Hensley sold his interest in Ruidoso Downs , for which he was listed as secretary - treasurer , and had no apparent connection to the track thereafter .
Eugene Hensley 's problems at Ruidoso Downs were just beginning .
In 1963 , Eugene Hensley was sued by minority partners for $ 415,000 .
The partners alleged Eugene Hensley used track money to make improvements to his Scottsdale home , used the track 's airplane for personal pleasure and built and operated a guest house for his personal use .
The lawsuit was settled the same year after Eugene Hensley agreed to return 1,000 shares of Ruidoso Racing Association stock that was by then worth $ 350,000 .
The civil suit was prelude to an eight - count federal criminal indictment filed against Eugene Hensley in 1966 , alleging income tax evasion .
Eugene Hensley was convicted on all counts in a scandalous trial that revealed he had purchased several automobiles using track money and given them to his wife and a girlfriend .
Despite his 1966 conviction and subsequent five - year prison sentence , Eugene Hensley remained free on bond and continued to control operations at Ruidoso Downs until the New Mexico Racing Commission banned him from the track in 1968 .
After his criminal appeals were denied , Eugene Hensley entered a federal prison in La Tuna , Texas , in 1969 .
That same year , Eugene Hensley sold his remaining interest in the track to NewCo Industries Incorporated , which immediately signed a 20 - year concession contract with Emprise Corporation of Buffalo , New York .
Emprise had documented ties to organized crime , and was the concessionaire at Arizona dog tracks .
One of the company 's strongest Arizona supporters reportedly was the Hensleys ' old business partner -- Kemper Marley .
In the early 1970s , Arizona racing officials began to clamp down on Emprise after the company was convicted and fined $ 10,000 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for its hidden ownership in the Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .
The IRE series reported that as a defendant in that case , Emprise was linked to several prominent organized crime figures .
Emprise reorganized in Arizona as Ramcorp and was allowed to keep its lucrative concession contracts while its Los Angeles conviction was appealed .
But all the company 's proceeds from dog tracks were funneled through a trustee , former Mesa rancher and farmer Dwight Patterson .
Patterson , according to the IRE , urged then - Arizona governor Raul Castro to appoint Kemper Marley to the three - member Arizona Racing Commission , a position Marley reportedly was eager to get .
Marley would replace Robert Kieckhefer , who had been an opponent of Emprise .
Castro received more than $ 19,000 during his 1974 gubernatorial campaign from Marley , and another $ 5,000 from Marley 's daughter -- colossal sums at the time for an Arizona political campaign .
Castro appointed Marley to the racing commission in 1976 .
Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles wrote a series of stories documenting Marley 's questionable performance in appointive posts he 'd previously held .
Bolles ' stories doomed Marley 's appointment , forcing him to resign soon after being named to the Racing Commission .
On June 2 , 1976 , Bolles was mortally wounded by a car bomb .
Before lapsing into unconsciousness , Bolles uttered the words , " Adamson , Emprise , Mafia . "
He died 11 days later .
John Harvey Adamson confessed to luring Bolles to a Phoenix hotel parking lot and placing a bomb beneath the reporter 's car .
The bomb , Adamson testified , was detonated by James Robison , a Chandler plumber .
Adamson testified he was hired to kill Bolles by Max Dunlap , a Phoenix contractor and close associate of Marley's .
Marley had extended a $ 1 million loan to Dunlap , which had not been repaid .
Adamson said Dunlap hired him to kill Bolles because Marley was upset over Bolles ' stories .
Adamson served a 20 - year prison sentence and has since been released .
Dunlap was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced in 1994 to life in prison .
Robison was convicted , but his case was later overturned on appeal and he was acquitted in a 1993 retrial .
In 1981 , Marley filed a libel suit against IRE for a 1977 story that linked Marley to organized crime and the Bolles murder .
Marley sought a " six - figure " award for compensatory damages and a " seven - figure " punitive award .
A jury ruled that Marley had not been libeled by the stories .
However , the jury ruled that IRE had inflicted " emotional distress " on Marley .
The jury awarded Marley $ 15,000 in punitive damages , a fraction of the damages he was seeking .
Marley died in 1990 at age 83 .
He was never charged in the Bolles case and denied any involvement .
After selling his interest in Ruidoso Racing Association , James Hensley turned his attention to a wholesale beer distributorship he reportedly founded in 1955 in Phoenix with 12 employees .
Details about the inception and remarkable growth of James Hensley 's company are sketchy .
Hensley and his wife , Marguerite , have kept a low profile .
While the couple is listed in the Phoenix society 's " Red Book , " there is a dearth of news stories , photographs or even references to the family in the Phoenix media .
Some liquor industry observers say Hensley was given the Budweiser distributorship by his old business associate Kemper Marley , but a search of public records has not confirmed this theory .
What the records do show is five decades of steady growth for Hensley 's enterprise under the lax supervision of the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control .
James Hensley has given conflicting information to the department concerning the early days of his business .
Efforts to search liquor department files are hampered because the agency destroyed all records more than 30 years old -- and many more recent .
The lack of historical state documents on the state 's largest beer wholesaler makes it impossible to determine when and under what circumstances James Hensley was granted his first wholesale liquor license .
One can only speculate how a convicted felon who falsified federal liquor records managed to obtain a state and federal wholesale liquor license within a few years of his 1949 conviction and 1953 indictment .
But apparently , Hensley did .
Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms spokesman Larry Bettendorf says federal liquor licenses are allocated under a provision of a 1935 law passed soon after Prohibition ended .
Wholesalers such as Hensley must receive a " basic permit " from the federal government as well as state licenses .
The federal permit was designed to keep people such as Hensley out of the liquor business .
" The big concern after Prohibition was having bootleggers or other organized criminals entering into the business by using a front man , " Bettendorf says .
There was also concern about applicants fronting for the real owners of a business -- something the Hensleys had done in New Mexico at the racetrack .
" They tried to do everything they could to weed out where the money was coming from to make sure the person applying for it was the actual owner and operator .
These laws had not changed that much since 1935 , " Bettendorf says .
Current provisions of the law do not allow anyone convicted of a felony to even apply for a " basic permit " liquor license for five years .
Bettendorf did not know whether the five - year provision was in effect in the 1950s .
He said a person -- such as James Hensley -- who had been convicted of a felony related to bootlegging should have been scrutinized by federal regulators before obtaining a permit .
" They would have looked at someone very heavily if they had been convicted of bootlegging .
Absolutely , " Bettendorf says .
Once the federal government issues a " basic permit , " it can stay in effect for decades .
It is uncertain how convicted bootlegger James Hensley obtained a federal basic permit .
However , it is extremely unlikely that a person with a similar conviction today would get a federal liquor license , says Allison Stevens , ATF Phoenix Area supervisor .
Hensley 's oldest state liquor license application on file dates to 1971 .
In that application , he disclosed his felony conviction but failed to state that he had been an owner and employee at Ruidoso Downs as the secretary of the corporation .
At the time , the problems at Ruidoso were widely publicized in New Mexico newspapers and his brother was in prison for tax evasion and skimming funds from the track .
State records show James Hensley applied for another liquor license in 1988 .
This time , Hensley did not disclose his federal conviction when asked specifically on the form whether he had ever been convicted of a felony .
James Hensley signed the sworn and notarized statement that warned false information " could result in criminal prosecution . "
State liquor department director Howard Adams refused to discuss Hensley 's distributorship .
" I do n't want to talk about any wholesalers , " Adams said .
The liquor department is overseen by a seven - member state liquor board .
Board chairman Bill Snyder did not return a message seeking comment .
Just as Hensley gave incomplete and conflicting information concerning his previous employment and felony convictions , the two license applications give different dates for when he started his wholesale beer business .
In the 1971 application for a liquor license , Hensley said he had served as president and general manager of Hensley & Company Distributors and Hensley & Company Wholesale since January 1959 .
But in the 1988 liquor license application , Hensley stated he had been the head of Hensley & Company Wholesale since January 1955 and makes no mention of Hensley & Company Distributors .
State Corporation Commission records show the first reference to Hensley & Company Distributors in 1959 , when a liquor and grocery distribution company called Ritter - Walker Distributing changed its name to Hensley & Company Distributors .
James Hensley was listed as president of the company , and Marguerite Hensley as secretary , on the 1959 annual disclosure report .
The company reported total assets of $ 143,000 .
Corporation Commission records state that Hensley & Company Wholesale was not incorporated until 1966 .
The confusing maze of companies continued for more than four decades as James Hensley created a series of wholesale beer companies -- operating as many as three different entities in the Phoenix area at one time .
He consolidated the operations in 1993 under the present banner Hensley & Company .
The company reported $ 48 million in assets in December 1996 , the last year the Corporation Commission required detailed financial disclosure .
Hensley & Company is reported to be the 12th largest privately owned company in Arizona , with nearly 500 employees and a sales and delivery fleet of more than 300 vehicles , according to a September 1999 article in the trade journal Beverage World .
The company controls more than 60 percent of the beer market in Arizona , selling more than 20 million cases of Anheuser - Busch and other brands each year .
The privately held company remains controlled by chairman James Hensley , although he 's relinquished day - to - day operations to Robert M. Delgado , who serves as president and chief operating officer .
Company records show that as of January 1996 James Hensley controlled through a trust 2,110 shares of stock , of which at least 1,655 shares were voting stock .
Cindy McCain owned the largest block of stock with 7,436 shares , but only 177 shares were voting .
Her three children , John , James and Meghan , each had 1,370 shares -- including 336 voting shares each -- held in trust .
An adopted child , Bridget , had 600 non-voting shares .
The company placed a value for tax purposes of $ 1,467 per share on the stock in 1996 , making Cindy McCain 's stake in the company worth $ 11 million .
The trusts for the four children are worth about $ 7 million .
Delgado , meanwhile , controlled 4,572 shares of non-voting stock worth $ 6.7 million .
The Hensley & Company stock is only part of the McCain clan 's wealth .
According to Senator McCain 's financial disclosure statement for calendar year 1998 , Cindy McCain controls more than $ 1 million worth of Anheuser - Busch stock that generated between $ 15,000 and $ 50,000 in dividends .
Cindy McCain and her children also report owning real estate in Mesa , Sedona and Yuma worth more than $ 2.5 million
The report indicates that despite receiving more than $ 1 million in dividends from Hensley & Company stock in 1998 , Cindy McCain had 12 personal loans outstanding worth at least $ 1.24 million -- including a Bank One loan that exceeded $ 1 million and an American Express card tab between $ 15,000 and $ 50,000 running at 18.4 percent interest .
Most of her loans were advances from the Hensley & Company .
While John McCain enjoys a posh lifestyle , the only asset he reports as personally owning , in addition to his $ 136,700 Senate salary , is his Navy retirement pension , which totaled $ 49,668 in 1998 .
The senator and his wife agreed to keep sole and separate property when they signed an antenuptial agreement in 1980 prior to their marriage .
Senator McCain 's personal wealth is tied completely to his wife .
And Cindy McCain remains beholden to her father .
At the top sits James Willis Hensley .
In the late 1970s , John McCain was at a crossroads , both personally and professionally .
His marriage to his first wife , Carol , was falling apart ; the two were in the midst of a number of trial separations .
And McCain , who would never fully recover from injuries he sustained in Vietnam , finally accepted the fact that he would never fly again .
He liked his job as the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate , but it had done more to whet his appetite for politics than satisfy his career goals .
Then he met Cindy Lou Hensley .
She was 25 , he was 42 .
As Robert Timberg describes it in his book John McCain : An American Odyssey , the two were instantly smitten when they spotted one another at a political reception in Honolulu .
McCain was there for business , Hensley for pleasure -- a vacation with her parents , James and Marguerite .
They courted long - distance .
She 'd told him she was three years older than she was ; he said he was four years younger .
The real age difference : 17 years .
In his book , Timberg acknowledges -- then dismisses -- a popular theory explaining the McCain - Hensley romance :
" McCain 's detractors , and some of his friends , would later say that he saw Cindy as the ultimate target of opportunity and locked on to her with single - minded , even cynical calculation .
It was fine that she was young and beautiful , so it was said , but the real attraction was that she was the daughter of a rich , well - connected businessman from a state that seemed to offer opportunities to someone with McCain 's emerging political ambitions .
" ... The scenario is hard to take seriously .
Was it even remotely possible that the impulsive , hot - blooded McCain who used to take his Navy pay in cash had suddenly been reborn as a gold - digging manipulator , coolly mapping out a marriage of convenience ? "
Further , Timberg argues , McCain had to divorce Carol , who had been seriously injured in a car accident before John returned from the war , and who was still debilitated .
What would that do to his political aspirations in a conservative state like Arizona ?
But John did divorce Carol in February 1980 , married Cindy that May and took a job in public affairs at Hensley & Company .
John and Cindy could hardly survive on his $ 31,000 Navy pension , after all , and the marriage and job granted McCain instant entree into Arizona 's business , social and political circles -- although insiders tell New Times that McCain was miserable in his new job , biding his time until he could run for office .
It did n't take long .
McCain had banked on the fact that a new congressional district being created in Arizona would be located in metropolitan Phoenix -- as a newcomer , he could hardly take on a strong incumbent .
That did n't happen ; the new district ended up in Tucson .
But McCain got lucky .
Longtime U.S. Representative John Rhodes announced his retirement in January 1982 , leaving McCain a clear shot at the state 's 1st Congressional District , which includes Tempe , Mesa and parts of east Phoenix .
Even before Rhodes made his official announcement , the McCains had found a new home in Tempe .
The 1982 Republican primary was crowded .
McCain deftly deflected the " carpetbagger " label by noting that as a Navy brat , he'd never lived in one place longer than the five and a half years he spent in Vietnamese prison camps .
His friendship with Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette publisher Darrow " Duke " Tully gave McCain a free platform to deliver his campaign messages via a series of columns that appeared in the Gazette .
( Tully was enamored of McCain 's fighter - pilot experience .
Tully resigned as publisher of the newspapers in 1985 after it was revealed he had fabricated a military background as a highly decorated fighter pilot . )
As much as his quick tongue , heroic story and free positive press , it was his father - in - law 's funds that helped first get McCain elected .
In 1982 , John and Cindy McCain reported an income of $ 801,056 .
Of that , the only amount unrelated to Hensley was McCain 's $ 31,038 Navy pension .
McCain lent $ 167,000 to his campaign -- a huge chunk of the $ 569,545 it took to get him elected that year .
( Another major contributor that year was Charles H Keating , a former Navy fighter pilot who later ensnarled McCain in the biggest scandal of his political career . )
In addition , James and Marguerite Hensley and their employees donated $ 11,000 to McCain 's first campaign ; Anheuser - Busch 's PAC gave him $ 1,000 .
McCain easily won reelection in 1984 .
Fortune -- or McCain 's foresight -- smiled again when Senator Barry Goldwater announced his retirement in 1986 .
McCain was the perfect candidate to succeed the straight - talking Goldwater , who was also a retired military pilot .
McCain jumped for -- and won -- the Senate seat .
Every election season , contributions from Hensley & Company and other liquor interests continued to fuel McCain 's electoral triumphs -- victories McCain was beginning to take for granted .
In October 1986 , just days before McCain was elected to the Senate , the Associated Press broke a story that the McCains had been quietly remodeling Cindy 's childhood home -- a $ 500,000 spread still owned by Jim Hensley and located in north central Phoenix , outside of Congressional District 1 -- so they could relocate after the election .
The project was kept so quiet , the AP reported , that modifications to the house were being made under the name " Smith , " rather than McCain .
As it turned out , Smith is Marguerite Hensley 's maiden name .
The building plans the AP obtained showed that McCain was adding " Jacuzzis , a cabana , a ramada , a swimming pool , fountains and a barbecue . "
To this day , Jim and Marguerite Hensley live just around the corner .
Cindy drives a Suburban with the license plate " Ms Bud . "
In John McCain 's early years in public office , he did n't enjoy the reputation he does today as a crusader , a maverick who rails against the evils of special interests .
His only notable attribute was a grasp of foreign affairs .
Yes , he voted against pay raises for members of Congress , and donated his honoraria from speaking engagements to charity , but McCain 's critics charged that was painless for a guy whose wife was a multimillionairess .
It was n't until the '90s , after he was embroiled in the Keating Five scandal ( he returned more than $ 112,000 in contributions from the savings and loan mogul after being accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators on Keating 's behalf ) , that McCain became a champion of campaign - finance reform .
In fact , early in his political career , McCain voted against measures like the one he now proudly sponsors .
The same is true with tobacco and guns .
McCain took tens of thousands of dollars from tobacco companies before 1998 , when he infuriated the industry by pushing reform legislation .
He has taken money from the National Rifle Association and its affiliates , and voted their way , although last year he supported a measure to ban gun shows .
McCain is reaping the benefits of his maverick act today , as scores of Democrats across the country are reregistering to vote for him in GOP primaries .
But there is one area where it is unlikely that John McCain will ever emerge as a champion of reform : alcohol .
When he was elected to Congress , McCain swore he 'd recuse himself on all votes related to the alcohol industry , given his father - in - law 's and wife 's business .
A New Times analysis of McCain 's voting record since 1983 reveals that he has in fact recused himself on the two dozen or so alcohol - related bills that required a voice vote on the floor of the House and then the Senate , while McCain has served in those respective bodies .
The bills examined dealt specifically with alcohol : examples include legislation to toughen drunken - driving laws and lower alcohol excise taxes .
But such votes are relatively insignificant when compared to other powers endowed on a senator -- particularly a senior senator who chairs an influential committee .
Particularly if the senator is John McCain , the committee is the powerful Senate Commerce Committee and the issue is alcohol .
The Senate Commerce Committee has a number of alcohol - related issues in its purview , including the labeling of alcoholic beverages and alcohol advertising .
But you would n't know it from looking at the committee 's agenda since McCain took its reins three years ago .
John McCain 's influence regarding alcohol - related legislation comes from his inaction , rather than action .
As a committee chairman , McCain has the unilateral power to kill a bill simply by refusing to put it on a committee agenda or schedule hearings .
And since McCain was elected chairman of the committee in January 1997 , that 's exactly what has happened .
In the summer of 1996 , Joseph E. Seagram & Sons rocked the alcohol and broadcasting industries by announcing it would take to the airwaves , in violation of a longtime voluntary ban on broadcast advertising of distilled spirits .
For decades , there 'd been an uneasy truce between the distilled spirits lobby and those who want to ban alcohol advertising entirely :
Print ads were okay , but broadcast was out .
When Seagram reneged on the agreement , the liquor community took note .
It was n't just the distilled spirits lobby that was concerned .
Seagram 's unilateral actions could result in a severe backlash for all alcohol - related industries .
Beer and wine interests , whose products are advertised on the airwaves , feared that Seagram had opened a Pandora 's box that could lead to tougher restrictions on beer and wine broadcast advertising as well .
In late 1996 , members of the Senate Commerce Committee decided to hold hearings .
A date was chosen , February 11 , 1997 , before Republican Senator Conrad Burns ' communications subcommittee .
( Burns ' press office did not return calls . )
But before the hearings could be held , two important events occurred .
First , the beer and wine industries mounted a strong lobbying effort to scuttle any committee action that might address liquor advertising .
Second , Senator John McCain was elected chairman of the Commerce Committee in January 1997 after former chairman Larry Pressler of South Dakota lost his November 1996 reelection bid .
Even before McCain 's ascension , Pandora 's box was flung open -- the beer and wine lobbyists could see that this was n't just about hard liquor ads on TV .
The distilled spirits folks also were jockeying for parity with the beer and wine industry , including equal excise taxes ( taxes currently are based on the percentage of alcohol in a beverage ) and the ability to advertise during sports broadcasts , the most lucrative shows .
The beer and wine lobbies do n't want any of that .
The hearings portended a showdown between a divided liquor industry -- with the beer and wine industries trying to maintain the status quo while some hard liquor producers were trying to make inroads not only in broadcast advertising , but taxing issues as well .
Another hot - button issue was alcohol advertising aimed at teens .
The hearings likely would have broached that volatile topic .
The stakes were high and so were the campaign contributions .
The Christian Science Monitor reported that hard liquor and beer and wine industry contributions doubled during that session of Congress .
Mounting contributions and intense lobbying paralyzed the committee as the hearings were postponed a couple of weeks .
Then , in mid-February , the committee announced it would not delve into the beer and wine industry 's role in alcohol advertising .
News of the committee 's capitulation to special interests made the trade journal Advertising Age in a February 17 , 1997 , article .
The beer and wine lobbies had prevailed .
By mid-spring , it was evident the hearings would n't take place at all .
Clearly , the pressure the beer and wine lobby brought to bear on many members of Congress had something to do with the decision , but observers also wonder about the coincidental timing of John McCain 's ascent to the chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee .
George Hacker was particularly disappointed that the hearings were derailed .
Off and on since 1982 , Hacker has run the alcohol policies project of the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
He says it 's very hard to get alcohol - related legislation heard in Congress , and more difficult since McCain took the helm of the Senate Commerce Committee .
" Having someone with no interest and who really refuses to take an interest in alcohol is a serious problem in the Commerce Committee , " Hacker says .
But does mere indifference actually benefit the liquor industry ?
" Well , sure , " Hacker replies .
" If the chairman has a problem dealing with these issues , he 'll go on to something else . "
In fact , three alcohol - related bills have been assigned to McCain 's committee since he became chairman , and none has been taken up .
All three were sponsored by Senator Strom Thurmond , a South Carolina Republican .
Thurmond has fought for alcohol industry reforms for decades .
He first introduced legislation to require health warnings on alcoholic beverages in 1967 .
He was finally successful in 1988 , although he 's still not satisfied .
Ironically , Thurmond 's daughter was killed in a drunken - driving accident in 1993 -- prompting the Senate Commerce Committee to hold hearings that year ; that 's the last time such hearings were held .
The three Thurmond bills that have been before McCain 's Commerce Committee all deal with alcoholic beverage labeling .
They would transfer authority for the labeling from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms to the Department of Health and Human Services .
Another measure would prohibit the alcohol industry -- particularly the wine industry -- from claiming benefits from its products on labels .
( This bill has been introduced twice while McCain has been chairman . )
John DeCrosta , Thurmond 's press secretary , says the alcohol industry does n't want to be in the legislative spotlight .
" The ... industry looks at what 's happening with the gun industry , tobacco industry , the lead - paint industry , and they know they have a problem , " he says .
" This is something people consume , they get behind the wheel of a car , they cause deaths .
They develop cirrhosis of the liver .
They develop breast cancer .
They develop hypertension .
How long before somebody goes after them ? "
Asked about McCain 's ignoring of his boss 's bills , DeCrosta offers a halting response : " It 's obviously Senator McCain 's prerogative as to whether or not he calls these up for a hearing .
And you know , yeah , I do n't want to say that we have problems , but that 's his prerogative , and these are not issues or pieces of legislation , unfortunately , that generate a lot of support as far as co-sponsors . "
But , DeCrosta adds , " This is an issue that we 're just gonna keep fighting .
Next Congress , we 'll probably introduce these bills again and try to get some support for them . "
And then there 's the matter of bills that do n't fall into the category of " alcohol - related , " per se , but would definitely have an impact on the industry .
One such bill would have forced consumers to pay a 10 - cent beverage container deposit , as an incentive to recycle .
The alcohol industry -- particularly the beer industry , which sells its beverages in individual units -- hates it .
On January 28 , 1997 , the National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act was introduced and referred to the Senate Commerce Committee .
The National Beer Wholesalers Association identified the bill as one of its prime targets .
The bill languished , untouched , until the end of that session -- and died .
It 's not the first time McCain has watched that recycling bill die .
In 1992 , McCain came under fire in Mother Jones magazine , which noted that the Senate Commerce Committee refused to hear a similar measure the day after McCain ( then just a member of the committee ) purchased between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 worth of Anheuser - Busch stock for one of his children .
( This purchase was likely made by his wife . )
One Anheuser - Busch pet issue that has received a great deal of attention from McCain is boxing .
Since McCain became chairman , the Senate Commerce Committee has held numerous hearings on bills designed to reform the boxing industry , to keep it safe -- and popular .
Meanwhile , McCain has attacked so - called " ultimate fighting " promotions , which could be construed as competition for boxing .
Anheuser - Busch is the single largest corporate sponsor of professional boxing .
An analysis of contributions to John McCain's ' 98 Senate campaign and current presidential campaign , through last December , reveals he 's taken at least $ 103,363 from alcohol - related political action committees and employees of the alcohol industry .
( By contrast , he 's taken more than $ 1 million from the telecommunications industry , $ 98,000 from maritime interests and $ 59,000 from trucking interests -- other industries with business before his committee .
Trucking issues are important to Hensley & Company , which operates a fleet of 300 delivery trucks . )
McCain 's recent alcohol money comes from a variety of sources -- hard liquor , wine and beer interests -- but from the beginning of his political career , James Hensley and his associates have been very good to John McCain .
Since 1982 , McCain has received the following contributions :
 Hensley & Company employees : at least $ 61,063
 National Beer Wholesalers PAC : $ 21,000
 Anheuser - Busch employees and PAC : $ 33,100
George Hacker , of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , was surprised to hear that McCain accepts beer money .
That raises a question :
Why would alcohol interests donate money to McCain if he recuses himself completely from their issue ?
Hensley and the National Beer Wholesalers Association did not answer requests for comment .
But Anheuser - Busch released this statement , from Stephen Lambright , general counsel :
" Anheuser - Busch has a long tradition of active and responsible corporate citizenship .
Like many corporations , we participate in the political process in many ways , including through making contributions .
In doing so , we support candidates from both sides of the aisle who best represent the views of our community , our employees , our consumers and our shareholders . "
Hacker has another answer : " My guess is they give money because ... he can help by being absent , he can help by passing the buck , he can help by not passing the buck . "
Budweiser is the King of Beers -- both in the cooler and on Capitol Hill .
Anheuser - Busch is the top - selling beer manufacturer in the world .
Last year , Forbes magazine ranked the company among its " Super 100 . "
Gross sales in 1999 hit $ 13.7 billion , with profits of $ 1.4 billion .
Anheuser - Busch has long spread that wealth among political parties and elected officials , continually ranking near the top of campaign finance watchdogs ' contributor lists .
A New Times analysis reveals that between 1979 and 1999 , Anheuser - Busch employees and its PAC contributed more than $ 1.6 million to political campaigns .
Since 1993 , the company has donated more than $ 2 million in soft money to committees on both sides of the aisle .
In addition to campaign contributions , Anheuser - Busch spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on lobbyists who work the Hill .
A recent hire : Kevin Curtin , former staff director for the Senate Commerce Committee under former chairman Ernest " Fritz " Hollings , a South Carolina Democrat .
The company is backed by a strong beer - industry lobby .
The Beer Institute is a force to be reckoned with on the Hill , and the National Beer Wholesalers Association is a huge contributor :
The NBWA PAC donated more than $ 7 million to campaigns since 1982 and more than $ 100,000 in soft money contributions .
Anheuser - Busch has a lot to protect .
No alcohol company has had worse press regarding its advertising practices .
There 's even a group called " Anheuser - Busch Shareholders for Advertising Reform , " which holds protests at the company 's annual meetings .
In 1996 -- months before the Senate Commerce Committee hearings were scheduled and then canceled -- the Center for Alcohol Advertising released a study that showed that children between 9 and 11 were more likely to recognize the Budweiser frogs than Kellogg 's Tony the Tiger , the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or Smokey the Bear .
Only Bugs Bunny was better known than the frogs .
Like the rest of the alcohol industry , Anheuser - Busch has interests that go beyond the alcohol votes McCain avoids .
For example , McCain led the charge to normalize relations with Vietnam at the same time Anheuser - Busch was preparing to enter that market .
( A deal the company had to co-own a factory eventually fell through because of copyright problems .
A Czech beer called " Bud " is already sold in Vietnam . )
A recent lobbyist disclosure revealed Anheuser - Busch 's many interests ( along with alcohol , the company owns amusement parks ) :
" The company lobbied on issues related to alcohol abuse and prevention , tobacco abuse prevention , advertising , labeling , and taxation .
Anheuser - Busch also worked on endangered species issues , clean air act , recycling , product liability , national tobacco settlement , and transportation spending , as well as international trade including China 's Most Favored Nation status and federal budget and deficit decisions . "
Despite his claim , it 's impossible for Senator John McCain to recuse himself completely from important issues facing his family 's business .
Last month , Anheuser - Busch announced it would once again serve as the primary sponsor of the four official presidential debates to be held this fall -- the last one in St. Louis , the company 's hometown .
The cost of the local debate , $ 550,000 , was released , but the total amount Anheuser - Busch will spend to sponsor the events was not made available .
Unless George W. Bush delivers a powerful counterpunch to McCain 's swelling bandwagon , John McCain will be standing on the Republican party podium for the debates paid for by the King of Beers .
At his side will be Ms. Bud .
Back home in Phoenix , beer baron James Willis Hensley might smile about the fabulous return on his political investment .
And all three will hope the bright lights will continue distracting voters from a persistent croaking sound echoing from history 's murky but noisy swamp .

As the dire finances of the airline industry force carriers to find ways of charging for what once were free services , in - flight WiFi offers an appealing alternative : charge for something new that did n't have a precedent of being free .
After a number of US carriers announced plans to offer the service on specific aircraft models , Delta Airlines has decided it was n't interested in these half - measures .
By next year , it plans to have every aircraft in its domestic fleet fitted with hardware to allow in - flight WiFi access .
As with the other airlines , Delta will be using the Gogo service provided by Aircell , which transmits a given plane 's traffic through a dedicated cellular network on the ground ( we 've described this in a bit more detail in the past ) .
The connection appears to support access to a variety of Internet protocols — Delta mentions web , e-mail , IM , and VPN — as well as SMS messages .
The service will be offered at flat rates : $ 9.95 for flights under three hours , $ 12.95 for anything over that .
( There was no mention of what would happen if a shorter flight stretches out past the three - hour limit while stuck in a holding pattern . )
As Aircell notes in its product literature , computer users are accustomed to having to pay for access to public hotspots ( generally including those at airports ) , opening their wallets for several hours of access is unlikely to seem as aggravating as doing so for a blanket and pillow .
Although Aircell claims that its systems can be installed during an overnight layover , Delta expects the rollout to take nearly a year .
MD - 88 and MD - 90 aircraft , which are the most common in its domestic fleet , will get the upgrade first , followed by various forms of Boeing jets .
In all , the 330 + plane fleet is expected to be fully outfitted by next summer — perhaps sooner if , like other airlines , Delta takes planes out of service through cutbacks .
The first planes to offer the service should be in operation by the autumn .
As I have to spend most of my day connected anyway , I 've generally used flights to sort through back work and emails without the threat of being distracted by new work flooding in , or as an opportunity to catch up on reading some dead - tree material .
As such , I 'm somewhat ambivalent about the chance to have airborne WiFi .
Still , at least I can count on the combination of a 6 ' 2 " frame , a 17 " laptop , and a miniscule gap between me and the reclining passenger in front of me to ensure that my laptop is unusable .
In the Baltic Sea , birds called common guillemots raise their young on herringlike fish called sprat .
In the 1990s , local sprat became unusually abundant after populations of their main predator , cod , plunged because of overfishing and climatic changes .
Yet during that time , guillemot chicks grew poorly .
Why ?
The answer may lie in the " junk food hypothesis , " which holds that poor - quality food can hamper the reproductive success of marine predators just as badly as low - quantity food .
Henrik Österblom , the biologist from the Baltic Nest Institute at the University of Stockholm who studied the guillemots , noted that sprat were leaner when they were abundant and had to compete for limited supplies of zooplankton .
The lean sprat made less - nutritious meals for the guillemot chicks .
The chicks ' parents tried to compensate by bringing home more sprats , but because they catch and carry just a single fish at a time , it was hard to keep up .
The guillemots are n't alone : recent experiments have shown that many marine fish - eaters , including Steller 's sea lions and kittiwakes , either can't raise healthy young or can't maintain their own weight when fed low - energy food , however plentiful .
With colleagues , Österblom reviewed all the papers he could find on the subject and concluded that the junk food hypothesis could explain , at least in part , recent cases of breeding failure among northern marine predators .
The research was detailed in the journal Oikos .

Ion beam helps fight against wine fraud
Nuclear scientists in France have unveiled a 21st - century tool for unmasking counterfeit vintage wines , by zapping them with ion beams from a particle accelerator .
The beams , which are directed at the glass not the wine , can distinguish how old the bottles are where they might originate .
" The chemical composition of glass used to make bottles changed over time and was different from place to place , " says Herve Guegan , a researcher at the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) in Bordeaux .
" We compare the suspect bottles with those that we know come from the chateaux . "
Growing problem
The Antique Wine Company in London , which handles more than 10,000 bottles of rare wines every year for thousands of customers around the world , asked Guegan 's centre to develop the fraud - busting technology .
" We sell bottles every day for between 2000 and 10,000 dollars , " says the company 's managing director , Stephen Williams .
He adds that an exceptional grand cru can fetch up to $ US100,000 dollars .
At these prices , " counterfeiting is something we have to be very diligent about , " he says .
France 's most prestigious Burgundy and Bordeaux chateaux are notoriously reluctant to discuss fraud or its prevalence , but wine experts say it is a growing problem .
In a recent case , American collector William Koch sued a German wine dealer , claiming four bottles - allegedly belonging to US president Thomas Jefferson - he had purchased for $ US500,000 dollars were fake .
The case has yet to be settled .
Bottle database
The ion beam technology depends on comparison with genuine bottles .
" We are working with the various chateaux to develop a database of benchmark references , " said Williams , adding that more than 120 of Bordeaux 's most prestigious house have signed on .
He has also set his sights on the prized Burgundy region in northwestern France , and says a service geared toward wine collectors , wine merchants and auction houses will be available by late November .
While the new test can verify the age of the bottle , it cannot guarantee the quality of the wine .
The ion beam analysis correctly dated bottles of German wine recovered from a German ship , the Deutschland , which sank in a storm off the coast of England in 1875 , says Williams .
" The wine , however , was n't very good .
We still had a headache six months later , " he says .
To prevent counterfeiters from filling authentic old bottles with ordinary wine , Williams intends to combine the ion beam test with another established method that checks for levels of a radioactive isotope , caesium 137 , in the wine itself .
This technique , however , is only effective in identifying wines made in the era of heavy atomic weapons testing in the latter half of the 20th century .
Other technologies developed in the last few years to combat fine wine fraud include water marks and holograms on labels - like those used on bank notes - along with bar codes and UV - sensitive markings .

Chile 's peso firmed 0.4 % against a weaker dollar a day after Pinera said the subsidies would be aimed at creating new jobs or recovering those lost during coronavirus - driven lockdowns .
The currency has recovered sharply from its March lows , but remains about 4 % down on the year as the pandemic hammered Chile 's commerce , services and tourism sectors and drove unemployment to over 13 % , its highest in a decade .
The peso has far outperformed Brazil 's real , which plumbed new lows in 2020 despite a constitutional reform bill aimed at simplifying and reducing the cost of the public sector of Latin America 's biggest economy .
An interview recorded at JAOO , Anders Hejlsberg and Guy Steele talk about concurrency in language design .
Anders Hejlsberg is the chief architect of C# , creator of Turbo Pascal , and former chief architect of Delphi .
Guy Steele is the creator of Scheme and is currently working on Sun's Fortress , a programming language that focuses on parallelism and mathematics .
According to Anders , the change in emphasis is that the focus on parallelism is moving from coarse task and process based concurrency to a fine - grained concurrency where " you want to break a single logical task into multiple workloads " .
One of the areas Anders is working on is finding a way for the compiler to know if an object has been " revealed to the rest of the world " and using that information to determine if it is safe to mutate .
The challenge is that programmers have been taught to write in ways that are incompatible with where they need to go .
Guy follows with defining two types of concurrency , those that are fundamental to the application such as transactional processing , and those that are the result of not having a single CPU that is fast enough .
For the latter type he claims that developers would be happy not to use multi- threading if it were a viable option .
He does not care if the language is functional or not , as long as you can tell the compiler where it 's OK to use parallelism .
Anders counters that developers do not necessarily know if their code , or the code it uses , are actually safe .
This is where the idea of making pure functions , functions without side - effects , able to call only other pure functions .
When the topic turns to functional programming languages they both mentioned there is a lot of interest in it , but acknowledge the problems with retraining developers who have already heavily invested in imperative programming skills .
Anders also brings up the issue of efficiency in functional languages ; specifically algorithms like QuickSort perform poorly in functional languages .
He prefers a hybrid approach where there are " islands of purity " in an otherwise imperative language with a clear delineation between them .

The Omen
I 'm watching The Omen as I type this - how great is Gregory Peck ?
And he almost was n't cast in the part - the first pick was Charlton Heston , but he turned it down to make Midway .
And thank God for that - just about a year earlier , Peck was contemplating retirement because he had been in a nasty string of box office bombs .
But then The Omen came along and revived his career .
He took a huge pay cut , but did option to get a cut of the film 's gross .
The movie made more than $ 60 million in the U.S. alone , so it quickly became Gregory Peck 's highest - paying movie ever .
On to the trivia !
The little boy who played Damien , Harvey Stephens , dyed his hair dark just to play Damien - he was actually blond .
It 's the only major film role he ever had , although he did have a brief cameo in the 2006 remake as " Tabloid Reporter # 3 . "
I was delighted to find out that the actress who played Mrs. Baylock was in Hot Fuzz ( I adore Simon Pegg ) .
She was Joyce Cooper , the lady who ran the inn that Sgt.
Angel stayed at - the one he had the " Fascist " and " Hag " verbal spat with .
Equally interesting - the girl who played the nanny who offs herself in Damien 's honor is Jack Palance 's daughter , Holly .
The scene where the baboons attack the car at the safari park really scared Harvey Stephens and Lee Remick .
At first the scene was n't working - they tried putting a baby baboon in the backseat of the car to make the baboons angry , but much to everyone 's dismay , the baboons did n't really care .
Instead , they took the head baboon , causing the herd to go insane , rushing and pounding on the car .
That terror you see on Lee Remick 's face is real .
She was n't expecting such a violent reaction .
When the goldfish bowl falls to the floor and smashes , they 're not really goldfish .
They 're just already - dead sardines painted orange , because director Richard Donner refused to kill goldfish just for the sake of the movie .
Just like the 2006 remake , marketing made a huge deal out of 666 being the sign of Satan .
If you remember , the 2006 version came out on 6 - 6 - 06 .
The ' 76 version was sneak - previewed on June 6 , 1976 , and you 'd better believe that date was picked on purpose .
While movie patrons were in the theater watching the preview , theater employees were busy putting up posters to be seen as soon as the customers exited the theater .
They read , " Today is the SIXTH day of the SIXTH month of nineteen - seventy - SIX ! "
THe trick worked - many customers were seriously spooked .
Maybe The Omen is cursed .
Much has been made of the bizarre accidents that befell members of the cast and crew .
For instance : Scriptwriter and novel writer David Seltzer 's plan was struck by lightning .
Gregory Peck 's plane was struck by lightning too , on a separate occasion , and he was almost killed in a plane crash - he canceled his reservation on a flight that ended up plummeting to the ground , killing everyone on board .
Director Richard Donner 's hotel was bombed .
The Rottweiler trainers were attacked by the dogs they were training .
Eerily , the girlfriend of the special effects coordinator who rigged up the famous decapitation scene was decapitated a couple of years later .
And even people barely involved were at risk : a warden where the safari park scene was filmed was killed by a lion just a day after the scene was shot .
The scene where Lee Remick falls from the second floor of the house was done not by having her actually fall , strapped into a harness or anything .
She " fell " standing upright and was pushed backward by a dolly onto a " floor " built onto a wall .
How did the unknown Harvey Stephens get the prime role of Damien ?
Well , during casting , director Richard Donner told all of the little boys who were auditioning to attack him like they would attack Kathy during the church scene .
I mean , that 's probably fun for any little boy - but Stephens really played it to the hilt , scratching and clawing at Donner 's face and kicking him in the groin .
The groin kick must have really won Donner over .
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
I must admit , Texas Chainsaw is n't one of my favorites .
I have to agree with the commenter who said they are n't really into the torture movies - Saw , Hostel and Turistas are so not up my alley .
But , that does n't mean I do n't appreciate it for what it is - a groundbreaking movie for the genre .
It was so terrifying that people actually walked out during a mere sneak preview of the movie .
Like a lot of the other movies we 've discussed , it had a tiny little budget - $ 60,000 , although some accounts say it eventually ballooned up to as much as twice that .
Does n't really matter , though , since it ended up making $ 30.8 million in the U.S .
Director Tobe Hooper says he was standing in the hardware section of a store , getting angry because the crowd was so huge .
Then he saw the chainsaws and a lightbulb went off in his head .
Edwin Neal , who played the hitchhiker , said that filming his scenes with John Dugan ( he played the grandfather ) was the worst experience of his entire life .
It took 36 hours to film his scenes in temperatures that were consistently over 100 degrees .
The room was filled with rotting animal carcasses and food .
Neal has emphasized just how horrible it was by saying , " I had been in Vietnam , with people trying to kill me , so I guess that shows how bad it was . "
There 's no way the film is a true story .
The opening says that the events took place on August 18 , 1973 , but the movie was actually shot from July 15 , 1973 , thought August 14 , 1973 .
However , urban legends still persist that the horrifying events actually did happen near Poth , Texas , a town about 50 miles south of San Antonio .
The dude who played Leatherface , Gunnar Hansen , could easily run faster than Marilyn Burns ( Sally ) .
He employed lots of little tricks to slow himself up - if you watch when he is chasing her through the woods , at one point in the background , he starts to randomly slice up branches .
Gunnar Hansen had to wear the same shirt for the entire month of filming .
It could n't be washed , because the color might change and provide an inconsistency .
So he wore it for four weeks in the same conditions noted above - Texas heatwave , lots of fake blood and gore , etc .
By the end of the shoot , no one would eat lunch with Hansen when he was in costume because he smelled so bad .
Supposedly , the film never would have been made if it was n't for the porn Deep Throat .
The financing for Texas Chainsaw came from the profits of the Linda Lovelace flick .
Poltergeist
Let 's just keep the Tobe Hooper train rolling - he directed Poltergeist , which is maybe the best ghost movie of all time .
And unlike our others , this was a Spielberg flick – it had a budget and a crack marketing crew .
But like Texas Chainsaw , being involved with the movie comes with its downfalls .
I ’m talking about the Curse , of course .
Both actresses who played the daughters in the movie died at very young ages – Dominique Dunne , who played the older daughter , was murdered by her abusive ex-boyfriend in 1982 , the same year Poltergeist was released .
She was only 22 .
The actress who played little Carol Anne in the entire series died in 1988 at the age of 12 – the cause is a little murky .
First it was called an extreme case of the flu , then changed to septic shock , and is now thought to be attributed to acute bowel obstruction .
Two of the actors from Poltergeist II also died , one from stomach cancer and one from post - operative kidney failure .
But it ’s not just deaths – lots of other odd things happened as well .
The house that served as the exterior of the Freeling home was damaged in a 1994 earthquake ; JoBeth Williams ( she played the mom ) would come home after filming every day to find that all of the pictures on the wall in her house were crooked ; and in the scene where the son , Robbie , is choked by the clown , something went wrong with the mechanical prop and the actor was actually being choked .
These are just a few – a quick Google for “ Poltergeist curse ” will lead you to all sorts of interesting stories .
Some of them are a stretch , to be sure , but it definitely makes for some creepy reading .
Snopes has a good article about it , too .
A few more tidbits :
• According to both Craig T. Nelson ( the Freeling dad ) and JoBeth Williams , the skeletons used in the swimming pool scene near the end were the real thing due to a mistake by the prop company .
I feel like there are probably some bio - hazard issues there – I wonder if the cast was just told that he props were the real thing to elicit real terror during filming the scene .
• Like Texas Chainsaw , director Tobe Hooper had some real - life inspiration : a previous encounter with a poltergeist .
When he was a teen , his father passed away .
For weeks afterward Hooper says random dishes would fly of their own accord around the house .
• You know the scene where the researcher is looking in the bathroom mirror and starts hallucinating that he ’s tearing the skin off of his own face ?
The hands actually ripping the flesh off belong to Steven Spielberg .
• Look close at the kids ’ rooms – they ’re packed with Star Wars toys .
• Drew Barrymore audtioned for the Carol Anne part .
• Steven Spielberg and I have something in common : a fear of clowns .
In the movie , both of Robbie ’s fears – the clown and the tree outside of his room – are things Steven was scared of as a child .
• Apparently the MGM lion roar is the same roaring noise the Beast makes when it attacks the house at the end of the movie .
I ’m going to have to go pull out my copy of Poltergeist and check that one out .
• When JoBeth Williams is in the kitchen cleaning , turns to get some more supplies , and then turns back around to find the chairs stacked up on the table – that was all done in one smooth shot .
While the camera is following her over to her cleaning supplies , crew members quickly removed the single chairs and set an already - constructed stack on top of the table .
IMDB says if you watch the toaster on the counter while JoBeth is assembling her cleaning stuff , you can see the crew members stacking the chairs in the reflection .
Another thing I ’m definitely going to check out .
So , that ’s it for one more round of horror movie facts .
Would a third round be overkill ?
So many wonderful , terrifying movies … so little time .
The real winner of the 2008 presidential election ?

EDIT : Apparently Google Maps fixed the problem .
Now I guess you ’ll just have to trust me .
You trust me , do n’t you ?
So I ’m writing today , and for the scene I ’m working on , I need to know roughly how long it might take to get from Dubrovnik , Croatia to Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina .
No problem , I think , I ’ll just go to trustworthy Google Maps to find out .
It gave should have given me this :
See anything wrong with the map above ?
Note that according to Google Maps , one should n’t take the conveniently located highway between the two cities .
Apparently that ’s for sissies .
No , the preferred route is to take the ferry to Bari , Italy , drive to Brindisi , Italy , take the ferry there to Paxi , Greece , take another ferry to Parga , Greece , drive through the Albanian cities of Durrës and Shkodër , into Montenegro and through its capital of Podgorica before finally entering Bosnia and Herzegovina and arriving in its lovely capital .
For the record , that ’s six countries , six languages , three alphabets , 885 miles , and 28 hours to travel between two cities that are roughly 150 miles apart .
I sure hope Google fixes their algorithm before they take over the world .
Of course , that could be their evil plan .
Get everyone lost and then swoop in to fill the vacuum .
There ’s a conspiracy we sould be trying to spread .
Nato today said it had received a note from Moscow saying that Russia would break off military cooperation with the west 's military alliance .
The move is the latest fallout from Russia 's short , sharp war with Georgia .
It appeared to be a tit - for - tat response to Nato 's announcement this week that there could be " no business as usual " as long as Russian forces remained in Georgia .
Foreign ministers meeting in Brussels had decided that the Nato - Russia council would no longer meet for the time being .
The council , set up in 2002 , paved the way for cooperation on several projects .
They included the participation of Russian warships in Nato Mediterranean counter - terrorism patrols , sharing expertise to combat heroin trafficking from Afghanistan and developing battlefield anti-missile technology .
Norway , an alliance member , yesterday said it was told by Russia of its plans to cut all military ties with Nato .
An alliance spokeswoman , Carmen Romero , today said Nato had received notification through military channels that Russia 's defence ministry had taken a decision " to halt international military cooperation events between Russia and Nato countries until further instructions " .
She said Nato " takes note " of the decision , but had no further reaction .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , suggested that Nato needed Moscow more than Moscow needed Nato .
He said Russian cooperation with Nato efforts against militants in Afghanistan could be jeopardised , adding : " Russia 's help is critical for Nato . "
Lavrov added that after this week 's emergency meeting in Brussels , during which Nato " adopted a sharp but not very concrete document " on how to deal with Russia , " leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears , hoping that we do not halt cooperation with Nato on Afghanistan " .
" We do not intend to slam the door , " the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
" Everything depends on Nato - if their priorities go to the unconditional support of the bankrupt Saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership with Nato , it 's not our fault . "
The US played down the significance of the Russian decision , saying Nato had already effectively frozen cooperation in protest at Russia 's continued military presence in much of Georgia .
" For all practical purposes , military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the Russians , " the US national security council spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , said .
" I can't imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the Russians until the situation in Georgia is resolved . "
Nato warships entered the Black Sea for what the alliance said were long - planned exercises and routine visits to ports in Romania and Bulgaria .
Nato said the exercises were not linked to the conflict in Georgia , which lies on the eastern shore of the Black Sea , around 550 miles from the Romanian coast .
The three warships - from Spain , Germany and Poland - sailed into the Black Sea today and are due to joined by a US frigate , the USS Taylor , later this week .
They are " conducting a pre-planned routine visit to the Black Sea region to interact and exercise with our Nato partners Romania and Bulgaria , which is an important feature of our routine planning , " Vice - Admiral Pim Bedet , the deputy commander at the allied maritime headquarters in Northwood , England , said .

White House Lobbyist Reportedly Offered to Trade Access to Top Administration Officials for Cash Donations
Sunday , July 13 , 2008

A lobbyist with close ties to the White House reportedly was captured on undercover video offering access to key Bush administration figures — including Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice — in return for large donations to a library commemorating the Bush presidency .
The Sunday Times of London reported that Stephen Payne , who claims to have raised more than $ 1 million for the Republican Party in recent years , said he would arrange meetings with senior administration officials in return for a payment of " several hundred thousand dollars " toward the library in Texas .
During an undercover investigation by the newspaper , Payne was asked to arrange meetings in Washington for an exiled former central Asian president .
He outlined the cost of facilitating such access .
“ The exact budget I will come up with , but it will be somewhere between $ 600,000 and $ 750,000 , with about a third of it going directly to the Bush library , ” said Payne , who also is a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council .
He is shown on video telling the undercover Sunday Times reporters that the “ family ” of an Asian politician should make the donation .
He later added that if all the money was paid to him he would make the payment to the Bush library .
Publicly , it would appear to have been made in the politician ’s name “ unless he wants to be anonymous for some reason . "
Asked by the undercover reporter who the politician would be able to meet for a payment of $ 250,000 , Payne said : “ Cheney ’s possible , definitely the national security adviser [ Stephen Hadley ] , definitely either Dr. Rice or . . .
I think a meeting with Dr. Rice or the deputy secretary [ John Negroponte ] is possible . "

Cases from across the country prove that if the unborn are recognized as legal persons with separate human rights , the government will have the power to deprive pregnant women of their rights to informed consent , due process , liberty , and even life .

This summer , the question of abortion and the rights of the
unborn once again took center stage as a presidential campaign issue .
In
August , at the Saddleback Civil Forum , Pastor Rick Warren asked both
presidential candidates : " At what point is a baby entitled to human
rights ? "
Senator John McCain ’s answer ,
" at the moment of conception , " immediately established his anti-abortion bona
fides .
But the right answer , as a matter of international human rights principles and simple justice ,
is : human rights attach at birth , not at conception .
This is the only position that ensures that upon becoming
pregnant , women do not lose their
human rights .

Cases from across the country prove that if the unborn are
recognized as legal persons with separate human rights , the government will
have the power to deprive pregnant women of their rights to informed consent ,
due process , liberty , and even life – without any guarantee that the interests
of the unborn will in fact be protected .
After Ayesha Madyun ’s water broke , she went to
the hospital where she hoped and planned to have a vaginal birth .
When she
did n’t give birth in a time - frame comfortable to her doctors , they argued that
she should have Cesarean surgery .
The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a
50 - 75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically .
( Risks of
infection are believed by some health care providers to increase with each hour
after a woman ’s water has broken and she has n’t delivered . )
The court
said , " [ a ]ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent
existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor ’s scalpel . "
The court granted the order ; the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun .
After the delivery , there was no evidence of
infection and no evidence that any human rights were advanced – for the born or
unborn .
Relying on fetal rights arguments , authorities in Utah arrested a woman
for murder because she delayed a C - section causing , the state alleged , the
stillbirth of one of her twins .
Other women have been charged with
homicide based on the claim that the stillbirths they suffered were caused by
an illegal drug they took .
Recently , a unanimous South Carolina Supreme Court had to overturn
Regina McKnight ’s conviction for homicide by child abuse .
After Ms. McKnight
had served more than eight years in prison , the court finally recognized that
her conviction had been based on " outdated " research and that her trial counsel
had failed to call experts who would have testified about " recent studies
showing that cocaine is no more harmful to a fetus than nicotine use , poor
nutrition , lack of prenatal care , or other conditions commonly associated with
the urban poor . "
At least fifteen
to twenty percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth .
Certainly , human rights are not advanced by
creating a legal basis for treating miscarriages and stillbirths as murder .
Laura Pemberton wanted to have a vaginal birth after a
previous delivery by Cesarean surgery .
Because no hospital would admit her
unless she agreed to deliver again by surgery , she stayed home to give birth .
While there , in active labor and near delivery , an armed Sheriff knocked on her
door .
He had orders to take her into custody .
He strapped her legs together and
brought her to a hospital to determine whether she could be forced to have the Cesarean surgery .
A lawyer was appointed for the fetus , but not for Ms .
Pemberton .
Ms. Pemberton vehemently opposes abortion , but she nevertheless
believed in her right to evaluate medical risks and benefits to herself and her
unborn child .
She was forced to have the unnecessary surgery .
When she later
sued for violations of her civil rights , was told she had none .
My organization , National Advocates for Pregnant Women , is documenting
hundreds of cases in which fetal rights have been used to justify denying human
rights to women who have no intention of ending their pregnancies .
If the unborn
are granted human rights , courts will have jurisdiction over pregnant women
whenever someone disagrees with their decisions to undergo chemotherapy , to
continue taking anti-depressants , to continue working , to drink any amount of
alcohol , to chose vaginal birth over Cesarean surgery and even if what the
pregnant woman wants is , simply , to live .
At 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant Angela Carder became
critically ill .
The hospital called an emergency hearing to determine the
rights of the fetus .
Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms .
Carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal
rights .
As a result , Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and
bodily integrity ; she lost her life .
The surgery resulted in the death of both Ms .
Carder and her fetus .
Ms. Carder ’s case makes clear that the issue is not choice
versus life , but life vs. life – that is whether the government should have the
power to privilege fetal rights over maternal life .
Political
candidates of all persuasions should rest assured that to oppose the
recognition of human rights before birth is not to deny the value of potential
life as matter of religious belief , emotional conviction or personal
experience .
Rather , it is to recognize the value of the women who give that
life .
It is to recognize that there are not two different kinds of women : those who have
abortions and those who have babies .
Sixty - one percent of women who have
abortions are already mothers .
Over the course of their lives , 85 percent of
all women bring life into this world and provide the majority of care for that
life .
These women – all of them , whether they oppose or support
legal abortion – struggle with U.S. policies that run counter to women ’s health
and family well being .
They are pregnant women who lack protection from
workplace discrimination .
They are parents and caretakers who lack economic and
social supports available to women in virtually every other western
industrialized country , like a national health care system and paid maternity
leave .
And , whether they define themselves as " pro-life " or
" pro-choice , " most women believe , and justice demands , that they do not lose their human rights at
the moment they conceive .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Playboy magazine is offering a new way to lose your shirt on Wall Street .

The adult entertainment magazine , long famous for its photo spreads of nude women and lessons in living the urbane life of the well - heeled bachelor , is launching a search for models to pose for its upcoming feature , “ Women of Wall Street . ”
Playboy came up with the idea for the feature after the onset of the global financial crisis , which has vaporized fortunes and left Wall Street reeling .
It is planned for the February 2009 edition of the monthly magazine and on its website .
“ When the news gets bad , then maybe that ’s a chance to make people smile by coming up with something that puts a different twist on it , ” said Gary Cole , Playboy ’s photo editor .
Playboy and Playboy.com frequently run specials such as “ Girls of Olive Garden ” and “ Women of Home Depot , ” but in the past it has garnered attention for big business news themes .
It published “ Women of Enron ” and “ Women of WorldCom ” after the companies ’ spectacular failures .
The magazine ran a “ Women of Wall Street ” feature nearly 20 years ago .
Playboy is seeking current and former employees of the financial world , and is especially interested in those with more senior job experience .
“ It would be more interesting to have someone who ’s a financial analyst , ” said Cole .
Models must work for a financial institution or have recently worked for one , and prove that they are at least 18 years old .
“ How many attractive women do you ... think there are working on Wall Street and the affiliated companies ? ”
Cole said when asked how much success he thought Playboy would have in finding candidates .
“ There has to be thousands and thousands . ”
Playboy likely will photograph about 20 women , he said , adding that compensation would depend partly on how many women apply .
“ Whether you offer them $ 500 or $ 1,000 or $ 2,000 a piece , that ’s probably not going to change anybody ’s mind , ” he said .
“ The reason they do this is because they want the attention , the opportunity , the experience of doing it .
It ’s not really for the money . ”

We Hopi believe that the human race has passed through three different worlds and life ways since the beginning .
At the end of each prior world , human life has been purified or punished by the Great Spirit " Massauu " due mainly to corruption , greed and turning away from the Great Spirit 's teachings .
The last great destruction was the flood which destroyed all but a few faithful ones who asked and received a permission from the Great Spirit to live with Him in this new land .
The Great Spirit said , " It is up to you , if you are willing to live my poor , humble and simple life way .
It is hard but if you agree to live according to my teachings and instructions , if you never lose faith in the life I shall give you , you may come and live with me . "
The Hopi and all who were saved from the great flood made a sacred covenant with the Great Spirit at that time .
We Hopi made an oath that we will never turn away from Him .
For us the Creators laws never change or break down .
To the Hopi the Great Spirit is all powerful .
He appeared to the first people as a man and talked with them in the beginning of this creation world .
He taught us how to live , to worship , where to go and what food to carry , gave us seeds to plant and harvest .
He gave us a set of sacred stone tablets into which
He breathed all teachings in order to safeguard his land and life .
In these stone tablets were made , instructions and prophecies and warnings .
This was done with the help of a Spider woman and Her two grandsons .
They were wise and powerful helpers of the Great Spirit .
Before the Great Spirit went into hiding , He and Spider woman put before the leaders of the different groups of people many colors and sized of corn for them to choose their food in this world .
The Hopi was the last to pick and then choose their food in this world .
The Hopi then choose the smallest ear of corn .
Then Massauu said , " You have shown me you are wise and humble for this reason you will be called Hopi ( people of peace ) and I will place in your authority all land and life to guard , protect and hold trust for Me until I return to you in later days for I am the First and the Last . "
This why when a Hopi is ordained into the higher religious order , the earth and all living things are placed upon his hands .
He becomes a parent to all life on earth .
He is entitled to advise and correct his children in whatever peaceful way he can .
So we can never give up knowing that our message of peace will reach our children .
Then it is together with the other spiritual leaders the destiny of our future children is placed .
We are instructed to hold this world in balance within the land and the many universes with special prayers and ritual which continue to this day .
It was to the Spider woman's two grandsons the sacred stone tablets were given .
These two brothers were then instructed to carry them to a place the Great Spirit had instructed them .
The older brother was to go immediately to the east , to the rising sun and upon reaching his destination was instructed to immediately start to look for his younger brother who shall remain in the land of the Great Spirit .
The Older brothers mission when he returned was to help his younger brother ( Hopi ) bring about peace , brotherhood and everlasting life on his return .
Hopi , the younger brother , was instructed to cover all land and mark it well with footprints and sacred markings to claim this land for the Creator and peace on earth .
We established our ceremonials and sacred shrines to hold this world in balance in accordance with our first promise to the Creator .
This is how our migration story goes , until we meet the Creator at Old Tribe ( place that solidifies ) over 1000 years ago .
It was at that meeting when he gave to us these prophecies to give to you now at this closing of the Fourth World of destruction and the beginning of the Fifth World of peace .
He gave us many prophecies to pass on to you and all have come to pass .
This is how we know the timing is now to reveal the last warnings and instructions to mankind .
We were told to settle permanently here in Hopi land where we met the Great Spirit and wait for Older Brother who went east to return to us .
When he returns to this land he will place his stone tablets side by side to show all the world that they are our true brothers .
When the road in the sky has been fulfilled and when the inventing of something , in Hopi means , gourd of ashes , a gourd that when drops upon the earth will boil everything within a large space and nothing will grow for a very long time .
When the leaders turned to evil ways instead of the Great Spirit we were told there would be many ways this life may be destroyed .
If human kind does not heed our prophecy and return to ones original spiritual instructions .
We were told of three helpers who were commissioned by the Great Spirit to help Hopi bring about the peaceful life on earth would appear to help us and we should not change our homes , our ceremonials , our hair , because the true helpers might not recognize us as the true Hopi .
So we have been waiting all these years .
It is known that our True White Brother , when he comes , will be all powerful and will wear a red cap or red cloak .
He will be large in population , belong to no religion but his very own .
He will bring with him the sacred stone tablets .
With him there will be two great ones both very wise and powerful .
One will have a symbol or sign of swastika which represents purity and is Female , a producer of life .
The third one or the second one of the two helpers to our True White Brother will have a sign of a symbol of the sun .
He , too , will be many people and very wise and powerful .
We have in our sacred Kachina ceremonies a gourd rattle which is still in use today with these symbols of these powerful helpers of our True Brother .
It is also prophesied that if these three fail to fulfill their mission then the one from the west will come like a big storm .
He will be many , in numbers and unmerciful .
When he comes he will cover the land like the red ants and over take this land in one day .
If the three helpers chosen by the Creator fulfill their sacred mission and even if there are only one , two or three of the true Hopi remaining holding fast to the last ancient teaching and instructions the Great Spirit , Massauu will appear before all and our would will be saved .
The three will lay our a new life plan which leads to everlasting life and peace .
The earth will become new as it was from the beginning .
Flowers will bloom again , wild games will return to barren lands and there will be abundance of food for all .
Those who are saved will share everything equally and they all will recognize Great Spirit and speak one language .
We are now faced with great problems , not only here but throughout the land .
Ancient cultures are being annihilated .
Our people 's lands are being taken from them , leaving them no place to call their own .
Why is this happening ?
It is happening because many have given up or manipulated their original spiritual teachings .
The way of life which the Great Spirit has given to all its people of the world , whatever your original instructions are not being honored .
It is because of this great sickness - called greed , which infects every land and country that simple people are losing what they have kept for thousands of years .
Now we are at the very end of our trail .
Many people no longer recognize the true path of the Great Spirit .
They have , in fact , no respect for the Great Spirit or for our precious Mother Earth , who gives us all life .
We are instructed in our ancient prophecy that this would occur .
We were told that someone would try to go up to the moon : that they would bring something back from the moon ; and that after that , nature would show signs of losing its balance .
Now we see that coming about .
All over the world there are now many signs that nature is no longer in balance .
Floods , drought , earthquakes , and great storms are occurring and causing much suffering .
We do not want this to occur in our country and we pray to the Great Spirit to save us from such things .
But there are now signs that this very same thing might happen very soon on our own land .
Now we must look upon each other as brothers and sisters .
There is no more time for divisions between people .
Today I call upon all of us , from right here at home , Hotevilla , where we to are guilty of gossiping and causing divisions even among our own families ; out to the entire world where thievery , war and lying goes on every day .
These divisions will not be our salvation .
Wars only bring more wars never peace .
Only by joining together in a Spiritual Peace with love in our hearts for one another , love in our hearts for the Great Spirit and Mother Earth , shall we be saved from the terrible Purification Day which is just ahead .
There are many of you in this world who are honest people .
We know you spiritually for we are the " Men 's Society Grandfathers " who have been charged to pray for you and all life on earth never forgetting anything or any one in our ceremonials .
Our prayer is to have a good happy life , plenty of soft gentle rain for abundant crops .
We pray for balance on earth to live in peace and leave a beautiful world to the children yet to come .
We know you have good hearts but good hearts are not enough to help us out with these great problems .
In the past some of you have tried to help us Hopis , and we will always be thankful for you efforts .
But now we need your help in the worst way .
We want the people of the world to know the truth of our situation .
This land which people call the Land of the Freedom celebrates many days reminding people of the world of these things .
Yet in well over 200 years the original Americans have not seen a free day .
We are suffering the final insult .
Our people are now losing the one thing which give life and meaning of life -- our ceremonial land , which is being taken away from us .
Hotevilla is the last holy consecrated , undisturbed traditional Native American sacred shrine to the Creator .
As the prophecy says , this sacred shrine must keep its spiritual pathways open .
This village is the spiritual vortex for the Hopi to guide the many awakening Native Americans and other true hearts home to their own unique culture .
Hotevilla was established by the last remaining spiritual elders to maintain peace and balance on this continent from the tip of South America up to Alaska .
Many of our friends say Hotevilla is a sacred shrine , a national and world treasure and must be preserved .
We need your help .
Where is the freedom which you all fight for and sacrifice your children for ?
Is it only the Indian people who have lost or are all Americans losing the very thing which you original came here to find ?
We do n't share the freedom of the press because what gets into the papers is what the government wants people to believe , not what is really happening .
We have no freedom of speech , because we are persecuted by our own people for speaking our beliefs .
We are at the final stages now and there is a last force that is about to take away our remaining homeland .
We are still being denied many things including the rite to be Hopis and to make our living in accordance with our religious teachings .
The Hopi leaders have warned leaders in the White House and the leaders in the Glass House but they do not listen .
So as our prophecy says then it must be up to the people with good pure hearts that will not be afraid to help us to fulfill our destiny in peace for this world .
We now stand at a cross road whether to lead ourselves in everlasting life or total destruction .
We believe that human beings spiritual power through prayer is so strong it decides life on earth .
So many people have come to Hopiland to meet with us .
Some of you we have met on your lands .
Many times people have asked how they can help us .
Now I hope and pray that your help will come .
If you have a way to spread the truth , through the newspapers , radio , books , thought meeting with powerful people , tell the truth !
Tell them what you know to be true .
Tell them what you have seen here ; what you have heard us say ; what you have seen with your own eyes .
In this way , if we do fall , let it be said that we tried , right up to the end , to hold fast to the path of peace as we were originally instructed to do by the Great Spirit .
Should you really succeed , we will all realize our mistakes of the past and return to the true path - living in harmony as brothers and sisters , sharing our mother , the earth with all other living creatures .
In this way we could bring about a new world .
A world which would be led by the great Spirit and our mother will provide plenty and happiness for all .
God bless you , each one of you and know our prayers for peace meet yours as the sun rises and sets .
May the Great Spirit guide you safely into the path of love , peace freedom and God on this Earth Mother .
May the holy ancestors of love and light keep you safe in your land and homes .
Pray for God to give you something important to do in this great work which lies ahead of us all to bring peace on earth .
We the Hopi still hold the sacred stone tablets and now await the coming of our True White Brother and others seriously ready to work for the Creator 's peace on earth .
Be well , my children , and think good thoughts of peace and togetherness .
Peace for all life on earth and peace with one another in our homes , families and countries .
We are not so different in the Creator 's eyes .
The same great Father Sun shines his love on each of us daily just as Mother Earth prepares the substance for our table , do they not ?
We are one after all .

THIS was supposed to be the year in which America 's feminists celebrated the shattering of the highest glass ceiling .
They had the ideal candidate in Hillary Rodham Clinton , a woman who had been tempered in the fires of Washington .
And they had every reason to think that she would whip both the young Barack Obama and the elderly John McCain .
But it was Mrs Clinton who got the whipping .
She not only lost an unlosable primary race .
She was dissed and denounced in the process .
Chris Matthews of MSNBC said that she owed her Senate seat to her husband 's infidelity .
One lobbyist created an anti-Hillary pressure group called Citizens United Not Timid .
A couple of young men ordered her to “ iron my shirt ” .
Mr McCain , whom she regards as a good friend , looked on benignly when a Republican asked him “ How do we beat the bitch ? ”
Mr McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin as his running - mate has turned the defeat into Armageddon .
Mrs Palin is everything that liberal feminists loathe : a gun-toting evangelical , a polar bear - hating former beauty queen , a mother of five who opposes abortion rights and celebrates the fact that her pregnant teenage daughter has “ chosen life ” .
During her campaign for Alaska 's lieutenant - governorship in 2002 she called herself as “ pro-life as any candidate can be ” .
Gloria Steinem , the founder of Ms magazine , says that “ Palin shares nothing but a chromosome with Clinton ” .
Kim Gandy , the president of the National Organisation of Women , dismisses her as a “ woman who opposes women 's rights ” .
Debbie Dingell , a leading Michigan Democrat , said that women felt insulted by the choice .
Joe Biden says that , if Mrs Palin becomes the first female vice - president , it will be a “ backward step for women ” .
“ Eighteen million cracks ” , says the New Republic , ( referring to Mrs Clinton 's 18 m votes and the glass ceiling ) “ and one crackpot . ”
Mrs Palin's arrival on the national stage is inspiring some startling political somersaults .
Some feminists claim to be outraged that Mr McCain has promoted somebody just because she is a woman .
Sally Quinn , a writer for the Washington Post , has even argued that , given the size of her family , she cannot possibly be both a national candidate and a good mother .
At the same time , conservative traditionalists are suddenly realising that they have always been supporters of mould - breaking working mothers , whatever impression they may have given to the contrary .
The whole business is also inspiring plenty of speculation about the end of feminism .
One group of Hillary supporters said that their heroine 's defeat was like being told to “ sit down , shut up and move to the back of the bus . ”
But is feminism really faring so badly ?
American women are certainly under - represented in public life .
They make up less than 20 % of governors and members of Congress .
The number of women on the Supreme Court has recently fallen by half , from two to one , thanks to Sandra Day O'Connor 's retirement .
But what Ms Steinem regards as the most “ restricting force ” in America is nevertheless getting ever less restrictive .
Some of the most culturally conservative states in the country , such as Kansas and Michigan , have female governors .
In 1998 women won the top five elected offices in Arizona .
Mrs O'Connor was arguably the most powerful voice on the Supreme Court for decades .
Women are also winning the most important of all gender wars — the war for educational qualifications .
They earn 57 % of bachelor 's degrees , 59 % of master 's degrees and half of doctorates .
And they are doing better all the time .
In terms of higher education , women drew equal with men in 1980 .
By the early 1990s six women graduated from college for every five men .
Projections show that by 2017 three women will graduate for every two men .
The meritocracy is inexorably turning into a matriarchy , and visibly so on many campuses : the heads of Harvard , Princeton , MIT , Brown and the National Defence University are all women .
Boys , meanwhile , are more likely to drop out of high school than girls .
They are also more likely to be consigned to special education classes or prescribed mood - managing drugs .
Men are more likely to commit crimes , end up in prison , kill themselves or be murdered .
Even their sperm count is headed south .
The long - term result seems unavoidable : men are becoming ever more marginalised , while women are taking over the commanding heights of wealth and power .
The new Madonna
It is even plausible to argue that there is feminist - friendly news buried in the recent headlines .
One reason why younger women did not coalesce behind Mrs Clinton in the same way as their mothers must surely be that they have simply become accustomed to living in a world of opportunities .
On Super Tuesday , for example , Mr Obama did very well with women under 30 , while Mrs Clinton won easily among women over 60 .
Convinced that they will see a woman in the White House during their lifetimes , they did not feel the same “ fierce urgency of now ” ( to borrow a phrase from Mr Obama ) as 70 - somethings like Ms Steinem .
In her idiosyncratic way , Mrs Palin also represents the fulfilment of the feminist dream .
She demonstrates that gender is no longer a barrier to success in one of the most conservative corners of the land , the Alaska Republican Party .
She also proves that you can be a career woman without needing to subscribe to any fixed feminist ideology .
Camille Paglia hails her as the biggest step forward for feminism since Madonna .
One can argue , as we have , that it was astoundingly reckless of Mr McCain to have picked her on the basis of having once met her for 15 minutes .
But if feminism means , at its core , that women should be able to compete equally in the workplace while deciding for themselves how they organise their family life , then Mrs Palin deserves to be treated as a pioneer , not dismissed as a crackpot .
Life begins at rape ... ask Mayor Sarah Palin
By Shannyn Moore
Can you imagine having to pay for the CSI ( crime scene investigation - fingerprinting , photography , etc ) if your home was robbed ?
What if a bill came for the breathalyzer tests if you 'd been hit by a drunk driver ?
When Sarah Palin was mayor , the city of Wasilla had the most egregious policy against victims of rape in the state of Alaska , possibly the entire country .
The rape kit , a set of items used by medical personnel for gathering and preserving physical evidence following a sexual assault , was charged to the victim .
( note : step 6 )
I sat with a rape victim during the “ harvesting of evidence ” .
Mascara smeared eyes stared blankly out from a cave of shame .
“ We ’ve got swimmers , ” announced the forensic tech in the lab next door .
My friend did n’t look surprised .
In her 60 ’s , she was still asked if she felt the need for emergency contraception .
Surviving the process would have only been compounded and made worse with an itemized bill ; victimized twice courtesy of Sarah Palin and the city of Wasilla .
Much can be learned about the Palin Administration ’s family values from reviewing their spending priorities .
Former Chief of Police Irl Stambaugh included forensic rape kits ( up to $ 1,200 per kit ) in his budget requests .
He was fired by Palin in 1997 .
In her termination letter , Palin wrote , “ … I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla .
Therefore I intend to terminate your employment . . . ” Staumbaugh headed the police department since it was created in 1993 .
Before that , he served 22 years with the Anchorage Police Department rising to the rank of captain .
Sarah Palin hired Charlie Fannon as the new Wasilla Chief of Police and said it was one of her best decisions as mayor .
Fannon eliminated the forensic rape kits from the budget .
Though the number of rapes were n’t reported , Fannon claimed it would save Wasilla taxpayers $ 5,000 to $ 14,000 a year .
When Eric Croft , a Democrat Legislator from Anchorage , learned of Wasilla ’s policy , he drafted HB 270 , which Governor Tony Knowles signed into law .
The new law made it illegal for any law enforcement agency to bill victims or victims ’ insurance companies for the costs of examinations to collect evidence of a sexual assault or determine if a sexual assault actually occurred .
Upon signing the law , Governor Knowles said , “ We would never bill the victim of a burglary for the cost of gathering evidence , nor should we bill rape victims just because the crime scene happens to be their bodies . ”
Wasilla Police Chief Fannon protested the new law stating it would require the city and communities to come up with more funds to cover the costs of the forensic exams .
Really ?
Are the true costs of sexual assault and forcible rape in a community only measured and reflected in the dollars spent on the forensic rape kit ?
Alaska has the nation ’s highest per-capita rate of forcible rape .
A disproportionate number of rape and sexual assault victims are Native Alaskan women .
Alaska Native people in Anchorage were 9.7 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than others living in the city between 2000 and 2003 .
Alaska crime statistics never seemed to make a “ Northern Exposure ” episode .
But this is n’t about statistics - real lives were affected by Palin ’s regressive policies .
One thing Alaska ca n’t seem to export is the fundamental information around a woman ’s rights .
Alaska “ liberalized ” abortion laws before Roe v. Wade .
Our dirty secret had to do with a woman ’s right to be safe from rapists .
This right to choose was not only threatened , but abolished with Sarah Palin ’s archaic policy as Mayor of Wasilla .
The rape kit included emergency contraception .
To be sure , emergency contraception is not , nor does it cause an abortion .
In fact , ec prevents pregnancy and therefore reduces abortions .
Under Palin ’s Administration , “ Life Begins at Rape ” for women unable to pay for their forensic evidence gathering .
Justice is served to women who can afford it and denied for those who can’t .
I live in Alaska - the wealthiest of the 50 states !
Forcing rape victims to pay for their own forensic rape kits is something one would expect to find in a fundamentalist country overseas .
I have outrage fatigue .
I ca n’t decide which facet of this policy is more upsetting .
Is it the denial of justice for the poor ?
Is it the punishment of women who had been raped ?
Is it the political policies of a woman so entrenched in the “ Pro - Life ” movement she would deny justice to a victim ?
This is not a “ Pro- Life ” policy .
This is a “ Pro-Rapist ” policy , and forced pregnancy policy .
It should be noted Joe Biden introduced legislation to fund rape kits to women in America .
John McCain voted against it .
When Sarah Palin was elected Alaska ’s first female governor , I hoped these issues would be addressed as part of her “ historic ” platform .
When Amnesty International published their study on rape statistics and Alaskan women , the response was pathetic .
The now dismissed Commissioner of Public Safety , Walt Monegan , acknowledged the lack of law enforcement in Alaska as part of the problem .
Since that time , Walt Monegan has been fired and $ 2.5 million dollars threatened from the budget for State Troopers .
John Cyr is executive director of the Public Safety Employees Association , and has been very critical of the Palin administration ’s commitment to keep Alaskan ’s safer .
Under the Palin Administration , a law was passed that specifically deals with rapists .
I am not making this up .
It is now illegal for Alaskans to buy or sell the “ Rapist No. 1 ” doll .
Oh , you have n’t heard of it ?
It ’s an “ action figure ” from Quentin Tarantino ’s film “ Grindhouse . ”
Yes , really .
So now if you ’re raped , you can take comfort in knowing Alaska outlawed an action figure .
For all the Alaskans who have taken the charge to protect fellow citizens from predators , this was A GIANT WASTE OF TIME .
It ’s embarrassing to write this .
Who in the hell has been prosecuted for this “ outrageous ” purchase .
Did she think people in Alaska with the propensity to rape women were suddenly dissuaded because they could n’t buy a movie action figure ?
If Alaska ’s sexual assault statistics were true for the rest of the country , rape would be considered an epidemic and the National Guard would be called up .
As Mayor and Governor , Sarah Palin has made justice illusive to criminals and forensics a commodity that victims must purchase .
Meanwhile , rape prevention sits on the backburner .
Being a rape victim is n’t necessary for outrage .
You do n’t need ovaries to protect the physical sanctity of fellow citizens .
Life does not begin at rape , it just gets harder .

PALIN’S DELUSIONS WORSEN ….
I can understand Sarah Palin feeling humiliated by her Troopergate scandal .
An independent investigation concluded that she violated state ethics , abused the powers of her office , and lied about it .
This is n’t exactly easy to spin away this kind of violation of the public trust .
It was odd , then , to hear Palin tell reporters on Saturday that she ’s “ very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing , any hint of any kind of unethical activity there . ”
This was , of course , the exact opposite of reality .
The Anchorage Daily News called Palin ’s response “ an embarrassment to Alaskans and the nation . ”
The editorial added , “ Her response is either astoundingly ignorant or downright Orwellian … .
Palin ’s response is the kind of political ‘ big lie ’ that George Orwell warned against .
War is peace .
Black is white .
Up is down . ”
Naturally , then , Palin repeated the lie yesterday .
“ The report that came out also was very clear in that there was no unethical or unlawful behavior on my part , ” Palin told a local CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh , adding , “ No abuse of power there at all . ”
This is just madness .
The report was unambiguous — Palin “ abused her power . ”
She “ violated ” the “ Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act . ”
Even Sarah Palin can read this and understand the plain meaning of basic words .
This makes Palin ’s breathtaking lies all the more remarkable .
She said the report was “ very clear ” that she had n’t done anything “ unethical ” and there was “ no abuse of power ” at all .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen a politician lie so brazenly .
So , Republicans , which is it ?
Is Sarah Palin shockingly dishonest or is she functionally illiterate ?
Inquiring minds want to know .
In industries where pink slips are being passed out with abandon , the still - employed survivors are getting pretty bummed out .
Even Christopher Ruhm , an economist known for arguing that recessions are good for physical health , draws the line at hard times being good for mental health .
“ I ’m not claiming that people are mentally healthier during bad times , ” says Ruhm , professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
“ It ’s quite possible that mental and physical health go in opposite directions .
What I ’d say is that in bad times , people are healthier , but not necessarily happier . ”
A 2001 report , published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine , reviewed studies looking specifically at mental health and job insecurity -- as opposed to outright unemployment .
It found that job insecurity is a chronic stressor that leads to depression and anxiety .

“ If people are threatened with losing their jobs , they report feeling bad .
It ranges from demoralization to depression to more serious things , ” says C. David Dooley , chairman of the department of psychology and social behavior at UC Irvine and author of the 2004 book “ The Social Costs of Underemployment . ”
And that includes those still marching to their cubicles after a company downsizes .
“ The employment survivors are worse off as well , ” Dooley says .
“ They may be feeling survivor ’s guilt .
Or they ’re overworked .
Often , companies make the survivors do the work of everyone who used to work there . ”
In fact , he ’s found , the rate of depression among layoff survivors matches that of their former co-workers .
According to Dooley ’s research , job stress , underemployment and unemployment all can affect mental health ..
“ It ’s as regular as clockwork , ” he says .
“ They ’re depressed . ”

Anxiety over a downturn in the economy often does n’t have much to do with actual income , says Randi Riffkind , a West Los Angeles psychologist .
“ It ’s their attitude that ’s the determining factor in how much stress they feel , ” she says .
So , if you find yourself spiraling down into gloom and doom -- things are bad , they ’re going to get worse , I ’ll lose my job , then I ’ll lose my health insurance , then I ’ll lose my house -- try to make yourself stop , Riffkind says .
“ Notice the thoughts and then consciously turn the message around .
Not a Pollyanna kind of thing , but something realistic , like , ‘ I ’ve been through difficult times before , and I ’ll get through this . ’ ”

Big questions still hang over CCS technology overall Beneath the gargantuan grey boiler towers of Schwarze Pumpe power station which pierce the skies of northern Germany , a Lilliputian puzzle of metal boxes and shining canisters is about to mark a moment of industrial history .
This mini power plant is a pilot project for carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) - the first coal - fired plant in the world ready to capture and store its own CO2 emissions .
Next week the pilot - an oxyfuel boiler - will be formally commissioned .
A cloud of pure oxygen will be breathed into the boiler .
The flame will be lit .
Then a cloud of powdered lignite will be injected .
The outcome will be heat , water vapour , impurities , nine tonnes of CO2 an hour , and a landmark in clean technology .
Because the CO2 will then be separated , squashed to one 500th of its original volume and squeezed into a cylinder ready to be transported to a gas field and forced 1,000 m below the surface into porous rock where it should stay until long after mankind has stopped worrying about climate change .
This is the technology once lavishly described by the former UK Chief Scientist Sir David King as " the only hope for mankind " .
The plant operators , Vattenfall , have worked furiously for two years to get the pilot running .
" We are very proud - we think this is the future for coal , " says Vattenfall 's Hubertus Altmann .
They funded the 70 m - euro project themselves because they wanted to lead a technology they believe solves the conundrum of providing energy security through plentiful coal supplies whilst avoiding the CO2 emissions officially blamed for climate change .
' Too expensive , too late ' Green - carpeted marquees are currently being furnished for the guests who will swell the applause at the grand inauguration .
But big questions hang over this technology overall , particularly over where the CO2 will be stored and who will pay the high costs of building and running the CCS plants .
Greenpeace is among the environmental groups expressing reservations .
ACCESS ALL AREAS
In video : Inside the CCS plant " Our concern is that this technology is used to justify the construction of more coal power plants , " says Tobias Munchmeyer .
" It 's too expensive , it will come too late and it will divert money from the real solutions , renewable energies and energy efficiency . "
The EU wants to see 10 - 12 full - scale power plants demonstrating CO2 capture within the next few years .
But although a number of other firms will soon join the race with pilot projects , no full - scale CCS coal plant has yet been commissioned .
The British government has promised a decision in October on how it will fund a full - scale CCS in the UK .
It hopes to avoid landing the taxpayer with the bill , but questions over CCS funding in Europe are as yet unresolved by the European Commission and the European Parliament .
The main options are : New rules mandating that all coal power plants must be fitted with CCS - ie industry and the consumer will pay
Direct funding from the EU or member states ( but member states do not want to pay )
A feed - in tariff so generators get a premium for the amount of CO2 they sequester .
Monitoring may be difficult
Creating a new fund within the EU's Emission Trading Scheme ( EUETS ) , which would give firms valuable carbon credits for every stored tonne of CO2 .
This would cost nothing but might undermine the CO2 market
Setting a CO2 emission limit for all new power stations of , say , 350g of CO2 per kilowatt hour of electricity .
This would make it impossible to build a coal plant which did not capture at least some of its CO2 .
This option is being pushed hard by UK Conservatives Taking cash from EUETS auctioning .
The permits for big firms to emit CO2 will be auctioned from 2013 ( at the moment , they are given away ) .
This will raise many billions - some of which could be diverted to fund CCS projects .
Can the Schwarze Pumpe effort be scaled up economically ?
All the options would benefit from the sort of certainty over future carbon prices that would be provided by the successor to the Kyoto Protocol - but that is facing severe difficulties .
And , meanwhile , industry is crying out for politicians to make an early decision so it can invest the billions that are needed .
" We need CSS urgently because the world is building a whole new generation of coal power plants and unless we find out whether this technology operates at scale and we can make these plants zero - carbon in the future , those will be a liability , " says Nick Mabey of the think - tank e3g .
" The UK has talked a good game on this , it has said it wants to build a demonstration , but it 's yet to show where the money is going to come from for the plants it wants built in Europe and worldwide . "
Part of the problem is that the exact cost of large - scale CCS is unknown .
This has left green groups uncertain and divided on the topic .
The latest estimates suggest CCS power will cost roughly the same as wind power - maybe 50 % more than it does at the moment .
Coal supplies are plentiful ; the issue is CO2 emissions
The firms providing the technology are doing their best to re-assure national treasuries that they can do it at a price which leaves coal competitive .
Philippe Joubert , of Alstom , who built the oxyfuel boiler at Schwarze Pumpe , said : " We will have a very good indication one or two years from now where we will have the first result of the bigger size demonstration plant .
" Currently we are at 5 MW ; it 's not enough to set a price .
In our business , the size is a real issue , and if you start to have a real market , probably the price will drop . "
The real test of CCS , though , is not in Europe .
The global CO2 savings many scientists believe are needed to control global warming are only likely to happen if politicians in rich nations are ready to ignore high energy prices , put up the price of their cheapest fuel through CCS - and then help developing countries to do the same .

PRINCETON , NJ -- President Bush 's job approval rating is at 25 % in the latest Oct. 3 - 5 Gallup Poll , the lowest of the Bush administration , and only three percentage points above the lowest presidential approval rating in Gallup Poll history .
Bush 's previous low point was 27 % , measured about a week ago .
The 25 % approval rating is one point higher than Richard Nixon 's lowest job approval rating of 24 % measured in the summer of 1974 , and it is just three points higher than Harry Truman 's all - time Gallup low job approval rating of 22 % measured in 1952 .
No other presidents have had job approval ratings of 27 % or lower in Gallup Poll history .
The current poll recording Bush 's low job approval rating was conducted after Congress passed the economic rescue bill on Oct .
3 . Americans recognize the economy as the nation 's top problem , but apparently , the passage of this bill -- which the Bush administration had heavily advocated -- did nothing to affect Bush 's approval ratings .
Indeed , only 55 % of members of Bush 's own party approve of him in the poll , perhaps a reflection of some pushback from conservatives who do not strongly support the economic bill .
Nineteen percent of independents and 5 % of Democrats approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,011 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 3 - 5 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP )  " Joe the Plumber " is endorsing John McCain .
The Ohio plumber , whose real name is Samuel Wurzelbacher , campaigned Tuesday for the Republican presidential candidate in Columbus , the first stop in a day - long bus tour .
Wurzelbacher is a registered Republican but until now had declined to say who he was voting for .
Wurzelbacher said Democrat Barack Obama would make America a socialist nation because Obama wants to redistribute wealth .
He said he thinks Obama would target the middle class for tax hikes .
Wurzelbacher became an overnight media sensation after he was referred to constantly in the final presidential debate .
He 's since become the central thematic element in speeches by McCain and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .

Samsung NC10 deals Sparepart : Samsung RIGHT ... Amazon $ 41 Sparepart : Samsung LEFT HINGE ... Amazon $ 47
Editors ' Note : The Samsung NC10 we reviewed was imported from Korea .
Our unit ran Korean Windows XP and had a Korean keyboard .
We will update this review with any noticeable differences between the Korean version and the U.S. - based version .
The Samsung NC10 has joined the ranks of 10 - inch netbooks -- including the Eee PC 1000H , MSI Wind , and Lenovo IdeaPad S10 - - and it beats them all .
The $ 499 NC10 may have the same cookie - cutter specs as its competitors , including a 1.6 - GHz Intel Atom processor , 1GB of RAM , and Windows XP , but its spacious , well - positioned keyboard and more than6 hours of battery life make this system our favorite 10 - inch netbook yet .
Design
The Samsung NC10 is n't the flashiest netbook to grace our labs .
The white matte lid ( also available in Navy Blue in the U.S. ) , whose only adornment is its mirrored Samsung logo , is smooth , and its rounded square edges give the system a more professional look than the MSI Wind or the Eee PC 1000H manages .
The silver trim and glowing blue and reddish orange status lights on the front edge project a futuristic aura .
The blue glowing power button , positioned on the circular right hinge , reminds us of the premium Sony VAIO TT .
Measuring 10.3 x 7.3 x 1.2 inches and weighing 2.8 pounds ( with its six - cell battery ) , the NC10 is similar in size and weight to its rival 10 - inch netbooks , the 3.2 - pound ASUS Eee PC 1000H and the 2.6 - pound Lenovo IdeaPad S10 and MSI Wind .
Click to enlargeThe NC10 is about half an inch longer than Lenovo 's S10 but about the same length as the MSI Wind and the Eee PC 1000H .
Nevertheless , we had no problem holding it on our lap in a tightly cramped train seat .
When we walked around the city with the NC10 and its AC adapter in a shoulder bag ( bringing the travel weight to 3.4 pounds ) we felt no strain .
Large , Spacious Keyboard
When it comes to the keyboard , the NC10 easily bests those on the MSI Wind and Eee PC 1000H .
The 93 percent - full size layout is comfortable , and the raised keys provided nice tactile feedback .
Unlike the Eee PC 1000H , the panel did n't flex at all .
The feel of the keys and the size of the keyboard is n't all the NC10 has got going for it : unlike the 1000H and the Wind , the key positioning of the NC10 is near perfect .
The right Shift key is full size and directly below the Enter key .
When typing this review in WordPad we rarely mistyped words .
( Our review unit 's Korean keyboard was lacking a backslash / pipe key ; in its place was a Korean character .
We will update this review when we receive our American review unit . )

Small Multi-Touch Touchpad , Plethora of Ports
In order to accommodate the spacious keyboard , Samsung had to make some compromises .
At 2.3 x 1.1 inches , the NC10's touchpad is disappointingly small and vertically very narrow , requiring more movement and backtracking than we would like .
While the mouse button -- a single rocker bar - - lacks a divot to separate the left and right sides , we did n't have any problems clicking and did n't have to press too hard on it to get a response .
We would prefer two dedicated buttons , but this arrangement is still better than the vertically oriented touchpad buttons like those on the HP 2133 Mini-Note or Acer Aspire one .
The touchpad has a dedicated scrolling bar , which was useful for moving through long Web pages .
It also supports multi- touch controls and drivers from Synaptics , which allow for the typical pinch - and - zoom functions for pictures and Web pages .
The NC10 can also recognize other gestures ; we will update this review with our impressions once we procure the U.S. version .

The NC10 houses the typical netbook ports , including 3 USB ports , a 3 - in - 1 memory card reader , mic and headphone jacks , a VGA port , and an Ethernet jack .
Unlike Lenovo's S10 , the NC10 lacks an ExpressCard slot for adding a mobile broadband modem card , but you can always use a compact USB modem .
Matte Display , Decent Audio
The NC10's wide , matte , 10.2 - inch , 1024 x 600 - pixel screen is crisp and accommodating , and we were able to keep a Web page and a document in WordPad open side by side .
Content on the screen was vivid ; a streaming episode of Saturday Night Live on Hulu.com looked clear and detailed .
Tilting the screen back to its maximum of 45 degrees did n't produce glare , and horizontal angles were good enough to share the screen with a second person .
The speakers , positioned on the bottom of the chassis , produced loud sound .
Tom Petty 's " Runnin ' Down A Dream " sounded full and balanced with Samsung Enhanced Digital Sound enabled ; music sounded a tad flatter when we disabled the feature .
Compared with the ASUS Eee PC 1000 H 's Dolby - powered speakers , we hardly detected a difference between the two .
In a video conference over Skype , the integrated 1.3 - megapixel webcam on our unit produced some of the best images of any netbook .
Our caller , whom we frequently test netbook webcams with , said we looked clearer than we had in the past .
The microphone , located on the top right of the keyboard , sounded clear , though it picked up a bit of echo and background noise .
Still , our caller could hear us just fine without us having to speak up .

Solid Performance , Speedy Hard Drive
With its 1.6 - GHz Intel Atom CPU and 1GB of RAM , the NC10 performed up to our netbook standards .
We could n't run our usual PCMark05 test on the system , but in our experience , the NC10 was able to handle our usual mobile tasks easily .
Simultaneously conducting video calls over Skype and surfing the Web with multiple tabs open caused no performance lag .
The Intel 945GSE Express integrated graphics chip with 64MB of shared memory delivered a score of 603 in 3DMark03 , which is 66 points higher than the category average but 136 points lower than the Eee PC 1000H .
Nevertheless , we did n't see any differences between the systems in usual graphics intensive activities , such as watching a downloaded video of Mad Men .
The NC10's 5,400 - rpm , 120GB hard drive booted Windows XP Home in a decent 45 seconds .
( Note : The NC10 will be available with a 160 GB drive in the U.S. )
The LAPTOP Transfer test ( copying a 4.97 GB folder of mixed media ) took 6 minutes and 50 seconds , or a rate of 12.4 MBps .
Though it 's a decent speed for a netbook , the Lenovo S10 took only 4:53 ( 17.4 MBps ) on the same test .
Superior Endurance , Solid Wi-Fi Performance
The NC10 distinguishes itself with battery life .
Not only does it come standard with a six - cell battery ( most netbooks , such as Lenovo 's S10 , come standard with a three - cell ) , but the NC10 has the steam to last you through a flight from New York to California and then some .
On the LAPTOP Battery Test ( continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi ) , the NC10 lasted6 hours and 34 minutes .
Not only is this much higher than the mini-notebook average of 2:27 , but it beats out even the six - cell MSI Wind ( 5:13 ) and the Eee PC 1000H ( 4:28 ) .
Note :
When we first ran the LAPTOP Battery Test the NC10 yielded a runtime of 7 hours and 34 minutes .
This was with the Samsung Battery Manager 2.0 enabled , whichdims the screen to its lowest setting after 30 seconds of inactivity on the keyboard or touchpad .
The screen is usable during this time , but it 's uncomfortable .
When we ran the battery test at50 percentbrightnesswith the Battery Manager disabled , the NC10 ran for 6:34 ; cranked up to 100 percent , itran for 4:48 .
The NC10's 802.11b/g Wi -Fi card provided a swift connection for working in the cloud .
Delivering a strong 20.8 Mbps and 16.9 Mbps from 15 and 50 feet , respectively , we were able to maintain a strong signal far from our access point .
This blew away the MSI Wind ( 14.5/7.7 Mbps ) and even the 802.11n - equipped ASUS Eee PC 1000H ( 10.4/6.1 Mbps ) .
It maintained a strong connection during our day - to - day Web activities ; streaming music over Slacker was fluid , and video clips streaming on Hulu.com were void of any pauses .
Software and Warranty
Like many other mini-notebooks , the NC10 runs Windows XP Home .
Samsung also bundles its own utilities , including the Samsung Recovery Solution III ( which creates a restore file of the operating system ) and Samsung Magic Doctor ( which will detect problems with applications and help to correct any issues ) .
Other tools include an Easy Battery Manager 2.0 that allows for tweaking power - saving settings and an Easy Network Manager for connecting to a wireless access point .
The NC10 also came preloaded with McAfee SecurityCenter ( 60 - day trial ) and Adobe Acrobat Reader .
Samsung covers this netbook with a one - year warranty and 24/7 toll - free technical support .
Verdict
Click to enlargeUntil now , no other netbook has been able to match the 10 - inch MSI Wind 's endurance , strong performance , and spacious keyboard .
Samsung 's NC10 is the only product that provides comparable -- and even improved -- features for a lower price .
Its comfortable , well - positioned keyboard , speedy and spacious hard drive , and more than6 hours of endurance make the $ 499 Samsung NC10 the most well - rounded 10 - inch netbook on the market .
While the $ 549 MSI Wind ( with a six - cell battery ) is an excellent choice , it will cost you $ 50 more .
Those willing to sacrifice some touchpad room will find the Samsung NC10 to be a great mobile companion .
Watch our hands - on video to get a look at the Samsung NC10's performance and display .

The trial of the six Greenpeace UK activists was the first case in which acting to prevent climate change causing damage to property formed part of a ' lawful excuse ' defence
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage at a coal - fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and strengthen the anti-coal movement .
The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six , five of whom had scaled a 200 m tall chimney at Kingsnorth power station at Hoo , Kent in October 2007 .

The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the world " Gordon " down the chimney , but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world .
It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a " lawful excuse " defence in court .
It is now expected to be used widely by environment groups .
The court had heard from Prof James Hansen , one of the world 's leading climate scientists , that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species .
Hansen , a Nasa director who advises Al Gore , told the court that humanity was in " grave peril " .
He said : " Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium , draw a line in the sand and say no more coal - fired power stations . "
It also heard David Cameron 's environment adviser , millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith , and an Inuit leader from Greenland say that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world .
The court was told was that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels , the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland .
The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet , China 's Yellow river region , the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica , coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans .
Goldsmith told the court : " By building a coal - power plant in this country , it makes it very much harder in exerting pressure on countries like China and India to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel . "
The jury was told that Kingsnorth emits the same amount of CO2 as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined – and that there are advanced plans to build a new coal - fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent .
Greenpeace used the court 's decision to pile pressure on government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal - fired plants .
" Today 's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government 's plans for new coal - fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who , after hearing the evidence , supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate , " said Ben Stewart , Greenpeace 's communications director who was one of the six acquitted .
The others were Will Rose , Kevin Drake , Tim Hewke , Huw Williams and Emily Hall .
" It was n't only us in the dock , it was coal - fired power generation as well .
The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks , " said Hall .
" It 's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain . "
Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was taken to a police station yesterday after he brought chaos to the Milan fashion show for the second day running .
Despite the increased security after he evaded guards and burst backstage to changing rooms he again managed to get in .
Cohen , best known for his bizarre character Borat , caused havoc after storming the catwalk during the Agata Luiz della Prada show .
Unveiled : Sacha Baron Cohen gatecrashes the catwalk at the show of designer Agatha Ruiz de la Prada in Milan
Dressed in a velcro suit he was bundled away by security guards and taken to a nearby police station where he was formally identified .
A police officer at Milan Sempione police station said : 'A British national by the name of Sacha Baron Cohen was brought here and identified .
Sacha , in character as Austrian fashionista Bruno , is filming : Bruno : Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Male
' He did not have any ID documents on him so someone was sent to his hotel when he got here to fetch his passport .
' He was actually very funny and the first thing he said was ' Can I make a phone call ' like they do on TV . '
Cohen was released without charge and was last night still thought to be in Milan .
Baron Cohen is led away by the Italian police after storming the Milan catwalk
Earlier this week scantily clad models screamed and security guards dived on him when he burst into a show by Italian designer Iceberg .
The comedian was removed by police
TV footage screened on Italian TV showed Cohen dressed as his creation Bruno a flamboyant Austrian fashionista .
Cohen is in Milan working on a new film called Bruno : Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Male .
The movie is being shot in the same documentary style as 2006's smash hit Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan .
Wearing fake passes , Cohen and his film crew managed to get past security to the backstage area of Italian label Iceberg 's show .
The footage showed an actor dressed in head - to - toe velcro and wearing a blonde wig running about , screaming and hurling himself at the clothes racks .
Iceberg 's flustered stylist , Paolo Gerani , managed to stop the man and have the crew removed .
Fashion houses have since tightened up security , and Baron Cohen and his crew were blocked while attempting to enter the Dsquared .
Bruno : Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Male is due out next spring .
Cohen is best for known for playing bizarre Kazakh journalist Borat
Unbelievable :
It 's probably right that the McCain campaign should have eased her into national media interviews , rather than throwing her into extremely high - stakes situations immediately .
Immediately ?
She 's been the nominee for over a month and she still has n't given a press conference !
She had the easiest of Gibson interviews after a few weeks and than an infomercial from Fox , combined with a propaganda movie , and then Hewitt !
Yes , Couric asked questions that any local politician can answer .
That was too much ?
Dan Quayle answered press questions a day after being nominated .
No veep candidate has ever in modern times avoided the press the way she has .
Ever .
Look : we have a person who does n't know of another Supreme Court case apart from Roe vs Wade and cannot name a newspaper she reads .
She has been sequestered from any normal press access for a month .
And we are being asked to lower the standards for public office by this amount ... and it's the press 's fault !
No one serious about this country can even consider voting for this know - nothing pathological liar , however pretty .
All Rich Lowry has done is show he does not take national security or even basic competence in government seriously .
Press conference now !
Release her tax returns in full .
Demand her medical records .
Until then , no one should even consider voting for her .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Bob Woodward in a Slate roundtable on the new film , W. :
I think one of the best scenes in the movie is when Bush makes it clear to Cheney that he ’s the boss — that Cheney can push and argue and have his say , but Bush is the boss .
… President Bush made these decisions on his own .
The issue for history in the coming years and decades will be further examination of how Bush exercised that free will .
More citizens from Vermont , per capita , have been killed in Iraq than from any other state in the union .
If its citizens care to hold the primary perpetrator of this injustice responsible , they need only elect the progressive party candidate for state attorney general this year .
It turns out that Charlotte Dennett has pledged that , if elected , she will appoint Vincent Bugliosi , author of The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , as special prosecutor .
Bugliosi has been accompanying Ms. Dennett on appearances before newspaper editorial boards and in radio interviews .
In a press release issued by the campaign , he said , “ I have never received such a passionate response as I have to this book .
…
Most Americans are deeply offended that George W. Bush has not been held accountable for his many crimes .
. . the most egregious of which is the murder of 4,000 American soldiers and over 100,000 Iraqi civilians .
My book lays out the framework of how he can be brought to justice in any state in this country . ”
When her opponent , sitting attorney general William Sorrell , scoffed at the notion , Ms. Dennett , doubtful that he read Bugliosi ’s book even though it had been forwarded to him , spelled things out :
With respect to the separate crime of murder , the general rule is that a state only has jurisdiction over crimes physically committed in that state .
However . … where the crime occurs outside the territorial jurisdiction of the state , but the crime has a harmful effect on the people of the state , then that state has jurisdiction .
Clearly the war in Iraq has had a harmful effect on Vermont .
…
Moreover , Vermont has shared in the prodigious [ financial ] cost of the war to this nation .
…
Finally , Vermonters , as Americans , have endured the loss of prestige in the eyes of the world community ..
In light of that loss of life , Vermont native President Calvin Coolidge ’s words — engraved on the Vermont statehouse wall — as quoted by Ms. Dennett , are especially poignant :
If the spirit of liberty should vanish in other parts of the Union and support of our institutions should languish , it could all be replenished from the generous store held by the people of this brave little state of Vermont .
If you care to aid the campaign to hold Bush accountable , David Swanson of After Downing Street outlines ways we can help .

Never mind that — haul George Bush into a court of law , part 1
Rep. Mark Udall , stumping in Edwards Sunday , came as close as he ’ll likely ever come to saying “ I told you so , ” comparing his two “ no ” votes last week on the financial bailout package to his dissent on the Iraq war and the Patriot Act .
The subsequent and precipitous plunge by the stock market on Monday only gave the Eldorado Springs Democrat , who ’s running for U.S. Senate against former Republican congressman and oil - and - gas executive Bob Schaffer , more ammunition .
“ Let ’s go back to work and make sure this can work as best it can , and when the new Congress comes in , we have to reform the entire architecture of the financial services market , ” Udall said of the $ 700 billion bailout .
“ Look , I hope I ’m wrong , but this felt to me like to the lead - up to the Iraq war and it felt to me like the lead - up to the constraints that were put on our civil liberties , most notably with the Patriot Act . ”
Udall voted against both the authorization for the Iraq war in 2002 and the 2001 bill that would eventually become the Patriot Act .
Sunday , before a crowd of approximately 50 supporters at a rally in front of a Mexican restaurant , Udall outlined four key reasons for the economic crisis , including a runaway federal deficit requiring a huge injection of foreign capital ; lack of oversight of the subprime mortgage industry ; the loosening of SEC rules governing the investment banking industry , and no intervention by the Bush administration until it was too late .
“ This administration is always a day late and a dollar short , ” Udall said .
“ We had a war with no plan , we suffered a hurricane with no response , we had a financial meltdown with no oversight , and when they did respond it was after denying , denying , denying . ”
Udall said that the bailout does n’t direct mortgage companies to rewrite loans to help homeowners in danger of being foreclosed on ; that it still leaves too much leeway for golden parachutes and massive compensation packages for executives of faltering Wall Street firms , and that it does n’t lean heavily enough on the advice of the nation ’s top capitalists , like billionaire investor Warren Buffett , who suggested preferred stock positions be used to inject liquidity right into the banks .
“ The bill went over to the Senate [ after being rejected by the House Monday ] and came back basically unchanged , with another $ 150 billion [ in tax breaks ] in it with some things that we all need and support , but in the interest of standing firm and staying consistent , I voted ‘ no ’ again , ” Udall said .
In a brief interview after his speech Sunday , Udall defended his rather docile debating style during a Sept. 28 appearance on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” in which Schaffer continually and aggressively interrupted and even occasionally shouted Udall down .
Udall faces another televised debate with Schaffer tonight at the University of Denver .
“ I ’ve debated Bob close to 10 different times and we have another five or six to go — I ’ve seen a lot of different Bob Schaffers — and I made a decision on the spot to be respectful , to be thoughtful and to show the people watching that the Senate needs more people who are going to listen and work together than it needs people who are going to filibuster and shout , ” Udall said .
He also commented on a poll last week showing he ’s a whopping 21 points ahead of Schaffer on Colorado ’s typically more conservative Western Slope .
“ The people on the West Slope know my record ; they know I ’ve defended their water on the West Slope ; they know I ’ve defended their way of life out here ; they know I ’ve lived out here ; and they also know I ’m for responsible energy development but not at the sake of our air and water and our wildlife and our other economic interests like tourism , hunting and fishing , guiding . ”
A month of primary recounts in the election battleground of Palm Beach County , Florida , has twice flipped the winner in a local judicial race and revealed grave problems in the county 's election infrastructure , including thousands of misplaced ballots and vote tabulation machines that are literally unable to produce the same results twice .
Experts say the brew of administrative bungling and mysterious technological failures raises new and troubling questions about the county that played a crucial role in the 2000 presidential election debacle , and is one of a handful of counties considered pivotal in the upcoming presidential election .
Voting advocates are fearful that problems here – and perhaps in other election hot spots – could trigger a replay of the disputed 2000 election .
" It does n't get any more swing than that swing state , " said Pamela Smith , president of election - integrity group Verified Voting , " and that 's a major county .
This is going to be a very high - turnout election .
In any election you should be able to have justifiable confidence in the outcome .
If you 're having different results every time you count the ballots , that 's not going to create confidence . "
At issue is an Aug. 26 primary election in which officials discovered , during a recount of a close judicial race , that more than 3,400 ballots had mysteriously disappeared after they were initially counted on election day .
The recount a week later , minus the missing ballots , flipped the results of the race to a different winner .
The county eventually found the missing ballots after a prolonged hunt .
But it also turned up an additional 200 or so ballots that officials never knew were missing and that were never counted in the original tabulation of the race .
A recently completed recount – with all of the ballots – has restored victory to the original winner .
But the month - long saga has left voters and state officials exasperated and distrustful of the ability of county officials to run a competent general election in November .
More important , it 's also uncovered perplexing problems in some of the county 's high - speed optical - scan tabulation machines , made by Sequoia Voting Systems .
The machines flunked reliability tests prompted by the recount – producing different results for the same batch of ballots .
The probe began after Florida 's August primary , which involved a variety of local races in different districts .
In Palm Beach County , the one - page ballot included a race for a Circuit Court judge seat , which resulted in attorney William Abramson beating incumbent Judge Richard Wennet by just 17 votes .
Florida election law requires a recount when a margin of victory is one - half of 1 percent or less .
But when officials conducted the recount a week after the primary , they discovered they had 3,478 fewer ballots than when they 'd counted them on election day .
Undeterred , they proceeded with the recount , which resulted in Abramson losing to Wennet this time , by 60 votes .
The county planned to certify the recount results , despite the absence of nearly 3,500 ballots and protests from Abramson , until state election officials stepped in and said they would not accept the results in that race until the county found the missing ballots .
A hunt for the ballots ensued , and was so successful that officials found an additional 227 ballots that were never counted on election day .
All of the ballots were discovered in boxes in the county 's tabulation center .
Officials blamed the overlooked ballots on the disorderly way in which the recount was conducted , and the high number of ballots cast in the election .
On that last point , it 's worth noting that about 100,000 primary ballots were cast in the county .
The county is expecting more than half - a- million ballots to be cast Nov. 4 .
The ballot in November will also be two pages long , as opposed to the one - page ballot used in the primary , increasing concerns that the county could become ground zero for an election meltdown in the presidential race .
After the missing and new ballots were discovered , a court ordered a second machine recount of the judicial race .
The second recount confirmed the initial election results , that Abramson was the winner .
But this time his margin of victory was 115 votes , up from the 17 votes by which he 'd originally beaten Wennet .
But even that was n't the final score .
As mentioned above , Florida law requires a recount if the margin of victory in an election is one - half of 1 percent or less .
That recount is only a machine recount , not a manual recount .
However , if that recount results in a margin of victory that is one - quarter of 1 percent or less , then county officials must manually examine ballots that were spit out by the recount machines as being unreadable for having an undervote or overvote in the disputed race .
They do this to determine if the machine missed legitimate votes that were marked correctly or if the voter 's intent was clear enough that the ballot should be counted anyway even though the voter failed to mark the ballot correctly ( for example , if a voter failed to follow directions on the ballot and circled a candidate 's name instead of filling in a space next to the candidate 's name as the ballot instructed ) .
So Palm Beach County proceeded to do a manual examination of some 12,000 ballots that the optical - scan machines had rejected .
Officials found legitimate votes that were marked clearly and correctly and should have been read by the machines .
They also found other ballots that were not marked correctly and therefore could n't be read by the machines , but still indicated a clear choice by the voter .
In the wake of that count , Abramson was still the winner , but now his margin of victory had gone down from 115 votes to 58 votes .
Then a new surprise emerged .
Election officials discovered that an additional 159 ballots from 54 precincts may have had valid votes on them that never made it into the tabulation .
They determined this by looking at reports that each voting precinct produced on election day .
Those reports indicated the number of ballots that the precinct - based optical - scan machines had flagged for undervotes or overvotes .
Officials discovered that the numbers of undervotes and overvotes did n't add up to the total numbers that county election officials had calculated after the ballots were run through the county - based high - speed optical - scan machines .
This raised questions about whether optical - scan machines were erroneously rejecting legitimate votes as undervotes , or whether election officials had simply misrecorded the numbers or mistakenly placed legitimate ballots into piles of undervote ballots .
So county officials decided to ask a judge to let them conduct a third machine recount of some 3,000 ballots to see if they could find the mysterious 159 ballots that were throwing off the numbers .
Additional legitimate votes were found in this round ; at the end , Abramson was still the winner , but his margin of victory was now 61 votes , nearly the identical margin by which Wennet had won in the first recount .
" I'm overwhelmed , " Abramson told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel .
" This is why we 're the greatest country ....
We were faced with adversity and we all rose to the challenge . "
Wennet had a different view .
He said Florida law allowed for only one recount and that the additional recounts were invalid .
He asked a court to throw out any results after the initial recount that had him winning by 60 votes , even though that initial recount was conducted without some 3,500 missing ballots .
Barring that , Wennet asked for a do - over election on Nov. 4 .
As part of his complaint , Wennet cited the unreliability of the optical - scan machines that counted the ballots .
He asked the court to order a test of the high - speed optical - scan machines that were used for the recount .
Palm Beach County was using new optical - scan machines that it recently purchased from Sequoia Voting Systems for $ 5.5 million .
The machines replaced paperless touchscreen machines that the county had purchased in 2002 , which were bought to replace punch card machines that were involved in the 2000 election debacle .
Florida outlawed paperless voting machines last year , leaving Palm Beach and 14 other Florida counties to change their voting systems for the second time in eight years .
( All Florida voting machines , including touchscreen machines , must now produce a paper trail ) .
The county used one model of Sequoia 's scanners at precincts on election day , but used different high - speed scanners in the election office headquarters to conduct the recount .
So on Wednesday last week , the county conducted a test on a random sampling of its eight high - speed machines .
It scanned about 262 ballots that had previously been rejected by machines for having undervotes or overvotes , and that had then been examined by hand to determine if the machine 's reading of the ballots was accurate .
Only two of the county 's eight high - speed machines were tested .
That 's because last Thursday the county was scheduled to begin programming its optical - scan machines for the Nov. 4 election .
Officials expected the machines would reject the same ballots again .
But that did n't happen .
During a first test of 160 ballots , the machines accepted three of them .
In a second test of 102 ballots , the machines accepted 13 of them , and rejected the others .
When the same ballots were run through the machines again , 90 of the ballots were accepted .
( All of these numbers come from the Sun -Sentinel story about the test .
Election officials could not be reached to confirm the numbers . )
Wennet 's attorney , Gerald Richman , who witnessed the tests firsthand , provided Wired.com with more details about the test , which , if accurate , clearly endorse his belief that the machines are highly unreliable .
Richman told Wired.com that four ballots that had previously been rejected by a high - speed machine were examined by a county canvassing board and deemed to have clearly marked legitimate votes that should have been read by the machines .
When the four ballots were run through each of the two high - speed machines again , three of the ballots were accepted and read by both machines this time , but the fourth ballot was again rejected .
Richman said the county then re-scanned two batches of 51 ballots each that had initially been rejected for having no vote cast in the judicial race , but that were found in a manual examination to contain legitimate votes for one candidate or the other .
The first batch of 51 ballots were found to have legitimate votes for Abramson .
The second batch of 51 ballots were found to have legitimate votes for Wennet .
In the ballots containing votes for Abramson , 11 of the 51 ballots that had previously been rejected as undervotes were now accepted by one of the machines as having legitimate votes , and the remaining 40 ballots were rejected as having no vote .
In the ballots containing votes for Wennet , the same machine accepted 2 ballots and rejected 49 .
The same two batches of ballots were then run through the second high - speed optical - scan machine .
This time , the machine accepted 41 of the Abramson ballots as having legitimate votes ( up from 11 on the other machine ) and rejected 10 others .
In the batch of Wennet ballots , the machine accepted 49 and rejected 2 – the exact opposite of the results from the first machine .
" We just sat there with our heads spinning , " Richman said .
" It was unbelievable .
Nobody has been able to explain it . "
Richman said some of the ballots that were correctly marked were rejected , while other ballots that the machines read in the test should have been rejected by the scanners .
These ballots were marked with a check or " X " instead of the voter filling in the gap in a broken arrow next to the candidate 's name , as the ballot instructed .
Because of the problems in these tests , a second round of testing was conducted last Friday on six precinct - based optical scan machines out of a thousand machines the state uses .
( These were machines that counted votes at precincts on election day , not the eight high - speed machines that counted ballots in the recount . )
According to the Sun-Sentinel , the six machines functioned properly in that test .
But Richman said the test only involved re-scanning 10 ballots from two precincts to see if the 10 votes that were initially recorded in the judicial race at those precincts remained the same in the test .
" We had no time to do more , " Richman explained .
" Those machines had to be serviced the following day and reset for the [ November ] election . "
Neither Palm Beach County officials nor Florida 's secretary of state have responded to several calls for comment .
Sequoia Voting Systems also has not responded to a call to explain why some of its high - speed machines rejected legitimate ballots .
Sequoia has likely been preoccupied with another issue involving its optical - scan machines in Washington , D.C. , where hearings are being held to examine why a Sequoia system mysteriously added 1,500 phantom write - in votes to the Sept.
9 primary election totals in one precinct and calculated a total of 4,759 votes cast in the precinct where only 326 were actually cast .
The company has blamed the issue on static discharge or mishandling of a memory cartridge by poll workers .
Back in Florida , Richman has compiled an affidavit ( .pdf ) describing the results of the tests conducted on Palm Beach County machines to submit in Wennet 's suit .
But Richman , who is on Sen. Barack Obama 's legal team , says the problem is n't only how the machines malfunctioned in the recount and the tests , but how the problem might not have been uncovered at all if the judicial race had n't been so close that it required a manual examination of the undervote ballots .
" [ Ordinarily ] nobody looks at ballots that have been counted by the machine , " Richman said .
" Normally there is a presumption that whatever the machine does is correct , and you only look at the overvotes and undervotes in a hand recount .
Which is a problem , because if [ the margin of victory ] is not within a quarter of 1 percent , you never get to a hand count .
If there were mistakes involving other races , we 'll never know what the mistakes were . "
Douglas Jones , a professor of computer science at the University of Iowa who has consulted with a number of states on voting machine issues , said the problem with the machines is likely inconsistent calibration among machines .
Jones blamed the federal voting system standards by which voting systems are tested and certified .
He says the federal standards do n't set a threshold for what should be an acceptable number of scanning mistakes and calibration decisions are thus left to the companies that make them .
" This is an area where our voting system standards are virtually silent , " he said .
" The voting - system standards only require perfect counting of perfectly marked ballots .
They do n't have anything to say about how the machine counts ballots marked by real people in real elections .
The standards do n't govern one of the most important things about the machines . "
Jones also blamed election officials who fail to properly test machines before elections or who leave pre-election testing and setup of machines for vendors to do , rather than doing it themselves .
" That 's the norm , that the vendor sets up the machines , " Jones said .
" And my experience is that counties that contract with the vendor to operate the voting system generally do n't do anything to monitor the performance of that contract . "
In 2004 in Napa County , California , an optical - scan machine made by Sequoia failed to count more than 6,000 votes , because the Sequoia employee who set up the machine failed to calibrate it to read certain kinds of pens that voters used to mark their ballots .
Florida is expected to be a fierce battleground in the presidential race .
If Obama or Sen . John McCain wins with a large - enough margin , there will never be reason for a recount that might uncover the kinds of mistakes that were revealed in the primary aftermath .
If there is reason for a recount , the time frame to conduct it could be a problem , considering how long it took to complete multiple rounds of recounts in the judicial race .
Florida state law gives counties only 12 days after a general election to certify election results ( counties have only 7 days after a primary to certify results ) , which provides little time for a complicated or problematic recount to be resolved – that is , unless the state canvassing board refuses to accept problematic recount results , as it did in the judicial race this year .
In the 2000 presidential race , state officials were n't as accommodating .
At the time , Florida 's law allowed counties only 7 days to certify results from a general election , and then - Secretary of State Katherine Harris refused to extend the deadline on Nov. 14 to allow counties to conduct a manual recount of the paper ballots that were cast in the disputed presidential race .
The state Supreme Court overruled her and extended the deadline by to Nov. 26 .
But when Palm Beach County requested an additional extension to finish counting the last 1,000 ballots , Harris refused and certified George Bush the winner by fewer than 600 votes .
Palm Beach County completed its hand recount two hours after the deadline passed .
Smith 's Verified Voting group led the national charge to replace paperless touchscreen machines with optical - scan machines and other machines that produce voter - verified audit trails .
She said it 's not enough to have paper ballots : Palm Beach and other counties using optical - scan machines need to have robust pre-election and post-election testing of machines to make certain they 're calibrated correctly and that they 're reading a wide range of pencils and pens that voters use to mark their ballots .
They also need robust manual audits to randomly compare a sample of cast ballots with the machine tabulation rather than waiting on a close race and a recount to catch problems with the machines .
It 's unclear if Palm Beach County will be able to test its systems in the manner Smith describes for November .
According to a news report , the county has asked Sequoia to examine all eight of its high - speed optical scanners next week .

According to the IUCN , the spider has been listed as critically endangered because its natural habitat has been almost completely destroyed .
Many animals worldwide , from toads to tigers , face extinction , a " terrifying possibility " underlined by the release Monday of a report on mammals .
IUCN : IUCN Red List reveals world 's mammals in crisis
The report due Friday in the journal Science says that of the world 's 5,487 mammal species , at least one in four land species and one in three marine species face extinction in the foreseeable future .
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) predicted earlier that one in eight bird , one in three amphibian and one in three coral - reef species are endangered .
" Extinction is normal and natural , but what we are facing is a very rapid , accelerating rate of extinction happening right now that is very unnatural , " says IUCN biologist Michael Hoffmann .
The mammal report comes as the IUCN — the world 's largest organization of environmental groups , with 11,000 scientist members from 160 nations — opened its yearly meeting in Barcelona .
" Our results paint a bleak picture , " he says .
Land mammals face their greatest risk of extinction in South and Southeast Asia , where 79 % of monkey and ape species are threatened , the report finds .
Forest - cutting and expanded farms are destroying the homes of species such as the fishing cat .
Habitats from India to Java are threatened by marsh - clearing .
Sea mammals are under particular threat in the North Atlantic , North Pacific and Southeast Asia , where dolphin species suffer from fishing and pollution because of factory and farm runoff .
" Overall , about 30 % of animal species face declines , " says World Wildlife Fund biologist Sybille Klenzendorf , an expert on tiger conservation .
Steep declines in the population of marine mammals , such as the Gulf of California 's vaquita porpoise , began a decade ago , she says , while land mammals steadily lost numbers over the century .
" It 's not all doom and gloom , " Hoffmann says .
Some species , such as African elephants and black - footed ferrets in North America , have rebounded .
With habitat preserves , captive breeding and laws against hunting , many more species could be saved , he says .
But the IUCN report notes it lacked data for 836 of the world 's mammal species , possibly because those creatures have become extinct .

In her latest column , Janet Porter warns all those Christians who intend to vote for Barack Obama that they are willfully disobeying God and will be punished accordingly :
To all those who name the name of Christ who plan to willfully disobey Him by voting for Obama , take warning .
Not only is our nation in grave danger , according to the Word of God , so are you … [ T ] his election is not about race .
It ’s not about the economy .
It ’s about obeying God .
…
Be forewarned :
If you willfully disobey God on life and marriage because of race or false hope for the economy , you will usher in the kind of change that brought the Soviet Union to collapse .
But the warning goes far beyond that .
To those who think that God ’s grace gives them license to willfully disobey
Him without consequences – think again :
Not everyone who says to Me , “ Lord , Lord , ” shall enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father in heaven .
Many will say to Me in that day , “ Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in Your name , cast out demons in Your name , and done many wonders in Your name ? ”
And then I will declare to them , “ I never knew you ; depart from Me , you who practice lawlessness ! ” ( Matthew 7:21 - 23 )
That deals with your eternity .

Over at her blog , Lloydletta ’s Nooz and Comments , Eva Young alerts us to a video of Sarah Palin commenting on her attitudes toward homosexuality :
While I disagree with the Alaska Governor ’s contention that her friend “ made a choice ” to be gay , I ’m pleased that we have yet another piece of video showing Palin saying that she does n’t judge people because they are gay .
She has remained friends with a woman even after learning of her lesbianism .
These remarks are consistent with her past statements on homosexuality .
Importantly , she does n’t define her friend by her sexuality : “ She ’s not my gay friend , she is one of my best friends . ”
That ’s how I hope my straight friends see me .
Â
How we all should hope our straight friends see us .
This seems in fitting with the “ live and let live ” spirit of Alaska , something I ’d like to see become increasingly regnant in the Republican Party .
With the prominence of John McCain and Sarah Palin in the GOP , that seems to be becoming increasingly likely .
We know how John McCain treats friends and colleagues when he learns they ’re gay .
His running mate has the same attitude .

UPDATE from Bruce ( GayPatriot ) : Dan , I never watch any of the network news programs , but oddly happened to change channels just as this clip was being aired .
My take immediately was that her friend had the choice to “ come out ” and that she admired her friend for doing so .
But that ’s just my impression of her comments .
UP - UPDATE ( from Dan ) : Good point , Bruce .
We do make a choice in coming out .
Peter Mandelson 's last act as European Trade Commissioner was to advocate new trade rules that will directly benefit the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska .
Less than a month ago , in one of his final speeches before being recalled to the Cabinet and after he accepted hospitality on the Russian 's yacht , Lord Mandelson announced a new EU trade strategy giving multinational companies freer access to raw materials , including scrap aluminium and natural minerals used in the production of the metal .
Mr Deripaska owns Rusal , the world 's largest aluminium producer , which has subsidiaries in Europe .
The companies import both scrap aluminium and aluminium - containing minerals from Africa and India .
The new rules would exempt such companies from paying expensive export duties , to the anger of development charities .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Secretary of State for Business promised yesterday to be more careful in his contacts with wealthy businessmen after he became embroiled in allegations of a conflict of interest for staying on Mr Deripaska 's yacht .
But the new revelation raises further questions over Lord Mandelson 's links to the Russian billionaire .
Lord Mandelson arrives in Moscow today for a four - day trade meeting .
Mr Deripaska was originally invited to a reception for business leaders at the British embassy but was removed from the guest list .
It is not known whether Mr Deripaska or the Government took the decision .
Addressing industry lobbyists in Brussels on 29 September , Mr Mandelson condemned " beggar - thy - neighbour " export restrictions , including a 50 per cent levy on " scrap aluminium that has all but wiped out trade in this metal " .
Pledging new commitments for free trade , he added : " I will raise the question of raw materials in every meeting I have with every trade minister from every country that restricts European imports . "
Next month the European Commission will issue a policy statement outlining how firms can exploit natural resources around the world .
Yesterday , the Business Secretary wrote a letter to The Times insisting he " made no personal intervention to support the commercial interests of Mr Deripaska " .
There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Lord Mandelson or the Russian billionaire , and the peer has long advocated free trade .
He has not broken any European Commission rules , which do not require commissioners to register hospitality .
They are under an informal obligation to notify commission officials of any potential conflict of interest .
But critics said the announcement of new trade rules , five weeks after the yacht meeting and five days before he became Secretary of State for Business , fuelled the suspicion of a conflict of interest .
This is the latest twist to the Corfu saga , which has pitted Lord Mandelson and the banking heir Nat Rothschild against George Osborne and David Cameron 's fundraiser , Andrew Feldman over the alleged solicitation of a donation to the Tory party .
Until now , the controversy surrounding Lord Mandelson centred on the length of his relationship with Mr Deripaska .
A decision to exempt the Russian 's business from a tariff on aluminium foil was approved by Lord Mandelson in December 2005 .
When the story first emerged , European Commission officials suggested the two men had met at " a few social gatherings in 2006 and 2007 " .
In his letter to The Times the peer admitted he had in fact met Mr Deripaska in Moscow 2004 .
Referring to his new job , Lord Mandelson wrote : " I will , of course , in line with the Ministerial Code , ensure that no conflict of interest , or perception of such , arises from any of my past or indeed future contacts ...
As Business Secretary I will continue to act with the public interest in mind , as the public has every right to expect . "
The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said yesterday : " It is indisputable that Mr Mandelson accepted hospitality from Mr Deripaska .
It is indisputable that he then advocated policies which would benefit Mr Deripaska , and therefore he cannot be surprised if people reach the conclusion that the two events are connected .
The golden rule is you should never accept hospitality from somebody who will be affected or who will benefit from your actions . "
A spokesman for Lord Mandelson said : " He has said , and the director general for trade in the European Commission has said , that he had made no personal intervention to support the commercial interests of Mr Deripaska . "
Meanwhile friends of Mr Rothschild warned Mr Feldman not to sue the multimillionaire over their conflicting accounts of the discussions in Corfu .
One friend of Mr Rothschild said : " It would n't be a wise thing for Feldman to do , to bring this to court .
Who has the more money after all ? "

The rapid and emphatic movement of Sarah Palin 's left eye has become the latest sensation in the US presidential race .
During the Republican governor 's opening debate with her vice - presidential rival Joe Biden , she unleashed an apparently playful wink on several occasions .
For some voters , Winkgate was a folksy , intimate gesture .
For others , it was a cheesy and inappropriately flirtatious sales pitch .
The link between a wink and sales people - and dishonesty - is well established .
" Think of the used car salesman trying to sell you a car with 50,000 miles ( but they rolled back the odometer from 250,000 miles ) , " wrote one blogger .
Winking when you are trying to sell yourself to voters is something else .
George W Bush was criticised for fratboyish winks to the press corps and for winking at the Queen after a characteristic verbal blunder .
The Queen was not amused .
" She gave me a look that only a mother could give her child , " smirked Bush .
Body language expert Judi James thinks Palin 's gesture was not only deliberate but a useful part of her appeal as an " unpretentious " ordinary hockey mom .
" A wink is a very strong tie sign , which is a bonding gesture .
Anne Robinson uses it to say , ' I 'm a bit of a dragon but I 'm nice really . '
A lot of celebrities use it to connect with their audience and make themselves look down - to - earth . "
But it depends on the winker .
What 's good for Palin might be disastrous for John McCain or Barack Obama - whose fist bump was previously the most discussed presidential - race body language .
James warns that winking still has sexual connotations : powerful men who wink at work risk a sexual harassment claim .
Robinson , Britain 's best known public winker , remains deeply unimpressed by Palin .
" It 's depressing that she exists , never mind that she winks , " she says .
Just a quick post , to highlight something that I ’m sure we ’ll be hearing more about in the weeks to come .
We ’re starting to see racially - tinged rhetoric against an Indian - American candidate for U.S. Congress :
It seems to me that the officials at this press event know exactly what they ’re saying , though they nevertheless deny the racist and xenophobic thrust of their comments : “ From a demographic standpoint , Erik Paulson fits the district very well . ”
I do not know whether the Republican Party in Minnesota is going to start running ads along these lines or not .
If not , perhaps this is n’t really all that important .
But the rhetoric here just feels too deliberate to be merely a one - off event or an accident .
That said , if they ’re sinking to this level , Madia must be doing something right .
Incidentally , here is a debate between Madia and Paulson that took place on Minnesota Public Radio in mid-August .
And here are a few recent SM posts related to Madia : here , here , and here .
Say what you will about Sarah Palin - that she 's a dingbat , an ideologue , and a bit of a creep - but she 's not dumb enough to pay her taxes .
The McCain campaign released the last two years of her tax returns yesterday in an old school Friday news dump - and she totally cheats !
" Palin , it appears , did not pay taxes on the more than $ 60,000 of travel reimbursements that she and her family members reportedly billed the state during her 18 months as governor . "
McCain 's goons will surely argue that there 's nothing wrong with that .
Because they are liars .
" There is a fairly wonky debate over whether she should have been charged for these trips or whether it was accounted for in her salary .
John Bogdanski , a tax professor at the Lewis and Clark Law School , told the Huffington Post 's Seth Colter Walls that they did qualify as taxable income . "
And $ 60 grand is n't a big deal if you 're a total millionaire like John McCain and own eight houses , but Palin is merely wealthy .
So she rips off the Treasury Joe Six - Pack style .
" According to an accompanying 2007 personal financial disclosure report , Palin's ' income ' as governor of Alaska was $ 196,531.50 , well above the $ 107,987.00 that was noted on her W2 form from that same year . "

In its latest attempts to unfreeze credit markets and keep the banking system functions , the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing it is using its newly granted powers to pay interest on the reserves that banks leave at the Fed , among other things .
Here ’s what the Fed is doing and why .

As part of its effort to wipe out methamphetamine , and especially home - cooked meth , the state of Iowa enacted a law limiting the amount of pseudoephedrine people could purchase in a 24 - hour period or in a month .
The idea was to crack down on people who used the ingredient in popular cold and allergy medications to make their own meth .
sinus sufferers beware -- of the cops !
But the law of unintended consequences struck again this month -- or in the case of loal sheriffs , perhaps intended consequences -- this time landing squarely on the head of a Mason City man who knows nothing about meth , but knows a lot about suffering from chronic nasal congestion .
Gary Schinagel , 47 , a senior investment associate at Principal Financial Group in Mason City , was arrested for the illegal purchase of pseudoephedrine after buying generic cold medicines to treat his condition .
Schinagel told the Mason City Globe Gazette his through - the - looking - glass encounter with the drug war began when his niece called him and told him he had been listed in a newspaper article as one of the uncaught miscreants in a roundup of violators of the cold medicine law .
Schinagel went to the sheriff 's office thinking he could clear up the " mistake , " but was instead arrested .
" It is a sinking feeling to be placed under arrest , " said Schinagel .
" I 'm not a stick - in - the - mud but I 've tried all my life to abide by the law and not cross any lines I should n't cross .
I 've tried all my life to avoid situations like I find myself in now .
And I still do n't know which line I crossed , " he said , wondering if he had purchased too many pills in one day or in one month .
He had to call his bank to get the $ 1,000 bail bond needed to get him out of jail .
" It was embarrassing , " he said .
" The woman at the bank recognized my voice .
I sang in the choir with her . "
No word yet on apologies from the cops or when his charges will be dropped .
In the meantime , Schinagel is taking cold pills that do n't contain pseudoephedrine .
They do n't work as well , he said , and he has to buy more boxes .
One more example of collateral damage in the drug war .
But Schinagel is more understanding than the police who arrested him after he came to the station to straighten out the mess .
" Laws are made because there are some bad people out there and it's too bad that sometimes innocent victims get caught up in it , " he said .
" I understand the law -- but I will say there are some quirks in it . "

If mission specialist Michael Massimino is worried about performing death - defying repairs on the world ’s most famous ( and expensive ) telescope , he does a convincing job of hiding it .
Snug in the electric - orange space suit that he will wear aboard the space shuttle Atlantis , he riffs genially about his Brooklyn upbringing , the search for a great slice of New York pizza , and the absurdities of NASA lingo .
He discusses some technical issues about the suit with his crewmates .
He reflects on the history around him in this corner of Houston ’s Johnson Space Center , where Apollo communications equipment was tested four decades ago .
In short , he exudes effortless competence and exactly zero fear .
Massimino will need that moxie and know - how when he and his crew blast off this month from Cape Canaveral and rendezvous with the Hubble Space Telescope 360 miles above Earth ’s surface .
Once the astronauts secure the orbiting 12 - ton observatory to Atlantis , they will embark on five arduous space walks to install a new camera and spectrograph and fix two other malfunctioning instruments to upgrade Hubble ’s vision .
The crew will also swap in new batteries and gyroscopes , attach a protective blanket , and repair the guidance system .
NASA has sent servicing missions to Hubble before , but this one is unique in complexity and finality .
If the upgrades work , Hubble should keep scanning the cosmos until at least 2013 .
At that point , however , its gyros or batteries will fail and the heroic telescope will become so much orbiting junk .
Three members of the Atlantis crew have visited Hubble previously .
After this mission , no astronauts will ever return .
More significantly , this is the beginning of the end not just for Hubble but for space shuttles — indeed for the entire American manned space program as currently configured .
NASA will fly the shuttle a few more times , mainly to complete construction of the all - but - forgotten International Space Station , but by the fall of 2010 the last shuttle will be retired .
For the first time in 29 years , the United States will have no way to launch humans into space .
If all goes well , both the end of the Hubble and the end of the shuttle will create only temporary gaps .
NASA ’s next great space observatory , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , is well along in development , slated for launch in 2013 .
It might even overlap with Hubble , depending on how long its predecessor lasts .
But JWST is not a true replacement .
It is designed to study infrared rays — invisible radiation just beyond the red part of the spectrum .
That makes it great for examining infant stars and distant galaxies , but it will not be able to take space portraits that capture what the human eye can see .
The space shuttle , too , has a successor waiting in the wings .
The Ares rocket and Orion capsule , modeled on the Saturn rocket and Apollo module from the 1960s , should begin crewed flights in 2015 .
( Between 2010 and 2015 , all manned American flights into orbit will take place aboard Russian spacecraft . )
Ares and Orion will not have wings and will not be reusable , but they will be designed to carry humans beyond Earth ’s orbit , as part of NASA ’s planned return to the moon .
NASA ’s future depends heavily on this month ’s Atlantis mission .
If the shuttle flight goes awry , Hubble is doomed and the already - precarious support for Ares and Orion might evaporate .
( Last fall Sen . Barack Obama suggested delaying NASA ’s next human space adventure to focus funds on more practical problems . )
To ensure success , the astronauts have logged long hours in the Shuttle Mission Simulator at Johnson .
In a nearby building , the spacewalking part of the team has practiced 13 rounds of Hubble repairs under water in the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Lab ( NBL ) .
And over at the God­dard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , the training has continued on a Hubble mock - up in the center ’s 1.3 - million - cubic - foot clean room .
In the practice sessions every step is plotted , every contingency accounted for .
Yet space history is full of sad proof that humans cannot always master the complexities of their own inventions .
Two of the space shuttle ’s 123 flights have ended in fatal catastrophe ; the Columbia disaster happened just a year after the previous Hubble repair mission .
One of the reasons Massimino and the rest of the Atlantis crew look so relaxed is that they know success does not ride on them alone .
Everywhere they go they are supported by thousands of others — suit technicians and rocket engineers , NBL scuba divers and Johnson flight engineers — busting their behinds to make sure that the last great shuttle flight is an unmitigated triumph .
The fate of the Hubble Space Telescope and the destiny of the next generation of space explorers lie in their hands .
A spokesman for Senator Xenophon said , should the filtering plan go ahead , he would look to use it to block Australians from accessing overseas online casino sites , which are illegal to run in Australia .
In a Senate Estimates hearing last week , the Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , confirmed that his proposal would force ISPs to implement a two - tiered filtering system .
The proposed censorship is more advanced than that in any liberal democracy and would put Australia on a par with oppressive regimes such as Iran , the internet industry says .
Despite his earlier promises that Australians would be able to opt out of any internet filters , Senator Conroy said the first tier would be compulsory for all Australians and would block all " illegal material " , as determined in part by a blacklist administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
The second tier , which is optional , would filter out content deemed inappropriate for children , such as pornography .
But asked to specify the categories of content that Senator Fielding would like blocked by the mandatory first tier , a Family First spokeswoman indicated the party would want X - rated and refused classification ( RC ) content banned for everyone , including adults .
" Family First would consider a mandatory ISP - based filtering system that protects children by blocking illegal content like child pornography , but allows adults to opt out of filtering to access material classified R18 + or less , " Senator Fielding 's spokeswoman said .
According to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 , X18 + content includes hardcore pornography , while content that is refused classification includes that which depicts drug use or sexual fetishes .
Both are a step above R18 + content , which typically includes adult themes .
The online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia expressed fears that the internet filters could be used as a bargaining chip every time the Government needed to pass a piece of important legislation .
" Any group with an axe to grind and political clout will be lobbying the Government to blacklist websites which they object to , " EFA spokesman Dale Clapperton said .
" Having all Australians ' internet access subject to a secret and unaccountable government blacklist is completely unacceptable in a liberal democracy such as Australia . "
Clapperton said most adult pornography on the internet was already " prohibited content " under the Act , and pro-euthanasia , pro-anorexia and pro-piracy websites could easily be caught by the system .
Today , such prohibited content , if hosted overseas , is added to ACMA 's blacklist but Australians are still able to access it if they wish .
This would not be the case if mandatory ISP filtering was introduced .
" Senator Conroy talks about blocking access to ' illegal material ' , but the ACMA blacklist of ' prohibited content ' is not limited to material which is illegal - it includes X - rated material , and R - rated material unless it is protected by a government - approved restricted access system , " he said .
Greens Senator Scott Ludlam expressed similar concerns when grilling Senator Conroy in Senate Estimates last week .
He said all sorts of politically sensitive material could be added to the blacklist and otherwise legitimate sites - for example , YouTube - could be rendered inaccessible based on content published by users .
" The blacklist ... can become very grey depending on how expansive the list becomes - euthanasia material , politically related material , material about anorexia .
There is a lot of distasteful stuff on the internet , " Senator Ludlam said .
John Lindsay , carrier relations manager at Internode , said : " I do n't see that what Fielding has just described to you is necessarily any different to what the public should expect from the Government 's as yet unstated filtering regime , because we have n't got a clear explanation as to what the Government 's actual mandatory blacklist looks like . "
The Opposition 's communication spokesman , Nick Minchin , said it would take " a lot of convincing " for the Coalition to support the Government 's filtering plan .
" That 's the problem with having this sort of highly centralised government - mandated nationwide filtering system , " Senator Minchin said in a telephone interview .
" The argy - bargy that would result over what is in and what is out strikes me as being almost impossible to manage and it would be a cat chasing its tail . "
The Government 's own laboratory trials have found that presently available filters are not capable of distinguishing adequately between legal and illegal content and can degrade internet speeds by up to 86 per cent .
Despite this , and significant opposition from ISPs , the Government will soon seek expressions of interest from telcos seeking to be part of a live trial of the filters .
Synopsis
Habanero is a fully featured Enterprise Application Development Framework that is developed to assist software developers and software or IT managers to easily produce well architected , scalable web and windows .
Net solutions .
Habanero is unique in that it is developed by a core team of South African software developers , over a period of seven years .
Its strength lies in the fact that the architecture is fully test driven , is Free open source under the LGPL license and has an active community .
Habanero is continually evolving to keep pace with technology changes and new software development paradigms .
Why use a framework at all ?
We are currently living in a world where the complexity of software is increasing daily , users expectations of software are higher than ever before and the number of software graduates are decreasing at a rapid rate .
Good software development skills are in short supply !
The use of a framework such as Habanero is recommended because it :
Standardises the software development architecture allowing any software developer in the team to easily maintain software
Has built in best practices so that juniors and intermediates can easily develop high quality applications
Enforces consistency in development , functionality and the look and feel of user interfaces .
What does Habanero do ?
Allows a developer with a year of .
Net experience to easily produce enterprise application software in C Sharp or VB .
Net , that is scalable and robust .
It allows a developer to focus his / her time and effort on understanding and implementing business rules since all the routine tasks that are required to create and maintain a custom developed application are taken care of by Habanero :
It persists data to and from the database using object relational mapping .
It has a highly optimised Object Relational Mapping ( ORM ) layer that handles all interactions of your domain model objects with the data store of your choice .
You will notice that you never have to think about SQL , or files , or any other persistence strategy .
All of this is done for you .
The Habanero SQL engine handles everything , from querying your database to inserting , updating and deleting your data records .
Due to the intelligence built into the Habanero object model , you are able to query across relationships without having to think about SQL Joins and you can do efficient updates of the data in a table for only the fields that have been modified .
Uses standard persistent strategies but allows the developer to create a custom strategy that plugs seamlessly into Habanero .
Generates standard user interfaces that are used for data maintenance at run time so that data is easily edited and displayed .
Unique Habanero features
Supports agile development :
A tool called FireStarter is included with Habanero to provide a visual interface for the creation of your domain model objects and rules as well as your application code .
Using FireStarter , a developer is able to iteratively generate all of the domain model code ( as well as supporting Test Fixtures ) for his application , allowing them to focus on the application logic and flow instead .
Habanero is a very stable framework with many solutions successfully deployed all over the world .
The framework has been developed with a Test Driven Development approach ensuring that the code base is of a very high quality .
The framework is currently covered by more than 7500 unit and acceptance tests and the core domain layer library has test coverage of almost 90 % .
Persistence to most mainstream relational databases ( Oracle , SQL Server , MySQL , FireBird , MS Access , PostgreSQL , and SQLite ) , as well as files ( XML , binary , etc . )
Has a highly efficient in - memory datastore that allows developers to easily test their applications using test driven design methodologies .
Has a highly efficient in - memory datastore that allows developers to easily test their applications using test driven design methodologies .
It is meta data driven and is not a code generator thereby ensuring that your code is not bloated with unmaintainable code .
For more info , please visit the Habanero labs portal .
Why you should use Habanero instead of risking the development of a new framework
Can you really justify the expenditure of building a framework when there is a free framework that is freely available for downloads ?
Do you really believe that a new framework developed by an internal team ( that receives very limited technical quality assurance and deployment feedback ) is equivalent to a framework that has been developed and tested over seven years by a team of senior software developers ?
In this day of high IT staff turnover and decreasing skill sets , are you prepared to run the risk of key software developers leaving mid way through the development of a framework ?

Villagers from the two communities fought with guns , bows and arrows , machetes and spears .
More than 100 have been injured and 50,000 have fled their homes to take refuge in makeshift camps set up by the police .
" Shoot - on - sight orders have been issued and curfew has been imposed in the violence - hit areas , " Assam 's chief minister Tarun Gogoi said .
Many of the dead were burned to death and more than a dozen people with serious burns have been taken to hospital in Guwahati , the state 's main city .
A senior police officer , who asked not to be named , told Reuters attackers had set fire to their rivals ' houses .
Authorities have called in army and paramilitary forces .
" The local administration failed to take immediate action to control the situation when the trouble initially started and later it flared up , " Gogoi said .
Ringed by China , Myanmar , Bangladesh and Bhutan , India 's northeast is home to more than 200 tribes and has been racked by separatist revolts since India gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
Muslim settlers from Bangladesh have moved into the region in recent decades .
Update :
The source is available at github.com/mist64/cbmbasic
Attention Slashdot crowd , here is a little background :
This application is a recompiled version of the original Commodore 64 binary – it is not a reimplementation , so while it runs at pretty much the maximum possible speed , it is still 100 % compatible .
The huge C file in the archive has been produced by feeding the original 6502 code into my static recompiler and optimizing it with LLVM .
The original operating system interface ( character I/O , LOAD , SAVE etc. ) has been reimplemented in native C , so Commodore BASIC interfaces nicely with OS X / Windows / Unix – you can use pipe I/O , and you can pass the filename of a BASIC program on the command line .
Yes , you could also just run a standard C64 emulator , but it would n’t be nearly this speed , and everything would run inside a sandbox ; and there would be no way to interface this to your OS .
A while back , I released Apple I BASIC and Commodore BASIC as a scripting language for Mac OS X 10.5 on Intel .
It did not work on any other OS or on a different CPU type .
Today , we are releasing Commodore BASIC as a Scripting Language – it works on Linux , Windows , Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 ( Intel and PowerPC ) , and you even get the source , so you can adapt it to other operating systems and CPUs .
Download it here : cbmbasic.zip
The archive comes with binaries for Mac OS X and Windows .
The source compiles on Linux , Windows and Mac OS X .
All code is BSD - licensed .
Main work by Michael Steil , speed optimizations , Linux and Windows fixes by James Abbatiello .
The core of the BASIC interpreter is in the file cbmbasic.c , which is platform , endianness and bitness independent .
For all I/O , it calls out into runtime.c , do it should be able to adapt this project for any OS by just changing runtime .c .
All function calls that the core interpreter ca n’t handle end up in kernal_dispatch ( ) in runtime.c , where a switch statement dispatches these to C functions .
For Commodore BASIC , runtime.c has to support several Commodore KERNAL library routines .
Some of them are very important ( CHRIN , CHROUT ) and some are only used for certain BASIC statements ( LOAD , SAVE , OPEN , SETTIM ) .
runtime .c does not implement all functions yet .
Feel free to port cbmbasic to your system and architecture of choice , and extend runtime .c to support more functions .
If you like , send your changes back to us ( mist64 < at > mac < dot > com , abbeyj < at > gmail < dot > com ) , so we can update the main project and give your changes to everyone .
We ’re also interested how fast you can get it with different compilers and settings .
See my old article for more info as well as some insights on how it is done .

GOVERNMENT
Prevention - oriented government .
End crisis management through prevention - oriented programs that will both solve existing problems and prevent future ones from arising .
Conflict - free politics .
The Natural Law Party supports all - party government -- bringing together the best ideas , programs , and leaders from all political parties and the private sector to solve and prevent problems .
The Natural Law Party advocates an end to negative campaigning and partisan politics , and supports essential campaign finance reform to eliminate special interest control of government .
Proven solutions .
Government should be based on what works -- not what is politically expedient or bought and paid for by special interest groups .
There are simple , humane , cost - effective , scientifically proven solutions to all of Americas problems .
The Natural Law Party was founded to implement these solutions immediately in government .
Government in accord with natural law .
Solve problems at their basis by bringing individual life , and our national policies , into greater harmony with natural law through proven educational programs ; natural , preventive health care ; renewable energy ; sustainable agriculture ; and other forward - looking , prevention - oriented programs .
Reverse the current epidemic of individual and social stress by establishing groups professionally engaged in creating coherence throughout society .
Scientific research verifies that such groups promote social harmony , reduce collective stress , and improve efficiency in governmental administration .
Streamline the Federal Government by reducing government waste and mismanagement , cutting pork - barrel spending , simplifying redundant bureaucracies , and encouraging decentralization and privatization wherever possible .
ECONOMY
Implement a pro-growth economic policy , with a truly balanced budget ( not a " surplus " that exists only as an accounting fiction ) by 2002 and a low flat tax of 10 % by 2006 .
Only the Natural Law Party can cut taxes deeply -- and responsibly -- while protecting the integrity of our important social programs through the hundreds of billions of dollars saved annually by our cost - effective solutions to crime , spiraling health care costs , and other costly social problems .
Simultaneously , by propelling the economy into a growth phase , our policy will create new jobs , reduce unemployment , and strengthen job security .
Fully harness America 's most precious resource -- the unlimited intelligence and creativity of America 's 270 million citizens .
In todays information - based economy , intelligence and creativity , innovation and ideas , drive economic growth .
The Natural Law Party strongly supports proven educational , job training , and apprenticeship programs that develop intelligence and creativity and prevent school dropouts .
Only the full utilization of our human resource through the Natural Law Partys fundamental commitment to education will ensure Americas competitiveness and future leadership in the family of nations .
HEALTH
Support health strategies that focus on prevention and strengthen the general health of the nation , thereby shifting our national focus from disease care to health care .
Recent research shows that at least 50 % of deaths and 70 % of disease in America are self - inflicted  -- caused by an epidemic of unhealthy habits .
The vast majority of disease is therefore preventable .
Support the introduction of financial incentives that will help prevent abuse of the health care system and ensure high - quality care , including ( 1 ) medical savings accounts for Medicare and Medicaid subscribers , which will provide financial rewards for good health ; and ( 2 ) vouchers enabling Medicare and Medicaid enrollees to choose any insurance plan or health care provider they desire , thereby promoting competitive costs and quality of care among medical providers .
The implementation of verifiable , cost - effective prevention together with the above financial incentives will rescue Medicare and Medicaid from bankruptcy , save the nation up to $ 500 billion a year in health care costs , and prevent untold pain and suffering .
Promote life in accord with natural law through the reduction of individual and social stress , thereby achieving a lasting social transformation toward more life - supporting , health - promoting behavior among our citizens .
EDUCATION
Support proven educational initiatives and curriculum innovations , including : The Head Start program , to help children excel from an early age
Proven developmental technologies , such as the Transcendental Meditation program , to directly increase intelligence and boost educational outcomes
School vouchers to increase school choice , foster competition , and improve educational outcomes
Federally guaranteed student loans and Pell Grants for higher education
Higher national standards and the practical means to achieve them
National apprenticeship programs for students who are not college bound
Computer - aided instruction , including Internet instruction
Sound approaches to school nutrition and preventive health education
Effective drug prevention
Policies and programs to upgrade the status and skills of teachers CRIME AND REHABILITATION Support systematic , scientifically proven programs to reduce stress in the individual and throughout society -- thus eliminating the root cause of crime .
Target individuals who are at highest risk for crime -- the current prison inmate population -- through proven rehabilitation programs and advanced scientific methods to assess rehabilitation and eligibility for parole .
Implement community policing .
Such programs have been credited with reducing crime dramatically .
In this approach , police are assigned to high - crime neighborhoods identified by computer tracking , work closely with these neighborhoods , and are rewarded for preventing crime .
Revitalize our overcrowded urban centers -- breeding grounds for violence and crime .
Introduce programs proven to reduce drug dependency and promote mental and physical health .
Support effective educational programs to keep children in school , off the streets , and out of the reach of crime .
The Natural Law Partys strong educational focus is the true , long - term solution to the pervasive problem of crime .
AGRICULTURE
Support legislation that will ensure social , economic , and environmental sustainability of agriculture while balancing the following goals : ( 1 ) ensuring high - quality , healthy food for consumers that is free from industrial and agrichemical toxins ; ( 2 ) promoting health and longevity in farmers and in the population as a whole ; ( 3 ) protecting natural resources and the environment ; ( 4 ) cushioning farmers from the natural and financial instability unique to agriculture ; ( 5 ) enabling farmers to better pursue financial profitability ; and ( 6 ) restoring the vitality of family farms and rural communities .
Mandate the labeling of genetically engineered foods and declare a moratorium on the release of genetically engineered organisms until the ecological impact of such organisms is established .
Shift the U.S. policy focus from cheap food for the consumer to quality food for the consumer on a sustainable basis . 
Agrichemical use could be reduced 50 % by the year 2002 and farm profits could increase through field - tested techniques supported by scientific research , such as integrated pest management , integrated crop management , and organic methods .
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
Support the development and use of new , environmentally clean energy sources , such as solar , wind , and biomass by ( 1 ) removing federal subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy and ( 2 ) taxing fossil fuels to reflect their real cost to the nation .
Improve energy efficiency and self - sufficiency by ( 1 ) supporting basic research on energy efficiency , energy storage , and fuel cells , in addition to electric , hydrogen , and highly energy - efficient vehicles , ( 2 ) providing financial incentives for home - owners and industry to use available energy - efficiency measures , and ( 3 ) setting performance standards for energy - consuming and pollutant - emitting products .
Clean up Americas polluted air , rivers , wetlands , and oceans by eliminating industrial pollution at its source and using waste products productively .
Lead the global effort to prevent the destruction of the earths forests , the decimation of the diversity of species , and the potential damage from ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect .
Create new jobs and new industries in energy conservation and renewable energy sources that will simultaneously benefit the environment and save the nation hundreds of billions of dollars .
STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY
Support long - overdue reforms to ensure ( a ) equal access to the ballot , the media , and the public for all qualified candidates , ( b ) the elimination of PAC and soft - money funding of campaigns , and ( c ) a shift toward public sponsorship of campaigns in order to reduce the undue influence of special interest groups on election outcomes .
Such reforms will fulfill every Americans right to complete information about all candidates and their platforms while freeing elected officials to focus on serving their country rather than seeking campaign contributions .
Encourage voter participation in the election process by shortening the campaign season to two months , making election day a national holiday , and abolishing the Electoral College .
Restrict lobbying and limit congressional privileges .
ABORTION
Offer prevention of abortion on a realistic basis through proven educational programs to bring individual and national life into harmony with natural law .
The Natural Law Party believes that we can reduce abortions more effectively through education than through legislation -- education that develops intelligence , improves moral reasoning , and promotes far - sighted thinking and actions that do not create problems .
Our nation 's history shows that it is difficult to legislate morality , and the Natural Law Party believes that it is counterproductive for the Federal Government to outlaw abortion .
Encourage a shift from public to private funding of abortion -- specifically , private charity by those who wish to make abortion accessible for women who cannot afford it .
Over time , the government should eliminate the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortion as a method of birth control .
( The Natural Law Party would support public funding of abortions in cases of rape , incest , or medical necessity . )
Satisfy both those who are pro-life and pro-choice by ( a ) decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies more effectively than legislation and ( b ) leaving moral responsibility in the hands of those whose lives are affected most .
FAMILY VALUES
Implement programs that resolve the root cause of the breakdown of family life today -- epidemic stress levels throughout society , especially in urban centers .
With the rise of greater social harmony , all individuals , and especially parents , will be able to make the most life - supporting decisions in their personal lives and the most nourishing decisions for the lives of their children .
Create jobs , stimulate growth , and ease the financial strain experienced by so many American families through our low - tax , pro-growth economic policy .
FOREIGN POLICY
Create an immediate shift in U.S. foreign policy away from military aid towards a more life - supporting policy based on the exportation of U.S. know - how -- American expertise and technical assistance in business administration , entrepreneurship , education , sustainable agriculture , energy conservation , and emerging environmental technologies -- supplemented where necessary with economic support .
This new type of life - supporting assistance will allow many developing countries to become financially self - sufficient and thereby help eliminate global hunger and poverty .
Ensure that our foreign aid resources are applied effectively -- not wasted through inefficiency , mishandling , or inappropriate allocation -- by making foreign aid decisions in consultation with the government and citizens of recipient countries .
Through this cooperative focus , promote unity and respect within the global diversity of cultures , religions , races , and economic and political systems .
DEFENSE
Support the creation of a " prevention wing " within the military -- a group whose primary purpose is to prevent the outbreak of war and to preserve and strengthen national and international peace .
Train as few as 1Ð2 % of military personnel , comprising one or several groups of 5,000Ð10,000 , in the proven peace - promoting technology of the TM - Sidhi program .
As well as inoculating  participating troops against the debilitating effects of combat stress , this prevention wing would help relieve stress in the nation as a whole , prevent incoherence within the government , and protect the nation from negative influences both inside and outside the country -- including terrorism and war .
Responsibly reduce defense expenditures over time by creating a smaller , more flexible force that , when coupled with greater economic and security cooperation , can most effectively serve the nations security interests and provide the basis for a more stable world .
Encourage incentives to help defense industries diversify into nondefense markets and reinvest private - sector funds and expertise .
REVITALIZING OUR INNER CITIES
Apply proven educational , health , economic , and crime - reduction programs to improve the inner city environment .
Use federally guaranteed loans to stimulate capital investment for start - up industries in urban enterprise zones . 
By targeting economically deprived urban areas , we can stimulate economic growth where it is most needed , thereby creating more jobs , a stronger sense of community , and the revitalization of our inner cities .
Help plan urban infrastructure and housing that improve quality of life and restore a sense of community to the inner city .
Promote the development of nonpolluting automobiles and public transportation , human - scale housing that discourages crime and supports neighborhoods in which families can grow and prosper , and the development of more parks and green spaces .
DRUG ABUSE
Implement educational programs that directly unfold intelligence and creativity , build self - confidence , eliminate stress , and raise life to be in harmony with natural law , thereby eliminating the tendency towards drug dependence and helping prevent school dropouts -- the principal targets for drugs and drug - related crimes .
Promote programs that have been shown to dramatically reduce drug dependency and to eliminate stress and restore balance in an individuals physiology and psychology ( see our Health and Crime platforms ) .
Support procedures that will promote cooperation and coordination among the various law enforcement agencies responsible for interdicting , apprehending , and prosecuting individuals and organizations engaged in illegal drug and narcotics activities .
GUN CONTROL
Eliminate the climate of fear and tension pervading Americas cities and towns , which is largely responsible for the proliferation of guns and their use in acts of violent crime , through effective crime - prevention programs ( see our Crime platform ) .
Uphold existing gun-control legislation as an appropriate balance between public safety and the constitutional right to bear arms .
UPHOLDING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES Support any legislation deemed necessary to uphold the guaranteed constitutional rights of women and of minorities .
Dissolve prejudice and bigotry in society through educational programs that develop broad comprehension , increased intelligence , and improved moral reasoning and by reducing social stress that leads to fear and divisiveness .
Increase participation in government by women and by minorities to bring greater strength and balance to the administration .
IMMIGRATION
Support balanced immigration by allocating immigration quotas to each nation , thereby preventing dominance of any one nationality or ethnic subculture in America 's melting pot tradition .
The concentration of uninational subcultures in urban centers precludes acculturation , slows economic integration , and could lead to the birth of a permanent underclass .
Disincentivize illegal immigration by ( 1 ) increasing border defense through reassignment of selected military personnel and resources ( see our Defense platform ) , and ( 2 ) improving economic conditions in neighboring countries through a foreign policy emphasizing technical assistance and U.S. know - how ( see our Foreign Policy platform ) .
Most of the 400 presentations at the Agile 2008 conference , held last month in Toronto , were geared for developers and testers .
But the event held more than a few revelations and " Aha ! " moments for IT managers , particularly revolving around team workflow , business value , company culture and the new role of the manager .
Here are the key messages communicated by and to the Agile community .
1. Trust the Wisdom of Teams
Software is a result of a team effort , so a manager 's main concern should be nurturing the team .
But how many of us see our roles as enlightening an otherwise substandard and underperforming bunch of geeks who would escape their duties the moment we take our eyes off them ?
No , we never talk this way , but smart developers can conclude from our actions when a manager does not actually trust the team .
The result is lower morale , underutilized brain resources and lost opportunities .
In his conference keynote , James Surowiecki , author of The Wisdom of Crowds , described how groups demonstrate better decision - making results than do individuals .
We need to aggregate the intelligence available to organizations , he said , and develop frameworks for making near - optimal decisions .
Among the pitfalls that Surowiecki described was the importance of diversity because homogeneous groups become " dumber . "
The role of devil 's advocate is essential , he said , to avoid group degradation .
However , over time , a homogeneous group gets used to its devil 's advocates and learns to disregard their reasoning .
As a result , you need to mix up who wears the devil 's - advocate hat .
2. Even Self - Organized Teams Require Coaching
Command - and - control practices inevitably lead to substandard results in software development .
However , it would be naive and irresponsible to imagine that turning teams into self - organized machines means abdication from managerial duties .
On the contrary , Agile principles require managers to become leaders , and that goes all the way up to the CIO .
Many presentations revealed several results - based techniques in team dynamics .
One was a tutorial on " Coaching Self - Organized Teams " delivered by Joseph Pelrine and Steve Freeman .
Pelrine and Freeman focused most of their attention on models managers can use to leverage team conflict , such as the Abide model ( attractors , barriers , identities , diversity , environment ) .
By changing those parameters , the presenters said , you can change the results .
Using the Flow model , managers can pay attention to the acceptable level of challenge based on an individual 's skills to find a balance between anxiety and boredom ; they suggest you can manipulate the flow channel based on the learning patterns team members demonstrate .
3. Adapt or Get Out of the Way !
The New Manager 's Role
What is Agile leadership ?
What does it mean to lead in an " agile " manner ?
This was the theme of the hands - on , dynamic and creative workshop " Agile Leadership " given by Johanna Rothman , the author of Behind Closed Doors and Manage It ! , together with her coauthor Polyanna Pixton .
The workshop concentrated on collaborative environments , trust , transparency of information , and building productive and sustainable teams .
The group considered that the most important duty of an Agile leader is to build trust on every level ; it compared situations where " trust has not been built yet " and " trust has been broken . "
Trust is a fragile binary state ; regaining trust is much more difficult than building it .
Sometimes , broken trust cannot be rebuilt ; a leader needs to simply accept this fact and move on , said the presenters .
According to Pixton , a key factor in building trust with the team is a leader 's consistency in making decisions and what these decisions concern .
We managers often forget the second part of that statement .
When we do so , it leads to micromanagement , underutilization of the wisdom of teams and eventually to the deterioration of trust .
No matter how many people are on your team , the presenters insisted , you need one - on - ones with every team member at least once every two weeks .
This includes the leader 's peers .
While this maxim hardly seems feasible for larger teams , every inch of retreat from it costs in trust deterioration .
The workshop was full of such " simple revelations " that offer " obvious " but often underutilized bits of wisdom .
For example , one participant asked , " How do you make team members trust each other ? "
Rothman immediately replied , " You trust them first ! "
Perhaps the answer seems obvious , but do we always " walk the talk " ?
Not every bit of advice is as easy to adopt .
One presenter said , " Never rescue your team . "
Teach as little as possible , she said ; instead , create as many options as you can .
The team should feel the same pressure its manager feels .
It 's the only way to force your team to think and to offer solutions ; and , she said , it 's the only way to create a self - organized team .
The manager 's duty is to discuss with the team the risks associated with each solution .
But when a team member comes to you for a solution , said the presenters , return the baton to him by first asking , " How would you do it ? "
For example , one presenter said to a subordinate , " I have to apologize that I had to step in and do it for you .
You probably think now that I do not trust you anymore .
I apologize ; this will not happen again . "
That 's a tough lesson for a conventional manager !
Next : The Yearly Employee Appraisal , and other ways to de-motivate teams
4. Motivate , Do n't De-Motivate : Appraisals , Bonuses and Compensation
Managing IT teams includes human resources ( HR ) tasks .
According to Mary Poppendieck , one of the icons of the Agile movement , everything you are doing in your HR functions is wrong , because it is supported only by our illusions , not by facts .
In her presentation , " Appraisals and Compensation : The Elephant in the Room , " Poppendieck offered her view on appraisals , bonuses and compensation , and on their dramatic negative impact on performance .
She discussed the history and literature of reward systems in application to environments that require collaboration — a topic often avoided , as it causes conflict between rewards and teamwork .
Everyone hates annual appraisals .
A significant amount of managerial time and energy is wasted on this process , bringing very little value .
( The first known piece of literature about the negative influence of the appraisal system comes from sixth - century China , Poppendieck said . )
Few people consider appraisal and reward systems fair , particularly in the eyes of the receiver .
Our appraisal practices are based on assumptions that are seldom specified or confronted , such as the motivation to improve performance , career and development guidance , a paper trail for corrective action , and a basis for pay and promotion .
Step by step , Poppendieck demonstrated that these goals are rarely ( if ever ) achieved , but the harm they bring is almost certain .
The only way to change behavior is to change the consequence , not the antecedent , she said .
People invest their souls into their job only with positive reinforcement .
When faced with negative reinforcement , people do just enough to avoid the threat .
Conventional appraisal and reward systems often create competition within the team .
The consequences are obvious :
If managerial efforts to create a collaborative environment contradict the company 's appraisal system , team members will always believe what the appraisal system suggests .
Should we be surprised when our incentive systems extinguish collaboration if individuals compete for rewards ?
Incentives cannot solve a systemic problem .
Nor can incentives increase training or skill .
In software development , Poppendieck said , most people think others are motivated by money , but claim they personally are motivated by other factors .
Another assumption built into typical appraisal and reward systems is that an individual 's performance can be reliably and unambiguously assessed .
However , this is true only when performance can be objectively measured and attributed to individuals and when individual jobs have almost no interdependence .
These conditions do not apply to software development .
But then what do we measure , and on what should we base our appraisal systems ?
According to Poppendieck , it is difficult to come up with a good and sustainable system in the software development domain .
Since most systems tend to demotivate people and teams , it is safer to abandon appraisals altogether .
Use other means to motivate people , she said , and to create a high - performance culture .
5. Write Value - Based Vendor Contracts
Another long - standing Agile tenet is " reduce the waste . "
In this context , " waste " is anything that does not bring clearly defined and immediate value .
Today , the Agile movement is knocking on the door of the CFO , offering new approaches to software development vendor contracts .
Jeff Sutherland , one of the Agile movement founders , wants the higher performance demonstrated by Agile teams to be rewarded .
In his talk , " Money for Nothing and Your Change for Free : Agile Contracts , " he reminded us that clients are tired of vendors who promise low - ball prices and then make their money on change requests .
Current practice suggests that vendor and client agree at the start on project overruns .
Sutherland offers a way out for both parties .
His approach is :
Create a project backlog identifying all the features to be developed .
Prioritize the features on business value ( for example , expected ROI ) .
Offer a usual fixed - price contract with time and materials ( T& M ) for changes .
Add a " change for free " clause that allows a client to introduce a change and to remove features from the bottom of the prioritized list .
The overall amount of work ( project size ) would not change ; the vendor assumes the risk of late delivery .
If a client is unwilling to remove the less - important features , the contract reverts to a regular T&M schema for changes .
This approach looks attractive to a client because it permits scope changes .
It also avoids the trap of high cost of changes .
Sutherland also suggested that Agile contracts include a " money for nothing " clause .
A high percentage of developed features are never used .
When a development team releases software in stages , with the highest - priority and best business value features completed first , at some point a client may be satisfied with the partially completed project .
In this case , the client would have the option of terminating the contract at any time , for 20 percent of the remaining contract value .
This allows the client to get back 80 percent of the remaining money without severing the vendor relationship .
Of course , the " money for nothing " clause cannot be applied if the project backlog is not prioritized or if trust between management , the development team and the client is lacking .
Next : Building Agile sustainability in the organization
6. Avoid Building Plank Roads
A movement 's strength can be evaluated based its self - criticism , and several presentations were dedicated to questioning Agile .
For example , in her presentation , " Expanding Agile Horizons : The Five Dimensions of Systems , " Mary Poppendieck raised issues of Agile 's sustainability , using a story about plank roads as an analogy .
About 160 years ago , she explained , the U.S. had a massive boom in plank road construction .
The road construction technology required high capital investment but brought immediate positive result .
However , plank roads deteriorated quickly ; their annual maintenance was 20 to 30 percent of the initial cost .
The approach was eventually abandoned .
Is Agile a sustainable solution , Poppendieck asked , or a plank road ?
It would n't be the first such " silver bullet " offered to the software development community .
High - level languages initially promised to solve what Edgar Dijkstra called a " software crisis " in his famous Turing lecture 50 years ago , but COBOL , Fortran and PL /1 made programmers ' jobs more complex .
Every industry veteran remembers the waves of structured programming , 4GLs , rapid application design , " programming without a programmer " and other solutions to all our problems .
With time , all these " universal " solutions found a much more humble place .
Waterfall was a plank road , said Poppendieck , aimed at solving the process problem by applying project management methods already used in other industries .
But its applicability to software development was dramatically overestimated , and the ramifications of this strategic mistake haunt us to this day .
She cited an article from ACM Software Engineering Notes from April 1982 : " To contend that any life cycle scheme , even with variations , can be applied to all system development is ... to fly in the face of reality . "
Said that article , " System requirements cannot be stated in advance , not even in principle , because the user does n't know them in advance — even in principle . "
The same paper suggested that our development process changes the user 's view of the requirements .
To think that this was said in 1982 !
Poppendieck also suggested additional approaches to provide longevity and sustainability [ PDF ] to system development .
7. Who Do You Trust ?
The presentations given by author Linda Rising were the jewel of the conference .
Deeply philosophical , appealing to both the brain and the heart of the audience , they call for revisiting the foundations of one 's value system .
It ’s very common to hear about violence against women and about male batterers rather than about violence against men and about female batterers .
Like it or not , experts that do not cherry pick their data find a fairly even split when the general public is polled in various ways .
Domestic Violence expert John Hamel , LCSW recently addressed this , with abundant research citations , for a book chapter .
I will provide , with his permission , his annotations .
But why ?
First , derogatory stereotypes are bad in principle .
Second , the stereotypes cause people to downplay or ignore domestic violence and related behaviors by women .
Third , funding for shelters and other services for men who are victims of domestic violence is affected .
Fourth , men may end up as victims of the justice system when it turns against them because of the stereotypes .
Consider these two examples :
A volunteer who presents about male victims was presenting to a police department .
She had 200 law enforcement personnel present .
At the end , she got a police officer to volunteer a call to a shelter , posing as a male victim .
He called a hotline for a battered womens program and asked about services for men , explaining that he was experiencing violence at the hands of a female .
The hotline worker said , “ You should be in jail . ”
The officer restated that he needed help because his wife was violent .
The hotline worker hung up on him .
In a recent article in the San Diego Metro Weekly domestic violence was mentioned in the context of the California Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage , regarding gay divorce .
It says ,
And , if any violence has preceded the divorce discussions and say … the local gendarmerie is called in , our boys are subject to domestic violence laws , which are stickier by far than if they were single and decided to box each other on the ears .
This not only assumes there is no violence in lesbian relationships , and there certainly is , I ’ve seen it , but it also diminishes the seriousness of it by referring to it as boxing the ears .
Hamel ’s Review of Research
Now here is a taste of Hamel ’s review of the data .
Thank you , John !
Straus et al. ( 1980 ) ; Straus & Gelles ( 1990 ) .
Both National Family Violence Surveys , with a combined sample of more than 8,000 respondents , reported comparable gender rates for not only physical assaults , but verbal abuse as well .
Rouse , Breen and Howell ( 1988 ) .
This survey of 130 dating and 130 married students found that women are more likely than men to engage in isolation behaviors , such as “ monitors time , ” “ discourages same - sex friends ” and “ discourages opposite sex friends . ”
Stets ( 1991 ) .
The male and female respondents in this study of dating students reported equivalent rates of controlling behaviors ( e.g. , “ I keep my partner in line , ” “ I am successful in imposing my will onto my partner ” ) , as well as psychological abuse ( e.g. , “ Said mean things , ” “ Degraded him / her ” ) .
Kasian & Painter ( 1992 ) .
The authors surveyed a large sample ( 1,625 ) university students .
Male respondents reported higher rates of received abuse , as measured by a modified version of the Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory , for control , jealousy / isolation , verbal abuse and withdrawal of affection .
There were no gender differences in rates of received emotional abuse ( “ diminishment of self - esteem ” ) .
Feder and Henning ( 2005 ) .
In this study of 317 couples dually arrested for IPV ( interpersonal violence ) , most of them African - American , criminal justice data revealed no differences between the partners in injuries inflicted or weapons use .
Interview data revealed no differences in physical assault ; women were more likely to use a weapon , but to suffer slightly higher rates of injuries ( 19.6 % vs. 15.0 % ) .
There were no gender differences in overall psychological abuse or coercive control tactics .
Stacey , Hazelwood & Shupe ( 1994 ) .
Higher rates of victimization than perpetration were reported by the male subjects in this Texas study of men in batterer treatment on four of the thirteen items from the CSR Abuse Index : “ deny rights to privacy , ” “ deny access to family , ” “ withdraw emotions to punish , ” and “ withhold sex to punish . ”
Although the men reported lower rates of victimization than females on the other items , the differences were usually not large ( e.g. , “ deny freedom of activities ” was cited by 71 % of men and 72 % of women ; “ deny access to friends ” was cited by 57 % of men and 63 % of women , and “ censor phone calls ” was reported by 53 % of men and 60 % of women . )
One would have expected much larger differences from this population , considering that the men had been arrested and deemed “ batterers , ” while their female partners were deemed the “ victims . ”
Tjaden & Thoennes ( 2000 ) .
The National Violence Against Women Survey ( NVAWS ) , drawing on a sample of 16,000 men and women , reported that 0.2 % of men are stalked each year by a current or former intimate , and 0.5 % of women , a ratio of 2.5 women for each man victimized .
In addition , .038 % of the men reported to having been raped the previous year .
Five times as many women ( 0.2 % ) said that this had happened to them .
Spitzberg & Rhea ( 1999 ) .
The authors examined a variety of stalking subtypes , collectively known as obsessive relational intrusion ( ORI ) .
Results from their sample of college students in Texas revealed a 54 % rate of male - perpetrated ORI ’s , versus 46 % for females .
Langhinrichsen -Rohling , Palarea , Cohen & Rohling ( 2000 ) .
In this college survey , respondents were asked to report on their own ORI behavior , as well as incidents of victimization .
There were no overall gender differences in stalking rates .
However , men made more unwanted visits to homes and apartments , whereas women left the greater share of unwanted phone messages .
Women were also four times as likely to report having been physically threatened .
Meloy & Boyd ( 2003 ) .
The authors reported on 82 female cases from mental health clinics and some who came to the attention of law enforcement .
The women were similar to male stalkers in having a history of failed intimate relationships and having cluster “ B ” DSM IV personality disorders ( not antisocial ) .
They were also similar in that 50 % — 75 % threatened and 50 % — 55 % assaulted their victim .
But they were different in that they more often carried out threats and caused property damage .
Busby & Compton ( 1997 ) .
A large survey of 3,034 engaged couples reported that 6.1 % men and 13.0 % women had been sexually pressured by their partner .
O’Sullivan et al. ( 1998 ) .
In this survey of 433 dating university students , 18.5 % of the men and 42.5 % of women reported to having been sexually coerced by their partner .
Muehlenhard & Cook ( 1988 ) .
This college study revealed that men more often than women engaged in unwanted sexual intercourse , at rates of 63 % versus 46 % .
Being taken advantage of when intoxicated was reported by 30.8 % of the men , and 21.0 % of the women .
Among the men , 13.4 % had been verbally coerced , and 11.5 % of the women said that this had happened to them .
The rates were 5.7 % for men subjected to nonviolent coercion ( e.g. , blocking the door , holding the person down ) , compared with 5.4 % for the women .
Coercion involving physical assaults was experienced by 1.4 % of the men and 2.7 % of the women .
Waldner - Haugrud & Magruder ( 1995 ) .
The authors asked a dating population about a range of coercive sexual behaviors .
In the previous year , the men had an average of 2.26 incidents perpetrated upon them , and the women 2.86 .
Persistent touching was reported by 51 % of males and 70 % of females .
Men were twice as likely to report blackmail ( 8.5 % versus 4.2 % ) ; women reported a higher incidence of manipulative guilt ( 30.1 % versus 22.5 % ) .
The women were twice as likely as men to be restrained or detained , and more threatened with physical force ( 6.9 % to 6.0 % ) ; but three times more men had weapons used against th em ( 4.5 % versus 1.4 % ) .
Coker , Davis , Arias , Desai , Sanderson , Brandt & Smith ( 2002 ) .
A re-examination of data of 16,000 respondents from the National Violence Against Women Survey found lifetime male victimization rates of 10.5 % for experienced verbal abuse and jealousy / possessiveness , and 6.8 % for power / control , compared to rates of 5.2 % and 6.9 % for women .
Riggs , O’Leary & Breslin ( 1990 ) .
Found a strong correlation between having a dominant and aggressive personality and IPV for both men and women .
Cano , Avery - Leaf , Cascardi & O’Leary ( 1998 ) .
Found a significant correlation in high school dating study for boys and girls between the use of jealousy and dominance tactics and physical assaults .
Hines & Saudino ( 2003 ) .
Using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale , this survey of 481 university students found comparable levels of physical aggression between the genders .
Women were found to have engaged in higher levels of psychological aggression , and the two types of abuse tended to co-exist .
Graham - Kevan & Archer ( 2005 ) .
Drawing upon a community sample of university students and faculty in Lancashire , England , the authors found rates of 13 % for female intimate terrorists and 9 % for male intimate terrorists , based upon the same criteria as used by Michael Johnson ( a combination of physical violence , control , and psychological abuse ) .
Laroche ( 2005 ) , and Graham - Kevan ( 2007 ) .
Laroche analyzed a massive Canadian study , the 1999 GSS , involving 25,876 respondents .
Respondents were asked about their victimization by a current or previous spouse in the past 5 years .
In addition to questions on physical assaults , the survey also asked respondents about victimization from the following psychologically abusive and controlling behaviors by their partner , similar to those in the Duluth Power and Control Wheel : “ Limits your contact with family or friends , ” “ puts you down or calls you names to make you feel bad , ” “ is jealous and does n’t want you to talk to other men / women , ” “ harms or threatens to harm someone close to you , ” demands to know who you are with and where you are at all times , ” “ damages or destroys your possessions or property , ” and “ prevents you from knowing about or having access to the family income , even if you ask . ”
For the five year period prior to the study , approximately 3 % of the surveyed women , and 2 % of the men , were counted as victims of severe intimate terrorism ( IT ) – defined as having experienced severe and frequent physical violence and high levels of psychological abuse and control , and who would fit Ehrensaft et al . ’s “ clinical abuse cases ” from injuries sustained , fear expressed , and use of police and other services .
Graham - Kevan analyzed the results of the same survey , except that she focused on abuse reported for the past year only , and found very comparable rates of intimate terrorism between the genders .
This is a remarkable finding , considering the study ’s methodology ( akin to the NVAWS in t hat its questionnaire framed IPV in terms of personal safety rather than conflict , thus suppressing male victimization rates ) and “ the inadequate assessment of controlling behaviors suffered by men ” ( Laroche , 2005 , p. 11 ) .
Felson & Outlaw ( 2007 ) .
An analysis of data originally obtained through the NVAWS with a sample of over 15,000 currently married or formerly married adults found that : ( 1 ) women are just as controlling and jealous towards their male partners as other way around ; ( 2 ) the relationship between use of control / jealousy and physical violence exists equally for both male and female respondents ; ( 3 ) “ Intimate terrorists ” can be either male or female .
( Controlling / jealous behaviors defined as : “ Prevents you from knowing about or having access to family income even when you ask ” ; “ Prevents you from working outside the home ” ; “ Insists on knowing who you are with at all times ” ; Insists on changing residences even when you do n’t want or need to ” ; “ Tries to limit your contact with family and friends . ” )
Regarding the extent to which men and women engage in “ intimate terrorism , ” the authors write : “ Both husbands and wives who are controlling are more likely to produce injury and engage in repeated violence .
Similar effects are observed for jealousy , although not all are statistically significant .
The seriousness of the violence is apparently associated with motive , although the relationship does not depend on gender ” ( p. 404 ) .
It should be pointed out that the National Violence Against Women Survey was designed , conducted and analyzed by feminist researchers , who sought to prove that violence against female intimate partners is much more serious than violence against male intimate partners .
Straus ( 2006 ) .
7.6 % of the male respondents and 10.6 % of the female respondents interviewed in the International Dating Violence Survey ( sample of 13,601 university students in 32 countries ) reported having perpetrated severe assaults , and both partners were found to be violent in 68.6 % of the cases .
Based on 9 items related to dominance on the PRP ( e.g. , “ my partner needs to remember that I am in charge ” ) , the survey found overall dominance scores to be equal across gender , although higher dominance scores were found for women in 24 of 32 countries .
It was also found that dominance by either partner increases the probability of severe violence , and that dominance by females increases risk of severe female - only or mutual IPV more than does male dominance .

Introduction
As a system administrator , you run across numerous challenges and problems .
Managing users , disk space , processes , devices , and backups can cause many system administrators to lose their hair , good humor , or sanity .
Shell scripts can help , but they often have frustrating limitations .
This is where a full - featured scripting language , such as Python , can turn a tedious task into an easy and , dare I say it , fun one .
The examples in this article demonstrate different Python features that you can put to practical use .
If you work through them , you ’ll be well on your way to understanding the power of Python .
About modules
A module is an important Python concept .
Basically , a module is a resource you import in order to use it .
This process is comparable to taking a piece of paper out of a file cabinet and putting it on your desk , ready for use .
You import modules using the import command , which appears at the top of each of the example programs .
Modules are available for database connectivity , network programming , operating system services , and hundreds of other useful areas .
Put Python to work
Why Python ?
Python has many features to recommend it :
It ’s free , being open source .
It ’s easy to learn .
Many users find its syntax much more English - like than other scripting languages .
It ’s mature .
Python has been around a long time , which means its code is stable , lots of modules add functionality , and robust documentation is available on the Web .
Python is a full - featured , robust programming language and , as such , it has tons of features .
Learning it could be a task of epic proportions .
However , remember that many Python features , such as the GUI toolkits , are of limited value to system administrators .
That ’s why this article uses specific examples :
They demonstrate the skills you need to effectively write Python scripts to manage systems .
Notes on the examples
Each example includes a try : and an except : with a surrounding block of code .
This is an implementation of rudimentary error handling .
Python has extensive support for handling all types of exceptions but , for the purposes of these example programs , I ’ve kept it simple .
and an with a surrounding block of code .
This is an implementation of rudimentary error handling .
Python has extensive support for handling all types of exceptions but , for the purposes of these example programs , I ’ve kept it simple .
These examples were run on Python 2.5 running on a Linux ® box , but they should work on any UNIX ® / Linux machine .
You ’ll undoubtedly think of ways these scripts can be improved .
This is good !
The nature of Python scripts is that they can be easily modified and customized without needing to recompile code .
Example 1 : Search for files and show permissions in a friendly format
The first example program ( see Listing 1 ) searches for files that match a pattern ( based on user input ) and displays the results to the screen , along with the permissions assigned to the particular files .
At first , you might think this program does n’t do much more than execute a find command ; however , it displays results in a customized way , and your options for displaying this enhanced find are limitless .
The example shows you how to take a system command and make it better ( or at least more customized ) .
The script basically performs three tasks :
Get the search pattern from the user .
Perform the search .
Present the results to the user .
In writing the script , constantly ask yourself this question , “ Which task is this code supporting ? ”
Asking yourself this question can increase the focus of your work and efficiency .
Listing 1 . Search for files and list results with file permissions
import stat , sys , os , string , commands # Getting search pattern from user and assigning it to a list try : #run a ' find ' command and assign results to a variable pattern = raw_input ( " Enter the file pattern to search for :
" ) commandString = " find " + pattern commandOutput = commands.getoutput(commandString ) findResults = string.split(commandOutput , "
" ) #output find results , along with permissions print " Files : " print commandOutput print " ================================ " for file in findResults : mode=stat .
S_IMODE(os.lstat(file ) [stat.ST_MODE ] ) print "
Permissions for file " , file , " : " for level in " USR " , " GRP " , " OTH " : for perm in " R " , " W " , " X " : if mode & getattr ( stat , " S_I " + perm+level ) : print level , " has " , perm , " permission " else : print level , " does NOT have " , perm , " permission " except : print " There was a problem - check the message above " Show more Show more icon
The program follows these steps :
Ask the user for a search pattern ( lines 7 - 9 ) .
Print a listing of files found ( lines 12 - 14 ) .
Using the stat module , get permissions for each file found and display them to the screen ( lines 15 - 23 ) .
When the program is run , the output looks like that shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Output of the first example
$ python example1.py
Enter the file pattern to search for : j*.py FILES FOUND FOR PATTERN j*.py : jim.py jim2.py ================================
Permissions for file jim.py : USR R USR W USR X GRP - GRP - GRP - OTH - OTH - OTH - Permissions for file jim2.py : USR R USR W USR X GRP R GRP - GRP X OTH R OTH - OTH X Show more Show more icon
Example 2 : Perform operations on a tar archive that is based on menu selection
The previous example prompted the user for a search pattern to use .
Another way to get information from the user is through a command - line argument .
The program in Listing 3 shows how to do that in Python :
The code takes a tar filename as a command - line argument and then prompts the user with several options .
This example also shows a new way to attack the problem .
The first example used the command module to run the find command and capture the output .
This approach can be clumsy and is n’t very “ Pythonic . ”
This example uses the tarfile module to open a tar file , which has the advantage of allowing you to use Python attributes and methods as you manipulate the file .
With many modules provided by Python , you can do things that ca n’t be done through the command line .
This is a good example of implementing a menu system in Python .
The program performs different actions based on your selection :
If you press 1 , the program prompts you for the file name in the archive to extract the current directory to and then extracts the file .
If you press 2 , the program prompts you for the file name and then displays the file information .
If you press 3 , the program lists all the files in the archive .
Listing 3 . Perform actions on a tar archive based on your menu selection
import tarfile , sys try : #open tarfile tar = tarfile.open ( sys.argv [ 1 ] , " r:tar " ) # present menu and get selection selection = raw_input ( " Enter
\ 1 to extract a file
\ 2 to display information on a file in the archive
\ 3 to list all the files in the archive
" ) #perform actions based on selection above if selection == " 1 " : filename = raw_input ( " enter the filename to extract : " ) tar.extract ( filename ) elif selection == " 2 " : filename = raw_input ( " enter the filename to inspect : " ) for tarinfo in tar : if tarinfo .
name == filename : print "
\ Filename : \t\t " , tarinfo.name , "
\ Size :\t\t " , tarinfo.size , " bytes
\ elif selection == " 3 " : print tar.list ( verbose=True ) except : print " There was a problem running the program " Show more Show more icon
The program follows these steps :
Open the tar file ( line 5 ) .
Present the menu and get the user selection ( lines 8 - 11 ) .
If you press 1 ( lines 14 - 16 ) , extract a file from the archive .
If you press 2 ( lines 17 - 23 ) , present information about a selected file .
If you press 3 ( lines 24 - 25 ) , present information about all the files in the archive .
The output is shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 .
User menu for second example
$ python example2.py jimstar .tar Enter 1 to extract a file 2 to display information on a file in the archive 3 to list all the files in the archive Show more Show more icon
Example 3 : Check for a running process and show information in a friendly format
One of the most important duties of a system administrator is checking on running processes .
The script in Listing 5 gives you some ideas .
The program takes advantage of UNIX ’s ability to run a grep command on output generated by a command , which lets you automatically narrow the data Python has to parse .
This program also uses the string module .
Get to know this module — you ’ll use it often .
Listing 5 . Display information on a running process in a friendly format
import commands , os , string program = raw_input ( " Enter the name of the program to check : " ) try : #perform a ps command and assign results to a list output = commands.
getoutput ( " ps - f|grep " + program ) proginfo = string.split( output ) # display results print "
\ Full path : \t\t " , proginf o [ 5 ] , "
\ Owner :\t\t\t " , proginfo [ 0 ] , "
\ Process ID : \t\t " , proginf o [ 1 ] , "
\ Parent process ID : \t " , proginf o [ 2 ] , "
\ Time started : \t\t " , proginf o [ 4 ] except : print " There was a problem with the program . "
Show more Show more icon
The program follows these steps :
Get the name of a process to check and assign it to a variable ( line 3 ) .
Run the ps command and assign the results to a list ( lines 7 - 8 ) .
Display detailed information about the process with English terms ( lines 11 - 16 ) .
The output is shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . Output of the third example
$ python example3.py
Enter the name of the program to check : xterm Full path : /usr / bin/xterm Owner : knowltoj Process ID : 3220 Parent process ID : 4308 Time started : 16:51:46 Show more

Example 4 : Check userids and passwords for policy compliance
Managing security is a critical part of the job for any system administrator .
Python makes this job easier , as the last example illustrates .
The program in Listing 7 uses the pwd module to access the password database .
It checks userids and passwords for security policy compliance ( in this case , that userids are at least six characters long and passwords are at least eight characters long ) .
There are two caveats :
This program works only if you have full rights to /etc / passwd .
If you use shadow passwords , this script wo n’t work ( however , Python 2.5 does have a spwd module that does the job ) .
Listing 7 .
Check userids and passwords for compliance with security policy
import pwd #initialize counters erroruser = [ ] errorpass = [ ] # get password database passwd_db = pwd.getpwall ( ) try : # check each user and password for validity for entry in passwd_db : username = entry [ 0 ] password = entry [ 1 ] if len( username ) < 6 : erroruser.append( username ) if len ( password ) < 8 : errorpass.append( username ) # print results to screen print " The following users have an invalid userid ( less than six characters ) : " for item in erroruser : print item print "
The following users have invalid password ( less than eight characters ) : " for item in errorpass : print item except : print " There was a problem running the script . "
Show more Show more icon
The program follows these steps :
Initialize the counter lists ( lines 4 - 5 ) .
Open the password database and assign data to a list ( line 8 ) .
Check users and passwords for validity ( lines 12 - 18 ) .
Output invalid users and passwords ( lines 21 - 26 ) .
The output is shown in Listing 8 .
Listing 8 . Output of the fourth example
$ python example4.py
The following users have an invalid userid ( less than six characters ) : Guest The following users have invalid password ( less than eight characters ) :

Other uses for scripts
You can use Python in a number of ways to manage systems .
One of the best things you can do is analyze your work , determine which tasks you perform repeatedly , and explore whether Python modules are available to help you with those tasks — almost certainly they are .
Some specific areas where Python can be of great help are as follows :
Managing servers : Checks patch levels for a particular application across a set of servers and updates them automatically .
Checks patch levels for a particular application across a set of servers and updates them automatically .
Logging : Sends an e-mail automatically if a particular type of error shows up in the syslog .

Testing Web applications :
Uses freely available tools to emulate a Web browser and verifies Web application functionality and performance .
These are just a few examples —
I ’m sure you can add useful ideas of your own .
Summary
With its easy - to - learn language ; its ability to handle files , processes , strings , and numbers ; and its almost endless array of helper modules , Python is a scripting language that looks like it was made for system administrators .
It ’s a valuable tool for any system administrator ’s toolbox .

東京・神奈川の私立中学入試が始まるなど、本格的な受験シーズンを迎えているが、受験生の間では「受験にウカール」などゲン担ぎの食べ物が大はやりだ。カツカレーもその一つ。しかしカレーは単なるゲン担ぎだけではないようだ。カレーを食べると脳が活性化して、集中力や計算力がアップする、という研究結果が出てきている。
カレーを食べると脳内血流が約4％増加する
「 カレーは体を温めるので、冷え性の人にもいい」と丁宗鐵医師は語る
「カレーは体を温めるので、冷え性の人にもいい」と丁宗鐵医師は語る
「 カレーを食べると頭が良くなるんです 」
こう語るのは、日本薬科大学教授で、東京・日本橋でクリニックを開業する丁宗鐵医師だ。丁医師は、東京大学助教授の頃からスパイスに注目してきた東洋医学の専門家で、現在まで100名近い治験者のデータを収集し、カレーが脳に及ぼす作用について研究を続けている。その丁医師は、カレーと漢方薬の共通点を「カレーのスパイスと漢方の生薬は同じものが多く、さまざまなスパイスや生薬を組み合わせて使う点も似ている」と語る。
丁医師がカレーの威力を研究した結果、カレーを食べると脳内の血流量が増加して、集中力や計算力があがることが分かったという。また、健常者を対象に行った実験では、カレーを摂取すると脳内の血流が2～4％増えることが確認された。
脳内の血流量が増加することで、脳の働きがよくなる。実際、丁医師がカレーを食べた人の脳波を調べたところ、脳の中の「情報処理」を担当する部分の働きが活発になることが確かめられた。つまりカレーを食べると、集中力や計算力がアップすることが期待できる、というわけだ。
この 「脳内活性化」を引き起こすのは、カレーのスパイス。
「カレーのスパイスにはさまざまな種類があり、市販のカレールウでも15～30種類のスパイスが使われています。脳を活性化するのは、そのうちの数種類。たとえば、漢方では『小豆蒄（ショウズク）』と呼ばれるカルダモンはその代表的なスパイスです」
と丁医師は語る。市販のルウにも十分含まれているため、家庭で作るカレーでも受験生の「味方」になってくれるそうだ。
An Austrian man has been arrested on suspicion of burning his in - laws to death with a home - made flame - thrower .
Police said the 48 - year - old used a propane gas container to torch the elderly couple as they lay in bed in the village of St Magdalena am Lemberg .
The bed - ridden woman , who had lost both her legs to diabetes , died where she lay but her husband was found in the garden having tried to escape .
Police said the suspect 's wife was in the house but escaped through a window .
The suspect fled the scene but was found later having stabbed himself in the stomach , said police .
Chief investigator Anton Kiesl said the man was being kept in hospital in an induced coma .
The suspect 's motives were not immediately clear .
Resident Hack
by George Dienhart
My congressman , Lynn Westmorland released the following statement in regards to the bailout .
“ As the financial crisis has unfolded over the past year , we ’ve slowly watched the dominos drop one after another and we ’ve seen one bailout after another , ” Westmoreland said .
“ Each time we were told : ‘ This bailout is going to fix the problem . ’
We ’ve already spent hundreds of billions of dollars that our government does not have and yet the problems continue to deepen .
I ’ve read all the documents and listened to the experts and no one can say – not even with nearly $ 1 trillion on the line – that this will work .
“ Undoubtedly , this is one of the toughest votes that I ’ve taken in Congress .
When faced with a tough decision , I rely on my principles – that smaller government is better and that markets work better bureaucratic decisions .
While this bailout may work in the short term , I ’m concerned greatly about the long - term consequences .
When government willingly steps in to rescue people from risky behavior , government creates an incentive for future risky behavior .
When businesses accept greater regulation in order to receive a bailout , we enlarge government , distort markets and render capitalism less efficient .
“ I do believe that our nation faces great financial challenges right now , and I believe that Congress should act .
But the House should not appropriate up to $ 700 billion for a bill that did n’t exist until a few days ago and that never went through one committee hearing .
This legislation costs way too much to pass through Congress with so little scrutiny .
If the process is broken , the product is flawed .
Combined with war costs , other bailouts and the stimulus packages , we ca n’t afford to be wrong with a price tag this high .
“ I have supported an alternative plan that would lower taxes and regulations to create an incentive for private money , foreign and domestic , to flow back into the credit markets .
Unfortunately , alternative versions were shut out of this closed process . ”
Congressman Westmorland made a vary important statement - " alternative versions were shut out of this closed process " .
In other words , the house GOP was shut out of the process .
Aside from John McCain , no one saw this backlash coming .
McCain rightly predicted that Pelosi and Reid needed to get the GOP members of the house onboard this legislation in order for it to pass .
What Pelosi and Reid did n't seen to understand is people generally want to have a voice in the process .
This allows people to feel as though they are onboard .
This clearly did not happen .
Below the fold , a reprint of Stoneleigh 's excellent primer on the credit crisis .
Right about now is when it starts to impact the energy world .
This is a post run just over a year ago , by emeritus TOD contributor Stoneleigh .
It was instructive as much as it was prescient so I wanted to give its author a public hat tip .
Both Stoneleigh and her writing partner Ilargi at The Automatic Earth have had a consistently , and unabashedly phenomenal call with respects to the financial and debt crisis .
It is certainly not over , but we now begin to see the impacts that a financial crisis may have on future energy supplies - it 's like losing the battle as well as the war .
Still , the quickness of the deterioration in the economy may be a blessing in disguise - more resources left in ground for some better planned use .
We have been living in inflationary times , for as long as most of us can remember .
The money supply keeps expanding and prices increase over time as a result .
Central bankers have many tools at their disposal which they can use to tweak the economy - –they can raise or lower interest rates , can control reserve requirements for fractional reserve banking and can inject liquidity into the banking system , among other things – and we have become used to thinking that they can prevent the kind of ' economic accidents ' that previous episodes of excess have led to in the past .
Especially in recent years - –since the apparently successful containment of the dot com aftermath -- we have acted as if risk were a thing of the past .
Sliced , diced and spread around Wall Street and the rest of the global financial system , risk has seemed tamed , contained and controlled , until last week that is .
For years , industry insiders and so - called experts have proclaimed the virtues of slicing , dicing , and repackaging risk .
They waxed on about how borrowers and savers , and society as a whole , could only benefit from such machinations .
They suggested any sort of exposure could be disbursed and dissipated to the point where it essentially disappeared .
Some even claimed that the crises of the past would no longer exist .
Yet amid the hype and assurances , few supporters spoke of the dark side of wanton and widespread risk - shifting .
They did n’t seem — or want — to acknowledge that by combining complicated risks in unfamiliar and unnatural ways , the end result could be an uncontrollable monstrosity — one that eventually turned on its masters .
Nor did they heed the notion that by scattering risk into every nook and cranny of the global financial system , the vast web of overlapping linkages virtually guaranteed that serious problems in one sector , market , or country would trigger far - reaching shockwaves .
All of a sudden , markets are reeling around the world , deals are unraveling , the mainstream press is talking about a credit crunch and the world ’s central bankers are injecting unprecedented amounts of liquidity to calm the markets .
Risk has made a comeback , and in that environment the evident concern of the central bankers does not seem very reassuring .
The Dot Com Crash and Money Dropped From Helicopters
As the dot com boom morphed into the dot com bust ( threatening to become a full - blown meltdown by the end of 2002 ) central bankers cut interest rates drastically and held them down for a long period of time .
In 2001 , the US Federal Reserve Bank , the spigot of credit in America ’s debt - based economy , drastically slashed its interest rates 84 % , from 6.5 % in 2001 down to 1 % in 2002 .
The Fed did so because the collapse of the dot.com bubble in 2000 had so damaged US financial markets ( the NASDAQ fell by 80 % ) the Fed feared a depression could result .
As Ben Bernanke was preparing to take over from Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve , he promised to drop money from helicopters if necessary to prevent deflation .
Having spent his academic career studying the causes of the Great Depression , Bernanke understood the danger of deflation and was determined to avoid the liquidity trap by maintaining the demand for credit .
As good as his word , Bernanke , and Greenspan before him , oversaw a doubling of the money supply since 2000 .
Adjusted for changes in the money supply ( inflation ) , real interest rates ( the nominal rate minus inflation ) were negative for several years .
Instead of dropping money from helicopters , Bernanke dropped free debt .
Real Interest Rates ( Nominal Rate Minus Inflation )
The key in all of this is not inflation , as most believe .
The Fed says they are most worried about inflation risks , but the reality is that they are most worried about deflation risks .
Always .
Always deflation .
The Fed has no choice but to always remind us that the risks are tilted toward inflation , just as the Treasury Secretary , whichever one happens to be in office at the time , must always say that the U.S. maintains a strong dollar policy , even if monetary policy and fiscal policy are conspiring to devalue the dollar .
Fractional Reserve Banking and the Expansion of the Money Supply
Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend into existence money they do not have ( on the assumption that their depositors will not all want their money back at once ) , provided that they keep a certain percentage of their deposit base with the Federal Reserve to cover withdrawls .
Ten percent would once have been a typical figure , but since the 1990s , the Fed has deliberately shepherded reserve requirements down , essentially to zero , through dropping required reserve percentages , reducing the categories of funds needing a reserve and allowing funds to be swept from a reservable category to a non-reservable category overnight ( using sweep accounts ) .
As reserve requirements have fallen , banks have been able to expand the money supply far more rapidly than would previously have been the case , at the cost of removing the cushion they previously held as insurance against financial accidents .
As with everything else , the resilience has been stripped from the system in the name of efficiency , in this case in the use of capital to generate maximum returns .
The Housing Bubble and the Debt Mountain
The combination of drastically reduced reserve requirements and negative real interest rates predictably led to a borrowing binge of epic proportions , increasing what was already a dangerous level of indebtedness .
Many of those whose fingers had recently been burned in the stock market turned to real estate , and , by extension , all of the supporting industries surrounding it .
People moved to larger properties , bought investment properties , renovated , upgraded and re-equipped .
The surge in demand , and depreciation of the currency through rapid expansion of the money supply , led to a huge increase in property prices .
This enabled owners to use their appreciating properties as ATMs , at first using the windfall for luxuries , but increasingly relying on it to fund basic living expenses through refinancing .
This created both a debt mountain and a structural vulnerability to a fall in property prices .
Banks offered credit to those further and further down the credit - worthiness scale , with scant regard to the ability of those borrowers to repay their loans .
Instead of holding debt on their own books as they would once have done , banks now make their money from fees and sell the loans on to investors as mortgage - backed securities .
As they no longer bear the risk of default , they are unconcerned about it .
They often asked for little or no information from prospective borrowers – often no proof of income , employment or even identity - leading to the label of ‘ liar ’s loans ’ .
With rates so low , borrowers were far more concerned with the level of monthly payments than with the balance outstanding .
Exploiting this blinkeredness , banks offered a range of loans called neg am ARMs – adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization .
Borrowers were offered low ‘ teaser ’ rates for the first few years , paying less than the interest owed on their loan during that time , while the unpaid interest was added to the principle in the meantime .
Often they signed the loan documents without understanding the concept of teaser rates .
At the end of the teaser period , the full monthly interest payment would be due on the now larger principle at the new prevailing interest rate .
As interest rates have increased recently , monthly payments on resetting ARMs are often set to more than double .
In October of this year , $ 50 billion dollars worth of ARMs will reset , with a further $ 30 billion a month doing the same for over another year .
Marginal borrowers , who were often already only barely affording their existing payments , are highly unlikely to be able to afford the new ones .
Their only recourse would be to sell , but falling prices have made this difficult .
Some are already in negative equity – owing more on their home than its current market value .
Foreclosure lies ahead for many , but mass foreclosure sales will depress property prices , exacerbating the debt problem for a wider range of borrowers .
Even many quite high - income families have been enticed into a lifestyle their income could not support , and could find that falling property prices push them over the edge .
As sales will be very challenging , and bankruptcy laws have been tightened , many people could be tethered to unpayable debts for a prolonged period .
Financial Engineering – Hedge Funds , Derivatives , Leverage and the Repackaging of Risk
[ In December 2006 ] , another bit of news reached us : the derivatives market , in which hedge funds tend to speculate , has reached a face value of $ 480 trillion … 30 times the size of the U.S. economy … and 12 times the size of the entire world economy .
Trading in derivatives has become not merely a huge boom or even a large bubble - but the mother of a whole tribe of bubbles … dripping little big bubbles throughout the entire financial sector .
The ability to expand the money supply almost infinitely has been seized on by financial engineers interested in finding new and tempting ways to dress up leverage - seemingly eliminating risk while actually making it endemic through the financial system .
The resulting derivatives have been called ‘ financial weapons of mass destruction ’ by Warren Buffet .
In order to sell mortgage - backed securities to investors , banks packaged them into different risk tranches of Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) – investment , mezzanine and equity - concentrating the lowest risk elements in funds able to earn an investment grade rating .
In order to sell the higher risk tranches , banks commonly set up hedge funds with enough seed capital to sell the securities to themselves .
As housing prices rose , the securities appeared less risky , and so were able to attract outside investment and to be leveraged by being used as collateral for further loans .
High performing funds , during the era of rising house prices , were tremendous engines of credit expansion .
Alternatively , equity and mezzanine tranches were often sold to large institutional investors , such as pension funds , willing to unwittingly accept illiquid securities with fictional marked - to - model valuations ultimately based on the ‘ documentation ’ provided with liar ’s loans .
These investors were chasing yield without realizing that they were chasing risk .
The practice was colourfully referred to by insiders as ‘ landfilling toxic waste ’ .
Rather than selling the risky securities , banks could also keep them , and the cash flows they generate , but insure them against default through a Credit Default Swap ( CDS ) – swapping the risk of default for a cash payment .
The underwriting institution can then aggregate the CDS income stream into pools , themselves divided into tranches with different risk profiles .
These synthetic CDOs are based , not on cash flows derived from borrowing money , but on cash flows derived from insurance premiums paid to cover the risk of mortgage default .
Institutions can even insure against the risk of default on securities they do not own – creating synthetic CDOs and effectively shorting subprime mortgages or risky corporate bonds while once again hugely expanding supply of leveraged credit .
Any default could therefore result in claims to underwriters many times as large as the supposed value of the underlying securities .
The danger is that underwriting institutions willing to accept huge amounts of risk in exchange for apparently being paid to do nothing , may not actually have the ability to pay out on default .
The original institutions did not seem to ask too many questions of those to whom they had readily assigned the risk of default , but risk does not go away merely because one institution has paid a fee to another .
The risk guarantee is only as good as the credit worthiness of the guarantor , and one commentator has described many credit default swaps as being guaranteed by Madame Merriweather ’s Mud Hut in Malaysia .
International banking rules say that banks have to hold a certain level of spare funds ( or reserves ) to protect themselves from the danger that their loans might turn bad .
However , since the banks had sold the risk of default on to somebody else , they could now argue that they did not need to hold these funds .
To anybody outside the world of finance , this might look odd ( after all , the banks were still making loans ) ; but the regulators accepted this argument , since the risk had moved , in accounting terms .
And that let the banks free up funds to make even more loans .
It was the financial equivalent of calorie - free chocolate : almost too good to be true .
Conflict of Interest - The Role of the Ratings Agencies
The ratings agencies that grade securities for investment purposes , and also depend on doing business with the same institutions whose bonds they rate , gave high ratings to mortgage - backed securities and did not lower them even as the housing bubble began to deflate .
As the securities were not actively traded in a liquid market , the nominal marked - to - model valuations remained constant , and so did the ratings until recently .
The danger is that lowering ratings below investment grade would force many institutions to sell them , potentially forcing those ‘ assets ’ to be marked - to - market where real bids , or the lack of them , would result in real market valuations .
That would revalue a whole asset class at a stroke – revealing that the Emperor had no clothes .
It was a responsibility that ratings agencies were unwilling to take until forced by Bear Stearns ’ declaration that two of its hedge funds were essentially worthless .
A small percentage of mortgage - backed securities funds have since been down - rated and more have been placed on watch , but as yet there has been no real price discovery .
Many investors are currently locked into hedge funds , delaying asset sales , but financial institutions can only maintain their solidarity for so long before they will have to act to extract what value they can from their collateral , even if that amounts to only pennies on the dollar .
Ratings are likely to be downgraded only when they absolutely have to be .
Ratings agencies have made it clear that rating securities does not mean that they do due diligence .
Moody's : " Moody 's has no obligation to perform , and does not perform , due diligence . "
S&P : “ Any user of the information contained herein should not rely on any credit rating or other opinion contained herein in making any investment decision . ”
What then is the purpose of a ratings agency ?
Private Equity and Leveraged Buyouts
As the housing market was beginning to decline in late 2006 , the market for private equity deals , or leveraged buyouts , was taking up the slack and feeding the credit expansion boom .
Private equity was able to use a small amount to borrow huge sums of credit in order to take large companies private , with the underwriting banks able to sell the resulting securities to investors .
The target companies were then often asset stripped , loaded up with debt and sold back to the public in a private equity ‘ strip and flip ’ .
In this way , private equity was able to play off the public markets , extracting real value through the use of cheap credit loaned into existence for the purpose .
Many of these huge deals are now threatened , as investors are no longer willing to purchase the securities generated , leaving the underwriting banks holding the risk .
Bridging loans are becoming ‘ pier loans ’ as they no longer lead anywhere .
The Inverted Pyramid - Money versus Credit ( or Hyperinflation versus Hyperexpansion )
Money and credit are not the same thing , although people currently use them interchangeably .
Money is a physical commodity , while credit is virtual wealth borrowed into existence .
Money can be subject to inflation , either by printing currency or by debasing specie ( reducing the precious metal content of coins ) , but does not disappear .
Credit , on the other hand , can expand dramatically through financial alchemy , but has no physical existence , although its effects are certainly tangible .
Because credit is used as a money substitute in the financial markets , it acts as an inflationary force in the asset markets ( and this spills over into the real world as the imaginary wealth thus created leads to overconsumption and malinvestments ) , but it is all ephemeral - in the end , it is still credit , not money .
As soon as money is needed in lieu of credit , such as has now happened in the CMO and CDO markets , it becomes clear that the money simply is n't there . "
Weimar Germany or present day Zimbabwe are examples of hyperinflation , but the Roaring Twenties and our situation are instead examples of credit hyperexpansion .
Inflation is a chronic scourge , but credit expansions are self - limiting – they proceed until the debt that creates them can no longer be serviced , at which point that debt implodes in a sea of margin calls .
There is actually very little real cash out there relative to credit .
The " sudden demand for cash " is in fact the world 's biggest margin call to date .
The value of credit is only as good as the promise that stands behind it , and when that promise cannot be kept , value abruptly disappears .
Let 's suppose that a lender starts with a million dollars and the borrower starts with zero .
Upon extending the loan , the borrower possesses the million dollars , yet the lender feels that he still owns the million dollars that he lent out .
If anyone asks the lender what he is worth , he says , " a million dollars , " and shows the note to prove it .
Because of this conviction , there is , in the minds of the debtor and the creditor combined , two million dollars worth of value where before there was only one .
When the lender calls in the debt and the borrower pays it , he gets back his million dollars .
If the borrower can't pay it , the value of the note goes to zero .
Either way , the extra value disappears .
If the original lender sold his note for cash , then someone else down the line loses .
In an actively traded bond market , the result of a sudden default is like a game of " hot potato " : whoever holds it last loses .
When the volume of credit is large , investors can perceive vast sums of money and value where in fact there are only repayment contracts , which are financial assets dependent upon consensus valuation and the ability of debtors to pay .
IOUs can be issued indefinitely , but they have value only as long as their debtors can live up to them and only to the extent that people believe that they will .
Essentially , the gargantuan edifice of leveraged debt that has been accumulated during the years of credit expansion can be described as an inverted pyramid .
Its point rests squarely on those at the bottom – for instance the subprime mortgage holders who ’s relatively modest debts have been leveraged into trillions of dollars worth of derivatives .
Each dollar of subprime mortgage debt probably underpins at least a hundred dollars of additional debt , and these loans will go into default en masse once the ARMs begin to reset in earnest .
The leverage that has magnified gains on the way up , will magnify losses in a debt implosion on the way down .
Until now , his debt was an asset of the fund , and was being used as collateral against loans ten times its value .
But the moment that Mr. Jones gave up on the idea of home ownership , the value of his mortgage simply disappeared .
The paper asset , which derived its value from Mr. Jones ’s promise , was destroyed .
This had a cascading effect , since Mr. Jones ’s mortgage was being used as collateral to borrow money to buy even more subprime mortgages , many of which were also defaulting .
Assets purchased on borrowed money were now worthless .
Only the debts remained , and suddenly there was more debt than the original amount that investors had put into the fund .
These original funds would be needed repay the debts incurred by the fund .
Nothing is left to return to investors .
Liquidity Traps and the Mood of the Market
Central bankers act as midwives for credit expansion – manipulating the cost of credit in order to encourage borrowing and lending .
However , this cannot continue indefinitely as it does not occur in a vacuum .
Central bankers have a range of options open to them , but ultimately the financial circumstances , and the mindsets , of both borrowers and lenders are important to whether or not credit expansion can be maintained .
The Fed really only can do two things .
They can lower margin requirements for banks , the amount of capital they have to hold to make loans .
That it has already driven to basically zero .
So the Fed cannot allow banks any more “ leeway ” than it already has .
They can also perform open market money operations like REPOS and coupon passes .
The Fed calls up big banks and buys their government bonds out of their portfolio .
But they do n’t buy them with real money ; they buy them with credit newly created just for that purpose .
The big bank can then lend that credit out in a much greater amount because the Fed only requires them to keep a small fraction of that credit to support whatever the bank wants to lend out .
This is our wonderful fractional reserve system .
If everyone went to the bank to get their “ savings ” at once they would find that they could get out less than 1 % .
But here is the key .
The bank must ultimately be willing to lend it and then find some investor to borrow it .
This has been no problem whatsoever over the last several years .
Now most investors realize that they have too much debt , that their level of income cannot support it .
Banks realize this too and have increased their lending requirements .
The last borrower is always the most aggressive speculator .
So most market participants are now looking for ways to pay back debt ( deflation ) just when the Fed is desperate to get investors to borrow more ( inflation ) .
This conundrum is a form of liquidity trap - a shortfall in demand for credit that the policy tools of central bankers have great difficulty influencing .
Keynes referred to this type of scenario as “ pushing on a piece of string ” .
We are still in the early stages of this credit crunch and as yet , the Fed has not employed all the tools at its disposal .
Most notably , it has not yet cut interest rates , likely due to recent Chinese threats to dump the dollar .
As the dollar should benefit from a flight to quality as credit spreads ( the risk premium over treasuries ) widen , there should be scope to cut interest rates later in the year .
It is likely , however , that this will be less effective than the Fed would hope .
The theory is flawed .
Central banks promising new credit to strapped banks only helps them with their current problems .
It will not get new credit into a system that can't take anymore .
Banks , given their situation , are reducing drastically their new commitments , as they should .
Borrowers can't afford to borrow more .
The continuation of the credit expansion will remain dependent on a supply of ready , willing and able borrowers and lenders , and those already appear to be in short supply .
A trend of credit expansion has two components : the general willingness to lend and borrow and the general ability of borrowers to pay interest and principal .
These components depend respectively upon ( 1 ) the trend of people 's confidence , i.e. , whether both creditors and debtors think that debtors will be able to pay , and ( 2 ) the trend of production , which makes it either easier or harder in actuality for debtors to pay .
So as long as confidence and productivity increase , the supply of credit tends to expand .
The expansion of credit ends when the desire or ability to sustain the trend can no longer be maintained .
As confidence and productivity decrease , the supply of credit contracts .
A significant headwind faced by the central bankers is the dramatic change in the mood of the market in recent weeks .
It is said that humans have only two modes - complacency and panic , and markets , being a human construct , are no exception .
The current mood of the market is one of fear , and if fear becomes panic , it can remove liquidity from the market far faster than even a central banker can pump it in .
Actual cash is in short supply , and the many investors are afraid that the game of musical chairs will end before they can grab one of the very few chairs .
If they do manage to find a chair , it will be difficult to convince them to part with it , no matter what the inducement .
Risk has made a definitive comeback .
Deflation and the Mother of All Margin Calls
A credit expansion cannot be sustained indefinitely .
At some point the burden of debt begins to stifle the ability to produce .
The debt industry can take on a parasitic life of it ’s own , becoming an integral part of the culture , from the level of the individual , as documented by James Scurlock in Maxed Out , to the level of corporations and government .
The attention paid to assessing credit ratings , monitoring credit activity , hounding defaulters , writing off bad debt , juggling minimum payments , thinking of creative ways to exploit leverage , and encouraging every last entity to take on more debt in order that predatory lenders might wring out every last penny of profit , is attention not paid to productive activities of the kind that build successful economies .
Eventually , it requires so much energy to maintain that economic performance suffers and extracting sufficient profit to cover interest payments on ever - increasing credit balances becomes impossible .
A mood of conservation eventually takes hold , replacing the expansionary fervour , and reducing the velocity of money .
When the burden becomes too great for the economy to support and the trend reverses , reductions in lending , spending and production cause debtors to earn less money with which to pay off their debts , so defaults rise .
Default and fear of default exacerbate the new trend in psychology , which in turn causes creditors to reduce lending further .
A downward " spiral " begins , feeding on pessimism just as the previous boom fed on optimism .
The resulting cascade of debt liquidation is a deflationary crash .
Debts are retired by paying them off , " restructuring " or default .
In the first case , no value is lost ; in the second , some value ; in the third , all value .
In desperately trying to raise cash to pay off loans , borrowers bring all kinds of assets to market , including stocks , bonds , commodities and real estate , causing their prices to plummet .
The process ends only after the supply of credit falls to a level at which it is collateralized acceptably to the surviving creditors .
In such an environment , financial values can disappear very quickly , leaving behind only stranded debt .
All it takes for an asset class to be devalued is for as few as two parties among many to agree to a new lower price .
The remainder need do nothing , other than refrain from disputing the new valuation , for their net worth to fall .
In this way , a few discounted house sales can bring down the value of a neighbourhood , and that lost value , which may have been underpinning a hundred times its worth in leveraged debt , is magnified through the inverted debt pyramid .
The majority who do nothing end up watching the investment value of their assets plummet , while the owners of debt attempt to call in whatever value they can , from wherever they can , through margin calls .
The United States faces a severe credit crunch as mounting losses on risky forms of debt catch up with the banks and force them to curb lending and call in existing loans , according to a report by Lombard Street Research .
" Excess liquidity in the global system will be slashed , " it said .
" Banks ' capital is about to be decimated , which will require calling in a swathe of loans .
This is going to aggravate the US hard landing . "
( CNN ) -- Presidential hopeful Barack Obama turned up the heat on rival John McCain Wednesday , when it was announced that a 30 - minute long campaign ad will go out on prime time television in the United States .
Sen . Barack Obama hits prime time Wednesday night with a 30 - minute ad buy .
It 's the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought a peak time slot to make his closing argument .
The half - hour ad will run on NBC , CBS , Fox and Univision .
However CNN declined the Obama campaign 's request to air the ad .
The network said it did not want to pre-empt its programming lineup with a 30 - minute paid commercial program .
Talks betwen the Obama team and ABC fell apart , with a source familiar with ABC policy suggesting the network had offered a different time slot .
However Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said ABC had ultimately offered Obama the slot he wanted , but the campaign turned it down .
" By the time they agreed we had already committed our resources , " Burton said .
The television ad , which is estimated to have cost about $ 5 million , will include a live segment from Florida -- a key battleground state -- with voters discussing their problems and Obama laying out his plans for the country .
Watch more on the final stretch »
Obama 's closing effort also includes an appearance on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show " and a late - night rally in Kissimmee with former President Bill Clinton .
Joe Biden , Obama 's running mate , also will be in Florida for an event in Jupiter .
Obama has outspent rival McCain by a huge margin , according to CNN 's consultant on ad spending .
Between the time the two candidates clinched their party 's nominations in the spring and October 25 , Obama spent more than $ 205 million on TV ads .
McCain spent more than $ 119 million , according to TNS Media Intelligence / Campaign Media Analysis Group .
Meanwhile , the McCain campaign launched an ad Wednesday attacking Obama for his 30 - minute special , saying : " Behind the fancy speeches , grand promises and TV special , lies the truth : With crises at home and abroad , Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs . "
The Republican National Committee also blasted the timing of the ad , which pushed back the start of a World Series baseball game .
" It 's unfortunate that the World Series ' first pitch is being delayed for Obama 's political pitch .
Not only is Obama putting politics before principle , he 's putting it before our national pastime , " RNC spokesman Alex Conant said .
" To accommodate a half - hour Obama time buy on Fox on October 29 , Major League Baseball ... agreed to move the start time of Game 6 by about 15 minutes , " a Fox spokesman said .
Wednesday night 's game is in fact Game 5 , due to a rain delay .
MLB 's willingness to delay the fall classic for a political ad shows how very unusual the Obama TV spot is .
" Ross Perot did it in 1992 , but it was n't this close to Election Day , and now you have a very different media consumption environment .
You did n't have the cable then , " CMAG 's Tracey said .
" There is no precedent for this sort of an ad this late in the race . "
Nationally , Obama holds a lead of 8 percentage points over McCain , 51 percent to 43 percent , according to CNN 's poll of polls .

All About U.S. Presidential Election • Sarah Palin • Joseph Biden
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Bring your partner , grab a seat , pick up your baby catalog and start choosing .
Would you be comfortable selecting what cosmetic features you want your baby to have ?
Will you go for the brown hair or blond ?
Would you prefer tall or short ?
Funny or clever ?
Girl or boy ?
And do you want them to be a muscle - bound sports hero ?
Or a slender and intelligent book worm ?
When you 're done selecting , head to the counter and it's time to start creating your new child .
Does this sound like a scary thought ?
With rapid advances in scientific knowledge of the human genome and our increasing ability to modify and change genes , this scenario of " designing " your baby could well be possible in the near future .
Techniques of genetic screening are already being used -- whereby embryos can be selected by sex and checked for certain disease - bearing genes .
This can lead to either the termination of a pregnancy , or if analyzed at a pre-implantation stage when using In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) , can enable the pregnancy to be created using only non-disease bearing genes .
British scientists last week developed a " genetic MoT " test , which offers a universal method of screening embryos for diseases using a new technique of karyomapping , which is more efficient than previous processes .
The test would be taken on a two - day - old IVF embryo and is yet to be validated , but it could mark a significant change ; allowing doctors to screen for gene combinations that create higher risks of diabetes , heart disease or cancer .
Experts estimate the test , if licensed by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority , could be available for around $ 3000 .
In the future we may also be able to " cure " genetic diseases in embryos by replacing faulty sections of DNA with healthy DNA , in a process called germ line therapy .
This has been performed on animal embryos but is currently illegal for humans .
Furthermore , the developing technologies of genetic alteration open up a whole new set of possibilities -- which could result in so - called " designer babies . "
The technique -- known as inheritable genetic modification -- modifies genes in eggs , sperm or early embryos and results in the altered genes being passed on to future generations .
Should parents be allowed to create their babies ?
This could potentially irreversibly alter the human species .
So , the obvious question arises : should we be doing this ?
Some countries have made genetic screening or alteration illegal by law , and the ethical questions surrounding the uses of the technology are vast -- creating a palpable tension over the subject .
In September , Internet giants Google and Microsoft withdrew adverts for sex selection products and other services considered illegal in India when they were threatened with legal action .
The Center for Genetics and Society is trying to encourage debate on the topic -- as soon as possible .
Executive director of the organization , Richard Hayes , told CNN that the general public of most countries was missing out on taking part in the debate .
" The debate has taken place amongst scientists and science journalists , but average people feel overwhelmed with the technical detail .
They feel disempowered . "
Hayes said his organization supported the use of embryo screening to help prevent the passing on of serious diseases and disorders like Cystic Fibrosis , but is wary of other technologies and how genetic screening and alteration can be misused .
" We support the use of that to allow couples at risk to have healthy children .
But for non-medical , cosmetic purposes , we believe this would undermine humanity and create a techno - eugenic rat race , " Hayes said .
He said there were immense amounts of resources being poured into developing gene altering techniques and no laws in many countries to stop them from starting clinics that could offer selected cosmetic traits .
" As technology advances it is possible that any number of human characteristics in part influenced by genes could come under human control .
Right now there is an enormous amount of research being conducted to correlate specific genes with specific characteristics . "
One of the organizations researching genetic alteration is the University of California Irvine 's Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center .
Professor of biological chemistry and developmental and cell biology , and co-director of the Center , Peter Donovan , feels the research could have massive benefits .
After his team discovered a greatly improved method for genetically manipulating human embryonic stem cells earlier this year , Donovan said :
" The ability to generate large quantities of cells with altered genes opens the door to new research into many devastating disorders .
" Not only will it allow us to study diseases more in - depth , it also could be a key step in the successful development of future stem cell therapies , " Donovan
But according to Hayes the potential for misuse of this technology could have dire consequences for the human race .
" This runs many risks .
It 's used in many countries to avoid the birth of female children .
" The technologies are going to be accessible to affluent couples and would be used in ways that could increase inequality .
The last thing we need now is a genetic elite .
" This designing aspect would also lead to an objectification of children as commodities . "
Hayes said it was important that people began debating the issues now so the correct " rules , regulations and regulatory oversights " could be established before the technology was complete and accessible .

On Wednesday morning , Sarah Palin gave her second policy speech as Republican candidate for vice - president .
Speaking at Xunlight Corporation , a thin - film solar PV manufacturing company in Toledo , Ohio , Palin did not present any new ideas or policy proposals on energy .
Rather , Palin spoke about her qualifications to lead on the energy issue , citing her time as governor and her experience serving on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission .
Calling Wednesday morning ’s address ‘ a major energy policy speech , ’ is a stretch , to say the least .
The speech was thoroughly infused with the familiar political rhetoric that rehashes the Alaska Governor ’s now tired pleas for the increased production of fossil fuels , blames Democrats for our current energy situation and toots her own horn for taking on the old - boy , moneyed interests of big oil .
The irony that Palin was speaking at a solar cell manufacturing facility was particularly striking because she hardly mentioned anything but oil and gas .
As The Washington Post reports , “ While a sign declaring “ Creating Green Collar Jobs for Ohio ” festooned the hall in which Palin delivered her address , she only made a passing reference to the tour she took this morning of the small solar panel manufacturing facility . ”
And those passing references , were usually in the larger context of oil and gas .
“ All who work in pursuit of new and clean energy sources understand that America ’s energy problems do not go away when oil and gasoline prices fall , as they have in recent weeks .
Oil today is running about sixty - four dollars a barrel — less than half of what it was just a couple of months ago .
And though this sudden drop in prices sure makes a difference for families across America , the dangers of our dependence on foreign oil are just as they were before .
It is just as great a threat . ”
The calling card for Palin and the Republicans has traditionally been to define energy as oil and gas , and to define everything else as “ alternatives . ”
On Wednesday , Palin spoke of fossil fuels with what appeared to be a longing reverence while recounting her experience in Alaska .
“ Ever since I grew up I heard about this dream for a natural gas pipeline , ” she said .
While Palin publicly endorsed John McCain ’s support for a federal cap on greenhouse gas emissions , she indicated in today ’s speech that a McCain - Palin administration would give energy suppliers a wealth of tax breaks and subsidies rather than simply mandate lower carbon emissions .
“ And we will control greenhouse gas emissions by giving American businesses new incentives and new rewards to seek , instead of just giving them new taxes to pay and new orders to follow , ” she said .
In a response released by the Obama campaign , Ohio governor Ted Strickland , criticized McCain ’s proposal to cut corporate income tax rates , which he said would benefit the companies who trade in middle eastern oil .
“ In a bit of rare straight talk , Sarah Palin attacked her own running mate ’s record today by blaming our oil addiction on 30 years of failure ’ in Washington , ” Strickland said .
“ John McCain was there for twenty - six of those years , during which he voted against alternative sources of energy and stood with oil industry lobbyists instead . ”
Palin ’s policy speech recounted the energy independence theme she has been hammering at for the last several months .
A theme she also touched on while introducing John McCain at a campaign stop in Hershey , Pennsylvania on Tuesday .
“ In our administration , we will set this nation firmly on a course of energy independence and we will drill here and we will drill now .
Drill baby drill !
You betcha , we will drill baby drill and we ’ll mine baby mine because we need American energy resources brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers . ”
While the theme of energy independence resonates with a lot of people , the way it is framed by Gov. Palin and many Republicans appears to be completely bereft of any environmental consideration whatsoever .
The discourse of energy independence need not be owned by the ‘ more baby more ’ philosophy of natural resource use .

Have we finally found the answer to whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice or a biological trait ?
A new Swedish study has revealed that gay men and heterosexual women have brain halves of a similar size .
On the other hand , the right brain side is bigger in lesbian women and heterosexual men .
The research and its findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
In a first of its kind of study , the scientists at Karolinska Institute in Sweden used magnetic resonance imagery ( MRI ) to look for the source of cognitive abilities difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals .
They investigated two separate parameters that are unlikely to be directly affected by learned patterns and behavior .
The test group comprised 90 men and women — 50 heterosexual and 40 homosexual .
According to BBC , “ When these results were collected , it was found that lesbians and heterosexual men shared a particular “ asymmetry ” in their hemisphere size , while heterosexual women and gay men had no difference between the size of the different halves of their brain .
In other words , structurally , at least , the brains of gay men were more like heterosexual women , and gay women more like heterosexual men .
” They go on , “ A further experiment found that in one particular area of the brain , the amygdala , there were other significant differences .
In heterosexual men and gay women , there were more nerve “ connections ” in the right side of the amygdala , compared with the left .
The reverse , with more neural connections in the left amygdala , was the case in homosexual men and heterosexual women .
” Dr Qazi Rahman , a lecturer in cognitive biology at Queen Mary , University of London , said , “ As far as I ’m concerned there is no argument any more - if you are gay , you are born gay .
The brain network which determines what sexual orientation actually ‘ orients ’ towards is similar between gay men and straight women , and between gay women and straight men . ”
For the past 25 years , Omar Ali has made his living as a rickshaw driver in one of the busiest and most chaotic cities on earth .
Twelve hours a day , seven days a week , the 45 - year - old pedals people around Dhaka on his cycle - rickshaw .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the bad traffic has also encouraged him to sing .
Every time he gets stuck in a jam , Mr Ali starts a song .
This week his musical talents were finally recognised when he won a TV talent contest that gripped viewers in Bangladesh .
Singing a traditional folk tune , the father - of - four beat off the challenges of the other contestants – all of whom were also rickshaw drivers .
Now , armed with £ 1,000 prize money and a deal to release a CD of him singing , Mr Ali is looking to put the traffic - clogged streets of Dhaka behind him .
“ It is not about the money I have won , but my devotion to music , ” he said .
Mr Ali , who usually earns less than £ 2 a day , said he learnt to sing by listening to the radio in his village in northern Bangladesh .
“ In the village I drove a buffalo cart and I would sing , ” he explained .
“ Now in Dhaka , whenever I get caught in traffic , I sing .
It makes my passengers happy and they sometimes give me 10 per cent extra .
They get upset in the traffic but the singing helps make it bearable . ”
The idea for the show , Magic Tin Chakar Taroka , or “ Three Wheeler Stars ” came from a journalist , Munni Saha , who had seen a talent show for rickshaw drivers held in a school playground on the outskirts of the city .
When she won the backing of her television company , she put posters on the back of rickshaws to publicise auditions that attracted up to 3,000 men .
This number was reduced to 20 after weekly episodes .
Saha said : “ Maybe they are rickshaw drivers , but they are also singers , so I thought why do n’t we help them . ”
Such has been the success of the show , both in Bangladesh and with expatriate audiences in the US and UK , that it is now likely to be repeated .
Although Mr Ali now has his eye on a career in music , the runners - up used their prize money for more practical reasons .
The 10 finalists all won around £ 300 , enough to buy their own vehicles .
The working lives of Mr Ali and his fellow rickshaw drivers are hard and brutal , made worse by Dhaka ’s awful traffic .
The country ’s interim government is working on a £ 3.2 bn 20 - year plan that includes underground railways , elevated motorways , flyovers , footbridges and new roads to try to ease the jams in the city of 11 million people .
It ’s a life that Mr Ali , with his new - found fame , wants to escape .
“ Riding a rickshaw is hard on my body , ” he said .
“ And it ’s getting harder as I get older . ”

It may be some consolation to Barack Obama that - perhaps as the highest tribute to his eloquence - the Republican Party has appropriated many of the key words he uses .
In the blink of an eye , the party of national security , limited government and family values has become the party of “ reform . ”
Mr. Obama repeatedly used the words “ hope , ” “ change ” and “ unity . ” throughout his campaign to win the nomination .
He called for an end to the bickering in Washington and for a new era of bipartisanship .
He also called for renewed patriotism : “ There are no red states or blue states .
There is the United States of America . ”
He also sounded a populist note , pledging to give the government back to the people .
At home and abroad , Mr. Obama presents himself as the future and derides much that came before him - George Bush , the Republicans , even some Clinton Democrats - as the “ failed policies of the past . ”
The McCain campaign has managed to brilliantly craft a message that attempts at once to preserve the core Republican identity , while also tapping into the call for change that is sweeping America .
Former Democrat now independent , Sen. Joe Lieberman , delivered a speech Tuesday night at the Republican convention in which he echoed Mr. Obama ’s major theme by stating that our Founding Fathers “ foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship . ”
He touted his own speech at a Republican convention as an example of a new direction : “ What , after all , is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this ?
The answer is simple .
I ’m here to support John McCain because country matters more than party . ”
He emphasized that Mr. McCain is working to “ break through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics .
” He declared : “ The McCain - Palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year . ”
He saw Mr. McCain as the transformative candidate who is “ a restless reformer , who will clean up Washington and get your government working again for you . ”
On Wednesday night , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Mr. McCain is “ the kind of change we need .
” He also said Mr. McCain is “ the candidate with the real record of bipartisan cooperation .
He ’s the candidate that can credibly reach out for the votes of Independents and Democrats .
” Also , he touted Sarah Palin as “ the future . ”
He stated that “ Governor Palin represents a new generation . ”
She is “ the kind of reformer we need - she shook up Alaska .
She ’ll shake up Washington . ”
For her part , Mrs. Palin also sounded the same themes : “ Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons , and not just to mingle with the right people . ”
She presented herself as a reformer who has stood up to “ special interests , the lobbyists , big oil companies , and the good - ol ’ boys network . ”
She stated that Mr. Obama ’s big - government agenda would result in “ more orders from Washington . ”
She derided Mr. Obama ’s ability to make real change : “ In politics there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers .
And then there are those , like John McCain , who use their careers to promote change . ”
She painted Mr. McCain as the anti-establishment candidate : “ Our nominee does n’t run with the Washington herd .
He ’s a man to serve his country , and not just his party . ”
She concluded that those who seek “ hope ” and “ change ” should join the McCain - Palin cause .
In his acceptance speech , Mr. McCain also lambasted Washington and promised reform : “ And let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second Washington crowd : change is coming . ”
He presented himself as one who rises above party affiliations : “ I ’ve fought corruption and it did n’t matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans . ”
He also brought attention to Republican abrogation of their principles : “ We were elected to change Washington , and we let Washington change us . ”
He pledged to create a truly bipartisan administration : “ I will ask Democrats and independents to serve with me . ”
He insisted that he would legislate with anyone who would help him : “ I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again . ”
The McCain campaign has appropriated Mr. Obama ’s calling cards .
The party that has occupied the White House for the last eight years , has dominated Congress for 10 of the last 12 years and has a nominee that has been in Washington for 35 years is now selling itself as the new kid on the block .
It is a difficult tightrope to walk : Mr. McCain is trying to have it both ways .
But if there is a Washington insider who can do it , that insider is John McCain .

Israel should withdraw from nearly all territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was quoted on Monday as telling a newspaper .
Olmert , in a caretaker role since quitting on September 21 , said he was breaking new ground in calling for a broad pullback from the occupied West Bank , where Palestinians hope to establish a state , and in the annexed Golan Heights , which Syria wants back .
( I am saying ) what no previous Israeli leader has ever said : we should withdraw from almost all of the territories , including in East Jerusalem and in the Golan Heights , Olmert , who resigned over corruption allegations , told Yedioth Ahronoth .
The Israeli daily called it a legacy interview , published on the eve of the Jewish new year , in which Olmert went further in making offers for peace than he ever did publicly when he was in active office , with greater power to see them carried out .
We wish we had heard this personal opinion ... ( before ) he resigned , said Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al - Malki .
It is a very important commitment but it came so late .
We wish this commitment can be fulfilled by the ( next ) Israeli government .
According to Western and Palestinian officials , Olmert has proposed in peace talks with the Palestinians an Israeli withdrawal from some 93 percent of the occupied West Bank , plus all of the Gaza Strip , from which Israel pulled out in 2005 .
Olmert has said repeatedly that Israel intends to keep major Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank in any future peace deal with the Palestinians .
A peace agreement , Olmert has said , would mean Israel would have to compensate the Palestinians for the land it hopes to retain by close to a 1 - to - 1 ratio .
In exchange for the settlement enclaves , Olmert has proposed about a 5 percent land swap giving the Palestinians a desert territory adjacent to the Gaza Strip , as well as land on which to build a transit corridor between Gaza and the West Bank .

This is just to say that you lost my vote over the last few weeks and Barack Obama won it .
Sen. McCain , I know I 'm just a simple single mom , but I do live in Michigan , ground zero in the Electoral College battle .
This was n't an easy choice .
I was with you when only five folks showed up to your town hall meetings in New Hampshire last summer as you stood up for a compromise on immigration .
I cheered when you told Mitten Staters that those cushy auto jobs ain't a - comin ' back before you tanked in our primary .
And I defended you against the loony left 's bizarre assaults on your military service .
You are , indeed , an American hero , and one of mine .
But your attack - happy , outrage - driven campaign - which is inexplicably run by the slimeballs who slandered you on behalf of George W. Bush in 2000 - is beneath you .
You cannot blame the bombastic ads and barrage of smears on wily subordinates ; you are the captain of this ship and you refuse to turn it around .
And as you have seen fit to appease the far right more and more each day , down to your extremist VP pick , I 'm struggling to see you as the man on white horseback who 's come to save the day .
You seem like you only want to win - at any cost .
" This campaign is n't about issues , " your campaign manager scoffed last week .
Well , I think that insults the American people .
And it insults me as a voter .
Because I 'd like you to know that I will be voting for Barack Obama on the issues .
And the economy is No. 1 for my family .
I like that Obama 's comprehensive economic plan is rooted in conservative ideas on tax cuts , which need to be broad - based .
You do n't have many ideas beyond extending the narrow Bush tax cuts and calling your opponent a tax - hiker .
I 'm sure the few making over $ 250,000 approve , but even you knew those cuts would be fiscally disastrous , which is why you voted against them .
Our country can't sustain this kind of lopsided tax code , not while the middle class is losing net income for the first time in decades , the gap between rich and poor is growing and the Iraq war drains $ 10 billion from taxpayers every month .
And speaking of the war , like the vast majority of Americans , I want to see it end .
Here 's my compromise to you : Declare victory and get out .
I have no reason to think that Obama and his stable of bipartisan foreign policy advisers will go about this in a hasty manner akin to how Bush got us into this mess .
But Sen. McCain , you are even further out there than the president , who sees the need for a timetable after more than five years of morass .
Violence is down now , hallelujah .
But our military is broken , with some soldiers doing seven tours of duty in Iraq .
The surge can not be sustained .
Nor do we have the manpower to truly fight al - Qaida in Afghanistan or Pakistan , much less start to tangle with Iran or Russia .
Your bellicose foreign policy is not the reasoned realpolitik of President Bush the Elder ; it will bankrupt our budget and make us more vulnerable to terrorism .
No one knows this better than our enemies .
And I appreciate Obama 's willingness to include insurance companies , seniors groups and doctors into reforming health care , which is ridiculously inefficient and expensive .
Your hands - off approach wo n't help the Big Three or small business being sunk by off - the - charts expenses .
You 're unwilling to even help uninsured children by reauthorizing the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) .
I know the new conventional wisdom is that we need to change the country by going with the GOP , which has been in charge for most of the last glorious war - ravaged decade that 's culminating in economic devastation .
And I know that because I , too , have reproduced like Sarah Palin and people care more about my mug shot that what I write in this column , that I am automatically obligated to vote for your ticket .
But I 'm just an average gal from Michigan who plans to vote my conscience .
Our country has been at war in Iraq since my daughter was six months old and I 'm tired of having to explain death to her .
Before the Bush presidency , I paid $ 1 a gallon for gas in Iowa , and I know as well as you do that drilling wo n't bring the price down one dime .
What I do n't know is how I 'll scrape up $ 300,000 to send her to the University of Michigan in 12 years .
Now you 're telling me that you 're the maverick again , although you 're certainly not on the biggest issues of the day .
You have little to offer me and millions of Americans in terms of real policy change .
What you can provide is a compelling life story and a superstar running mate .
Well , Sen. McCain , you warned us all not to vote on style and slogans over substance .
That 's why I 'm voting for Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
Picture this .
Your lunch break is about to hit lunch and your heading for the Mosque for Friday prayers .
Because you 've worked extra hard all week and do n't have much to do on this particular Friday , you ask the boss for a 15 minute leeway in - case you get held up along the way .
He grants it because you 're a hard worker and you rarely go to Friday Prayers , deciding instead to pray in your car , out in the parking lot .
As your Genie - Boss grants you your wish , you smile and tell him / her " I bet I can be back in 45 minutes if all goes well " .
You obviously have n't been to the Mosque in a while because you forgot the 13 cardinal problems with the other people who go to Friday Prayer .
13 . The Long Khutbah
This is one of the excruciating parts of Friday Prayers .
Not the content of the Khutbah in of itself , or even the fact that there is a Khutbah .
It would be un -Islamic to not have one .
But sometimes the Imam may lose track of time and speak for painfully long periods of time .
This becomes extremely hard to bare if the Imam is n't particularly engaging either .
I 'm talking about those Khutbah 's that start from 1:00 pm and end at 2:00 pm .
Those Khutbah 's that rehash the same point again and again .
These also tend to be the Khutbah 's that occur when the Mosque is filled to the brim .
Where you can't even sit cross-legged .
You 're relegated to knees - perpendicular - to - the - floor position , the position that places them under your chin .
That same position that is forced on you because the fat guy to your left and the bratty kid on your right who needs to have room to play with his toy , otherwise he 's going to cry and create a kicking fuss that will leave you the one being kicked ; while the father looks at him and does nothing more than tap his finger over his lips asking the child to be quiet .
And it gets worse .
When it finally comes time for namaz , your legs are asleep .
So , in the 30 seconds you have to formulate a line , you can barely move .
You might still be sitting on the floor rubbing your legs while everyone around you looks on , like you should be ostracized for not getting up right away .
Forget the fact that you can't .
Or that if you do , your legs might buckle and you 'll just fall back down .
It becomes quite the dil - diddly - emma .
And when you do stand up , you 're back to being sandwiched between the fat guy and the kid ; which leads me to the next point .
12 . Children Crying and the Parents Who Ignore Them
Your sitting there .
The Imam is getting to a great point in the khutbah , and then ... the alarm sounds .
Not that m echanical fire alarm at the back exit .
The child alarm .
Crying .
The sound that many dread hearing , especially during a Khutbah , b/c , like always , this child is about two rows behind you , and the father who decided to bring his child to the Mosque today , decided to pay special attention to this particular part of the Khutbah .
Fortunately for him , he can block out the child 's crying .
You can't do that .
You already had enough on your mind with the fat guy and kid , and now this guy decides he does n't need to escort himself and his child from the prayer hall so everyone else can continue to pay attention .
I guess he does n't realize that everyone else in the hall also has ears .
Ears that work .
You sit there and wonder when the crying is going to stop , when the khutbah finishes .
Geez .
You did n't even get to pay attention to the end of the khutbah b/c that child 's crying .
Another Friday , another khutbah ruined .
Which brings me to my next point ..
11 . Crawling Children During Prayer
You 've now set your rows for congregational Zuhr prayer .
The kid next to you and his dad moved forward into a gap in the row in front of you .
Awesome .
Someone less annoying will stand next to you , right ?
Wrong .
Remember the father from # 12 ?
He decided to move up , now .
Him and his child .
Since the child will not participate in prayers , because of his age , the father will stand the child next to him ( and you ) and continue with his own prayers .
That 's fine .
Or is it ?
Prayer has started by this time , and it's about time to move toward your sajdah when you realize the child who was supposed to be standing next to you is now sitting directly in front of you .
The father , staying consistent in his habits , neglects to pull the child out of your way .
This leaves you to make a quick decision about whether to side - step the child , or push the child out of the way as you go down for sajdah .
As you move down for sajdah , having decided you 'll push the child ever so slightly , so you have room to put your head down , the child moves out of the way on his own .
Thankfully , a situation was averted .
Children in the sajdah zone is a dangerous circumstance many of us face when we go for Friday prayers .
It is something that needs to stop , though .
It 's also about as common as ...
10 . Cell Phones Ringing
Oh , I 'm sorry , was that Surah al - Kafiroon you just recited ?
All I remember hearing was " Ameen " followed by " Hello Moto " , followed by an urge to do the robot dance .
This has happened so many times to you that when you say Ameen during the course of any prayer , that stupid Motorola ringtone plays in the back of your head , quicker than a dog salivates for meat powder .
Pavlov would 've been proud .
You are n't though .
You want to do your prayers in peace .
Without disturbance ?
Is that so much to ask ?
Apparently so .
You know what else should n't be too much to ask ?
Not getting ...
9. Elbows to the Head .
Now that # 11 is n't of concern anymore , someone else decided to hone in on your fun .
An elbow to the head , while not as common as # 10 , is definitely a problem when going for Friday prayers .
People just love to spread their arms out during sajdah .
Unfortunately , this means you must sacrifice your head for the sake of his elbows .
Definitely not a good trade - off .
Not the most comfortable position to be in .
However , this does n't seem to bother you that much b/c while you can probably still focus on your prayers with an elbow now leaning on your head , it 's those darn ...
8. Smelly Socks
that are the greatest distraction in a trip to the Mosque that seems to be a convoluted attempt to stop you from ever coming again .
Unfortunately , the conspiracy wo n't rattle you .
Even these socks .
Socks that reek .
Socks that , when you arise , remind of you of Linus from the Charlie Brown comics ( not in a good way ) .
You 'd like to wonder just why someone would come to the Mosque with smelly socks , but your attention has been diverted by the infamous
7.Butt - to -Face
When Rising from Sajdah .
This one is one of those that just seems to be bad timing .
As you rise from sajdah to stand for the third recitation of Surah al - Fatiha , the guy in front of you just happens to get up in a way that causes butt - to - face contact .
Not a pleasantry by any means .
But one of those occurrences that happens from time to time .
We all like to pretend it does n't happen , but it 's a unspoken occurrence that is all too common .
Of course , this is tied into the next one ; which is a doozy .
6. Moving Back .
# 7 , while , as mentioned , is common , is also very avoidable .
You see , you only got the butt - to - face because of one reason , and one reason only .
The person in front of you .
The initiator of this contact , has a bad habit of moving back every time he gets up from sajdah .
We all know your feet will move slightly back after sajdah .
However , those careful enough , will make the necessary adjustments to stand back in line with the other fellow congregates .
This means the person must be aware of his doing so .
This is not always the case .
Many of these proprietors of such annoyances are also the proprietors of the next issue .
5. Weird Bodily Sounds
As you already know , while the Mosque functions as a House of God , doubles as a location for a symphony orchestra of a different nature .
The Bodily Orchestra as conducted by the Elderly .
This has become so common , you almost forget it 's there .
But it 's there , baby .
Oh , it 's there .
From the time you entered the Mosque , to the time you will leave , there will be those elderly who feel compelled to share their bodies need to release burps , half - burps , snorting , sniffing , coughing , sneezing , and any other sound it is capable of making , with the rest of the congregation .
This background noise usually does n't catch your attention until someone making that hocking sound ; like they are about to spit .
Your ears are now perked and aware of every bodily sound that is emitted from every person , old and young .
It is this way that you spend your final moments in prayer , before it is completed .
You can only add this to a growing list of things that need to stop , that happen at Friday Prayers .
Unfortunately , this is n't the end .
There 's also the case of ...
4. Your Shoe = Rag Doll
So , now that you are done prayer , you must rush to find your shoes and go back to work .
You might still have a chance to be on - time .
That is , until you 've reached to spot where your shoes were .
Yes , past tense .
Your shoes were here .
Now they are not .
Your shoe = rag doll , believe it or not .
It is not important to the 100 + people who came for Friday prayers to not step on someones shoes , to not throw someones shoes out the way , to separate the shoes as if it were a mandatory requirement in Islam .
No , it is not important to them .
Unfortunately , it is for you .
And that 's why you choose an off - beat location where you must be absolutely sure no one will step on them , or take the liberty to throw one to parts unknown .
You must have known placing your shoes near the front entrance , by the doors would be akin to shoe - harakiri .
Nevertheless , the very practice of kicking someones shoe around must stop .
3. People Pushing as Your Put on Your Shoes
Now that you 've found your shoe , you must put it on .
This is a task unto itself , as many people are either in a rush , the same way you are , or just do n't care .
It 's the latter that need to stop , as their oversight into your existence leads to the vulnerability of your safety as you stand in the crowd trying to tie your shoes on your feet .
You 'd like to just tuck in the laces and walk out the door , with the hope of tying them outside , where the masses have n't reached yet , but you know that one of your laces is bound to fall out ; and that is certainly asking to be tripped .
Which brings me to my next point ...
2. Blocking Entrances .
You know these people .
The ones that met each other last week at the Mosque , but are so excited to see each other , they MUST stand in the door - way and block you while you try to rush outside and get to your car before # 1 takes affect .
And it always seems to be the front - entrance , and it also appears they know you 're there , but do n't care .
Either way , you 're trying to get in your car , but as one of these people just has to know if the other one is driving the same car as the last time he saw him , you look at your watch and realize your late .
You 're time is up .
You are officially late .
As you look up , they 've both disappeared .
How wonderful .
As you walk to your car , you now do n't care .
You could n't care less .
You weave through the traffic in the parking lot , walking slowly toward your car .
You do n't even care about the next one , b/c that was the last straw by your boss .
One more late , he said , and you 're fired .
So we 'll mention the last one out of courtesy anyway .
1. The Traffic in the Parking Lot .
It 's not the traffic itself , per se .
There are other people who go to the Mosque .
And , the more , the better .
However , what slows down the drivers ability to leave the parking lot in an orderly manner is simple .
Like # 3 , there are always people who will decide to stand in the way of other cars and have a conversation .
There are always people who decide they cannot wait for another car to pass , and must get in the line that is exiting the lot for the street , and they have to get in there , even if there is no room .
Combined with # 2 through # 13 , it 's just one of the many things that happen at the Mosque that needs to stop .
With that said , the lesson in all of this is not that the Mosque , and the people in it need to fundamentally change their behavior .
The rule of thumb should be that if you are going to go to Friday Prayers , you should never do so in a rush , and should always remember that your priority when you are at the Mosque is to worship and to focus on the remembrance of Allah , as well as your own spiritual lackings , and not what your next task , or appointment is .
Obama calls out McCain on his lack of knowledge on all things that are job related .
McCain can't even understand today 's financial news ...
It 's not that I think John McCain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of most Americans .
I just think does n't know .
He does n't get what 's happening between the mountain in Sedona where he lives and the corridors of Washington where he works .
Why else would he say that we 've made great progress economically under George Bush ?
Why else would he say that the economy is n't something he understands as well as he should ?
Why else would he say , today , of all days - just a few hours ago - that the fundamentals of the economy are still strong ?
Senator - what economy are you talking about ?
What 's more fundamental than the ability to find a job that pays the bills and can raise a family ?
What 's more fundamental than knowing that your life savings is secure , and that you can retire with dignity ?
What 's more fundamental than knowing that you 'll have a roof over your head at the end of the day ?
What 's more fundamental than that ?
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - that promise that America is the place where you can make it if you try - a promise that is the only reason that we are standing here today ...
Enlarge Illustration by Tim Pyle , SSC / JPL / Caltech Gaps in Epsilon Eridani's dusty comet and asteroid belts suggest that an Earth - like planet could be hiding past the inner asteroid belt .
LOOKING FOR LIFE LOOKING FOR LIFE NASA scientist Marc Kuchner explains why he finds the Epsilon Eridani intriguing .
" Because the Epsilon Eridani system is so nearby , familiar , and similar to the solar system , I found looking at these new observations almost unsettling , like meeting someone for the first time you think you know well , when you 've only spoken on the phone before .
As for whether there will could be a habitable planet in the system : I would n't be surprised if there are 7 or 8 planets orbiting Epsilon Eridani .
One of these could well be habitable .
But something to keep in mind is that if even one of the more massive planets in the system is on a moderately eccentric orbit , then over time , the orbits of the other planets will become eccentric too .
If the planet is on an eccentric orbit , that could potentially make it not habitable , even though its orbit is stable .
Planets tend to trade eccentricities as time goes by -- they take turns being the on the most eccentric orbit .
There are some pieces of evidence that suggest that at least one of the planets in this system is on an eccentric orbit .
But we 'll need still better observations to tell for sure .
Also , Epsilon Eridani is a more active star than the sun .
So any life that arose on one of its planets would have to endure stronger flares , for example , than our sun produces .
But there is certainly life on Earth that could survive somewhat stronger stellar flares .
Maybe not people , though ! "
Star Trek fans , take heart — Mr. Spock 's fabled home star , the nearby Epsilon Eridani , could harbor an Earth - like planet .
NASA astronomers today report that the triple - ringed star has an asteroid belt and a Jupiter - like giant planet in roughly the same orbits as in our own solar system .
Only 850 million years old , a fifth the age of Earth 's sun , Epsilon Eridani resembles a younger twin to our solar system .
About 62 trillion miles away , it is the closest known solar system .
It was borrowed by the creators of the TV series Star Trek as the location of Vulcan , the planet that gave us the super - logical science officer Mr. Spock .
" We certainly have n't seen it yet , but if its solar system is anything like ours , then there should be planets like ours , " say astronomer Massimo Marengo of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
The NASA Spitzer space telescope results , which measure the infrared heat given off by dust and ice rings circling the star , suggest Epsilon Eridani possesses three jumbo worlds , revealed by dust - free circular lanes in its asteroid belt and more distant comet belts .
The circular asteroid belt that , like ours , orbits within 300 million miles of the star is particularly surprising , Marengo says , because earlier studies had suggested the star 's Jupiter - like planet followed a looping path that would have destroyed the narrow belt .
Instead , it must follow a nearly circular orbit .
Because Epsilon Eridani is smaller , dimmer and younger than the sun , the " habitable zone " for Earth - like planets there is closer to the star , says planetary theorist Sean Raymond of the University of Colorado - Boulder .
" An Earth - like planet could actually form in the ( star 's ) habitable zone , " he says , if the report of a well - behaved Jupiter - sized planet bears out .
Another planetary theorist , Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institute of Washington ( D.C. ) , is doubtful , suggesting such a planet is " likely to be too massive and too close to allow Earth - like planets to form in the habitable zone . "
Jokes Marengo : " Of course there is disagreement among Star Trek fans about whether the planet of Mr. Spock could be at Epsilon Eridani , because it is such a young star and Vulcans are supposed to be an advanced civilization . "

Before you throw this letter into the proverbial round file , let ’s be clear : this is the first time I have ever asked for a bailout from the Federal Reserve .
I know what you ’re thinking .
Why do I deserve your largesse , and I do mean largesse , since I ’m asking for five million big ones ?
The answer is simple .
Like many of our nation ’s financial institutions , I am simply too big to fail .
If investors were allowed to witness the collapse of Freddie , Fannie , and then Andy , I ca n’t begin to describe what havoc it would wreak on their already frayed nerves .
Actually , I can describe it : global financial calamity .
I think we can both agree that , to dodge this bullet , ten million dollars is a small price to pay .
( I know that I originally asked for five , but since I started writing this letter my financial situation has deteriorated in grave and unexpected ways . )
Why am I too big to fail ?
It ’s important to grasp the critical role that I play in a wide - ranging but fragile web of economic relationships .
If I go belly - up , I will no longer be able to tip my doorman when he gets me a taxi .
This is not a hypothetical situation .
I have studiously avoided tipping him for a solid month now .
Consequently , he no longer has cash to spend at the liquor store after work , and the liquor - store owner no longer has money to spend on Internet porn .
Given that Internet porn is the only fundamentally sound engine of the American economy , we ’re playing with fire here .
If that stalwart industry is allowed to fail , Asian porn companies will rush to fill the void , offering porn that is both cheaper to produce and way hotter than ours .
What will it take to keep this from happening ?
There are no guarantees , but sending me a check for twenty million dollars would buy us all valuable time .
How did I find myself in this hole ?
Like most financial crises , mine had its origins on a slippery slope .
First of all , I made the mistake of logging on to iTunes when I was high and downloading every Electric Light Orchestra song ever recorded .
Second , I created my own e-commerce site , the ill - fated DressYourBadger.com .
I mistakenly believed that a Web site for people who kept badgers as pets and wanted cute outfits to dress them up in would work as a subscription - based service , especially if I charged subscribers a thousand dollars a month .
When there were no takers , I switched to an all - advertising model , not realizing that I was plunging headlong into the jaws of an epically weak advertising market , particularly for products relating to pet badgers .
I have never borrowed money from anyone before , and , if you do n’t believe me , ask any of my friends .
Only do n’t ask Bo . You should not ask Bo for two reasons .
First ,
Bo is under the impression that I did borrow money from him , when all I actually did was let him pay for a pitcher of Stella when it was my turn to pay , and then ran out of the bar before he figured it out .
The other reason you should not ask Bo is that Bo is a ginormous dick .
In fact , if Bo writes to you looking for a bailout , i.e. , he wants to be made whole for that pitcher of Stella , please feed his letter to the nearest high - speed shredder .
I promise you , no investor on the planet will give a rat ’s ass if Bo goes under .
By now , I ’m fairly confident you ’ve already decided to give me that bailout , but , just in case you have n’t , here ’s one more good reason : there ’s a better than fifty - fifty chance that at some point in the next ten years I ’ll be elected Vice - President of the United States .
I would n’t have guessed that a few months ago , but apparently now they ’re letting anybody run .
How is this significant for you ?
In addition to presiding over the Senate and attending state funerals , one of the Vice - President ’s duties ( as I see it ) is to badmouth the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to the President .
This is a situation that could get , shall we say , rather awkward for you .
But why even contemplate such a scenario when it could all be avoided by sending me a check ?
It ’ll be the best billion dollars you ever spent . ♦

A few times a year they would arrive .
Email dispatches from an adventurous explorer in the world of geometry .
Sometimes with subject lines like “ Phenomenal discoveries !! ! ”
Usually with images attached .
And stories of how Russell Towle had just used Mathematica to discover yet another strange and wonderful geometrical object .
Then , this August , another email arrived , this time from Russell Towle ’s son : “… last night , my father died in a car accident ” .
I first heard from Russell Towle thirteen years ago , when he wrote to me suggesting that Mathematica ’s graphics language be extended to have primitives not just for polygons and cubes , but also for “ polar zonohedra ” .
I do not now recall , but I strongly suspect that at that time I had never heard of zonohedra .
But Russell
Towle ’s letter included some intriguing pictures , and we wrote back encouragingly .
There soon emerged more information .
That Russell Towle lived in a hexagonal house of his own design , in a remote part of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California .
That he was a fan of Archimedes , and had learned Greek to be able to understand his work better .
And that he was not only an independent mathematician , but also a musician and an accomplished local historian .
In the years that followed , Russell Towle wrote countless Mathematica programs , published his work in The Mathematica Journal , created videos ( “ Regular Polytopes : The Movie ” , “ Joyfully Bitten Zonotope ” , … ) and recently began publishing on The Wolfram Demonstrations Project .
In 1996 , he sent me probably the first image I had ever seen of digital elevation data rendered in Mathematica .
His last letter to me was this May , where he explained :
“ Along the way it occurred to me that it would be interesting to treat the zonogons of a plane tiling as pixels ; an example is attached , in which I mapped a photo of a butterfly onto a patch of Penrose tiling . ”
Throughout the years , though , zonohedra were Russell Towle ’s greatest passion .
Everyone knows about the five Platonic solids , where every face and every vertex configuration has the same regular form .
Then there are the 13 Archimedean solids ( PolyhedronData [ " Archimedean " ] ; the cuboctahedron , icosidodecahedron , truncated cube , etc. ) , constructed by requiring the same configuration at each vertex , but allowing more than one kind of regular face .
The zonohedra are based on a different approach to constructing polyhedra .
They start from a collection of vectors v i at the origin , then simply consist of those regions of space corresponding to ∑ a i v i where the 0 < a i < 1 .
With two vectors , this construction always gives a parallelogram .
And in 3D , with three vectors , it gives a parallelepiped .
And as one increases the number of vectors , one sees a lot of familiar ( and not so familiar ) polyhedra .
I ’m not sure how the “ known ” polyhedra ( included for example in PolyhedronData ) are distributed in zonohedron space .
That would have been a good question to ask Russell Towle .
My impression is that many of the “ famous ” polyhedra have simple minimal representations as zonohedra .
But the complete space of zonohedra contains all sorts of remarkable forms that , for whatever reason , have never arisen in the traditional historical development of polyhedra .
Russell Towle identified some particular families of zonohedra , with interesting mathematical and aesthetic properties .
Zonohedra not only have all sorts of mathematical connections ( they are , for example , the figures formed by projections of higher - dimensional cubes ) , but may , as Russell Towle suggested in his first letter to me , have practical importance as convenient parametrizations of symmetrical geometric forms .
In recent years , zonohedra have for example begun to find their way into architecture .
Indeed , a 600 - foot approximation to a zonohedron now graces the London skyline as the Swiss Re building ( “ Gherkin ” ) .
There is a certain wonderful timelessness to polyhedra .
We see ancient Egyptian dice that are dodecahedra .
We see polyhedra in Leonardo ’s illustrations .
But somehow all these polyhedra , whenever they are from , look modern .
That there is more to explore in the world of polyhedra after two thousand or more years might seem remarkable .
Part of it is that we live in a time of new tools — when we can use Mathematica to explore the universe of geometrical forms .
And part of it is that there have been rather few individuals who have the kind of passion , intuition and technical skill about polyhedra of a Russell Towle .
It ’s good that Russell Towle had the opportunity to show us a little more about the world of zonohedra ; it ’s sad that he left us so soon , no doubt with so many fascinating kinds of zonohedra still left to discover .
The green fairy returns . *

In the 20,000 years or so that humans have been getting piss - drunk , no spirit has earned a worse rap than absinthe .
Said to turn mild - mannered imbibers into raving maniacs , it was banned in the US and much of Europe in the early 1900s .
( Remember Van Gogh 's ear incident ?
Some scholars blame the green fairy . )
The chemical culprit was thujone , a toxic compound found in the crushed flowers and leaves of absinthe 's key ingredient , wormwood .
Or so we thought .
Three years ago , Wired sent me to meet Ted Breaux , a chemist and microbiologist who had reverse engineered the liquor 's recipe and discovered that there was barely any thujone present ( November 2005 ) .
During harvest and distillation , he explained , its concentration was reduced to a minuscule five parts per million .
Breaux 's research — finally published this spring in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry ( .pdf ) — and that Wired story have helped change absinthe 's image from drug to drink .
The US has been slowly peeling away its ban , and in March , the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved the sale of absinthes that were " thujone free " ( containing less than 10 parts per million ) .
To date , there are four brands on US shelves : Lucid ( Breaux 's formula ) , Kuebler , Green Moon , and St. George Absinthe Verte .
" The US is lucky in that its first absinthes are high - quality products , distilled from whole herbs , " Breaux says .
" In the European market , 80 to 90 percent is industrial junk . "
Under the Jade label , Breaux is making his own absinthes in France and trying to get them green - lighted for sale in the US .
" Even at this point , gaining that approval seems to involve more luck than anything , " he says .
Luck , and a little chemistry .

A bad answer not because it ’s so awkward but because she lacks the knack for spinning tough questions to her advantage in a way politicians ought to be able to .
E.g. , “ Any decision is a bad decision , Katie , where the Court arrogates to itself the right to decide difficult questions which , in a democracy , should be left to the public . ”
An answer like that would have gone a long way towards countering Biden ’s dopey point about the virtue of Roe v.
Wade lying in its expression of consensus .
Hey , Joe ?
Consensus is best determined at the ballot box .
If Biden disagrees with that , I encourage him to let the Supreme Court decide who should be the next president .
It sounds from WaPo at this point like Palin ’s going to try to bait Biden into a fatal gaffe tomorrow night to cover any missteps she might commit .
Not a bad idea in light of the new CBS poll : “ Women ’s perception of Palin has become increasingly negative .
On Sept. 8th , Palin had a 47 percent favorable rating among women and a 19 percent unfavorable ; now her favorable rating among the group is down to 30 percent , while her unfavorable has risen to 34 percent . ”
Exit question :
She ’s on record as opposing the Supreme Court ’s ruling on punitive damages in the Exxon Valdez case .
Why did n’t she just mention that ?
Update : Karl e-mails , “ Biden ’s a senior member of the Judiciary Committee .
Try asking him about the Alaskan pipeline and see how he does . ”

Financial Fiasco
Leading banks and investment funds have been foundering , because of bad debts and lack of trust ; and other , less well - known kinds of fiscal chaos are also on the horizon .
For example , due to an unfixable security flaw in the way funds are now transferred electronically , worldwide , it is no longer safe to write personal checks .
A criminal who sees the numbers that are printed at the bottom of any check that you write can use that information to withdraw all the money from your account .
He or she can do this in various ways , without even knowing your name --- for example by creating an ATM card , or by impersonating a bank in some country of the world where safeguards are minimal , or by printing a document that looks like a check .
The account number and routing information are all that international financial institutions look at before deciding to transfer funds from one account to another .
( See , for example , Grant Bugher 's comments . )
More and more criminals are learning about this easy way to acquire money , and devising new schemes to conceal their identities as they steal the assets of more victims .
Nowadays almost everybody knows that it 's dangerous to reveal your credit card number , or to have that full number on a printed document that somebody might find in the trash .
Soon people will learn that it is equally dangerous to reveal the numbers that are printed in plain sight on every check .
Forget signatures ; banks have no time to verify them .
The once venerable system of checking accounts is irretrievably broken .
Before long , companies will find it impossible to give out paychecks without exposing themselves to unacceptable risk .
One consequence of this debacle is , alas , that I can no longer write checks to reward the people who discover errors in my books .
The system that I 've been using has worked well for almost forty years ; but recently I have had to close three checking accounts , and the criminal attacks on those accounts have caused significant grief to my bankers .
( Certainly I do not believe that anybody who received one of my checks has been in any way a culprit .
But all such recipients are entitled to bragging rights ; therefore the numbers printed on those checks inevitably become known to random members of the public . )
I cannot in good conscience continue to traumatize the people at my bank , who obviously have plenty of other things to worry about .
After painful deliberation I 've come up with a new plan , which I hope will be acceptable to all concerned , and perhaps even welcomed as an improvement .
Instead of rewarding heroic bug - finders with dollars , I shall henceforth award brownie points , otherwise known as hexadecimal dollars ( 0x $ ) .
From now on it will be kudos , not escudos .
Instead of writing personal checks , I 'll write personal certificates of deposit to each awardee 's account at the Bank of San Serriffe , which is an offshore institution that has branches in Blefuscu and Elbonia on the planet Pincus .
It turns out that only 9 of the first 275 checks that I 've sent out since the beginning of 2006 have actually been cashed .
The others have apparently been cached .
So this change in policy will probably not affect too many people .
On the other hand , I do n't like to renege on promises , so I shall do my best to find a suitable way to send money to anyone who really prefers legal tender .
Everybody who has received a reward check or a hexadecimal certificate from me since 1 January 2006 automatically has an account at the Bank of San Serriffe , and these accounts are listed on the bank 's website .
All of these people have my undying gratitude for the invaluable help they 've generously provided in order to improve the books and the software that I 've written .
I ask friendly readers to keep sending those precious bug reports , and to let me know if my new policy displeases you in any way .
The First 200 Pages of Volume 4 Are Here !
On May 1 I received my first copies of The Art of Computer Programming , Volume 4 , Fascicle 0 , a paperback edition of what will eventually form the opening sections of Volume 4A and the answers to more than 350 exercises .
Section 7 An Introduction to Chapter 7 ( Combinatorial Searching ) Section 7.1.1 Boolean Basics Section 7.1.2 Boolean Evaluation
Anybody who 's interested should contact their favorite bookseller for a spiffy new copy of the first printing .
This booklet joins the already - published fascicles 2 , 3 , 4 ; look for fascicle 1 early next year .
Sneak preview of Volume 4 , Fascicle 1
I spend most of my time these days grinding out new pages for the fascicles of the future .
Early drafts are posted here , ready for beta - testing .
I 've put these drafts online primarily so that experts in the field can help me check the results .
But brave souls who are n't afraid to look at relatively raw copy are welcome to look too .
( Yes , the usual rewards apply if you find any mistakes . )
( If you have trouble downloading these files , your browser is probably screwing up ; please see my FAQ page for a workaround . )
Note to Internet friends : I 'm extremely grateful that hundreds of you have taken time to read these drafts , and to detect and report errors that you 've found .
Your comments have improved the material enormously .
But I must confess that I 'm also disappointed to have had absolutely no feedback so far on several of the exercises on which I worked hardest when I was preparing this material .
Could it be that ( 1 ) you 've said nothing about them because I somehow managed to get the details perfect ?
Or is it that ( 2 ) you shy away from the more difficult stuff , being unable to spend more than a few minutes on any particular topic ?
Although I do not like to think that readers are lazy , I fear that hypothesis ( 1 ) is far less likely than hypothesis ( 2 ) .
I may have to remove material that nobody cares about .
But I still cling to a belief that this stuff is extremely instructive .
Thus I would like to enter here a plea for some readers to tell me explicitly , ``Dear Don , I have read exercise N and its answer very carefully , and I believe that it is 100 % correct , '' where N is one of the following :

Threescore Years and Ten ( שבעים שנה )
OK , now I 'm a septuagenarian !
My Big Birthday actually happened six years ago , when I became sixty - four ; sixty - four is 1000000 in binary , and it 's 100010001 in the Fibonacci number system .
But probably I 'll learn something interesting about the number seventy during the coming year .
As another decade has passed , I 'm overwhelmed by the feeling that I 've been enormously blessed to have a loving wife and family , plus many friends around the world .
Fortunately my health is still good , and I still seem to be able to " walk the walk and talk the talk " of a computer scientist and a sometime mathematician .
So I have lots of reasons to be happy , while not forgetting that many serious problems remain unresolved .
When people reach this stage in their lives , they occasionally like to look back and reflect on what has shaped them .
So I was pleased when a British organization , Peoples Archive , recently asked to make a series of videos in which I try to tell what I remember about my past life .
Peoples Archive has now included those videos --- 97 short segments , together with transcripts --- in their excellent collection of stories , freely viewable from their website .
( The other stories are , of course , more interesting than mine .
Check out Freeman Dyson , Benoit Mandelbrot , Carl Djerassi , Stan Lee , ...!)
Last year Ed Feigenbaum and I also spent several pleasant days interviewing each other , as part of the Computer History Museum Oral History Project .
Transcripts of those interviews will soon appear on that website , and CHM also will also make the videos available on DVD ( about seven hours each ) .
An interview by Andrew Binstock
Andrew Binstock recently asked me some interesting questions about a wide range of subjects , and I tried to answer them clearly .
The results are now posted on the informIT website ; also in Chinese translation .
( If you 're interested , please read the original interview before looking at online comments that have little to do with what I really said !
The Web is wonderful , but ...)
An interview by James Buchanan
Another interview has been printed in Issue 77 of the UK magazine Linux User & Developer , according to their website .
They promised to send me a copy , but never did .
Can anybody tell me on what pages the interview appeared , and what was the exact date of publication , so that I can put the info on my CV ?
( Also it would be nice if I could see what they say I said .
I 'm not inclined to buy it from them at the moment .
Does anyone have ideas on how I might have a look ? )
( Note added 9 Jan 09 : OK , I 've now got a copy , thanks ! )
A Flame About 64 - bit Pointers
It is absolutely idiotic to have 64 - bit pointers when I compile a program that uses less than 4 gigabytes of RAM .
When such pointer values appear inside a struct , they not only waste half the memory , they effectively throw away half of the cache .
The gcc manpage advertises an option " - mlong32 " that sounds like what I want .
Namely , I think it would compile code for my x86 - 64 architecture , taking advantage of the extra registers etc. , but it would also know that my program is going to live inside a 32 - bit virtual address space .
Unfortunately , the - mlong32 option was introduced only for MIPS computers , years ago .
Nobody has yet adopted such conventions for today 's most popular architecture .
Probably that happens because programs compiled with this convention will need to be loaded with a special version of libc .
Please , somebody , make that possible .
Wanted : A Name For High - Tech Grief
A rapidly spreading kind of trauma now affects millions of people every day , but the English language has n't yet been extended to deal with it .
Well - known neologisms like `jet lag ' and `road rage ' describe well - known phenomena .
But what do we call the combination of helplessness and agony that affects us when our computers or computer - based appliances do inexplicable things , for which there 's no apparent workaround ?
I 've often seen secretaries in tears when they 're trying to cope with name - brand operating systems .
My computer - savvy friends tell me that their vacations with relatives tend to be occupied mostly by the need to fix hardware and software glitches .
I myself have often cried out for help to colleagues who have generously made house calls , in order to unwedge my highly customized Linux system .
Recent discussions with friends have led to several good suggestions , including :
cyber despair ( David Eisenbud , Talin )
( David Eisenbud , Talin ) technitis ( Chuck McManis )
( Chuck McManis ) compu-terror ( Steve Diamond )
( Steve Diamond ) cyber burned or cyburned ( Betsy Zeller , Dave Marvit )
or ( Betsy Zeller , Dave Marvit ) techno lost ( Ned Holbrook )
( Ned Holbrook ) byte - bitten ( Robert Sapolsky )
( Robert Sapolsky ) digital dread ( Aza Raskin )
( Aza Raskin ) techno angst ( Jono DiCarlo )
( Jono DiCarlo ) irritable bit syndrome ( Charles Merriam )

( J. H. Quick , student ) PCsick , rhymes with seasick ( Bruce Baumgart )
, rhymes with seasick ( Bruce Baumgart ) notwork failure ( Joshua Levy )
( Joshua Levy ) Vista - vexation ( Ryan Zoerner )
In a few random conversations I found that the first of these was most likely to provoke instant recognition and a lively response .
But my sample size has been small .
What to do ?
I suggest that , the next time you 're attacked by this malady , you run through the list above and see which term best characterizes your feelings .
Then blog about it .
The best term should soon rise to the top , and become integrated into our common vocabulary .
Did you borrow a video from me ?
Videotapes of most of my Computer Musings have been made since 1998 , and I have often loaned copies to people who were unable to attend in person .
Now there is good news and bad news .
The good news is that dozens of these videos have been digitized , and they are available for viewing .
The bad news is that three people have not returned the tapes they borrowed , and there is no backup copy ; I learned recently that my copy was unique , because all the master tapes were erased .
If you are the person who currently has any of the following tapes :
Twisted toruses ( or : tori , tori , tori ) , from 10 May 2001 ;
Totally acyclic digraphs ( spiders ) and how to squish them , from 06 Dec 2001 ;
Topological sorting revisited , from 23 Apr 2002 ;
please PLEASE return it / them immediately .
The TeX Tuneup of 2008
New versions of TeX ( 3.1415926 ) and METAFONT ( 2.718281 ) have just been released , after five years of accumulated experience with the previous versions .
Although some bugs were fixed , they do n't affect user programs that were error - free before , except that TeX may now run a bit faster .
Nobody needs to rush to upgrade , but you will of course be wise to install the latest and greatest versions whenever you get a new computer .
Another review is planned for six years hence ( see the Computers & Typesetting home page ) .
Enjoy !
Public lectures
Although I must stay home most of the time and work on books that I 've promised to complete , I do occasionally get into speaking mode .
Here is a current schedule of events that have been planned for this year so far :
Republicans decided that targeting Christopher Dodd ( right ) and Frank – not terribly well known outside the Beltway -- might make for good campaign rhetoric .
The new villains : Dodd and Frank ?
John McCain and his Republican allies have elevated as political villains an unlikely pair to deflect blame for the slumping economy .
During a town hall in Wisconsin on Thursday , McCain called Senate Banking Chairman Christopher J. Dodd ( Conn . ) and House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank ( Mass . ) “ willing co-conspirators ” in the current financial collapse .
Advertisement
This comes as conservative talk radio hosts and an outside group aligned with the GOP accuse the duo of similar crimes against the economy , particularly an allegation that congressional Democrats blocked legislation to increase regulations and oversight for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
This latest back - and - forth shows how political the economic crisis has become after party leaders on both sides of the aisle helped usher legislation through Congress last week granting the Department of the Treasury historic authority to buy up to $ 700 billion in distressed mortgage - related assets .
Republicans and Democrats observed a tentative truce during negotiations over that bill .
But this week they were back at one another ’s throats , and Republicans decided that targeting Dodd and Frank – not terribly well known outside the Beltway — might make for good campaign rhetoric .
" The fact is that the same people that are now claiming credit for this rescue are the same ones that were willing co-conspirators in causing the problem , ” McCain told supporters at a town hall meeting in Waukesha , Wis. , on Thursday .
“ Congressman Barney Frank and Senator Chris Dodd are two of them . ''
Dodd shot back later that afternoon , saying , “ John McCain can spend the next 25 days trying to erase his 25 - year record of deregulation , but the American people are n’t buying it .
“ The truth is , as Chairman of the Commerce Committee , John McCain was the master of deregulation , ” Dodd continued in a statement released by his office .
“ Now all of a sudden he ’s found religion and is trying to paint himself as a populist regulator , but it ’s not going to work . ”
On Wednesday , the American Issues Project , a conservative group that has run ads trying to tie Barack Obama to radical Vietnam - era bomber Bill Ayers , began airing a television ad linking campaign donations from Fannie and Freddie to influential Democrats , like Dodd , as a major reason for the deep slide in the financial markets .
“ Chris Dodd takes big money from Fannie and Freddie , ” the narrator says in the ad .
“ Dodd kills reform — and secures a sweetheart mortgage for himself . ”
This plotline has exploded among grassroots activists across the country .
On Monday , business leaders in Warner Robins , Ga. , asked Democratic Rep. Jim Marshall about Frank ’s close ties with the two mortgage giants during an appearance organized by the local Chamber of Commerce .
And conservative talk - radio is rife with chatter about the role Dodd and Frank played in opening the door for this era of tight credit and plunging financial markets – all while most national and local polls show the GOP bearing the political brunt of this slide .
But the main justification for these attacks – that congressional Democrats colluded with Fannie and Freddie to block increased regulation – ignores a central fact :
The fight to impose tougher oversight on the two government - sponsored secondary lenders was predominantly waged between the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill – with Frank playing a bit role in the stalemate .
In fact , in 2005 , Republicans on the Financial Services panel , led by then - Chairman Mike Oxley ( R - Ohio ) , pushed for tougher regulation , but the White House fought those efforts , preferring instead to privatize the two mortgage giants , which rely on government guarantees to package home loans and resell them for a profit .
From the beginning , Democrats blamed the Bush administration and the GOP ’s cozy relations with Wall Street – Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) even made that point in a controversial speech on the House floor before a failed vote last Monday .
The eloquently expressive Frank fired a salvo on Monday during a mortgage foreclosure symposium in Boston when he complained that Republicans are unjustly seizing on his efforts to expand affordable housing as a root cause of the foreclosure epidemic sweeping this country .
“ They get to take things out on poor people , ” Frank said , according to press reports .
" Let 's be honest :
The fact that some of the poor people are black does n't hurt them either , from their standpoint .
This is an effort , I believe , to appeal to a kind of anger in people . "
House Republican Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio fired back by poking fun at Frank ’s speech impediment .
“ You know where he ’s from .
He ’s from Massachusetts , although he ca n’t say the word ‘ Massachusetts , ’ ” Boehner told a group of Republican donors in Atlanta on Tuesday .
On Thursday , in a sign that this political debate has taken on a personal edge for many of the participants , Dodd said , “ This is not the John McCain I have known all these years .
He ’s been erratic , angry , and shown uncertain leadership in a time of crisis .
“ I did n’t hear from him once when we were negotiating the economic rescue package until he pulled a campaign stunt , parachuted into Washington and accomplished nothing except unnecessarily delaying this agreement for another week , ” Dodd said .
“ If he wants to be angry at someone , he should be angry at himself , his party , and this president for being asleep at the wheel and causing this crisis . ”
Parnes reported from Waukesha , Wis .
The Grand Illusion :
Why consciousness exists only when you look for it
New Scientist , 22 June 2002 , p 26 - 29
“ The last great mystery of science ” ; “ the most baffling problem in the science of the mind ” ; this is how scientists talk about consciousness , but what if our conscious experience is all a grand illusion ?
Like most people , I used to think of my conscious life as like a stream of experiences , passing through my mind , one after another .
But now I ’m starting to wonder , is consciousness really like this ?
Could this apparently innocent assumption be the reason we find consciousness so baffling ?
Different strands of research on the senses over the past decade suggest that the brave cognitive scientists , psychologists and neuroscientists who dare to tackle the problem of consciousness are chasing after the wrong thing .
If consciousness seems to be a continuous stream of rich and detailed sights , sounds , feelings and thoughts , then I suggest this is the illusion .
First we must be clear what is meant by the term “ illusion ” .
To say that consciousness is an illusion is not to say that it does n’t exist , but that it is not what it seems to be―more like a mirage or a visual illusion .
And if consciousness is not what it seems , no wonder it ’s proving such a mystery .
For the proposal “ It ’s all an illusion ” even to be worth considering , the problem has to be serious .
And it is .
We ca n’t even begin to explain consciousness .
Take this magazine in front of your eyes .
Right now , you are presumably having a conscious experience of seeing the paper , the words , and the pictures .
The way you see the page is unique to you , and no one else can know exactly what it is like for you .
This is how consciousness is defined : it is your own subjective experience .
But how do you get from a magazine composed of atoms and molecules , to your experience of seeing it ?
Real , physical objects and private experiences are such completely different kinds of thing .
How can one be related to the other ?
David Chalmers , of the University of Tucson , Arizona , calls it the “ Hard Problem ” .
How can the firing of brain cells produce subjective experience ?
It seems like magic ; water into wine .
If you are not yet feeling perplexed ( in which case I am not doing my job properly ) , consider another problem .
It seems that most of what goes on in the brain is not conscious .
For example , we can consciously hear a song on the car radio , while we are not necessarily conscious of all the things we do as we ’re driving .
This leads us to make a fundamental distinction : contrasting conscious brain processes with unconscious ones .
But no one can explain what the difference really is .
Is there a special place in the brain where unconscious things are made conscious ?
Are some brain cells endowed with an extra magic something that makes what goes on in them subjective ?
This does n’t make sense .
Yet most theories of consciousness assume that there must be such a difference , and then get stuck trying to explain or investigate it .
For example , in the currently popular “ Global Workspace ” theory , Bernard Baars , of the Wright Institute in Berkeley , California , equates the contents of consciousness with the contents of working memory .
But how does being “ in ” memory turn electrical impulses into personal experiences ?
Another popular line of research is to search for the “ neural correlates ” of consciousness .
Nobel Laureate , Francis Crick , wants to pin down the brain activity that corresponds to “ the vivid picture of the world we see in front of our eyes ” .
And Oxford pharmacologist , Susan Greenfield , is looking for “ the particular physical state of the brain that always accompanies a subjective feeling ” ( New Scientist , 2 Feb , p 30 ) .
These researchers are not alone in their search .
But their attempts all founder on exactly the same mystery ―how can some kinds of brain activity be “ in ” the conscious stream , while others are not ?
I ca n’t see what this difference could possibly be .
Could the problem be so serious that we need to start again at the very beginning ?
Could it be that , after all , there is no stream of consciousness ; no movie in the brain ; no picture of the world we see in front of our eyes ?
Could all this be just a grand illusion ?
You might want to protest .
You may be absolutely sure that you do have such a stream of conscious experiences .
But perhaps you have noticed this intriguing little oddity .
Imagine you are reading this magazine when suddenly you realise that the clock is striking .
You had n’t noticed it before , but now that you have , you know that the clock has struck four times already , and you can go on counting .
What is happening here ?
Were the first three “ dongs ” really unconscious and have now been pulled out of memory and put in the stream of consciousness ?
If so were the contents of the stream changed retrospectively to seem as though you heard them at the time ?
Or what ?
You might think up some other elaborations to make sense of it but they are unlikely to be either simple or convincing .
A similar problem is apparent with listening to speech .
You need to hear several syllables before the meaning of a sentence becomes unambiguous .
So what was in the stream of consciousness after one syllable ?
Did it switch from gobbledegook to words half way through ?
It does n’t feel like that .
It feels as though you heard a meaningful sentence as it went along .
But that is impossible .
The running tap of time
Consciousness also does funny things with time .
A good example is the “ cutaneous rabbit ” .
If a person ’s arm is tapped rapidly , say five times at the wrist , then twice near the elbow and finally three times on the upper arm , they report not a series of separate taps coming in groups , but a continuous series moving upwards ―as though a little creature were running up their arm .
We might ask how taps two to four came to be experienced some way up the forearm when the next tap in the series had not happened yet .
How did the brain know where the next tap was going to fall ?
You might try to explain it by saying that the stream of consciousness lags a little behind , just in case more taps are coming .
Or perhaps , when the elbow tap comes , the brain runs back in time and changes the contents of consciousness .
If so , what was really in consciousness when the third tap happened ?
The problem arises only if we think that things must always be either “ in ” or “ out ” of consciousness .
Perhaps , if this apparently natural distinction is causing so much trouble , we should abandon it .
Even deeper troubles threaten our sense of conscious vision .
You might be utterly convinced that right now you ’re seeing a vivid and detailed picture of the world in front of your eyes , and no one can tell you otherwise .
Consider , then , a few experiments .
The most challenging are studies of “ change blindness ” ( New Scientist , 18 Nov 2000 , p 28 ) .
Imagine you are asked to look at the left hand picture in the illustration below .
Then at the exact moment you move your eyes ( which you do several times a second ) the picture is swapped for the one on the right .
Would you notice the difference ?
Most people assume that they would .
But they ’d be wrong .
When our eyes are still we detect changes easily , but when a change happens during an eye movement or a blink we are change blind .
Another way to reveal change blindness is to present the two pictures one after the other repeatedly on a computer screen with flashes of grey in between ( for an example see http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/ASSChtml/kayakflick.gif).
It can take people many minutes to detect even a large object that changes colour , or one that disappears altogether , even if it ’s right in the middle of the picture .
What do these odd findings mean ?
At the very least they challenge the textbook description that vision is a process of building up representations in our heads of the world around us .
The idea is that as we move our eyes about , we build up an even better picture , and this picture is what we consciously see .
But these experiments show that this way of thinking about vision has to be false .
If we had such a picture in our heads we would surely notice that something had changed , yet we do n’t .
We jump to the conclusion that we ’re seeing a continuous , detailed and rich picture .
But this is an illusion .
Researchers differ in how far they think the illusion goes .
Psychologists Daniel Simons of Harvard University and Daniel Levin of Kent State University , Ohio , suggest that during each visual fixation our brain builds a fleeting representation of the scene .
It then extracts the gist and throws away all the details .
This gives us the feeling of continuity and richness without too much overload .
Ronald Rensink of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , goes a little further and claims that we never form representations of the whole scene at all , not even during fixations .
Instead we construct what he calls “ virtual representations ” of just the object we are paying attention to .
Nothing else is represented in our heads , but we get the impression that everything is there because a new object can always be made “ just in time ” whenever we look .
Finally , our ordinary notions of seeing are more or less demolished by psychologists Kevin O’Regan of the CNRS , the French national research agency in Paris , and Alva Noë of the University of California , Santa Cruz , who first described vision as a grand illusion .
They argue that we do n’t need internal representations at all because the world is always there to be referred to .
According to their “ sensorimotor theory of vision ” seeing is not about building pictures of the world in our heads , it ’s about what you are doing .
Seeing is a way of interacting with the world , a kind of action .
What remains between eye movements is not a picture of the world but the information needed for further exploration .
The theory is dramatically different from existing theories of perception .
It ’s not clear who ’s right .
Perhaps all these theories are off the mark , but there is no doubt about the basic phenomenon and its main implication .
Searching for the neural correlates of the detailed , picture in our heads is doomed because there is no such picture .
This leaves another problem .
If we have no picture , how can we act on the things we see ?
This question may seem reasonable but it hides another false assumption ―that we have to see consciously in order to act .
We need only think of the tennis player who returns a serve before consciously seeing it , to realise that this is false , but the situation is odder than this .
We probably have several separate visual systems that do their jobs somewhat independently , rather than one single one that produces a unified visual world .
David Milner of the University of St Andrews , and Melvyn Goodale of the University of Western Ontario , argue that there is one system for fast visuomotor control and a slower system for perceiving objects .
Much of their evidence comes from patients with brain damage , such as D.F. who has a condition known as visual form agnosia .
She cannot recognise objects by sight , name simple line drawings , or recognise or copy letters , even though she produces letters correctly from dictation and can recognise objects by touch .
She can also reach out and grasp everyday objects ( objects that she cannot recognise ) with remarkable accuracy .
D.F. seems to have a visual system that guides her actions but her perception system is damaged .
In a revealing experiment D.F. was shown a slot set randomly at different angles .
( Trends in Neurosciences , vol 15 p 20 , 1992 ) .
She could not consciously see the orientation of the slot , and could not draw it or adjust a line to the same angle .
But when given a piece of card she could quickly and accurately line it up and post it straight through .
Experiments with normal volunteers have shown similar kinds of dissociation , suggesting that we all have at least two separate vision systems .
Perhaps the most obvious conclusion is that the slow perceptual system is conscious and the fast action system is unconscious .
But then the old mystery is back .
We would have to explain the difference between conscious and unconscious systems .
Is there a magic ingredient in one ?
Does neural information turn into subjective experiences just because it is processed more slowly ?
Perhaps the answer here is to admit that there is no stream of conscious experiences on which we act .
Instead , at any time a whole lot of different things are going on in our brain at once .
None of these things is either “ in ” or “ out ” of consciousness but every so often , something happens to create what seems to have been a unified conscious stream ; an illusion of richness and continuity .
It sounds bizarre , but try to catch yourself not being conscious .
More than a hundred years ago the psychologist William James likened introspective analysis to “ trying to turn up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks . ”
The modern equivalent is looking in the fridge to see whether the light is always on .
However quickly you open the door , you can never catch it out .
The same is true of consciousness .
Whenever you ask yourself , “ Am I conscious now ? ” you always are .
But perhaps there is only something there when you ask .
Maybe each time you probe , a retrospective story is concocted about what was in the stream of consciousness a moment before , together with a “ self ” who was apparently experiencing it .
Of course there was neither a conscious self nor a stream , but it now seems as though there was .
Perhaps a new story is concocted whenever you bother to look .
When we ask ourselves about it , it would seem as though there ’s a stream of consciousness going on .
When we do n’t bother to ask , or to look , it does n’t , but then we do n’t notice so it does n’t matter .
Admitting that it ’s all an illusion does not solve the problem of consciousness but changes it completely .
Instead of asking how neural impulses turn into conscious experiences , we must ask how the grand illusion gets constructed .
This will prove no easy task , but unlike solving the Hard Problem it may at least be possible .

Singerhas been working with Esquire magazine 's Hollywood Hills House to celebrate music in the public school system in Los Angeles .
Since 1997 this non-profit organization has been helping to restore music education programs in American public schools .
So far $ 43 million in musical instruments have been given to 1,600 public schools in over 100 cities around the country .
This wonderful gift of music has impacted over 1.2 million students .
Research has proven that when a child plays a musical instrument , they enhance their critical thinking skills and their ability to work as a team .
Engagement in school is key in keeping children from dropping out .
West Hollywood was filled with famous faces last night , helping to raise awareness and raising money for this wonderful foundation .

Avoid expulsion from Google by following these SEO tips on what not to do .
It ’s very important that you obey the rules of the search engines or your site will be placed in a black hole .
Cloaking : A type of search - engine subterfuge in which an indexed Web page is not shown to visitors who click its link in Google ( or another search engine ) .
The cloaking works two ways : Visitor content is cloaked from Google , and Google ’s indexed content is cloaked from visitors .
This serves to give a high PageRank to content that ordinarily would rate a low PageRank .
Cloaking is not always illicit .
A certain type of cloaking are used to deliver pages tailored to a visitor ’s ISP ( America Online , for example ) or specific Web browser .
Doorway page :
An entry page to a Web site , sometimes known as a splash page .
Doorway pages endure a negative connotation due to illicit techniques that send visitors to an entirely different site than the destination they clicked in Google .
Excessive Cross linking :
When cross linking is done intentionally , the Webmaster is seeking to raise the PageRank of the involved sites .
Excessive cross linking can backfire .
If Google decides that the resulting enhanced PageRank is artificial , any or all of the sites might be expelled from the Web index .
Innocent cross linking between two related sites is usually not a problem .
Keyword stuffing :
The attempt to gain a higher PageRank ( or higher ranking in any search engine ) by loading a page ’s HTML code or text with keywords .
In most cases a visitor ca n’t see the keywords because they ’re buried in HTML tags , camouflaged against the background color of the page , or reduced to a tiny typeface .
Keyword stuffing violates Google ’s guidelines for Webmasters and can result in expulsion from the index .
Link farm :
A site whose only function is to display outgoing links to participating Web sites .
Link farms are disreputable versions of legitimate , topical link exchange sites through which visitors gain some content value .
Link farms often have no topicality and present no guidelines or standards of submission .
Google does not explicitly threaten expulsion for joining link farms , but it discourages their use .
Mirror site : Mirror sites duplicate content and are used for both legitimate and engine - spamming purposes .
Legitimate mirror sites assist in downloading when a great deal of traffic is trying to reach a page or acquire a file .
Illicit mirror sites attempt to fill a search results page with multiple destinations owned by a single entity .
When Google discovers a mirror site whose only purpose is to dominate a search page , that site risks expulsion .
Page redirect : A background link that sends site visitors to another site .
Page redirects can be used legitimately , as when a site moves from one domain to another .
In that scenario , the Webmaster sensibly keeps the old domain active for a while , seamlessly sending visitors to the new location when they click the old one .
As an illicit optimization technique , page redirects deflect visitors from the site indexed by Google to another site that would not be able to gain as high a PageRank .
This type of redirect , when uncovered by Google , risks the expulsion of both sites from the index .
Spam : Generally refers to repeated and irrelevant content .
As an optimization term , spam refers to loading a page with keywords or loading a search engine ’s index with mirror sites .
Google reacts strongly to spamming , and takes harsh measures against Web sites that use spamming techniques to improve PageRank .
The United Nations is raising its security level in Pakistan and ordering children of international staff to leave the country amid increasing violence , a UN official said Thursday .
A suicide bomber killed himself and three other people in an attack outside the Charsadda home of Awami National Party Leader Asfandyar Wali Khan , police said .
The blast is the latest in a wave of bomb attacks by Islamist militants .
Last month , a suicide bombing at the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistani capital , Islamabad , killed 55 people .
" Phase three has been approved by the secretary general , " said UN information officer Ishrat Rizvi , referring to a security level that requires dependents of UN staff to leave a country .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon approved the move after the agencies in Islamabad recommended it earlier this week , officials told the Associated Press .
The upgraded security level will also apply to the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi and areas around the Afghanistan border , officials said .
Much of the border region , including the city of Peshawar , were already off - limits for UN families .
Officials said some families may be allowed to relocate to safer areas , such as Lahore or Karachi .
Rizvi said the United Nations would later be issuing details about the decision .
There has been growing unease about security in Pakistan despite government assurances about efforts to protect foreigners .
Pakistan 's military has reported that suicide attacks have killed nearly 1,200 people — most of them civilians — since July 2007 .
Work will continue
The new security level would have no impact on the UN 's operations in the country , Rizvi said .
" It 's a matter of only evacuating the children of international staff members , which does n't make any difference to the work of the United Nations , " she said .
About 100 of the UN's more than 2,000 staff in Pakistan are foreigners .
But officials said only 20 people had children who would be required to leave the area .
Britain announced on Wednesday that it is also withdrawing the children of its diplomats from Pakistan .
The country has been under intense U.S. pressure to combat Islamic militants among the border region of Afghanistan , a known haven for al - Qaeda and Taliban militants , and Pakistani extremists who attack American and NATO troops .
Ostriches , emus , kiwis and other winged non-flyers might seem to be birds of a feather , sharing similar evolutionary origins , but the story could turn out to be much weirder , with perhaps numerous flying ancestors .
This group of birds , called ratites , has been viewed by biologists as part of a larger group ( paleognaths ) of mostly extinct birds that are key to understanding the early evolution of birds .
All living ratites are found in the Southern Hemisphere and share features associated with flightlessness , such as small or absent keels on their breastbones ; smaller , simpler and fewer wing bones ; bigger leg bones ; and structures in their feathers that do n't help with aerodynamics .
So for these reasons and others , many scientists previously figured the ratites , a group that also includes rheas and cassowaries , all shared a common ancestor that was flightless .
However , a new analysis shows they do not share this single hypothetical flightless ancestor .
Rather they probably evolved from more than one different airborne ancestor .
Ostriches are special
The research , led by John Harshman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , Edward L. Braun of the University of Florida and Michael J. Braun of the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History , was based on sequencing genetic material sampled from the tissues of many different bird species and using the gene sequences to determine how the birds relate to one another .
Nearly all of the ratites , except for ostriches , which the analysis revealed as a class unto themselves , are actually more closely related to tinamous ( a chubby , ground - dwelling bird with a stubby tail , that nonetheless can fly and lives in Central and South American ) than they are to ostriches , says UF zoologist Edward L. Braun .
The analysis also placed tinamous in a sub - group that includes rheas , cassowaries , emus and kiwis but excludes ostriches .
" We think the most likely hypothesis is that the tinamous , rheas , cassowaries , emus , and kiwis had an ancestor that could fly , and that flight was lost at least three times ( once in ostriches , once in rheas , and once in the emu- cassowary - kiwi group ) , " Braun said .
Julia Clarke , a paleontologist at North Carolina State University , was not involved in the new research , and said the results are surprising , the analyses are well done and the dataset used for them is the largest one available .
" It is unquestionable that any future analysis will need to address this dataset , " she said , " but the results are in conflict with nearly every previous hypothesis of relationships within paleognath birds . "
New idea takes flight
The result also undermines continental drift as the explanation for how flightless birds became so far - flung — ostriches today live in Africa ; rheas in South American ; emus and cassowaries in Australia and New Guinea ; kiwis and moas ( the latter now extinct ) in New Zealand ; and elephant birds ( also now extinct ) in Madagascar .
Some zoologists had thought the birds ' distribution reflected the order in which the continents broke away from the early super - continent of Gondwana .
But it looks like there is a much simpler explanation for the distribution of ratites ' ancestors , once Gondwana started to break up 167 million years ago .
They flew .
" Our idea provides another explanation for the distribution of ratites — it becomes reasonable to postulate that they flew to their new homes and only lost flight after dispersing , " Braun told LiveScience .
Clarke said that if the new results are confirmed with a new set of genes or other combinations of data , " there could be profound implications for our understanding of major trends in bird evolution , such as patterns and potential explanations of flightlessness . "
The finding is also exciting from a developmental standpoint , Braun said , given how similar most ratites look .
The ratites apparently all arrived at similar body shapes through different evolutionary routes , a concept called convergence ( for example , birds , bats , insects and pterosaurs all have or had wings , but they are not all closely related ) .
" This raises an interesting question — what genetic mechanisms lead to these similarities , and can we identify them by looking at how ratite chicks grow in the egg , " Braun said .
The research , funded by the National Science Foundation , is detailed this week in the online edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" The Industrial Revolution had caused a severe mental trauma , one that still reaches out and extinguishes the memory of certain people .
For them , modern history begins from a big explosion -- the Industrial Revolution .
This is a standard ideological approach : a star crosses the sky , a meteor explodes , and history begins anew . "
" In the West , there had been a persistent growth of corporatism in spite of the outcome of the last world war .
And that this growth continued .
Why would this be shocking ?
Because corporatism was part of the anti-democratic underpinnings of Fascist Italy in particular , but also of Nazi Germany .
Beneath the uniforms and the military ambitions and the dictatorial leadership and the racism lay corporatism .
It was the intellectual foundation of fascism .
And it was supposed to have been destroyed along with both regimes in 1945 . ”
" structures "
" Among the illusions which have invested our civilization is an absolute belief that the solutions to our problems must be a more determined application of rationally organized expertise .
The reality is that our problems are largely the product of that application . "
" feudal fiefdoms of expertise "
" The professional [ found ] that he could build his personal empire but curiously enough , the more expert he became , the more his empire shrank . "
" This means that in dealing with the public , they find it easier to appeal to the lowest common denominator within each of us .
That this often succeeds reinforces their contempt for a public apparently capable of nothing better . "
- John Ralston Saul , “ Unconscious Civilization , ” 2006 ) .
“ Voltaire and his contemporaries believed that reason was the best defense against the arbitrary power of monarchs and the superstitions of religious dogma .
It was the key not only to challenging the powers of kings and aristocracies but also to creating a more just and humane civilization .
While the emphasis on reason has become one of the hallmarks of modern thought , today 's rational society bears little resemblance to the visions of the great 17th and 18th century humanist thinkers .
Our ruling elites justify themselves in the name of reason , but all too often their power and their methodology is based on specialized knowledge and the manipulation of rationalrather than reason .
Today the link between reason and justice has been severed and our decision - makers , bereft of a viable ethical framework , have turned rational calculation into something short - sighed and self - serving .
The result , Saul observes , is that we live in a society fixated on rational solutions , management , expertise , and professionalism in almost all areas , from politics and economics to education and cultural affairs .
The cult of expertise is one of the defining characteristics of today 's rational elites , as Saul sees it .
The division of knowledge intohas meant that general understanding and coordinated action are increasingly difficult and often looked upon with suspicion , as evidenced by our systems of education which reward the specialist and disdain the generalist .
It has also resulted in a fracturing of society into smaller and smaller and increasingly insulated professional groups .
While the emergence of professionalism has paralleled the rise of individualism over the last two centuries , the result has not been greater individual autonomy and self - determination , as was once hoped , but isolation and alienation .
The great schism between the principles of democracy and the practices of modern rational governments has brought about not only widespread public frustration and anger , but also a general contempt among the ruling elites for the citizenry .
While they cooperate with the established representational systems of democracy , Saul says , they do not believe in the value of the public 's contribution .
Nor do they believe in the existence of a public moral code .

Bank of America , Merrill Bailout Disguised as Buyout ?
Bank of America 's buyout of Merrill Lynch seemed laughable to me - that is until I realized the full picture .
With a $ 50 billion all - stock deal valued at $ 29 per share , at first glance it might appear that Bank of America does n't stand to lose much considering its stock is at least 50 % overvalued by my analysis .
However , even at an adjusted price of $ 25 billion , Bank of America will be responsible for absorbing all of Merrill 's losses .
Good luck .
But wait .
They do n't need luck , they have the Fed .
I could care less about Merrill 's 49 % stake in Blackrock .
No financial institution is infallible under these conditions and only an idiot would rush in to buy Merrill at $ 50 billion .
They are on the hook for a huge amount of mortgage securities .
And their brokerage unit has been fighting a massive decline for years .
In fact , I expected them to eventually sell it off .
While I can guarantee you all bank CEOs are lost in the woods , Bank of America 's CEO , Kenneth Lewis can't be that stupid .
Think about it .
Lewis already committed to a buyout of troubled Countrywide well before he realized how bad things would get .
How much blind risk can Bank of America handle ?
A lot if they are given a blank check by the Fed .
And the fact is that they have been , along with the rest of the banking cartel .
I 'm quite confident Lewis was approached by the Fed and U.S. Treasury with promises of extra assistance , if needed , in exchange for buying Merrill .
That is precisely why the bank offered a 70 % premium for the struggling firm .
Think about it .
Merrill was on its way to single digits so why not wait ?
Better yet , why offer a 70 % premium to its Friday closing price ?
This is the worst banking crisis in U.S. history and they 're offering 70 % premiums ?
It appears as if we are witnessing government bailouts using taxpayer money that are being deceitfully disguised as buyouts .
Not just with the Merrill buyout but also this newly established $ 70 billion emergency bank fund , set aside to help out banks with future problems .
Where do you think this money is coming from ?
The banks certainly do n't have it .
It is coming indirectly either from the Fed or the U.S. Treasury .
That is precisely why the Fed just opened up the types of securities for Schedule 2 auctions that can be used as collateral for borrowing from the Term Securities Lending Facility .
Now all investment - grade securities can be pledged .
In addition , the amounts auctioned have been increased by $ 25 billion to $ 200 billion .
The problem is that what may be investment - grade today could easily become junk next week .
In fact , as I have stated in the past , we are going to see a huge junk bond market soon .
Already , corporate defaults are soaring .
You see , the banking cartel – the guys that own the Federal Reserve – have been given a blank check and will make it through this crisis .
JP Morgan Chase is already dealing with Bear Stearns so now it was time to ask Bank of America to take over Merrill .
And while the money might not be coming directly from the U.S.
Treasury , what 's the difference ?
Anyone holding dollars is getting screwed because all of this extra printing is destroying the currency .
I recall reading Friday an analyst form Citigroup stating Merrill 's “ liquidity position is strong and that exposure to volatile businesses is lower relative to its peers . ”
http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.asp..
If that 's the case , then it looks like all the banks are on the verge of complete failure .
When are these analysts going to stop with their lies ?
By now , we should come to expect the Friday close of the next bank failure .
Now , let me show you an excerpt from a June 25 , 2008 article I wrote http://seekingalpha.com/article/82623..I want you to focus on the section titled , “ A Final Word of Caution ” … .
“ Those of you looking to make easy money in the financials like E - Trade ( ETFC ) need to think again .
The risk is too high right now .
I find it amazing how so many who have taken a long position in ETFC cite the company 's impressive book value as some sign of value or financial strength .
Understand that book value is used in the event of liquidation of assets in bankruptcy and therefore usually has no impact for common stock holders .
In addition , book values of financials are meaningless since the banks have overvalued their debt .
Finally , book values typically have no way of fully accounting for the type of massive leverage the banks have built .
If you were not aware of these basic facts , you really need to sit this one out , save your cash and wait for the next bull market , when nearly everyone does well .
Even Citibank ( C ) has considerable downside from here , as does Bank of America ( BAC ) .
Over the past year , I have made many recommendations to short the financials .
Earlier in the year , my attention was focused on Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) and American International Group ( AIG ) .
The story on these guys is far from over but I would wait for a rally before going short again .
The next short to consider will be Merrill Lynch ( MER ) .
When MBIA ( MBI ) and Ambac ( ABK ) get another downgrade , MER will be in deep trouble due to their large exposure to insured mortgage debt .
That said , you might be wondering why MER is already near a year low .
It 's quite simple .
All that I have told you about Merrill 's risks is widely known .
But that does not mean it can't go lower .
However , unless you are very experienced with shorting , you need to stay away from this strategy .
Will there ever be a time to pick up the financials ?
I doubt I will bother to pick up any of these ( other than for short - term trading ) even when I sense the bottom has been reached because the climb back up is going to be very slow and small .
The dilution that has and will continue to occur will crush earnings for many years . ”
So which major bank will be next to go under ?
Whatever bank that ends up being , Citigroup is certainly in no shape to help out .
Even with the Fed 's printing presses they are going to struggle to survive .
Most likely , Citi will sell off a few of its businesses before it 's all over .
So the question is , which member of the banking cartel will be asked to step in and buy Washington Mutual .

In the heart of Appalachia , knobs , gaps and hollers define the undulating green landscape .
Life is old , travel is slow , and it ’s a daunting job to get a bus full of journalists up the steep , rutted dirt road through Cabin Creek Hollow to Larry Gibson ’s cabin on Kayford Mountain .
But no photos or descriptions of the devastation we are about to witness can do justice to a close - up look at a mountaintop removal mining operation .
That is why we are here .
That is what Larry wants to provide for reporters on this Society of Environmental Journalists field trip to the coalfields of southern West Virginia in October 2008 , in hopes that we will be a conduit for the story he spends his life telling .

Much of the original homestead was seized by devious land companies in the early 20th century , but 50 acres remain .
Back in 1993 a spokesman for the Sago Mine told Larry the property was worth $ 1 million an acre to the coal industry , but he was offered $ 140,000 for all of it .
He chose to put it in a land trust instead , and keep it as a base from which to fight against the destruction that now surrounds him and threatens many similar locations in the region .
“ My mother gave me birth , ” he said , “ but these mountains give me life … There should be something in your life that money ca n’t buy .
To me , it was my heritage , my culture , my way of life , of the Appalachian people . ”

Larry is a lone hold - out on this mountain , which was once home to 60 families before the industry bought them out .
He tells visitors , “ I do n’t need your help getting off this mountain ; I need your help staying on it . ”
He used to stand on this land and look up at green summits rising more than 3000 feet , surrounding the collection of cabins in the woods .
Now , this lone forested flank at 2400 feet is the highest point around .
The mountains encircling it have been blown up with millions of tons of dynamite in order to remove the shallow coal seams that lie buried within the layers of rock .
If I had n’t heard the sounds of heavy equipment in the distance – the grinding engines of earthmovers and massive dump trucks beeping in reverse – I might never have realized what lay just a few hundred yards up a wooded rise from Larry ’s cabin .
We would discover it , he said , by walking through “ Hell ’s Gate , ” the barrier marking the property line between his family ’s land and the Samples Mine , where a subsidiary of Massey Coal has blown away 900 feet and 7500 acres of Kayford Mountain over the last four years .
Another 6000 acres on adjacent Coal River Mountain are slated for the same fate .
The first blast there went off the week before our arrival , Larry said , even though the permits are not yet final .

Ancient landscapes , lost forever
To understand the atrocity of mountaintop removal mining , you must first have a sense of what is being eradicated .
In central Appalachia , lush hardwood forests cover the slopes in a mélange of green , beech , buckeye and maple , ash , shagbark , hickory and oak , tulip tree and flowering dogwood .
Beneath their leafy canopy lies an understory of shrubs like mountain laurel and rhododendron , and hundreds of flowers and herbs , including medicinal plants such as ginseng and goldenseal .
Moss and fungi thrive where water is plentiful , as do an amazing assortment of freshwater fish , salamanders and frogs .
Deer and black bear drink from the clear streams that fill the narrow valleys , forming the headwaters for the rivers of the Eastern seaboard .

One of the most biodiverse places on the planet , this region and its ecosystems have been a long time in creation .
Some of earth ’s most ancient mountains comprise this range , birthed 300 million years ago when North America and Africa were still connected : the Appalachians were formed as part of the same mountain chain as the Anti-Atlas in Morocco .
Deep within their folded slopes lie some of the world ’s richest carbon deposits , the product of millennia of compression , the anthracite and bituminous coalfields that hold much of the U.S. ’s most plentiful fossil fuel stores .
Intensive efforts to retrieve that coal have been a defining part of the natural and cultural landscape in Appalachia since the Civil War .
Where Kentucky , Tennessee , Virginia & West Virginia share borders , beauty and pain have resided side by side for 150 years .
Coal barons of the 1920s sought to smash miners ’ unions in a push to increase production and profits from underground mines , but today ’s captains of industry have managed to find a way around the cost and conflicts associated with labor while taking coal out of the earth via a faster mode .
In so doing , they are undoing the earth ’s geology and devastating whole ecosystems .
They call it mountaintop mining .
Opponents call it mountaintop removal .
We walk through a golden tracery of lacy maples and red sumac to Hell ’s Gate , a low black bar , and approach the rim of a vast pit .
As bleak and gray as the clouds overhead , it stretches 270 degrees around us to the horizon .
It is as if we have come to an overlook of the surface of the moon .
Few people are present except us .
Most of the work is being done not by miners , Larry tells us , but by heavy - equipment operators .

How to move a mountain
Destroying mountains to extract coal requires surprisingly little manpower .
Just 19 men do what it used to take 650 to do in an underground mine , Larry says .
“ It is the most barbaric form of mining I ’ve ever witnessed in my life . ”
First , the trees are clear - cut and removed .
The trees on Kayford Mountain were burned , Larry said , though occasionally they are sold for timber in some operations .
Explosives are then buried in the ground and detonated .
The mountaintop shudders and shakes apart into rubble .
Ten to 12 blasts a day split the air at the Samples Mine , just a portion of the 3 million pounds of dynamite exploded every day in Appalachia , Larry said .
He added that a single blast in 1999 costing $ 1 million was the largest non-nuclear blast to be detonated since World War II .
Only on Sundays is the mine quiet , when Larry can hear the birds .
There used to be 147 species native to Kayford Mountain , but just 39 remain , he said , according to a group of birders who monitor their numbers .
The blasting is hard on other animals , too , Larry says .
He tells us that 14 bears were killed on the side of his land , tracked in to the mine zone via radio collars , but never out again .

After the blasting is finished the loose debris – or ‘ overburden ’ – is placed into enormous dump trucks that hold 240 tons and placed into adjacent valleys as “ fill . ”
Once enough rock is removed to get at the coal seam , it is ripped out by gigantic drag lines and scooped into buckets big enough to hold 24 small cars .
Then the process begins again .
Each successive blasting round creates a deeper incursion into the mountain until ultimately it resembles a ravaged crater like the Samples Mine .
At the Four Mile Mountain Mine , our second stop , we learned that 25 - 30 feet of rock are blasted away to reach coal seams that are typically 10 - 18 inches deep and about 400 feet long .
It seems like a lot of effort for a relatively little amount of coal versus rock .
That tells you something about how lucrative coal is , and how cheaply it can be mined using these low - labor methods .
Andrew Jordon , CEO , Pritchard Mining Andrew Jordon , CEO , Pritchard Mining
Andrew Jordon , CEO of Pritchard Mining and immediate past chair of the West Virginia Coal Association , told reporters at the site that much of the coal removed in mountaintop mining could not be accessed via traditional underground mining methods , and that which could would require a much greater expense and threat to human safety if surface mining methods were avoided .
Once the coal is removed , it is washed and loaded into trucks and eventually onto trains for transport across the country .
Left behind are millions , even billions , of gallons of sludge .
Black , stagnant and laden with toxic metals , the waste liquid is injected into old underground mines or impounded behind huge earthen dams that comprise “ valley fills . ”
Hundreds of feet high , these piles of rock and dirt are often dumped into seasonal streambeds , wiping out the flow of water and affecting adjacent stream quality for more than 100 miles downstream .
Bill Raney , president of the WVCA , takes issue with this notion of “ dumping . ”
“ A valley fill is one of the most sophisticated structures in earthmoving engineering , ” he said .
And as for streams obliterated when such fills are placed in hollows ?

“ Those are n’t streams , ” said Rocky Hackforth , Pritchard ’s vice president of operations and general manager at Four Mile .
Because they only run when it rains , for instance , they are “ ephemeral streams , ” a term Raney offered , and thus do not meet the definition of a “ navigable ” waterway off limits to dumping under the Clean Water Act .
Currently , law exists to prohibit mining activity within 100 feet of a stream .
But the law is blatantly flouted on a regular basis by mountaintop removal operations that skirt the Act through claims that such ephemeral run-offs are exempt from the legal provision .
“ Reclaimed ” Kayford Mountain MTR site
The semantics of reclamation
Reclamation standards require that mining companies restore the land to a close approximation of its “ original contours , ” including reinstating streams , but in most cases what results is merely a layer of grass seed tossed over the topsoil - barren moonscape .
And even industry leaders admit that attempts to recreate vital streams that offer a natural habitat for fish and other aquatic life have been less than successful .
Jordon ’s operation has received recognition for industry best practices in reclamation , however , and a survey of the no-longer - active sections of the Four Mile Mountain mine show 10 - to15 - foot tall native trees that appear to be coming back nicely .
“ Our success rate with reforestation has been very , very good , ” Jordon said .
Of 6000 acres under lease to Pritchard , 2200 have been mined and reclaimed so far .
“ We ’re here to recover the resources that we ’ve been blessed with in West Virginia and then to put it back , ” Jordon said .
But to suggest that such replanting will do anything more than provide a veneer of green for decades to come defies reason .
It has taken a thousand years to generate the layer of topsoil on the Appalachians , and thousands more to evolve the multitude of species of flora and fauna that reside in the undisturbed forest .
Just because wild turkeys and deer “ immediately ” return to the reclaimed site , according to Hackworth , it ’s hard to imagine convincing anyone that the scale and scope of damage inflicted has been mitigated .

In other cases , there is no mandate to restore the land to any semblance of its original character under the Interior Department ’s 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act if a “ higher and better use ” can be demonstrated .
This includes economic uses of flat property deemed to benefit the public with the construction of airstrips , schools , prisons , shopping centers and golf courses .
The previous , largely vertical landscape was only useful for hunting or timber , while flattened mountaintops expand the range of uses and thus the value of the land , say proponents .
Larry Gibson , and many residents of coal country whose mountain roots and cultural heritage go back centuries , disagree .
At any rate , less than 5 percent of mountaintop removal sites have undergone any sort of economic development , despite the former coal mines being touted by industry and government as ‘ gold mines ’ for commercial growth .
The National Mining Association now estimates that 14 to 15 percent of the nation ’s coal production comes from mountaintop removal mining .
In Appalachia , the number of surface mines now exceeds underground operations .
The effects of such extreme methods on the face of the land in Appalachia are profound .
But the effects on Appalachia ’s people are also deeply disturbing , as Part III of this series will examine .
Coming up :
Part III : The poor are always downstream
Part IV : The tenacity of hope

Are the Big Three worth saving ?
The U.S. auto industry ’s downward spiral has accelerated dramatically in recent weeks .
In a desperate bid for solvency , General Motors Corp. is seeking a merger with Chrysler .
Chrysler has talked with Renault and Nissan about partnerships .
And now Ford Motor Co. , GM and Chrysler -- backed by Michigan lawmakers -- are lobbying Washington to give them cash , implying that failure to provide a bailout could doom the industry to bankruptcy .
Congress last month approved $ 25 billion in loan guarantees for automakers , and rules for those loans are being drafted .
But the companies say they need more -- now .
GM , Ford and Chrysler are burning through cash far more quickly than they ’re bringing it in , sales have fallen off a cliff , and none of them has been able to borrow money in months because of the credit crisis .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday that officials at the Treasury , Energy and Commerce departments were discussing aid to automakers .
Options may include buying equity stakes in the companies , providing more loans , guaranteeing their borrowing or buying troubled auto loans .
Bush administration officials , she added , were “ working as quickly as we possibly can ” to speed disbursement of the loans .

A Ford Credit spokeswoman said Monday that the company had applied for new short - term loans offered by the Federal Reserve to businesses having trouble borrowing .
Recent news reports indicate that GM and Chrysler are seeking about $ 10 billion in government funds to support their merger .
Meanwhile , the drumbeat of bad news continued .
Rating firm Moody ’s downgraded Chrysler and GM debt Monday for the second time in three months , as well as the debt of Ford ’s lending arm , citing “ the pace and severity of erosion in the U.S. automotive sector ” and suggesting that the companies may have difficulty remaining solvent through 2009 .
With about 200,000 U.S. employees , hundreds of thousands more abroad and $ 400 billion in annual revenue among the Big Three , the prospect of failure by any of them is worrisome .
Yet there is considerable debate about what might happen if they did fail .
Some analysts , economists and industry insiders predict a financial cataclysm , while others foresee little more than a shift of the industry to foreign companies such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Some argue that , in the long term , the U.S. economy would be better off moving past automobile making .

“ A failure from the Big Three would be a huge , huge hit , ” said Donald Grimes , a research specialist at the University of Michigan .
“ But there ’s a real question about whether there ’s room for all of them . ”
Others posit that the failure of just one of the Big Three would send shock waves through the entire manufacturing sector that could devastate suppliers and freeze up the other two carmakers .
Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost .
“ If Ford or GM goes down , you take a 2 - million - job hit ” that would also dump hundreds of thousands of retirees on the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. , said David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research .
Chrysler and GM will be responsible for an estimated $ 90 billion in pension and health insurance benefits by 2017 .
This month , the center began running what it calls catastrophe studies to predict the consequences of an automaker ’s failure .
The studies project a toll of up to 2 % of gross domestic product .
“ The hit to the economy is $ 200 [ billion ] to $ 300 billion , ” Cole said .

The Big Three ’s slow loss of market share to foreign brands sped up in the 1990s .
In the 1970s , GM controlled more than 40 % of the U.S. market ; today , foreign carmakers account for 51 % of U.S. sales .
What ’s more , most foreign automakers have plants in the U.S.
So far this year , 27 % of the cars bought in the United States were built in U.S. plants owned by foreign carmakers .
That , says David Gregory , law professor at St. John ’s University and a former labor representative for Ford , clearly indicates where the industry is headed .
Because companies such as Nissan Motor Co. , with a huge operation in Tennessee , and BMW , which builds vehicles in South Carolina , have erected plants in areas where labor is inexpensive and local laws make it difficult to establish unions , they have a huge cost advantage over Detroit .
Last fall the Big Three renegotiated their contracts with the United Auto Workers union , imposing a two - tier wage structure that is more competitive with foreign automakers .
But they wo n’t see most of the benefits until 2010 .

“ The reality is that Japanese and European automakers are already in the U.S. in a big way , ” Gregory said .
“ They can more than make up the capacity lost by the closure of the Big Three .
I ’d say they could do it in five years or less . ”
He and others contend that companies such as Toyota would quickly fill the void for supplier giants such as Lear Corp. and Johnson Controls Inc. , particularly if the economy recovers enough to boost sales to pre-2008 levels .
For laid - off autoworkers willing to relocate , they might even offer employment .
Essentially , the theory goes , the net effect on employment would be nil .
“ After a period of adjustment , it would basically be a wash , ” said the University of Michigan ’s Grimes .
Romain Wacziarg , economics professor at UCLA ’s Anderson School of Management , takes the premise a big step further .
He suggests that building any cars -- be they Toyotas or Chevys -- in the U.S. no longer makes sense because they can be built more efficiently in semi-skilled labor markets such as Mexico .

He compares automaking to shipbuilding and steelmaking , which were huge in the U.S. decades ago but ultimately moved overseas , forcing development of new industries or specialized remnants of the departed industries .
“ You have very severe short - term effects on communities , ” Wacziarg said .
“ But in the long run , the economy learns to specialize in new activities that have a higher value .
Pittsburgh reinvented itself after steel .
Detroit may have to do the same . ”
As U.S. bulk steelmaking ceded to specialty steels , so could U.S. automaking focus on cutting - edge vehicles such as hybrids and electric cars .
“ I think carmaking in the U.S. will continue to exist in some form , ” said Elon Musk , chairman and chief executive of San Carlos - based electric carmaker Tesla Motors .
“ There ’s some fundamental restructuring to be done though . ”
Advertisement
For those who work in the auto business , such a transition is unthinkable .
“ If you ’re looking at identifying an essential part of the economy , we would insist that this industry still plays a huge role , ” said Greg Martin , a GM spokesman .
“ Any plan to stabilize the economy would have to encompass the U.S. auto industry . ”
That ’s very much on the mind of Rep. Dale Kildee ( D - Mich . ) .
He joined seven other members of Michigan ’s congressional delegation in sending a letter last week to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke urging the two to “ use their broad regulatory authority ” to “ promote liquidity ” for U.S. carmakers .
“ There ’s hardly a congressional district in the nation that is n’t affected by the Big Three , ” said Kildee , the son of a UAW member who helped pass the $ 1.5 - billion bailout of Chrysler in 1979 .
He said he ’d push Congress to fast - track disbursement of the $ 25 billion in guaranteed loans and ask for $ 25 billion more .
“ It ’s not just the auto industry we ’re helping ; it ’s the entire industry of this country . ”
Michigan would be the epicenter of an automaker collapse .
The state already has the second - highest unemployment rate in the country , 8.7 % , compared with 6.1 % nationwide .
After years of job losses , much of the workforce has migrated elsewhere : Detroit ’s population is now barely 900,000 , down from 1.8 million in 1950 .
Recent estimates suggest the state could lose 60,000 more jobs should one of the Big Three fall .
Advertisement
In the wake of the federal bailouts of Wall Street and insurer American International Group Inc. , experts feel little doubt that some sort of government aid to carmakers will be forthcoming .
With GM and Ford spending cash at a rate of $ 1 billion a month , it remains to be seen whether an infusion of taxpayer dollars will stop the bleeding .
Economist Gregory said any bailout might be pouring money down a hole .
“ The damage to the public psyche of losing GM , Ford or Chrysler is incalculable , and the effect on whatever is left of the Rust Belt will be even worse , ” he said .
“ But the truth is , our economy does n’t depend on cars , not anymore .
The only question is how painful the transition will be . ”

It 's one step forward , one step back for local government snooping , as new figures reveal the extent of Council spying on residents , and Bury comes a cropper to the tune of ( allegedly ) £ 100,000 for its secret filming activities .
However , those who believe they have a divine right to intrude into everyone else ’s lives seem remarkably coy when asked questions about their own activities .
First the bad news .
An investigation by The Sunday Telegraph suggests that three - quarters of local authorities have used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) 2000 over the past year .
The Telegraph put in a Freedom of Information request to Councils , seeking to identify which Councils had used their RIPA powers .
Out of the 115 who responded , 89 councils had done so in the last 12 months .
RIPA was introduced originally to tackle serious crime and terrorism , granting Councils the right to place residents and businesses under surveillance , trace telephone and email accounts and even carry out undercover surveillance .
But it has serious flaws , mostly the work of David Blunkett in 2003 , which have led to Councils now using their powers to tackle such life - threatening issues as littering , benefit fraud and parents abusing their school catchment areas .
Scariest of all , a number of Councils – including Dudley and County Durham – are using the Act as a means to recruit child informers .
Undercover children , armed with hidden surveillance equipment , were sent into shops to carry out illegal purchases of cigarettes and alcohol .
This seems to be separate and in addition to a new drive by Councils to encourage children to snoop on their neighbours for money : children as young as eight are being offered incentives of up to £ 500 to denounce miscreants who fail to obey Council diktats on waste collection .
Against this backdrop , the assurances of Sir Jeremy Beecham , acting chairman of the Local Government Association , ring rather hollow .
He claimed that " these crime - fighting powers ... are only to be used to tackle residents ' complaints about serious offences " .
" Councils do not use these powers to mount fishing expeditions , ” Beecham further pointed out .
Obviously not .
After all , why carry out fishing expeditions when entrapment is so much more effective ?
It is therefore not without a certain degree of lip- curling irony that El Reg must also report the fine dished out to Bury Metropolitan Council , who used their RIPA powers to video a crew of refuse collectors accused of “ incorrectly emptying a dustbin ” .
The day when it becomes a crime for ‘ walking on the cracks in the pavement ’ and ‘ looking at people in a funny way ’ must surely not be far off .
The binmen ’s reign of terror began , according to the Council , when they devised a dastardly plan to remove trade waste from the premises of a local newsagent – even though the shopkeeper had not paid for this service .
Yet the extent of their wickedness did not end there .
The Council further claimed that they were rewarded with a bottle of strawberry - flavoured mineral water from their local Axis of Evil .
Following their sacking by the Council , the binmen took their case to an Industrial Tribunal .
This was due to take place in June this year but the men reached a settlement – believed to be not unadjacent to £ 100,000 in compensation - just three days before it was due to begin .
A Bury Council spokesman said : “ The council has a duty to investigate allegations that have properly been made .
The council considers that the use of its powers under the RIPA in this case were proportionate and lawful . ”
What Bury refuse to say is just how much local taxpayer money was wasted on this fiasco .
As part of the agreement , they are prevented from revealing exactly how much the council paid them .
In vain , El Reg inquired how much and , more to the point , on what grounds they thought they had the right to withhold this information from the public .
But answer – from Bury officially , as well as local Council leaders – came there none .
So there you have it .
Snooping by Councils = good .
Information on how Councils spend our money = doubleplus ungood . ®
Pete Warren explains how a forensic specialist can retrieve data from your hard drive - even if you think you 've deleted everything - that reveals a great deal about you
The first time that I really became aware of computer forensics was around eight years ago when I arranged for some hard drives I had bought from a boot fair to be examined by Professor Neil Barrett , an expert in the field .
The results were memorable .
When Barrett rang me to say that he had found account details for a Paul McCartney - on a hard drive discarded by a merchant bank - I was prepared for the inevitable teasing .
" Sure , Neil , I suppose there must be quite a few Paul McCartneys . "
" Yes , I suppose there are , " he replied .
" Not too many called ' Sir ' , though . "
Spy in the machine
Your hard drive is watching you : it 's the spy in the machine .
It records all you do online - where you go , what you look at , what you read and write .
And that data can live on even if you think you 've wiped it away .
Like a traitor , your hard drive could reveal far more about you than you ever wanted it to .
The machine I use to inspect hard drives is a purpose - built computer with a reasonably powerful processor and a hard drive of its own with 1 terabyte of storage .
It cost £ 2,000 and it's the equivalent of a custom car , with quick - release sliding panels and drive cases for easy loading of the hard drives I am asked to look at .
Most importantly , it has computer forensic software - which cost another £ 2,000 .
Mine was supplied by Access Data , a company which believes that computer forensics will be one of new growth areas of computing .
Since we found the drive with McCartney 's details on it , I have worked with BT , Sims Lifecycle Services and Glamorgan University ( where I 'm doing an MSc ) to alert people to the risks of disposing of drives with valuable data on them - such as company records , personal emails , the complete personal lives of families - and even enough on people 's sexual interests for them to be blackmailed ( Dead disks yield live information ) .
I pick drives to examine - acquired at car boot sales or dumps - randomly .
The first task is to connect a write - blocker , which prevents any data being written to the drive .
This ensures that the investigator cannot be accused of putting anything on a disk that could be a crime scene .
That 's not melodramatic .
In each of the past four years we have conducted our survey , we have found drives containing paedophile information , which have been turned over to the police and have resulted in prosecutions .
The next task is to image the drive - simply , copying it on to your own drive so you can start to go through it .
Another task is to make an MD5 hash of the original drive , a unique number generated from its bits and bytes .
This is to verify that the image is the same as the original : the two should have the same MD5 hash .
The Access Data software ignores the operating system , instead talking directly to the drive 's file allocation system and master boot records .
It sorts everything into groups - by type , category and extension .
Email is extracted and lumped together , as are graphics .
You can search for specific data such as a date or name .
" It 's like The Sims , " says Dr Andrew Jones , head of computer security at BT Exact .
" Instead of going through the front door , you take the roof off and you look down on the drive from above . "
Then it 's a laborious process going through each file .
It 's a boring and painstaking process - until you start to unearth the gems .
I start with the graphics files and documents , but the real pros go to the slack space - where all of the odds and ends of files end up , a dustbin of half - files and bits of data that people think they have deleted .
These can help you get an idea of what the computer has been used for and where other data - the stuff people want to hide - might be .
Good riddance ?
Most people think the delete key gets rid of those files , but it does n't - it simply tells the computer that that space is available to be written over again .
The file often is still all there , waiting to compromise its former owner .
If the drive is not encrypted , the software opens up the computer easily .
I can order everything by date and time ; I can see the email that provoked a web search , the item that was then bought .
It feels like being able to see inside the mind of the former owner of the drive .
And do n't think that you can erase your tracks by deleting the browser history : even if you wiped the cache : a hexadecimal editor can help the investigator decode the traces left behind even after you 've deleted it .
You start to recognise other people who are using the computer .
On one drive I quickly identified the owner from her email .
But there was someone else searching the web for clothes for Barbie dolls .
I soon identified the most likely person making those web searches - there were pictures of a small girl on the drive .
A closer look told me her name .
Other details followed : soon I knew her age and what school she goes to .
Inside her mind
By this time I knew her mother 's name too , and what her interests are , what her fascinations are and what goes on in the secret recesses of her head .
All this was revealed to me by her web searches - and her visits to websites of a sexual nature .
She has been deceitful : I can see lies in the emails that she has sent , because she has been trying to sell something to a lot of people at the same time and told each that she was only dealing with them .
People are using computers without realising that their computers are constantly taking snapshots of their lives .
The information could compromise them financially as well as personally : on drives we found two years ago were the social security numbers of most of the employees of the UK branch of a multinational company .
We could have stolen each person 's financial identities .
Some tribes in Africa do not like people taking their photos because they think that the camera takes a part of their being .
A computer does much the same .
When you work in computer forensics , and when you hold a hard drive in your hands , you hold someone 's life in your hands .
How to secure your disk
1 Use encryption .
Vista Ultimate has BitLocker ; Mac OSX has FileVault .
There is also TrueCrypt , which is free and cross-platform .
2 Use secure erase programs such as blancco ; for a list , see howtowipeyourdrive.com .
3 When you 've finished with your computer , securely wipe it and then reinstall the operating system from scratch .
Or remove the hard drive and smash it with a hammer .
Last week Peter Graves ( the original author of ABCL ) mailed me that he is n't able to hold the maintainers position for ABCL .
Therefore , he offered me the commit bit ( and maintainers role ) .
See also the mail at the end of this one .
I 'd like to use the opportunity to thank Peter for getting ABCL into existance , maintaining it for a long time already .
At the same time , I 'd like to thank him for the trust he 's giving me with the project .
Since I 've been set up correctly to maintain the project here on SF last week , I guess it 's time to outline how I view the project and my new role .
The project has been - at least from what I 've seen from it - pretty much a one - man show .
Even more reason to applaud Peter .
Looking at my own availability , I wo n't be able to deliver the same amount of resources to the project .
That does not necessarily mean a slow down on development speed , however : I 'd like the project to be a group effort where we can all enjoy the efforts of others and others can benefit from ours .
What does that mean ?
Mainly : * It means that I 'd like a maintenance team to grow around ABCL in due course .
* Reporting bugs is still fine , of course , but if it goes with a patch : you have a higher chance of the resolution to be applied .
Next to that : I read this list on a daily basis ( European timezones ) , so answers should be available within reasonable time lines .
Do you have a reaction to this mail ?
Comments ?
Suggestions ?
Objection ?
Please respond !
Bye , Erik .
Why did I only talk about ABCL in the above ?
Well , to be honest : I 'm really interested in ABCL and very little in J .
Are you interested in J ?
Step up and join the team !

Unfortunately I do n't have such a general description , and I 'm not in a position to write one now .
I trust your judgement !
On a brighter note , I 'm not really going anywhere ; I just do n't have the time or spare mental capacity to work on ABCL ( or XCL ) right now .
That might change in the future ( but do n't count on it ) .

Well Michael is simultaneously the most terrible yet the most awesome teenage boyfriend ever !
Also , it 's funny how what he 's thinking during the " pondering " scene is so out of left - field from what we would typically think it is both funny and awesome .
Great job !
It came to me suddenly and , frankly , quite disturbingly .
But the truth could n’t be denied any longer — I may have been a Muslim and just did n’t realize it .
This epiphany — to use a word from my alternative Christian identity — came to me after reading many of the emails floating around regarding the Presidential race .
I had to be honest and put myself to the same test as the candidates .
Here are the facts , shameful as they are :
* It was not until the fifth grade in Jackson , Mississippi , that I entered a Christian school ( an Episcopal elementary school . )
Prior to that , I attended schools with no religious affiliation .
And we all know what that means .
As a Muslim , I would have had no conflict attending these non-denominational schools .
* Some of my best friends growing up in Mississippi were of Lebanese origin .
There are pictures that exist today of me together with Lebanese Americans wearing uniforms of a distinct military design .
There are some who maintain that these were Boy Scout uniforms , but that could very well have been a clever ruse .
We even went on survival training missions together as members of the suspect Boy Scout Order of the Arrow .
We were well trained in the use of firearms .
Many metal bunnies died at the Mississippi State Fair .
* In junior high school — a non-Christian public school , I must confess — we played against a team who were called the Crusaders and I tried very hard to inflict physical and psychological damage on the Crusaders .
We cursed the Crusaders and questioned the honor of their mothers .
* From my formative years as a grad student at Oxford , where there were many Muslims , there exist photographs of me attending a lecture entitled , “ The History of Islam . ” I was spotted many times riding my motorcycle in the vicinity of the Mosque on Bath Road .
That I was visiting a girlfriend who lived nearby may only have been a clever deep cover deception .
As proof of my success as a Muslim organizer , there are now four Mosques in Oxford , where there was only one when I was a student .
* Upon deep reflection , I admit that I am unable to give my exact whereabouts on April 15 , 1991 .
That is the day , as we all know , that the largest Mosque in New York City was opened .
It is located on East 96th Street and I had an apartment just three blocks away on East 93rd Street .
* When asked , I would be forced to admit that I am aware that some guy named Mohammad founded the Muslim religion .
* In a devastating admission , even knowing the above , I attended fights and cheered for Mohammad Ali on more than one occasion .
I did so even when he was fighting known Christians like Smokin ’ Joe Frazier .
I confess to yelling , “ Kill ‘ em ! ” in the 11th round of the second Ali-Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden .
* I like pita bread .
All of this is terribly difficult to come to terms with , but facts are stubborn things , as I read somewhere , maybe in the Koran .
In this moment of national crisis , this is not the time for self - deception .
I can only ask forgiveness and understanding .
To atone , I promise to argue that Ali only won the “ Thrilla in Manila ” because there are so many Muslims in the Philippines and clearly the whole thing was rigged .
I will also cheer for the Crusaders in their next game , whomever they are playing .
Thank you for your understanding .
Let the healing commence .

Officials in Los Angeles announced that they prepare to implement a water - conservation plan .
This will include the limitations on watering lawns and washing cars as well as recycling sewage water .
Previous proposal of recycling waste water and refilling drinking supplies to control water usage due to water sources shortage was criticized and delayed .
This time city officials are determined to introduce advanced recycling technology to bring up to 4.9 gallons of treated sewage water to drinking standards by year 2019 .
The initiative could cost around $ 2 billion and will affect many aspects of daily life of the residents .
People will be encouraged to switch to low water - consuming washing machines and urged to water lawns and wash vehicles at certain time and in certain amounts .
It is also expected to introduce new technology for water conservation in homes and businesses .
This includes waterless urinals , weather - sensitive sprinkler systems and porous parking lot paving to filter water into groundwater supplies .
Officials said that restrictions made after 1990s drought would be introduced again , but this time with even more limitations due to impending water shortage and 15 percent increase in demand by 2030 .
Other cities are going to follow this initiative too and cut water usage and restrict waste .
Up to $ 1 billion would be invested to recycle wastewater and refill underground water supplies .
In 1990s when this system was introduced , it was criticized as " toilet - to - tap " method .
Now , experts said that new technology will make a difference and residents should face this fact .
The water plan is to be improved and vetted by the City Council to specify the costs and how the program would be financed .

MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
Spanish police have arrested 121 men and seized millions of computer files in the country 's biggest operation against child pornography on the Internet .
Investigators uncovered a worldwide network that was trading millions of files .
Authorities are looking at 96 others but they have not been placed into custody yet , Manuel Vazquez , the national police chief of the technology investigative brigade , Wednesday .
Eight - hundred police officers participated in the raids on more than 200 homes in most of Spain 's provinces .
The operation was conducted in cooperation with federal police in Brazil , which uncovered a worldwide file - sharing network that was trading millions of files in 75 countries .
During their search , officers uncovered computer images of young children in sexually explicit positions , Vazquez said .
Some of the pictures depict rape , police said .
Two of the men arrested used their nephews , who were under 10 years of age , for the photographs , Vazquez said .
The men run a gamut of professions : commercial pilots , school janitors , taxi drivers and bank workers , Vazquez said .
Four of them were under the age of 18 .
The suspects also include a worker in Spain 's spy agency , the National Intelligence Center ( known by its Spanish acronym CNI ) , and a national police officer , a national police source told CNN .
Watch more on the bust »
The suspects have been charged with distribution of pornographic material .
If convicted , they can face up to eight years in prison .
Spanish authorities have conducted a series of raids in recent years against child pornography rings , often with the assistance of overseas law enforcement agencies .
Soon after the email exchange , Mr Read received a pre-court letter from Mr Jones , demanding that he agree the comments were unreasonable .
The businessman warned him that if he did not respond within seven days , he would be taken to court and face costs of £ 175 as well as " substantial " lawyers ' fees .

If Obama is elected , wo n't we have our most left - wing government ever ?
No .
On the face of it this would be the most left - wing government ever , no ?
No .
Am I missing something ?
Yes indeed you are , Mr. Scarecrow .
Obama is a centrist on key issues like relatively minor forms of market regulation , leaving Roe alone , and a less messed - up heathcare system .
Polls consistently show that on most issues the country is to the left of Obama .
But this is what happens when you give Internet access to a bunch of clowns who think " do n't start that stupid war " is the same thing as Marxism .
Your 21st - Century Intellectual Conservative Movement : red-baiting , race - baiting , masturbating .
Fwap fwap fwap indeed .
( For the record I 'd be delighted if Obama were more progressive . )
When 116 million people recently stood up against worldwide poverty , their coordinated cry failed to make big headlines -- but they did inspire Irish rocker and activist Bono to write a new song for his group U2 .
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday , Bono said the Stand Up and Take Action campaign in 131 countries had moved him to start creating a song called " Stand Up . "
" It 's not finished yet but it 's inspired by this concept of stand up .
It 's a little diamond , though , " Bono said , speaking by telephone from Los Angeles .
" It 's not a ' let 's hold hands and the world is a better place sort of song . '
It 's more kick down the door of your own hypocrisy , " he said .
Organizers said the 116 million people who called on global leaders not to forget their promise to reduce world poverty and hunger by 2015 , represented nearly two percent of the world 's population and was a Guinness World Record " for the biggest mass mobilization on a single issue . "
World leaders set a series of agreed targets on poverty , education , health , equality and malnutrition known as Millennium Development Goals or MDGs , eight years ago .
But developing countries fear rich nations will use the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression as an excuse to scale down their promises .
African leaders have already accused rich donor nations of not keeping to their aid commitments , which has become critical to combat the effects of higher world food prices .
" Although they were not a legal contract , and we wish they were , there is a moral contract that was made , " Bono said .
" To break a promise to yourself , to your partner , to your family , a politician to his constituents , are all bad things to do -- but it's a heinous crime to make a promise to the poorest most vulnerable people on earth and break it .
That 's just not acceptable , " he said .
He said while the MDGs may be " the worst acronym in the history of activism , " the Stand Up and Take Action events around the world on Oct. 17 to 19 showed that people knew what they stand for .
" The numbers show that people are aware that those promises were made and why politicians can't think 'oh we can get away with it because no one really knows about it ' "
Bono said .
For years , Bono has used his celebrity to raise money and draw attention to global poverty and highlight how aid , when used properly , can help prevent and treat diseases like malaria and HIV / AIDS .
" It is dreadful to think that we could take the foot off the pedal at our end and they run out of road on theirs , " he said of concerns that less aid will slow Africa 's progress .
Still , Bono said the region had demonstrated significant economic potential after several years of strong economic growth , led by a new generation of leaders .
" I have faith in Africans who are becoming very adept at this balancing act between necessary aid flows and realizing that business , commerce and investment can take you out of catastrophe , " said Bono .

The money system is eerily Borg - like .
Because it structurally requires growth , it works relentlessly to assimilate all forms of capital .
The natural consequence is that everything must be for sale .
Values of freedom , independence , self - reliance , and even conservation are subservient to the goal of growth — which is really just growth of the financial Borg , not human welfare or the security of a habitable planet .
The Borg is a hive - like hybrid swarm of humanoid species , turned partially robotic .
They are distinctly goal oriented towards “ assimilation ” of all other humanoids and press themselves relentlessly with the creepy mantra “ Resistance is futile . ”
This is an allegory explaining some of the monetary issues associated with the current financial crisis .
It was written by Jason Bradford .
Jason was an academic biologist who " retired " at a young age to become a community organizer and learn how to farm with peak oil in mind .
He also hosts a biweekly radio show on public radio called The Reality Report .
How the Money System Depends on Growth
Modern money is not based on any physical assets or intrinsic value .
Instead it is called a “ fiat currency , ” which in Latin means , “ let it be done . ”
The government , or law , decrees that the face value of money is what it is .
Money is created through forms of credit and debt , i.e. , when banks make loans and debtors accept them , the money instantly exists .
Only a fiat system can allow this form of money creation .
Money is used as a claim on real things , like labor and material goods .
The money system is supposed to be regulated , usually via central bank interest rate policies , to make sure that what money can purchase , or what value it holds , does n’t change too rapidly .
When money changes in value quickly it is difficult to plan , and a panic may even occur that could collapse the system .
A collapse can happen , for example , when too many people try to collect their bank deposits at once .
Banks do n’t keep all the money given to them by depositors , only some portion of it .
This is called “ fractional reserve banking . ”
Banks have to constantly manage their reserves , which means juggling how much money they lend out , how much is coming in from new deposits , and how many of their loans are being repaid .
If a bank is having trouble with cash flow and can’t keep up its reserves internally , it can borrow money from other banks that have more than they need at the moment .
If too many banks are having trouble , the Federal Reserve ( in the U.S. ) can step in and lend .
The money system needs to grow because money is lent into existence with interest .
All borrowers need to come up with principal plus interest .
The interest portion of the money supply needs to be created in the future or too many borrowers will default .
How is more money created in the future ?
Through more debt !
Debt and money supply will necessarily rise exponentially until they collapse .
And collapse is inevitable because money is still a claim on real , tangible things , like labor and resources , which in the real world are finite .
1
Real World Growth Ca n’t Keep Up with Money
A human being eats and grows , and produces wastes in the process .
The energy and mineral resources of an animal are called food .
If someone does n’t get enough food and they are a child , they fail to grow .
As an adult they may lose weight or starve .
It is also important that a person does n’t grow too fast , and at some point stops altogether or health will decline — possibly leading to death .
Fig .
2 . In the real world , getting too big has consequences and can lead to loss of performance and breakdown .
The economy does something similar by consuming resources and causing pollution .
The energy inputs of our economy are called gasoline , natural gas , hydroelectricity , etc .
Other resources our economy claims include mineral ores , forests , and , as I explain further below … people !
And just as a human should stop growth due to physical constraints , an economy can become too large relative to the support structure of the ecosystems around it .
Many old civilizations ended up in the archeological trash heap because they over taxed agricultural soils and deforested too extensively .
What is happening in the financial world is that the claims the money system is making on debt holders are greater than their ability to pay .
Most of the blame right now is being placed on a bubble in lending to purchase homes .
But is the sub prime mortgage fiasco the only explanation for money troubles ?
I do n’t think so .
What we are seeing reflects a general insolvency of the global financial system .
Part of the problem is that investors , business people and governments did n’t foresee that crude oil production would flatten in 2005 and prices would go from $ 10 per barrel in 1998 to $ 100 per barrel in 2008 .
Or that China and India would consume so much so fast that nearly all forms of commodities would rise in parallel with oil prices .
When credit is extended over a long time horizon , as in a home mortgage , the underlying assumption is that the future will be akin to the past .
Inflation will be relatively modest and incomes will keep up so that a steady flow of cash can go back to banks and keep up their reserve balances .
Obviously this has n’t occurred : prices rose faster than incomes and the ability to repay debts faltered .
As an example , I learned at the 2008 ASPO - USA conference that the airline industry was given credit to buy planes and enlarge airports with the expectation that crude oil would n’t be higher than $ 30 per barrel .
When banks see that many of the loans they previously extended ca n’t be repaid in full , they become less able to loan out more funds in order to preserve cash reserves .
Bankers are currently asking the governments ( in the U.S. and elsewhere ) to remove many of the bad loans from their books so they can become less stingy extending credit .
In the short term this could help banks and borrowers create more money .
But this move would do nothing to change the underlying dynamics of the situation , only move the debt plus interest obligations elsewhere , such as to taxpayers .
What Changes Hath the Borg Wrought ?
The financial Borg is n’t as creepy looking as in Star Trek , and that ’s why we have trouble seeing it .
Instead , money works through slow , steady pressure that manifests itself in Borg - like assimilation over time .
Think of America circa 1950 , where mom stayed home and cooked and cleaned and everyone watched each other 's kids .
Now we have fast food and cleaning services and professional child care and all adults join the labor pool to pay money for what they once did themselves .
Mom and Dad are now Borgs .
Imagine small , mostly self - sufficient farmers .
They live on inherited land and have little need to buy anything , including food .
Now put in place trade policies and land reforms that lead to consolidated land holdings and encourage migration to cities where factories reside .
These once largely self - sufficient people now need to rent their shelter and buy their food .
The world ’s poor workers are now Borgs .
2
The financial Borg does two things to grow .
It promotes increasing consumption by those it has already assimilated , which results in further ecological debt , and it assimilates those on the margin and gives them prosthetic appendages to yield ever more of the species Homo colossus W. Catton .

What Next ?
The United States ( and likely other nations with negative trade balances and large foreign held debts ) is in a Catch 22 situation .
Flows of credit are so crucial for the daily functioning of our economy that it looks as though these will be preserved at all cost .
Practically , this means Federal Reserve regulated interest rates will be kept low in the short term to encourage banks to make loans .
It also looks as though " a higher power " is going to try to lift the bad loans off some bank balance sheets .
This may lower bank - to - bank lending rates which are currently very high .
The medium term risk ( within a year ) of low interest rates is a rapid collapse of the value of the dollar .
Remember that when something is in greater supply , its value declines .
Because low interest rates and huge government bailout schemes place more dollars into circulation , the owners of dollars could panic over concerns about the value of their holdings .
But the U.S. is desperately dependent upon foreign creditors .
In order to attract foreign creditors into the U.S. market with a weaker dollar , U.S. Treasury bill rates would need to be raised , which would then lead to an increase in interest rates .
Because imports of foreign resources are also crucial to the U.S. economy , a weaker dollar will make these more expensive .
The overall impact is therefore even higher inflation , perhaps hyperinflation , while the economy actually contracts .
5
It is difficult in a panicky time to step back and ask questions about the greater purpose of what we are doing .
One of the problems I have is balancing my current anxiety over the unraveling of systems that I depend on , with the knowledge that these systems are highly misguided and need radical change .
As a people , we have become very poor at distinguishing between productive and unproductive debts .
Not all debts are bad .
We probably need to have lines of credit in order to install renewable energy systems , build low energy transportation systems , and develop local food systems .
But too much of our debt does not generate future revenues and is simply wasteful , such as the military and much of the travel industry .
And much of our debt is incurred building " assets " that will be seen as liabilities once oil declines and the oceans rise , such as NAFTA superhighways or sea - level ports for trade with Asia .
My bigger worry is that current leadership will do anything to prop up what exists , such as feeble U.S. car manufacturers , rather than demand a shift in priorities .

Our Borg - like monetary system is showing us how poorly it serves our needs .
What it needs is growth — growth as measured in the " formal economy " in the form of monetary units , which is recorded in the ledger books of banks , businesses and governments .
Because this formal economy is structurally dependent upon growth , it has worked to incorporate more and more of the " informal economy , " meaning the work done without monetary reward .
Growth in the formal economy does not necessarily lead to our prosperity , and as the formal economy declines we will be back to more of the informal economy .
There will likely be much fear and real pain in the short run , but in the long run a stronger informal economy and reprioritization of investments is what we need .
And in typical human fashion , it looks like it takes a catastrophe for us to pay close enough attention to see something other than what we want to see .

If the money supply ca n’t be expanded fast enough , prices fall and cash is hoarded , which is deflation .
Financial system catastrophe can go either way .

There have been a number of previous articles that have featured either Jason 's writings or his radio interviews .
This is a link to some of them .
I want to keep this factual .
This is not an article on who should be the next President , or as these campaigns usually go , who should n’t be President .
This is a simple presentation of facts as they stand today .
Bottom line - who ’d be better for your bottom line next year ... Obama or McCain ?
The Tax Policy Center has done some serious analysis of the current tax policies of our two candidates .
You can read about it here , and download the 37 - page report here .
Of course , as these are preliminary figures they ’re likely to change a little , but not a lot .
Sam Pizzigati of the blog Too Much analysed the figures .
And the results , while not exactly surprising , do provide food for thought .
As you ’d expect , Obama ’s tax plan will be better for lower - income families .
And McCain ’s tax plan favors the wealthy .
There is a simple graph below that outlines the figures .
The analysis
First , Obama .
Under his proposed tax plan , the super - rich ( around 140,000 households or the top 0.1 % of the US population ) have a lot to worry about if he becomes President .
In fact , in 2009 the top 0.1 % will pay roughly $ 701,885 MORE in taxes than they do currently .
If you ’re making over $ 2.9 million a year , your taxes will increase to 39.2 % .
The middle - income earners ( the middle 20 % of the US , earning between $ 37,595 and $ 66,354 ) do a lot better under Obama , getting a boost of roughly $ 1042 , or around 2.4 % .
And the low - income families ( the poorest 20 % , earning below $ 18,981 ) get the biggest boost of all .
They ’ll be around $ 567 better off , an increase of 5.5 % .
Now McCain .
Under his proposal , the super - rich get a little richer .
That same 140,000 households get a 4.4 % increase in after - tax income , equating to around $ 269,364 .
The middle - income earners get a boost with McCain too , although much smaller .
They ’ll receive a 0.7 % increase , or $ 584 .
And the low - income families , well , McCain does offer them some relief .
But not much .
Around a 0.2 % increase in after - tax income , or a whopping $ 21 .
What does this mean ?
Politically , McCain is doing what Bush and Reagan did before him .
It ’s the trickle - down effect .
You give the super - rich big tax cuts , they in turn use those cuts to boost business and create jobs for the middle and lower classes .
Obama is more in another Republican ’s camp – namely , Eisenhower .
In 1959 , the wealthy paid over 45 % of their income in Federal taxes .
And around 77 % on estate wealth .
Personally , leaving all other political agendas aside , I ’d have to vote for Obama under this plan .
I would receive greater tax benefits from him than under McCain .
And if you ’re in a low income bracket , I ’m sure you ’d prefer $ 567 in your pocket rather than the $ 21 McCain is offering .
Of course , this is subject to change but the point is clear .
The more money you have , the better off you ’ll be under McCain .
If you ’re a super - rich Wisebread reader , the difference between McCain ( +$ 269,364 ) and Obama ( - $ 701,885 ) works out to $ 971,249 .
That ’s almost $ 1 million dollars !
With so much at stake for you in 2009 , I can see why you ’d vote for McCain .
But is McCain trying to buy the rich vote and maintain good relations with corporate interests ?
That ’s a story for another time .
David Tennant has announced that he is vacating the Tardis and leaving the BBC's Doctor Who series at the end of next year .
Tennant 's decision brings to an end his popular four - year tenure as the time lord .
The BBC confirmed that the Scottish actor will complete the filming of four special episodes to be screened this year and in early 2010 , as well as 2009 's Christmas special .
Tennant broke the news of his departure at the National Television Awards as he accepted the outstanding drama performance prize .
He said : " When Doctor Who returns in 2010 it wo n't be with me .
The 2009 shows will be my last playing the doctor .
" If I do n't take a deep breath and move on now , I never will . "
Speaking about his time on the show , Tennant added : " It has been the most brilliant and life - changing time .
But it 's not over yet , I have a whole other year to go .
" Thank you for being so enthusiastic about the show , for watching it , and loving it . "

Scientists in Japan claim that their country 's controversial whaling programme , which has killed thousands of minke whales since the late 1980s , has established that the animals have lost significant amounts of blubber .
Measurements taken from more than 4,500 slaughtered minkes show they are getting thinner at a worrying speed , the researchers say .
The team from the Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo , set up to analyse the results of the scientific whaling programme , says its study offers the first evidence that global warming could be harming whales , because it restricts food supplies .
They say the discovery could only have been made by killing the animals .
Crucially for the Japanese , the results have been published in a mainstream western scientific journal , Polar Biology .
Campaigners say publication could offer scientific whaling a veneer of respectability , and bolster Japan 's efforts to hunt more whales .
They fear Japan could use the results to support efforts to hunt endangered humpback whales for the first time in 50 years .
The study claims the recovering humpback population in the Southern Ocean could also be hurting the minkes because of " interference " between the two species as they compete for food .
Campaigners and politicians say Japan 's scientific whaling programme is commercial whaling by another name and is unethical and unnecessary .
Lars Walloe , a Norwegian whale expert at the University of Oslo , who helped the Japanese team analyse the data , and an author of the study , said : " This is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive .
It indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem . "
Whales rely on blubber for energy and insulation .
The shift could already be making it more difficult to reproduce , Walloe said .
" I do n't think you could measure this by other [ non lethal ] means . "
He said the Japanese findings , and their publication , had been unpopular among scientists from nations opposed to whaling , including Britain .
Two journals refused to print the findings before they were accepted by Polar Biology , which published them online last month .
Walloe , who says he does not support the ban on commercial whaling , claimed that the journals that turned down the study did so for political , not scientific , reasons .
The findings are the most high profile of the Japanese scientific whaling programme so far .
Mark Simmonds , director of science at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , said : " Lots of dead bodies will provide robust data , so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information .
The question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed .
Scientific whaling is not about science , and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it . "

Much of the chemical waste still remains in Abidjan People in Ivory Coast have expressed disappointment following a trial over the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of toxic waste in Abidjan in 2006 .
They said Trafigura , the Dutch company that shipped the waste , should have faced more scrutiny .
Two people were sentenced to 20 years and five years in jail over the waste , which was blamed for 17 deaths and widespread health complaints .
In 2007 , Trafigura paid an out - of - court settlement relating to civil claims .
The company never admitted liability , saying the $ 200 m ( £ 108 m ) payment was made out of sympathy for the Ivorian people .
In March 2008 , the Ivorian Court of Appeal ruled that there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against the company .
Class action Denis Yao Pipira , head of the Federation of Associations of Toxic waste victims in Ivory Coast , said the full truth of the incident had not come out .
" It 's absolutely necessary that the owner of the waste , the company Trafigura that chartered the Probo Koala boat [ carrying the waste ] , have a chance to be questioned for their actions and to say which Ivorians they dealt with , " he said .
The BBC's John James reports from Abidjan that satisfaction over a rare verdict being reached was tempered by frustration that some people , including high - level political figures , were not held to account .
" Me , as an individual person , I could n't get to organise the papers to bring a boat of toxic waste into Abidjan , " said one man .
" It 's not possible ! " " We do n't have justice here in Ivory Coast . "
Trafigura chartered the ship carrying the waste , which was unloaded in Ivory Coast after a failure to agree deals to get it treated in the Netherlands .
A Trafigura spokesman said the Probo Koala was calling at a number of different ports , as part of a pre-arranged route to pick up and offload gasoline cargoes .
While the Probo Koala 's slops were offloaded in Abidjan when the ship docked there , the company said independent experts had found the slops could not have caused the widespread alleged illnesses .
Trafigura said it had contracted a local firm , Tommy , to handle the waste in good faith .
The head of Tommy , Nigerian national Salomon Ugborugbo , was sentenced to 20 years in jail .
Essoin Kouao , who worked as a shipping agent at the Port of Abidjan and had recommended Tommy to the Dutch company Trafigura , received a five - year prison term .
Seven others were acquitted .
Only one person from the Trafigura group - N'Zi Kablan the head of their local partner - was called to be involved in the trial .
He was supposed to be a witness but left the country days before the trial began .
This is unlikely to be the last word on the scandal , our correspondent says .
A massive class action involving thousands of victims that is prepared in the UK could begin next year .

Titanium or Plain Ol ' Steel ?
Cut through titanium - marketing hype — take a grinder to your stuff
Despite the short - lived Seinfeld commercials and the ongoing ad blitzes , customer demand for Windows XP over Windows Vista has again prompted Microsoft to extend the Windows XP lifeline .
Microsoft stopped selling Windows XP on June 30 of this year , but Windows XP is still available at some retail outlets , including Amazon.com while supplies last .
Larger PC manufacturers can't directly sell Windows XP anymore -- except on ultra -low - cost machines -- but they can sell Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows Vista Business machines with Windows XP discs in the box or they can do a ' factory downgrade ' and install Windows XP on the Vista machines .
The original January 31 , 2009 cutoff date from Microsoft has been extended to July 31 , 2009 .
According to The Register UK , Microsoft 's hardware partners are trying to have the new deadline extended even further .
System builders -- less major PC manufacturers -- will not receive an extension .
System builders can sell machines with Windows XP that have not been downgraded from Windows Vista , but only through January 31 , 2009 .
Microsoft tried to put the best face on the move in a statement provided to CNET News .
In France , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer commented on Vista sales and businesses moving at their own pace when it comes to moving to Vista or waiting for Windows 7 , saying that it depends on the business , and it appears that most businesses are n't interested in Windows Vista .
Depending on when Windows 7 is released and how well it functions and the reception it receives , there may be more reprieves for the extension of Windows XP in the future since it appears to be the preferred operating system of choice .
We shall certainly see .

Ruth and Darren Johnston sold the family business in March A couple who put £ 1.2 m from the sale of their family business into an Icelandic bank fear they have lost the money .
The cash was Darren and Ruth Johnston 's proceeds from the sale of one of north Wales ' biggest caravan parks , Winkups at Towyn , Abergele , in Conwy county .
The couple , from near Denbigh , invested the money in an offshore bond which was placed in an Isle of Man subsidiary of a failed Icelandic bank .
The account is not guaranteed by either the British or Isle of Man governments .
The family - owned 17 - acre holiday caravan and camping park was sold earlier this year after a drop in takings last winter made them fear a recession .

However , the money was placed in an Isle of Man branch of Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander ( KSF ) , an investment banking UK subsidiary of the failed Icelandic bank Kaupthing .
Royal Skandia have told the couple in a letter : " At this time you are not able to switch money from these deposits to other assets .
We recognise that these developments will cause you considerable distress . "
Mr Johnston , 43 , said : " We 're not fat cats , risk - takers or someone gambling on the stock market , just a couple who deposited money where we were advised it would be safe .
" Many other people also have their life savings there and we feel helpless and somehow the victims of politics in all this . "
The couple , who have two young sons , said they had been told where to invest their money in a high interest account by a financial adviser .
The Johnstons also said they were facing a capital gains tax bill of £ 120,000 next March for the missing investment .
We still pay tax in this country and therefore why are n't we British savers ?
Darren Johnston Mr Johnston said he had joined a website linking depositors in the Icelandic bank .
" If you go to the website and read the stories there are some horrendous stories on there of people that had all their money , " he told BBC Radio Wales .
He said the family did have some money to get by and were also getting help from his mother .
He said he had a strong message for the UK government who he said " do n't want to know " .
" Basically I do n't believe I 'm not a British saver .
They 've made a statement saying they will not let British savers lose money in the Icelandic bank crisis .
Smaller park " I 've paid tax in this country since I had my first job with Bulmers when I was 22 .
I 'm 43 now .
" I do n't avoid tax .
The product I 'm in does not avoid tax .
We still pay tax in this country and therefore why are n't we British savers ? "
Mrs Johnston , 47 , a former hairdresser , said : " We feel very angry , frustrated and abandoned .
" We had wanted the money to tide us over the recession and then had hoped to buy a smaller park which we could manage without staff . "
Mr Johnston has written to David Jones , Conservative MP for Clwyd West , who said he was very concerned " .
The MP said : " I will write to the Treasury and do what I can to help . "
Royal Skandia said it was in talks with local authorities and the UK government about compensation schemes .
A bank spokesman said : " We are doing everything we can for our clients . "

Are you the director of some high profile movies , feel you have a piracy problem but no longer do business with MediaDefender ?
Do you want to fail , badly ?
Then maybe you should follow the lead of Darren Bousman , director of the Saw movie sequels - and ask members of the public to upload fakes files on BitTorrent sites .
Darren Bousman , director of Saw II , III , IV , and no stranger to scenes of slaughter , has been caught up in his very own BitTorrent bloodbath .
On the official forum for his up - coming movie Repo !
the Genetic Opera , Bousman has been rallying support ( pic , since it ’s deleted ) among his forum fans ( known as the ‘ Repo Army ’ ) to become some kind of highly motivated , organic peer - to - peer version of MediaDefender .
Bousman details his brilliant plan in the forum post :
People will copy and burn the REPO CD and put it out on the web on something called TORRENT SITES .
What this means to the movie is devastating .
Basically – those who MIGHT have bought the soundtrack will instead download it for free …
Thus hurting the soundtrack , and the movie .
So what can you do ?
Upload FAKE REPO albums to TORRENT sites under the REPO name .
Meaning basically people will go online to a TORRENT site and try to search for REPO .
They will find it – but alas it wont be REPO .
It will be something else …
If enough people do this – it becomes harder to STEAL the album .
Pain , something found in abundance in the Saw movies , was evident in the disorganized battle - plan that followed .
Technical discussion began , noting the need for a good fake album to have the same number of tracks as the real version .
Other suggestions to thwart the evil pirates include renaming and seeding random songs , and uploading audio recordings which preach the importance of buying the album .
After someone pointed out that people would complain about fake torrents in the comments section of torrent sites , solutions offered included the Army posting its own comments saying that the fake is n’t really a fake , and posting on real torrents to say that they were the fakes .
Both techniques were doomed to fail before they began .
One of our favorite posts was the user who offered to spam the Ares Galaxy network on her own , and unwittingly came up with the basis of a usable slogan for the fakes campaign : “ Wait a minute , did Darren just ask us to essentially Rick - Roll people in the name of Repo ?
Hell yes . ”
Sadly , even with an army of completely well - intentioned and dedicated fans plus a great slogan , victory is n’t guaranteed .
After posting some fake torrents on The Pirate Bay , it did n’t take long for the negative comments from regular Pirate Bay users to build up , and the torrents were removed .
Despite many attempts by the Army at countering with some fake comments of their own .
The ranks of the general public Repo Army went into battle against just a few pirates but were completely unprepared , and suffered a bloody end that would ’ve made Jigsaw proud .
One user seemed to be a bit more aware , posting , “ You can keep it secret or whatever method you want , it ’s not going to work .
You ca n’t fool a pirate that easy , if we just could get scene access and pre it , so it looks real . ”
Right now , the fans have regrouped and are currently marking real Demonoid torrents as containing a virus , in order to get them removed .
It does n’t seem to be working .
The Repo Army does n’t act purely against BitTorrent , since it had been previously ordered to “ Attack YouTube ” by messaging anyone on the site who uploads any part of the album , and ordering them to take the clip down .
Some fans are even creating Repo anti-piracy videos :
In the meantime the fans have ensured that the soundtrack in question , Repo !
The Genetic Opera , is currently at 22 in Amazon ’s bestsellers chart , largely thanks to 25 five - star reviews , which currently represent 100 % of the total reviews on this album .
Apparently it ’s easier to fool Amazon than the average BitTorrent site .

Joe , who is named Samuel , admits he does not have a plumber 's licence Doubt has been cast over the story of " Joe the plumber " , the man who unexpectedly became the star of this week 's US presidential debate .
Joe Wurzelbacher , of Ohio , was thrown into the spotlight after he was used by John McCain as an example of who might suffer under Barack Obama 's tax plans .
But it now emerges he is not a licensed plumber and owes $ 1,200 in back taxes .
Meanwhile , the two candidates traded jokes , not jibes , at a dinner a day after their final televised debate .
Mr Obama and Mr McCain took to the stage in New York trading wisecracks about their campaigns , in light relief to the tense atmosphere of the debate the night before .
Mr Obama retains a five - point lead over his Republican rival following Wednesday 's third and final debate , according to the latest poll by Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby on Friday .
And the Washington Post newspaper has endorsed Barack Obama , saying he has shown the right characteristics needed to take the country through a time of great economic uncertainty .
Unpaid taxes Joe Wurzelbacher , 34 , found himself at the centre of a media frenzy on Thursday after " Joe the plumber " was mentioned 26 times during the final debate .

Advertisement A week earlier , he had confronted Mr Obama at a rally , questioning the Democratic candidate on tax plans that would see him taxed more if a plumbing business he hoped to buy earned more than $ 250,000 a year .
He was held by Mr McCain in the debate as an example of an every day hard - working American who would be penalised by Mr Obama 's tax policy .
However , a bit of media digging has uncovered that Mr Wurzelbacher 's first name is actually Samuel and he does not have a plumber 's licence , although the company he works for does .
According to Tony Herrera , of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 50 in Toledo , Ohio , Mr Wurzelbacher cannot practise in Toledo without a licence - although he can work for someone with a master 's licence or in outlying areas that do not require a licence .
According to local court records , Mr Wurzelbacher also owes the state of Ohio $ 1,182.98 in personal income tax .
Mr Wurzelbacher acknowledged he did not have a plumber 's licence and admitted in one interview he was " not even close " to earning $ 250,000 .
Warm words
At a fundraiser for Catholic charities on Thursday night , Mr McCain joked that he had replaced all his campaign advisers .
" All of their positions will now be held by a man named Joe the plumber , " he said .

He also made a jokey reference to Barack Obama 's fierce rival for the Democratic candidacy , Hillary Clinton , who was also in the audience .
" I can't shake the feeling that some people here are pulling for me .
I 'm delighted to see you here tonight Hillary , " he said .
Meanwhile , Barack Obama said he needed to correct some misconceptions about his background .
" I was not born in a manger .
I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father , Jor-el , to save the Planet Earth , " he said , in a reference to Superman .
He also listed his great strength as " my humility " and his greatest weakness as being " a little too awesome " .
The annual dinner has a tradition of presidential candidates as headline speakers before the election .
Both men paid tribute to each other , with Mr Obama praising Mr McCain 's service to his country as a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Mr McCain praised Mr Obama for his bid to become the first black president .
" I can't wish my opponent luck but I do wish him well . "

There has been a certain amount of uproar about how Firefox 3 handles self - signed SSL certificates , and a certain amount of attempts to justify it .
I disagree violently with the attempts to excuse the behavior , because what it comes down to for me is that Firefox 3 has made it more attractive to have no SSL certificate at all than to have a self - signed one .
This is both insane and inane ; it does nothing to further security on the Internet , and it has basically nothing to do with the sorts of real attacks that happen today ( none of which require SSL man in the middle attacks , because people are not that suspicious ) .
( Sadly , Firefox 3 is far from alone in how it treats self - signed certificates . )
Now , man in the middle attacks are a real problem ( or at least a potential real problem ) .
But there are potential better ways right now of handling almost all of the problems that Firefox 3 is trying to confront , even if they are not as provably secure as forcing the user to jump through a succession of flaming hoops .
And imperfect but usable security is much better than perfect but unusable security .
( I do sort of sympathize with Firefox 3 , because there are hard questions .
But ultimately I think that the hard questions are being used as excuses , unless people can show that there are significant active risks , not just theoretical ones .
Real security always involves risk assessment and tradeoffs . )
· Producers ' cartel is ready to flex its collective muscle to keep prices high · Group that rose in the 70s but unravelled in the 90s is influential once more
Is it over ?
Was that the oil shock ?
Can we relax , sit back and expect our energy bills and prices at the pumps to tumble ?
It is true that the price of oil is down .
In early July , the price peaked at $ 147 a barrel .
Yesterday it hit $ 106 .
A fall of almost 30 % in two months suggests the old rule that " nothing cures high prices like high prices " may finally be working in the oil market .
Americans used less in their cars over the summer : demand in the US fell by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of this year , the largest decline for 26 years .
In the UK , Ryanair is grounding more planes this winter .
The global economy is slowing - even China , the biggest source of new demand , may soon be feeling colder breezes .
But what 's this ?
Leading members of Opec , the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , want to reduce oil supplies to keep the price high .
The 13 members of the cartel meet in Vienna next week and Iran and Venezuela have made their position clear .
" Oil supply must be well proportioned with demand , and control over Opec 's excess oil supply is an issue that must be discussed , " said Gholam Hossein Nozari , Iran 's oil minister , this week .
Translation : he does n't want to see the price fall below $ 100 .
To many in the west , the stance will seem outrageous .
Gordon Brown was furious with Opec in May , when the price was $ 135 a barrel .
" It is , as people will recognise , a scandal that 40 % of the oil is controlled by Opec , that their decisions can restrict the supply of oil to the rest of the world , and that at a time when oil is desperately needed and supply needs to expand that Opec can withhold supply from the market , " he said .
Brown sounded like a buttoned - up version of the property tycoon Donald Trump , whose regular rants against Opec have entertained viewers of US financial television channels in the past year .
" It is an illegal monopoly , " he told CNBC a few months ago .
" If businesses ever formed Opec , everybody would be put in jail .
Every time a country hits oil , they are invited into the cartel .
It 's a disgrace . "
A decade ago , the west 's view of Opec was different .
The organisation , having enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , was regarded as a spent force .
Its summits in hotels in Vienna and Geneva were dismissed as squabbles over who had been cheating on quotas by over - producing - usually Venezuela or Nigeria .
After 25 years of trying to control the oil market , Opec seemed doomed - damned by internal indiscipline and the success of the west in finding alternative supplies of oil .
Its nadir was 1998 , when Opec was persuaded to increase production quotas .
The timing was awful .
The Asian currency crisis slowed the region 's Tiger economies and the price of oil fell to close to $ 10 a barrel .
The following year , the Economist magazine famously predicted the price could be heading to $ 5 .
The world was " drowning in oil " .
Opec seemed irrelevant and powerless .
Boomtime
Then the boom started .
The 1990s were revealed as a decade of under - investment , not only by Opec but by non-Opec producers , including the big oil companies .
New fields had n't been discovered .
Refining capacity had n't been built .
Shell had over - stated its reserves .
Existing oil fields were depleting faster than expected , especially in Mexico and the North Sea .
China and India began to industrialise and to subsidise oil for their own citizens .
Demand was accelerating and supply was struggling to keep up .
The ability of the US to bully Saudi Arabia , Opec 's most important member , into increasing production quickly came under question .
The Saudis guard closely their data on the oil reserves and production capability .
Why ?
" Peak oil " theorists argue it's because the big reserves are n't as big as advertised .
Even President George Bush seemed to endorse the thought in January this year .
" If they do n't have a lot of additional oil to put on the market , it is hard to ask somebody to do something they may not be able to do , " he said .
In the autumn of 2006 , with the price having fallen from $ 75 to $ 60 a barrel , Opec demonstrated it was willing to use its newly restored influence over prices .
It briefly reduced its production quotas , a signal that it was prepared to defend a price of $ 60 a barrel .
With barely a blip along the way , the price climbed to that record of $ 147 this July .
Was that Opec alone ?
Was it the combination of growth in China and India and the western oil companies ' inability to increase production ?
Was it the weakness of the dollar , creating an incentive for producers to leave their appreciating asset in the ground rather than turn it into a depreciating currency ?
Was it a classic investment bubble , fuelled by the growth of financial speculation in the futures market ?
Probably some or all of the above .
Either way , the approach of $ 100 is a critical test of Opec 's current mood and power .
In the old days , the Saudis were the voice of restraint .
After the oil shock of the 1970s , the Saudi oil minister Ahmed Yamani urged fellow members to be cautious , arguing that high prices would lead to a reduction in demand and cause the west to become more fuel - efficient .
Yet the Saudi ruling families have a huge social welfare programme to fund - as a rough guess , say some analysts , a price of $ 70 , if sustained for a long period , would now create political tension .
Add $ 20 or so for the economies of Iran and Venezuela , also built on the single commodity of oil .
" Could the price go below $ 100 , to $ 90 or even $ 80 ? , " asks Mike Wagstaff , chief executive of Venture Production , a North Sea oil and gas producer .
" Well , yes , it could but I can't see it going much lower than that .
Opec has shown itself to be a much more disciplined organisation over the past seven or eight years . "
He also argues that " the reality is that the west can't afford the price to go much below $ 100 because people need to fund investment . "
His point is that the industry 's costs have risen as oil has become harder to find and to produce .
A deep - water rig used for drilling in the deep waters off Brazil or west Africa costs $ 600,000 to $ 700,000 a day to hire ; three or four years ago , the price was $ 200,000 to $ 350,000 .
Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs calculate that the marginal cost of production , a critical figure for all commodities , now lies between $ 80 and $ 90 a barrel .
Hugo Navarro of Capital Economics expects to see a classic fudge from Opec next week .
He thinks official quotas will be left unchanged but actual production will be quietly cut in the coming months .
He argues that Saudi Arabia is sensitive to western public opinion and does n't want to be seen to be putting pressure on prices at a time when global growth is slowing .
" Even at current price levels , the cartel will still reap massive profit , given that Opec members have amongst the lowest production costs in the world , " says Navarro .
At the same , he says , the cartel has good reason to try to reduce output : " The last time Opec significantly increased production to stave off a global economic slowdown in the late 1990s , the results were a disaster for the cartel . "
Even so , he thinks , attempts to support a price floor of $ 100 will be unsuccessful - Capital Economics sees prices fall to $ 90 in a year .
Bullish
Most other forecasters are more bullish , but even Goldman Sachs , which coined the phrase " super spike " more than three years ago , said yesterday oil was " nearing a critical inflection point " .
It still expects $ 130 a barrel for the fourth quarter of this year , and $ 140 in 2009 , but attaches a big qualification : " In the event that a global recession and hard landing in China does materialise , spot crude oil prices would likely fall well below $ 100 per barrel . "
For consumers in the west , it 's hard to find a reason to be cheerful in that forecast - expect either high energy prices or global recession .
The shock is n't over .
WASHINGTON  Shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) tumbled Monday amid renewed fears that shareholders will wind up with nothing if the government intervenes to bail out the troubled companies .
The Treasury Department late last month gained the authority to boost Fannie and Freddie through an investment or a loan should the companies need their finances propped up due to soaring losses from bad mortgages .
The new government power , enacted by Congress after the companies shares plunged to levels not seen since the early 1990s , for several weeks quieted worries that the companies could collapse .
But investors were spooked once again , after a Barron 's magazine article over the weekend , citing an anonymous Bush administration source , reported that the government is pressing the companies to raise more money to guard against losses but does n't expect the companies to succeed .
Shares of Fannie Mae fell more than 22 % , or $ 1.76 , to close at $ 6.15 .
Shares of Freddie Mac fell almost 25 % , or $ 1.46 to $ 4.39 .
The Barron 's report said the government is likely to buy preferred stock in the companies , wiping out common shareholders .
In response , Treasury Department spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said the government has " no intention " of using its authority to invest in Fannie and Freddie and declined further comment .
But denials from government officials have not been soothing investors lately .
" Some of these things become self - fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile , " said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics in Washington .
The housing slump and continuing distress in the mortgage markets have withered the profit margins of Fannie and Freddie , the government - sponsored companies that together hold or guarantee nearly half of all U.S. home mortgages .
In response to last month 's steep slide in Fannie and Freddie 's stock , the Securities and Exchange Commission banned some forms of trading that enable short sellers to bet that a stock 's price will fall .
That order , intended to prevent stock manipulation , expired early last week .
Freddie Mac , in particular , has investors and analysts fearful .
The McLean , Va. - based company earlier this year promised to raise $ 5.5 billion to shore up its finances but has so far not done so .
The company 's sinking share price makes doing so less attractive because the value of existing shareholders ' stake would be diluted .
" We 're certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate , " Chief Financial Officer Buddy Piszel said on a recent conference call .
" But there is no need for us to rush . "
Government officials are likely seeking to avoid a full - fledged takeover of the companies , said Bert Ely , an Alexandria , Va. - based banking industry consultant and a longtime critic of Fannie and Freddie .
More likely , he said are less - sweeping moves to calm rattled debt investors .
Those include having the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department lend to the companies .
A government purchase of shares , he said , is " the step of last resort . "
Washington - based Fannie Mae and McLean , Via. - based Freddie Mac , are the largest U.S. buyers and backers of mortgages .
But they lost a combined $ 3.1 billion between April and June .
Half of their credit losses came from so - called Alt - A loans , which were made to borrowers with solid credit but little proof of their incomes , or small or no down payments .
Brian Faith , a Fannie Mae spokesman , said in an e-mailed statement that the company " continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements ...
We continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle . "
Freddie Mac spokeswoman Sharon McHale said the Barron 's article " significantly overstates Freddie Mac's financial situation " and said the company is " financially sound . "

Bongwater is a 1997 comedy film , based on a book of the same name by Michael Hornburg ( 1995 ) .
The film is set in Portland , Oregon , and stars Luke Wilson , Alicia Witt , Amy Locane , Brittany Murphy , Jack Black , and Andy Dick .
On Wednesday , Jennifer L. Brunner , the Ohio secretary of state who is a Democrat , sent out an advisory to all local officials instructing them what to do if anyone who has lost a home to foreclosure shows up at the polls .
If the address listed for such voters is no longer valid , and they moved outside the precinct , Ms. Brunner said , poll workers are instructed to send the voter to the polling place that corresponds to the voter ’s new address .
The voter will then be given a provisional ballot  special ballots that can be counted only after the voter ’s eligibility is verified  at the proper polling place , the directive said .
The state requires that election officials send a notice to all registered voters verifying their address 60 days before an election to check the accuracy of the voter rolls .
This month , Ms. Brunner ruled that an undeliverable notice will not be grounds enough on its own for a voter to be removed from the registration lists .
So far , election officials in Indiana , Kentucky , Missouri and Ohio have sent out notices to residents in select counties who have filed for a change of address but who have not updated their voter registration .
But the number of people who have moved , through foreclosure or for any other reason , far exceeds the number of people who have notified their election boards .
In Ohio , 375,000 people filed change - of - address forms with the Postal Service , but when state officials sent them cards asking for updated registration information , only 24,000 responded .
In Missouri , where 250,000 people notified the Postal Service of their move , only 22,000 told the election board .
Robin Carnahan , the Missouri secretary of state , and a Democrat , said that she is trying to get local election officials to increase the number of poll workers to deal with any confusion or challenges of voters .
In 2004 , a Republican Party official challenged a large number of voters at a largely black precinct in Boone County , Mo. , causing a backup .
Such challenges can cause long lines at polling places if there are not enough poll workers to pull challenged voters out of line , or if the workers have to consult with higher - level election officials for each challenge .
State political parties have traditionally used the mail to determine which voters to challenge .
By sending out mailings to voters likely to be of the opposite party , and then seeing which mailings are returned as undeliverable , they know whom to challenge at the polls for not living at their registered address .
Using public lists of foreclosed homes , however , can save money by allowing a party to avoid sending out mailings .
The basic model of development that ’s been my hobby for the past year has been to use a custom scripting language to configure an object model which is then consumed by a GUI or something – eliminating large amounts of maintenance and opening up a form of tool - oriented development that allows for an order of magnitude increase in code reuse .
That was my big thing after getting halfway through SICP– and the trojan horse by which I could sneak in some of the benefits of Lisp into a more Blubby environment .
Doing that sort of thing got me into some serious parsing , which made me realize I really needed to bone up on regular expressions .
I messed around with sed and awk enough that I finally broke down and decided to learn Perl .
Now I ’m working through O’Reilly ’s Intermediate Perl book so I can understand and use more stuff from Dominus ’s book Higher Order Perl .
The code below was mainly done so that I could get a better handle on references in Perl .
I ’m having a hard time getting up to speed with it , but hopefully after a few more projects like this I ’ll get the hang of it .
I also wanted to try to improve on the parser design that I thrashed out for Blub a while back .
Finally , I wanted to play around with the concept of a dispatch table before rereading Dominus ’s chapter on the subject .
Anyways … what I ’ve done is constructed my first complex data structure in Perl : a set of nested hash tables and arrays that describe a table of data .
We ’re loading up the tables by parsing a text file .
I ’m tired of parsing beginning and ending brackets , so I ’m trying maybe a more Python style approach of just using whitespace to indicate the end of a section .
Here ’s an example table .
Table Stuff : Key / [ A - Z ] / , Description A , Fooie B , Barrie
The dispatch table ( and Perl ’s core features ) allow us to treat code as data .
With just a few language features built in to our parser , we can allow the users of our scripting language to extend and redefine the parser from within their scripts .
Pretty cool… .
( Dominus goes much further into this than I do , of course .
And I ’m crazy , so do n’t judge his book by my bad code– I ’m just learning , here , with my lame “ 3rd grade ” level of Perl fluency . )
As I go further into the book Intermediate Perl , I can maybe come back and revisit this by turning it into an object .
Also , I ’m not using the regex ’s I ’ve tacked onto the table columns , so maybe I could write a validation routine that checks that the column data matches the expression .
Another change might be to have a second dispatch table to handle the different state changes … but that may be overcomplicating it .
[ Actually , after refactoring a bit , it seems okay . ]
I ’m sure I might come up with a different architecture if I read some chapters on compiler - like code … .

Simple Solar Circuits :
How to get started adding solar power to your small electronics projects .
Use the sun to power small solar and battery powered night lights , garden lights , and decorations for halloween .
The first part of a solar circuit is … a device for collecting sunlight .
To keep things simple , we ’re using a single nicely made small solar panel for all of these circuits .
The panel that we ’re using for these circuits is this one , part number PWR1241 from BG Micro , about $ 3 each .
This is a monolithic copper indium diselenide solar panel , apparently printed on a 60 mm square of glass and epoxy coated for toughness .
On the back of the panel are two ( thin ) solderable terminals , with marked polarity .
( While you can solder directly to the terminals , be sure to stress - relieve the connections , e.g. , with a blob of epoxy over your wires . )
In full sunlight the panel is specified to produce 4.5 V at up to 90 mA , although 50 mA seems like a more typical figure .
[ Before we move onto our first examples , a word of caution :
These are small simple circuits .
In building these , we will quite intentionally gloss over a number of minor details and issues that are unimportant at these low powers , but could become critical if you were to try to scale up . ]
Direct Drive :
The most obvious way to use power from a solar panel is to connect your load directly to the output leads of the solar panel .
Here are a couple of examples of this in practice :
On the left , we ’ve hooked up one of our little solar panels directly to a small motor taken from an old CD player .
When you set it out in the sunlight or bring it close to a lamp , the motor starts to spin .
On the right we ’ve hooked one of the panels right up to a high - power blue LED .
The reason that we ’ve used a high - power LED here is that it can easily withstand 50 - 90 mA from the solar panel– a “ regular ” LED designed for 20 mA would be destroyed by that current .
( The LED is the same type that we used for our high - power LED blinking circuit . )
Interruption - resistant direct drive :
The “ direct drive ” circuits work well for their design function , but are rather basic .
They provide no energy storage , and so are quite vulnerable to blinking out when a bird or cloud passes overhead .
For some applications , like running a small fan or pump , that may be perfectly acceptable .
For other cases , like powering a microcontroller or other computer , a brief power interruption can be disruptive .
Our next circuit design adds a supercapacitor as a “ flywheel ” to provide continued power during brief interruptions .
Instead of adding a single supercapacitor , you might notice that we ’ve actually added two .
That ’s because the supercaps that we had on hand are rated for 2.75 V– not enough to handle the 4.5 V output of the panel when sunlight is present .
To get around this limitation , we used two of the caps in series , for which the voltage ratings add , giving us a barely - okay total rating of 5.5 V. ( Note : be careful adding capacitors of different values in series– the voltage ratings may scale in non-obvious ways . )
When first exposed to the light , this circuit takes about 30 s to 1 minute to charge the capacitors enough that the LED can turn on .
After it ’s fully charged , the circuit can be removed from the sunlight and still drive the blue LED for about 30 s to 1 minute– a very effective flywheel for light duty applications .
Adding a battery
While interruption resistance is nice , a capacitor generally does not provide sufficient energy storage to power a solar circuit for extended periods of time in the dark .
A rechargeable battery can of course provide that function , and also provides a fairly consistent output voltage that a capacitor cannot .
In this next circuit , we use the solar panel to charge up a NiMH rechargeable battery and also LED off of the power , which will stay on when it gets dark out .
In this circuit the solar panel charges up a 3 - cell NiMH battery ( 3.6 V ) .
Between the two is a “ reverse blocking ” diode .
This one - way valve allows current to flow from the solar panel to the battery , but does not allow current to flow backwards out of the battery through the solar panel .
That ’s actually an important concern because small solar panels like these can leak up to 50 mA in the reverse direction in the dark .
We ’re using a garden - variety 1N914 diode for reverse blocking , but there are also higher - performance diodes available that have a lower “ forward voltage . ”
In this design we are continuously “ trickle charging ” up the battery when sunlight is present .
For NiMH batteries and sealed lead - acid batteries ( the two types that are most suitable for this sort of un-monitored circuit ) it is generally safe to “ trickle ” charge them by feeding them current at a rate below something called “ C/10 ” .
For our 1300 mAh battery cells , C/10 is 130 mA , so we should keep our charging below 130 mA ; not a problem since our solar panels only source up to 90 mA .
The other thing to notice about this circuit is that it ’s pretty darned inefficient .
The LED is on all the time , whenever the battery is at least slightly charged up .
That means that even while the circuit is in bright sunlight it is wasting energy by running the LED : a sizable portion of the solar panel current goes to driving the LED , not to charging the battery .
Detecting Darkness
We have written recently about how to make a useful dark - detecting LED driver circuit .
That circuit used an infrared phototransistor .
To add a darkness detecting capability to our solar circuit is even easier , actually , because our solar panel can directly serve as a sensor to tell when it ’s dark outside .
To perform the switching , we use a PNP transistor that is controlled by the voltage output from the solar panel .
When it ’s sunny , the output of the panel is high , which turns off the transistor , but when it gets dark , the transistor lets current flow to our yellow LED .
This circuit works very well and is a joy to use– it would make a good upgrade to the dark detecting pumpkin to make it go solar with this circuit .
A solar garden light circuit
While the last circuit works well for driving a yellow or red LED , it runs at 2.4 V ( the output of the NiMH battery ) , it does not have sufficient voltage to drive a blue or white output LED .
So , we can add to that circuit the simple Joule
Thief voltage booster to get a good design for a solar garden light :
A solar - charged battery with a dark detector that drives a Joule Thief to run a white output LED .
Naturally , you ’d want to give this a tough , weatherproof enclosure if it were going to be run outside .
( A mason jar comes to mind ! )
This circuit is actually very close to how many solar garden lights work , although there are many different circuits that they use .
Adding a microcontroller
Our last circuit examples extend the previous designs by adding a small AVR microcontroller .
We use the voltage output from the solar panel again to perform darkness detection , but instead take it to an analog input of the microcontroller .
The microcontroller is potentially a very low current , efficient device that lets you save power by not running the LED all the time , but ( for example ) waiting until an hour or two after darkness and / or fading the LEDs on or off , or even intermittently blinking for very low average power consumption .
In this example we have the PWM ( pulse - width modulation ) output of the microcontroller driving a Joule Thief style voltage booster to run the white LED .
( This is one of many , many different working designs for this sort of boosting circuits . )
We also made a second version of this circuit , with two red LED outputs to make a spooky Jack - o’- lantern :
To finish it up , we carved a beautiful white pumpkin and added this circuit to make our microcontroller - driven , dark - detecting , solar - powered programmable pumpkin , which faded its eyes in and out one at a time .
Note the long leads on the solar panel and wires to the LEDs to reach .
We hope that you might find this introduction to simple solar circuits helpful ; let ’s see those solar jack - o- lanterns !

Affliction MMA recently " postponed " its encore pay - per-view ( PPV ) event " Day of Reckoning " -- originally scheduled for October 11 in Las Vegas , Nevada -- because the promotion had a big announcement to make tonight about the company 's future .
And Vice President Tom Atencio had curious fans buzzing when he revealed that the announcement would be made during the big lightweight professional boxing title fight between Joel Casamayor and Juan Manuel Marquez , which will air on HBO pay - per- view ( PPV ) live from " Sin City " at 10 p.m. ET .
So what 's all the fuss about ?
Affliction has forged a partnership with Golden Boy Promotions -- the monster boxing promotional company led by superstar Oscar De La Hoya -- to co-promote future events that will feature mixed martial arts and boxing matches , according to ESPN.com .
Here 's a snip :
" Golden Boy and Affliction will partner 50 - 50 on at least four pay - per - view shows next year that will include boxing matches and MMA fights on the same card .
Smaller promoters have paired the two sports on cards , but never at the top level . "
It 's a relationship that was first discussed before Affliction even staged its first - ever event on July 19 ; therefore , it does n't come as too much of a surprise that Golden Boy Promotions is once again back on the MMA radar .
Of course , Affliction also has an existing deal with multimillionaire Donald Trump , meaning that the upstart promotion has added another powerful partner to help it succeed .
And the fearsome threesome will get its first crack at the big time when it trots out the biggest star on the roster , WAMMA heavyweight champion Fedor Emelianenko , to anchor the MMA portion of the card now set for the Honda Center in Anaheim , Calif. on January 17 .
No opponent for Emelianenko is known at this time .
This card will not air on HBO , which would have been an industry coup -- it is set to air on normal PPV .
However , it 's certainly possible that the new format and partnership could likely lead to something down the road .
Stay tuned for more details .
Mr. Obama ’s advisers emphasized that many of the new steps he called for could be taken quickly by the Democratic - controlled Congress in a lame - duck session this year , instead of waiting until after the new president is sworn into office in late January .
Several steps could be taken by the Treasury and Federal Reserve using their powers under current law , the advisers said .
At the Capitol on Monday , Speaker Nancy Pelosi would not commit to calling Congress back immediately after the elections to consider a stimulus plan , given the potential that Mr. Bush would veto it .
House Democratic leaders met with economists and afterward said they would develop a package for increased spending on public works , health care subsidies for states , extended unemployment pay and food stamp assistance .
Obama advisers put the cost of Mr. Obama ’s full economic stimulus plan at $ 175 billion , including $ 60 billion for the steps announced Monday .
Of the earlier $ 115 billion , $ 50 billion would be used to help states and to speed construction of roads and other infrastructure projects that create jobs .
About $ 65 billion of it would be the cost of a second round of rebates to taxpayers this year .
Mr. Obama had initially proposed to offset the rebates ’ expense with a new windfall - profits tax on oil companies , but the campaign indicated Monday that he would scrap that plan assuming that oil prices do not rise above about $ 80 a barrel .
The shift was just one sign of how the economic crisis has shoved concerns about budget deficits to the sidelines .
Despite criticism from the McCain camp that increasing taxes would further endanger the economy , Mr. Obama has “ no plans to change ” his longstanding proposal to repeal the Bush tax cuts next year for households with an annual income of more than $ 250,000 , said Jason Furman , Mr. Obama ’s economic adviser .
Under Mr. Obama ’s plan , most individuals and families would get a tax cut , and in terms of total dollars , he would cut taxes on lower - and middle - income people more than he would raise them on upper - income people .
McCain advisers on Monday reiterated their argument that the higher taxes , together with Mr. Obama ’s plan for expanded health care , would hit small businesses with costs they could ill afford .
Many small businesses pay taxes as individuals .
But the Obama campaign and independent fact - checking groups argue that relatively few would be affected by the tax increase on upper - income levels .

The MPAA is suing RealNetworks for making a product that will rip a DVD , crap it up with DRM , and store it on your hard - drive .
The MPAA says that only their stupid DRM , and not RealNetworks ' stupid DRM , can be used to cripple DVDs .
My take ?
A pox on both their houses .
Except this :
Lawyers for the MPAA , in a teleconference with reporters , said Kaleidesape and RealDVD are circumventing " technology designed to prevent copying . "
The lawyers , who asked that their names not be published , said they were concerned " Consumers will think this is a legal product … when in fact it is totally illegal . "
Wait wait wait wait : what ?
These unnamed lawyers are on a press - call with the media , as spokespeople for their company , and they " asked that their names not be published ? "
And journalists complied ?
Truly , this is a new low in chickenshittery that has me scraping my jaw off my chest .
These lawyers are n't deep - throat whistle - blowers sneaking information out of their employers ' filing cabinets : they 're the official spokespeople for the firm .
And they get anonymity ?
So what happens in the future — after the MPAA gets its ass handed to it by the court — if we want to argue that the MPAA 's lawyers have a long history of going around saying that software is " totally illegal " ?
Do the MPAA get to deny it , because no one can name the spokesperson who said it ?
And why on earth would the journalists honor such a request ?
" Unnamed MPAA lawyer says stupid thing " fails one of the important Ws of reporting : Who said it ?

IF YOU are a PhD student in America , there 's a good chance that your undergraduate degree came from Tsinghua University in China .
That 's because Tsinghua and Peking Universities are now the top feeder schools for American PhD programmes .
Chinese students have the largest presence in the natural sciences and engineering , and the better funded hard sciences have the most students .
Thus , when you aggregate the number of PhD students , the Chinese universities prevail .
The increasing dominance of Chinese doctoral students does add to the popular perception that America will someday suffer a shortage of scientists and engineers .
If that is indeed the case , why do so few Americans find themselves in PhD programmes ?
I completed a PhD in a quantitative field where , as an American citizen , I was a minority among my fellow graduate students ( though in my department , Europeans and South Americans dominated ) .
There certainly existed a perception among students and faculty that American students did not have the math skills necessary for a graduate degree .
There may be some truth to that .
The curriculum I taught was much less quantitative than what I experienced in my foreign undergraduate studies .
American students who do have the skills necessary for a quantitative PhD might also be less likely to pursue graduate work , because these skills are in high demand .
A clever graduate with strong quantitative skills can fetch a high salary right out of university .
The alternative of seven years of indentured servitude to your adviser probably sounds less appealing to many recent graduates .
Students from China do not face such high - paying alternatives at home .
Also , now that the number of H2 visas for skilled labour has decreased , PhD programmes provide a path to America for some .
This helps explain why the number of foreign students in PhD programmes increased remarkably between 2001 and 2006 .
After completing their studies , most foreign - born students hope to stay in America .
And this is no bad thing .
The resources at American universities are unparalleled elsewhere .
This attracts the best students and faculty from all over the world , increasing the quality of education that all students receive .
So long as America allows them to stay after they finish their studies , a greater proportion of foreign - born students may benefit everyone .

The Everglades are drowning .
Canals along Alligator Alley have spilled over banks into roadside swales .
Deer have been driven from flooded - out tree islands to strips of dry ground - mostly canal levees , but a few have even been spotted on the porches of empty hunting cabins .
And the water , already near a record high , is still creeping up - particularly in the area of deepest concern : the sprawling sawgrass prairies north of Tamiami Trail .
If the water does n't recede fast , the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns deer and other denizens could die in potentially large numbers .
" If we do n't start doing something , we 're going to end up with a total massacre , " said wildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron , who recently took a Democratic US congressman from Florida , Ron Klein , on an airboat trip into the 700,000 - acre conservation area west of suburban Miami - Dade and Broward counties , a marsh hammered by high waters over the decades .
Similar conditions decimated the Glades ' white - tailed deer in 1982 and 1995 , knocking the herd from thousands to hundreds , and killed countless smaller animals that rely on high , dry tree islands for food and shelter .
Those tree islands are anything but high and dry now .
About five miles south of Alligator Alley , Bergeron slowed his airboat near a small tree island , where months earlier he 'd spotted a buck .
The island used to have a landmark rock outcropping .
" That crop rock shot up 3 to 4 feet there , " he said .
" It 's under water now . "
It 's not the water depth - which ought to range from 6 to 18 inches depending on location - that presents the biggest problem ; it 's duration .
With the water up since Tropical Storm Fay seven weeks ago , wildlife managers figure they 've got less than 30 days before the toll starts mounting .
State and federal water managers , working with an outmoded and overwhelmed flood - control system and sometimes conflicting regulations to protect suburbs , farms , the Glades and the nests of an endangered bird from flooding , say there is not much more they can do - at least until the long - delayed overhaul of the Tamiami Trail and other Everglades projects move forward .
" Right now , we 're maximizing all our releases to alleviate the high waters , " said Andrew Geller , a senior engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers .
That 's not an answer that sits well with Bergeron , a prominent road builder and self - described " cracker " who has spent much of his life fishing and hunting in the Everglades .
For weeks , he has been calling state and federal agencies to press for relief - both immediate emergency action and long - term fixes .
The worst flooding is north of Tamiami Trail , a historic road that is the dividing line , and major cause , of much of the damage .
The road dams up and drowns marshes to the north and dries out Everglades National Park to the south .
" You 've got a desert on one side and a reservoir on the other , " Bergeron said .
Bergeron said he aims to be an " ambassador " to get the warring factions of the Everglades - environmentalists , the Miccosukee Tribe , local , state and federal agencies - together to break the gridlock surrounding both Tamiami Trail and a small endangered bird called the Cape Sable Seaside sparrow .
It 's a tall order :
The parties have been arguing for a decade .
Work to fix the road have been tied up for 19 years .
Last month , the National Research Council dubbed the project " one of the most discouraging stories in Everglades restoration " .
The sparrow plan follows a scheme that seasonally closes four huge floodgates along the Trail to protect nesting areas in the park from floods - and as a result stacks water to the north .
The Corps hopes to break ground before year 's end on a one - mile bridge , and a pilot project to improve flow through 19 existing culverts by scraping out a narrow strip of wetlands south of the road .
Bergeron supports expanding that project , an option environmental groups have n't embraced .
He also wants federal wildlife managers to reconsider the sparrow plan and broaden protections for animals harmed by the flooding , such as the endangered Florida panther .
His complaints echoed those of the Miccosukee , who have long argued that high waters destroy tribal lands - 250 acres of tree islands vanish yearly - and decimate other animals , including the endangered Everglades kite .
" I understand his frustration , " said tribe spokeswoman Joette Lorion .
" This area of the Everglades is being trashed , and nobody cares . "
Paul Souza , field supervisor for the US Fish and Wildlife Service , which oversees the sparrow plan , understands the concerns and said the agency has been " thinking through " options in light of studies documenting the freefall of the kite , which has declined by two - thirds since 2000 .
Souza agreed that starting work on the Trail was the most promising relief valve .
" It 's not the full answer , but it is a step in the right direction , " he said .
For now , state wildlife managers are trying to minimize stress on wildlife .
Though anglers can still ply canals , the FWC closed hunting and most public access to the interior marsh after Fay 's 20 inches of rain officially ended South Florida two - year drought .
More storms since have pushed water higher .
At one island , Bergeron , machete in hand , led Klein onto what he said was the highest spot for miles .
Most of it was inundated .
The driest spot was muddy .
The longer the marshes remain too deep , the lower the odds of wildlife survival .
Animals packed on levees are more prone to disease and can be easier picking for predators .
Stragglers left in the belly - deep marsh face even higher risks such as hoof rot - perhaps the unfortunate fate of one startled deer that left a splashing trail as it bolted at the roar of airboats .
It was miles from dry footing .
" If there is no place it can get to high ground , " said FWC regional director Chuck Collins , " it 's a goner " .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
First , there was " Einstein , " the federal government 's effort to protect itself from cyber attacks by limiting the number of portals to government computer systems and searching for signs of cyber tampering .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wants better protection for government computer systems .
Then Einstein 2.0 , a system now being tested to detect computer intrusions as they happen .
And in the future ?
Perhaps Einstein 3.0 , which would give the government the ability to fight back .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on Friday said he'd like to see a government computer infrastructure that could look for early indications of computer skullduggery and stop it before it happens .
The system " would literally , like an anti-aircraft weapon , shoot down an attack before it hits its target , " he said .
" And that 's what we call Einstein 3.0 . "
At a meeting with reporters to highlight National Cyber Security Month , Chertoff reiterated his belief that the government should aggressively defend its computer systems , saying that terrorists , if they gain expertise already available to others , would " cause potentially very serious havoc " to government systems .
" Let 's make the investment now rather than wait until there 's a huge catastrophe , " he said .
But despite his emphasis on the risks posed , Chertoff said the government is moving slowly to avoid stepping on the toes of the private sector as it addresses calls to reorganize the governance of cyberspace to provide accountability and authority .
" I think the question of what is the government 's role in cyberspace in general needs to be discussed among all the stakeholders , because there is a culture of cyberspace that is an open architecture , " he said .
" And I think if we just came in and said we want to take it over , there 'd be , understandably , a considerable amount of discomfort with that . "
" We are deliberately going slowly because we recognize that the issue of government involvement in the Internet is fraught with all kinds of potential concerns and potential anxieties about not having the government have a big - foot impact on an area of communication and commerce that has traditionally been viewed as really independent and free . "
Chertoff said the government is " feeling our way to what is the right mix of government involvement with protecting the Internet in the private domain while preserving everybody 's comfort level that we 're not going to be in their business in a way that would be inappropriate . "
Asked if he envisioned a world with two cyberspaces , he said he envisions a world with " a lot of different levels of security and trust , depending upon the nature of what it is that you 're doing . "
" We already have that now , in the sense that we have classified systems which are walled off from unclassified systems , " he said .
The Bush administration released its National Cyber Security Initiative in January .
The " most immediate component " of it from the Department of Homeland Security 's perspective , Chertoff said , is to increase security for federal government computer systems .
But another priority is to work with the private sector to address threats to businesses .
This includes not only protection from hackers , but also from counterfeit parts , which an individual or another nation could use to create vulnerabilities in the United States , he said .

THE GATES FOUNDATION
’S rather sudden domination of a very politically charged sector of the developed - world economy has earned it some enemies .
There is , of course , a seemingly unshakable enmity attached to anything associated , however distantly , with Microsoft .
But the foundation ’s methods are themselves drawing criticism .
Raj Patel , the author of “ Stuffed and Starved : The Hidden Battle for the World Food System , ” is one of the foundation ’s most eloquent critics .
He told me that he came away from a meeting with Shah in Berkeley , Calif. , feeling that it was “ impossible to get a straight answer as to what they ’re doing . ”
He added : “ It seemed so up in the air .
And of course while a public institution would have to be clear , they do not , and it ’s hard not to feel that what we ’re seeing is a foundation playing God in Africa . ”
He was careful to note that the reason the Gates Foundation could do this at all was that “ no one else has the kind of money the foundation does . ”
Still , he said , “ There has to be something problematic about a few big brains in Washington State making decisions about an entire continent . ”
Patel was also quick to point out that his anxiety about the foundation ’s lack of democratic accountability was only part of his critique .
Rather , his substantive critique of the Gates Foundation ’s agricultural initiatives focuses on its excessive confidence in technology and market - based solutions  what Bill Gates himself has called “ creative capitalism . ”
For Patel and other leaders of the agro-environmental movement , the net effect of Gates ’s efforts is to enshrine this narrowly technical approach as the global response to the food crisis in Africa .
“ I ’m happy to impute the best possible motives to them , ” he told me .
“ But Gates ’s success in imposing his terms on the debate strengthens the status quo rather than doing what needs to be done  which is to transform it . ”
Not everyone is as measured in their criticisms as Patel .
At a recent conference of the Slow Food movement in San Francisco , the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva denounced the Gates Foundation as being the “ greatest threat to farmers in the developing world . ”
Critics like Shiva note with concern that the Gates Foundation has hired from major agricultural multinationals a number of senior officials , including , notably , Rob Horsch , a leading agronomist who spent much of his career with the agricultural biotech company Monsanto .
As Peter Rosset , a Chiapas , Mexico - based agricultural expert with Via Campesina , the international food - sovereignty movement , put it to me , “ Monsanto already controls much of the world ’s seed market , and AGRA and by extension Gates is courting the major firms like Monsanto and Syngenta . ”
In a scathing report issued last year , the Canadian ecological watchdog group E.T.C. warned of “ a growing trend toward privatization of foreign aid , and the fusing of the private sector with governments . ”
The authors of the report went on to add bitterly that “ these days , where Bill Gates goes , so goes government .
Every head of every aid agency in the O.E.C.D. wants a photo - op announcing a joint venture with the megabillionaire . ”
Gates Foundation officials steadfastly deny imposing any particular vision of their own on the debate .
What the critics call ideology , they call reality .
As for their hiring practices , it is an article of faith at the foundation that its officials have something to learn from people of every conceivable worldview , from veterans of Monsanto to veterans of the anti-globalization movement .
What they do readily acknowledge is that their philanthropic efforts are in part intended to goad governments into action .
As Mark Suzman , a former senior official at the United Nations Development Program who is now the foundation ’s global development and advocacy director , put it to me , “ One of our goals is to get donors to rethink their commitment to agriculture in Africa  and African governments as well . ”
During my visits with the AGRA officials , DeVries seemed contemptuous of the foundation ’s critics , and Ngongi seemed indifferent to them .
But Shah seemed unhappy .
“ After I went to Berkeley to meet with the Food First people , ” he told me , “ I came away very much wanting to work more closely with agro-ecological groups .
We talk to anyone who will talk to us .
How could we aspire to be transformational if we did n’t ? ”
He paused , and then added musingly : “ I guess I really do n’t know why there is so much hostility .
I really think we have something to learn from them . ”

— A 70 - year - old Cary man died at the State Fair Friday night , State Department of Agriculture spokesman Brian Long said .
A Wake County sheriff ’s deputy found Everette A. Marshall unconscious in Dorton Arena around 8 p.m. during the Jason Aldean concert .
Emergency crews tried to revive Marshall .
He was transported to Rex Hospital where he later died .
Long said it appeared Marshall died of natural causes .
The man had attended the concert alone .
With 12 days to go until the election , today was the wrong time for Sarah Palin to shoot herself in the foot and alienate her base .
But that 's what she has done , in style , on Univision .
Interviewer :
To clarify , so you support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants ?
Palin : I do because I understand why people would want to be in America .
To seek the safety and prosperity , the opportunities , the health that is here .
It is so important that yes , people follow the rules so that people can be treated equally and fairly in this country .
Needless to say , the wingnuts , those few mentioning it so far , are not at all happy .
The Corner leads the charge :
What Palin 's response shows is that , first , she 's completely open to whatever kool - aid they want her to drink — i.e. , she has no innate resistance to amnesty for illegals that would cause her to look for less - unappealing ways of saying what the campaign wants her to say .
And second , it shows what the campaign is telling her about McCain 's views on the issue — if McCain 's talk of " border security first " were anything but boob bait for Bubba , his operatives would have made it clear that Palin was supposed to include that in her discussion of immigration , but she did n't even make a passing reference to it .
Daniel Larison :
I have given up trying to understand what Palinites see in their favorite candidate .
If this does not drive home how malleable and unacquainted with the relevant policy options she is , I ’m not sure what would .
Michelle Malikin simply says " We 're Screwed , ' 08 ! "
With twelve days to go , this is going to hurt the McCain / Palin camp even worse than the $ 150 k blown on Sarah 's make - over .
Immigrants are the " barbarians at the gate " that folk like Neo -Roman elitist Andy McCarthy are so afraid of
