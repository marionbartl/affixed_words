NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc on Friday abandoned the flailing HD DVD format , potentially ending a war over next - generation DVDs as it joined Best Buy and Netflix in supporting rival Blu-ray technology .

The format war between Toshiba Corp - backed HD DVD and Sony Corp ’s Blu-ray , often compared to the Betamax - VHS battle in the 1980s , has slowed the development of what is expected to be a multibillion dollar high - definition DVD industry .
It also has been a thorn in the side of retailers , which have had to commit shelf space to devices from both camps even as they field complaints from customers frustrated that some films come out in HD DVD while others are released in Blu-ray .
Wal - Mart , the world ’s largest retailer , announced the move as a phase - out at 4,000 U.S. Wal - Mart and Sam ’s Club stores by June , saying it was responding to consumer preference .
Wal - mart ’s on - staff movie and gaming blogger put the future of HD DVD in stark terms .
“ So ... if you bought the HD player like me , I ’d retire it to the bedroom , kid ’s playroom , or give it to your parents to play their John Wayne standard def movies , and make space for a BD ( Blu- ray disc ) player for your awesome Hi Def experience , ” Wal - Mart blogger Susan Chronister wrote in a posting .
Consumer electronics chain Best Buy Co Inc and online video rental company Netflix Inc defected to the Blu-ray camp earlier in the week .
Next - generation DVDs and players , boasting better picture quality and more capacity , were expected to help revive the $ 24 billion global home DVD market .
But Hollywood studios had initially split their alliances between the two camps , meaning only certain films would play on a consumer ’s DVD machine .
The balance of power , however , tipped toward the Sony camp in January after Time Warner Inc ’s Warner Bros studio said it would only release high - definition DVDs in Blu-ray format .
With that , studios behind some three - quarters of DVDs are backing Blu-ray , although some release in both formats .
Toshiba responded by slashing prices of HD DVD players , but Wal - Mart ’s move cast doubt on the success of that strategy .
“ Where are you going to sell the cheaper high - def format if not at Wal - Mart ? ” said Stephanie Prange , editor in chief at Home Media Magazine , who in January had cautioned against declaring Blu-ray the winner .
“ The dominoes are falling pretty quickly .... I think it ’s over , ” she said , tallying up previous wins for Blu-ray at Target Corp and Blockbuster Inc as well .
Blu-ray also has support from News Corp ’s 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney Co and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.
Sony ’s PlayStation 3 game console can also play Blu-ray films .
To be sure , Toshiba has secured agreements with studios including NBC Universal ’s Universal Pictures , Viacom Inc ’s Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc .
Microsoft Corp ’s Xbox 360 also currently works only with HD DVD .
However , Microsoft said in January it could consider supporting Blu-ray technology at consumers ’ behest .
Blu-ray said the Wal - Mart move showed its format had emerged the winner .
Toshiba could not be reached to comment on Wal - Mart ’s move , while earlier on Friday , the Hollywood Reporter quoted unidentified industry sources as saying Toshiba was widely expected to pull the plug on HD DVD in the coming weeks .
Toshiba spokeswoman Junko Furuta said none of what was reported in the magazine had been decided .
“ We can not comment on speculation , ” she said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
About 8,000 of the 30,000 " surge " troops sent to Iraq in 2007 will not go home as planned this summer , the Pentagon said Monday .
President Bush ordered nearly 30,000 additional troops to Iraq in January 2007 as part of a troop surge .
Support troops -- including helicopter crews , supply units , military police and headquarters staff -- will still be needed when the additional combat units return home , said Lt. Gen.
Carter Ham , the chief of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
In particular , U.S. troops are still needed to guard Iraqi prisons , he said .
" The transfer of responsibility for detention operations has not progressed as rapidly as we would like to the Iraqis , so there 's a need to have that force sustained , as well , " Ham said .
President Bush ordered nearly 30,000 additional troops to Iraq in January 2007 to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces .
When the last of the five Army combat brigades and two Marine battalions ordered in as part of that campaign leave Iraq by July , 140,000 troops will remain -- about 8,000 more than the 132,000 U.S. troops stationed there before the surge , Ham told reporters at the Pentagon .
" This will be very much conditions - based , but that 's our projection as of today , " he said .
He said top U.S. commanders are debating whether to make further withdrawals after July .
The U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , is scheduled to issue another report on the progress of the war in April , and Ham said it would be " premature " to discuss further withdrawals now .
The Bush administration has touted a sharp reduction in the sectarian warfare that wracked Baghdad throughout 2006 -- and an accompanying drop in American death tolls -- as signs of the campaign 's success .
But Ham said the support troops are still needed to preserve that progress .
" Rather than look at this negatively , I would say there is an opportunity now to take advantage of the security that has been established by the five surge brigades , " he said .
" And you want to sustain that and not jeopardize the gains that have been achieved . "
Critics say the political goals of the surge -- an Iraqi settlement of the nearly 5 - year - old war -- have not yet been accomplished .
Sen. Chuck Hagel , R - Nebraska , said Sunday that Iraq remains far from stable .
" If we 've had so much success , then why are our commanders concerned about pulling troops down and wanting to freeze them at at least the level that we had before the surge ? "
Hagel told CNN's " Late Edition . "
But Ham said the campaign has encouraged Iraqis to take steps toward reconciliation and to turn against Islamic jihadists loyal to al Qaeda , which is blamed for some of the war 's worst attacks on civilians .
" I would say that there is increasing pressure on al Qaeda in Iraq everywhere inside Iraq , " he said .
" Again , it is premature to declare victory or anything , but it is very clear that , wherever al Qaeda in Iraq tries to operate , they are increasingly being resisted by Iraqi security forces , clearly by the U.S. and other coalition members , and most importantly by the people of Iraq -- and that 's really what 's making the difference .

“ We are the Democratic party . ”
I really hate to use profanity like this on the blog – but I think it is called for under the circumstances .
The New York Times is reporting that :
… influential fund - raisers for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have stepped up their behind - the - scenes pressure on national party leaders to resolve the matter , with some even threatening to withhold their donations to the Democratic National Committee unless it seats the delegates from the two states or holds new primaries there .
According to the Times article , Ms. Clinton ’s donors have donated just under $ 300,000 to the Democratic National Committee – and they are threatening to stop supporting the Democratic party if the DNC does n’t cave in to their demands .
I have some hope that Howard Dean will not give in to Ms. Clinton ’s bullying .
But he undeniably is being pressured , bullied , strong - armed .
And big donors today have an outsize influence in the DNC .
So far , the DNC has been lagging behind the Republican National Committee in fundraising .
This is exceptional considering the money advantage both Ms. Clinton and Mr. Obama have had over any of the Republican presidential candidates .
I support the DNC – and no matter who the Democratic presidential candidate is , and no matter who wins in November , I want a strong Democratic party .
But today , I am donating to show that Ms. Clinton ’s backers do not own the Democratic party .
I may not be able to donate $ 63,500 like Paul Cejas – and I wo n’t try to hold the Democratic party hostage to my personal views .
But I am donating $ 50.00 right now to make a point .
I hope you can show your support as well .
Mr. Dean has not taken sides in the current primary battle – but is trying to enforce the rules that Ms. Clinton and Mr. Obama explicitly and publicly agreed to last year .
Ms. Clinton ’s backers are now trying to bully the DNC to break the rules and hand Ms. Clinton the nomination against the will of those people who have voted so far .
This is outrageous .
We are the Democratic party .
Let ’s show Hillary ’s big money pals whose party this is .
( If you just want to donate to the DNC without showing support for Mr. Obama ’s candidacy , try here .
Otherwise , to show support , donate here to “ We are the Democratic party . ” )
( I am not a big fan of Ms. Clinton – but I do n’t hate her .
This post is not about Ms. Clinton herself – but about my outrage at the tactics of her supporters .
Shame on them .
And Ms. Clinton – if you do n’t condemn these anti-democratic and anti-Democratic tactics , shame on you . )
Updated :
Let me be clear – I support Barack Obama in the primary – and have since before he won more states , more delegates , and more votes than Ms. Clinton .
But if Ms. Clinton were in the position Mr. Obama was in – I would not want Mr. Obama to win by extortion .
2nd Update :
The Drudge Report is highlighting the news – which means that it will likely dominate the news cycle tomorrow .
Obviously , most commentators will say that the tactics of the Clinton campaign are wrong .
But nothing would prove them wrong more than a donation to the DNC – allowing the Democratic party to ignore the powerful individuals who are trying to hijack the party .
3rd update : NJ Mom over at dKos interprets the story in much the same way :
I ’ve been concerned for a while that the Obama / Clinton contest is becoming a surrogate battle between the Dean and McAuliffe wings of the DNC .
It is a battle between those that believe in the “ important states ” vs. “ the other 40 ” , between DLCers and DFAers , between an addiction to corporate / special interest money and those that believe that small donors in vast numbers are democracy at its most powerful .
What I read in the NYT today , makes me concerned that McAuliffe and those that he represents are trying to ambush Dean using Clinton donors .
The NetRoots helped Dean get where he is today .
With the DNC coffers very low right now , he is under attack .
He needs us .
N.B . This post was written in the midst of an obviously contentious election campaign – one in which I had strongly considered supporting Senator Clinton but after careful evaluation , had come to the conclusion that Barack Obama was the only candidate suited to our current challenges .
While I stand by the content of the post , in retrospect , the tone is a bit overheated .

Original review : Aug. 30 , 2020
I entrusted my high - end Le Creuset , Emile Henry and Cuisinart bakeware to a disreputable mover and lost about two - thirds of a collection that took many years to amass .
( Yes , very sad . )
So , after much research I decided to take advantage of a promo offered by Corning / Pyrex to re-establish my kitchen .
All of the various & sundry pieces of Pyrex I bought are still USA - made .
I 'm reviewing this particular piece because I discovered during my research that anything with a deeper side also carries a higher price point .
At this low price point this roaster hits the mark in so many ways : the pleasing oval shape is even dressy table - worthy , and no doubt the large capacity coupled with those deep sides qualifies it as a versatile addition to any kitchen .
Two things to keep in mind with all Pyrex : DO NOT PLACE IN A COLD OVEN ( PRE - HEATED ONLY ) BEFORE BAKING and DO NOT HANDLE IT WITH ANYTHING DAMP WHEN HOT .
Unfortunately , the Corning website falls short of outlining those warnings in clear & simple terms , and additional practical information was omitted as well ( which I brought to their attention ) .
It initially bothered me that nothing had a label on it ( three safety and usage instructions were enclosed ) but , again , at this low price point I can overlook that ; it 's obvious everything was brand new and I 've bought Pyrex at Walmart without any labels either .
A packing slip was enclosed which nowadays is a treat unless you 're dealing with high - end merchants .
Nevertheless , the brand has been around forever for a reason : they 're in the business of making kitchen workhorses at very affordable prices = win|win !!
Last but not least , everything was very carefully packed and arrived in perfect condition .
The European bank , by contrast , is skeptical of the notion that inflation automatically falls when growth cools , and it has a mandate , inherited from the German central bank , to keep prices stable above all else .
So the view from the European bank ’s sleek silvery headquarters here is very different from the Fed ’s perspective in Washington , whatever market participants may think about the inevitability of lower European interest rates .
Mr. Trichet is likely to drive home this point after the central bankers emerge from their monthly meeting here Thursday , when they are expected to leave rates unchanged at 4 percent .
Many investors remain convinced that the European bank has little choice but to follow the Fed ’s lead , if only to ensure that recessionary conditions do not leach into Europe .
As the Fed has cut rates , investors have bet that the bank here will follow and lower its benchmark rate , certainly by June and possibly earlier .
Image Jean - Claude Trichet seems to prefer a threat to a rise in rates .

The rise of the euro , which breached the $ 1.50 threshold last week and settled in New York Wednesday at $ 1.5262 , also increases the pressure on the bankers from European politicians to at least hint at lower borrowing costs .
Falling interest rates in the United States have exerted a powerful force on currency values by damping the appeal of dollar - denominated assets .
“ In the present circumstances , we are concerned about excessive exchange - rate moves , ” Jean - Claude Juncker , Luxembourg ’s prime minister , who is presiding over the group of 15 euro - zone finance ministers , said on Monday .
But what sets off alarm among some politicians in Europe is far less likely to raise hackles at the central bank .
That is because the euro ’s rise also helps curb inflation by lowering the cost of imported goods .
And if the euro ’s appreciation is smooth , it supports the bankers ’ decision so far to stand pat .
Let 's be clear : we have lost this war .
We have lost because the initial , central goals of the invasion have all failed : we have not secured WMDS from terrorists because those WMDs did not exist .
We have not stymied Islamist terror - at best we have finally stymied some of the terror we helped create .
We have not constructed a democratic model for the Middle East - we have instead destroyed a totalitarian government and a phony country , only to create a permanently unstable , fractious , chaotic failed state , where the mere avoidance of genocide is a cause for celebration .
We have , moreover , helped solder a new truth in the Arab mind : that democracy means chaos , anarchy , mass - murder , national disintegration and sectarian warfare .
And we have also empowered the Iranian regime and made a wider Sunni - Shiite regional war more likely than it was in 2003 .
Apart from that , Mr Bush , how did you enjoy your presidency ?
McCain , for all his many virtues , still does n't get this .
Paul does .
Paul , moreover , supports the only rational response : a withdrawal , as speedily and prudently as possible .
McCain , along with Lieberman , still seems to believe that expending even more billions of dollars to prop up and enable a fast - devolving , ethnically toxic , religiously nutty region is somehow in American interests .
Given the enormous challenges of the terror war , the huge debt we are piling up , the exhaustion of the military , the moral and financial corruption that has its white - hot center in Mesopotamia , I do not believe that an endless military , economic and political commitment to Iraq makes sense .
It only makes sense if we are determined to occupy the Middle East indefinitely to secure oil supplies .
But the rational response to oil dependence is not to entrench it , but to try and move away from it .
Institutionalizing a bank - breaking , morale - busting Middle East empire is n't the way to go .
But the deeper reason to support Ron Paul is a simple one .
The great forgotten principles of the current Republican party are freedom and toleration .
Paul 's federalism , his deep suspicion of Washington power , his resistance to government spending , debt and inflation , his ability to grasp that not all human problems are soluble , least of all by government : these are principles that made me a conservative in the first place .
No one in the current field articulates them as clearly and understands them as deeply as Paul .
He is a man of faith who nonetheless sees a clear line between religion and politics .
More than all this , he has somehow ignited a new movement of those who love freedom and want to rescue it from the do - gooding bromides of the left and the Christianist meddling of the right .
The Paulites ' enthusiasm for liberty , their unapologetic defense of core conservative principles , their awareness that in the new millennium , these principles of small government , self - reliance , cultural pluralism , and a humble foreign policy are more necessary than ever - no lover of liberty can stand by and not join them .
He 's the real thing in a world of fakes and frauds .
And in a primary campaign where the very future of conservatism is at stake , that can not be ignored .
In fact , it demands support .
Go Ron Paul !

Consider breakfast .
My breakfast , to be exact .
It ’s been months since I have had an oatmeal breakfast or a nice cup of espresso with a drop of milk because coffee and milk has literally vanished from supermarkets ’ shelves since last November .
And that includes “ Mercal ” , the government ’s supermarket network where the poor are supposed to buy food at subsidized low prices
The reason ?
Stiff price controls , of course , and fixed currency rates that have been going on for 5 years , too .
Teachers are demanding that YouTube , the hugely popular video sharing website , be closed down for refusing to remove violent , threatening and sexual content involving children and staff .
Members of the Professional Association of Teachers have accused the company of encouraging cyber - bullying by ignoring their pleas to take down inappropriate clips .
In one case in Scotland , pupils filmed a teacher in the classroom and then posted it on the website alongside the caption ' you are dead ' .
Teachers claim that YouTube repeatedly ignored complaints about the footage , although it was eventually taken down .
On Tuesday delegates at the PAT annual conference will call for YouTube and similar sites featuring user - generated video content to be shut down and subjected to an investigation .
' Being exposed to ridicule , whether as an adult or young person , is a humiliating and frightening experience , ' Kirsti Paterson , a headteacher at Avoch Primary School , near Inverness , will tell members .
Giving the specific examples of YouTube and Rate My Teacher , she will add : ' In the short term confronting this problem must be the closure of sites encouraging the cyber - bullying . '
In the long term , she argued , the goal was to stop pupils carrying out the bullying and allow them to benefit from the technology .
Paterson said she was proposing the motion because of a spate of incidents where teachers who complained failed to get a satisfactory response .
This month three pupils at Hayling College , Hayling Island , Hampshire , were suspended after mobile phone footage of two girls fighting was placed on YouTube .
Max Bullough , the college 's headteacher , said he had great difficulty getting the video taken down and eventually had to turn to the police .
Bullough found he was unable to ' flag up ' the video for YouTube 's attention because he was not a member of the site and then he could not find contact details .
' They do n't seem to operate a complaints policy , ' he said .
' They say they have a team who deal with flagged up content operating 24 hours a day , seven days a week , but I do n't believe it . '
Eventually , he went to the police who managed to get the video removed , but only after it had been viewed by more than 1,000 people .
In the light of his experience , Bullough said he endorses the union 's conference motion .
' A lot of other headteachers have mentioned this problem to me , ' he added .
Meanwhile , footage of schoolchildren from Somerset punching and kicking each other remains on the website .
The video features boys aged 12 and 13 .
Many parents have also expressed concern .
Margaret Morrissey , of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations , said : ' Unless YouTube can assure parents as well as schools that if anything goes up of this nature it will be immediately removed , the PAT will get a lot of support from parents for this motion . '
YouTube insisted the problems arise in a minority of cases .
A spokesman said : ' YouTube is a community site used by millions of people in very positive ways .
Sadly , as with any form of communication , there is a tiny minority of people who try to break the rules .
On YouTube , these rules prohibit content like pornography or gratuitous violence .
' We do n't want that sort of material on our site , and nor does our community .
When people see content that they think is inappropriate they can flag it and our staff then review it .
If the content breaks our terms then we remove it , and if a user repeatedly breaks the rules we disable their account .
' If the police ask us for information , then we will co-operate , so long as they follow the correct legal process that the government introduced . '
The spokesman added that YouTube , along with a number of other websites , has joined a cyberbullying taskforce set up by the government .
Government surveillance of citizens ' personal computers is a violation of privacy , Germany 's highest court ruled today .
Citizens ' basic right to privacy is protected by Germany 's constitution , the court said , a protection that extends to their stored data .
" Collecting such data directly encroaches on a citizens ' rights , given that fear of being observed ... can prevent unselfconscious personal communication , " said Judge Hans - Juergen Papier in the court 's opinion .
The case began last year when officials in North Rhine - Westphalia began spying on computer - related activities using trojans and spyware ( also known as " policeware " ) .
The government apparently had few problems with this , saying that such activities were important in the fight against terrorism .
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble even suggested changing German law to give the government more freedom to use policeware and engage in other PC - related surveillance .
Papier disagreed , saying that the North Rhine - Westphalia law was unconstitutional and that his ruling would set a precedent for the whole country on how to treat individuals ' privacy .
He did rule , however , that the state could employ some surveillance services under extreme conditions , but doing so would require prior permission from a judge .
Such an exception would be made when there is " clear evidence of a concrete threat , " similar to what is already required to tap a suspect 's phone lines under current German law .
Surprisingly , Schäuble seemed to welcome the judge 's opinion , saying that he would refer to the clause allowing surveillance when preparing new legislation .
" I hope that the insecurity felt by young people will be tempered by this decision ; it shows that our government ... protects the people 's rights , " Schäuble said , according to the Associated Press .
The ruling goes against the example of countries like the US and UK which continue to push for increased surveillance at the expense of privacy .
Network security experts , however , warned earlier this month that such wide - scale digital surveillance could actually create new security risks .
" The US could build for its opponents something that would be too expensive for them to build for themselves , " researchers noted , " a system that lets them see the US 's intelligence interests , a system that could tell them how to thwart those interests , and a system that might be turned to intercept the communications of American citizens and institutions . "
In a rare breath of fresh air , The San Francisco Chronicle has now written an article confirming concentration camps in the United Sates and the possible impact of “ Endgame ” - and based on the few comments that were made , people do n’t want to believe the truth .
Unfortunately , Americans are acting the same as the Jews , disabled , and dissidents did during Hitler ’s Third Reich , always believing it could never happen to them …
When presented with the evidence that our own government is readying itself to imprison hundreds of thousands , or even millions of patriotic Americans that refuse to support a criminal and perhaps mentally unbalanced President LINK LINK - the author of the article , even though Dan Hamburg is a former Congressman , has been ridiculed for telling the truth :
Rule by fear or rule by law ?
Lewis Seiler , Dan Hamburg Monday , February 4 , 2008
“ The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law , and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers , is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist . ”
- Winston Churchill , Nov. 21 , 1943
Since 9/11 , and seemingly without the notice of most Americans , the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law , arrest a wide swath of dissidents ( citizen and noncitizen alike ) , and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of “ an emergency influx of immigrants in the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . ”
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees .
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott , the KBR contract is part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of “ all removable aliens ” and “ potential terrorists . ”
Fraud - busters such as Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , have complained about these contracts , saying that more taxpayer dollars should not go to taxpayer - gouging Halliburton .
But the real question is :
What kind of “ new programs ” require the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the union with the capacity to house perhaps millions of people ?
MORE
To those of us that receive our news from sources other than the MSM , the facts alleged in the story were no surprise , but the lack of comments , and those of a negative nature were indeed a surprise .
Why are the bulk of Americans so complacent ?
This is one of the comments that appears online :
watcher2 wrote : I suggest that Seiler and Hamburg re-read the title to their piece … ” Rule by fear or rule by law ” … and then examine the activities of those they seek to defend .
“ Activists ” ( I use the term loosely ) whose appear unable to understand the difference between : “ I do n’t like what you do , please stop ” , and “ I do n’t like what you do and if you do n’t stop , I ’ll ( burn your car , burn your house , threaten you with physical violence …or if you happen to live in England … I ’ll rob the graves of your relatives or attack you with baseball bats … insert your own threat ) ” , and have failed to understand the difference between protest and blackmail .
I do n’t recall the right to blackmail as a part of the 1st amendment … or did I miss that ?
More power to Ms Harman .
In her own state there resides a medic who advocates the killing of researchers as a defensible was to save the lives of lab rats …. rule by fear or rule by law ?
Hmmm , think I know where I stand on that one .
When you take into consideration the importance of a mainstream newspaper actually breaking the silence on this issue , I expected pages of comments , however , the original article was published on February 4th , and so far , there have only been five ( 5 ) comments , two of them made today .
The article was concise and did n’t go into the specifics when I wrote Now We Know Why There ’s A Press Blackout On S 1959 - It ’s Called “ ENDGAME ” By DHS on December 21st , 2007 , but they did cover the essentials - and it went nowhere .
Why ?
It ’s one thing when people do n’t choose to believe what we research and write on our Blogs , but when the public ignores a dire warning by a mainstream newspaper , it ’s obvious that America ’s complacency , if it does n’t stop soon , could be the final nail in FEMA ’s coffin for all of us .

THE Democratic race for the presidential nomination has settled into a pattern .
Barack Obama gains momentum , and is nearly crowned the winner .
Then Hillary Clinton wins a high - profile contest and makes a comeback , before Mr Obama builds up steam yet again .
Mrs Clinton 's latest resurrection came with big wins in Texas and Ohio .
But now Mr Obama is back .
Over the weekend he won a caucus in Wyoming and on Tuesday March 11th he emerged as victor at a primary in Mississippi .
He won both by margins of over 20 points .
Mr Obama 's recent wins will no doubt gratify him and his campaign team .
The victories vindicate further his campaign 's strategy : leave no state uncontested , and rack - up support wherever it is to be found .
It has allowed him to build a commanding lead of around 150 pledged delegates .
The Clinton team began spinning the two losses before they happened .
Both Wyoming and Mississippi are deeply Republican states , which Mr Obama has no chance of winning in the election .
According to Mrs Clinton , the states that matter are the big swing states that Democrats need to win in the autumn .
These are Ohio ; Florida , which she “ won ” in a primary in which nobody campaigned , since the state broke party rules by holding its vote too early ; and Pennsylvania , which goes to the polls on April 22nd and where she likes her chances .
Her argument falls at several hurdles .
The delegates she won in Florida will almost certainly not be counted .
And although Ohio was a big victory , even a huge win in Pennsylvania would not make up her deficit in pledged delegates .
Both Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama will battle for support from “ superdelegates ” .
These party bigwigs may vote for whom they choose at the convention .
Hence Mrs Clinton 's parallel campaign to convince them that the rules of the game are tilted away from her unfairly .
She says that caucuses , which Mr Obama has dominated , are undemocratic .
Her team also complains of unfair press coverage .
Winning over the superdelegates with such arguments could be rough and divisive enough .
Worse still , Democrats may get such arguments for all 42 days between the primaries in Mississippi and Pennsylvania .
Bored and frustrated , the two candidates and their many surrogates could settle into mutually destructive trench warfare .
The nastiness has already begun .
Samantha Power , an unofficial Obama adviser , had to quit after calling Mrs Clinton a “ monster ” in a newspaper interview .
But more of the ugly stuff has come from the other side .
Mrs Clinton has suggested , in an ad and in her comments , that she is ready to be commander - in - chief , as is the Republican nominee - to - be , John McCain , but that Mr Obama is not .
Her spokesman compared Mr Obama to Ken Starr , whose investigations of the Clintons in the 1990s made him a hate - figure among Democrats .
And last week , a newspaper printed comments by Geraldine Ferraro , a prominent supporter of Mrs Clinton , that are angering blacks , hitherto a solid Democratic - voting block .
Mrs Ferraro , the Democratic vice - presidential candidate in 1984 , said that Mr Obama was only where he was in the race because he was black .
Race being as ticklish a subject as it is in America , most politicians would retreat and praise Mr Obama when such comments caused a stir .
Instead Mrs Ferraro said that the outcry made her a victim of reverse racism .
A spokesman for Mrs Clinton has said only that she “ disagrees ” with Mrs Ferraro 's comments .
The Obama team asks why , if Ms Power had to quit , Mrs Clinton does not disown Mrs Ferraro .
And if she does n't , Mr Obama 's supporters may lash out in frustration .
A campaign that degenerates into name - calling and mud-slinging will hurt Mr Obama more than it does Mrs Clinton .
He has campaigned on messages of “ change ” and “ hope ” so he faces an unenviable choice in the long run-up to Pennsylvania .
If he lets the Clinton team fling the brickbats without retaliation she may set the tone of the campaign .
But respond in kind and his message of a new politics is tarnished .
Even though he is behind there in the polls , Pennsylvania cannot come soon enough for Mr Obama .
As the stock market gyrates , and Federal Reserve Board meets by videoconference to inject emergency funds into the system , Chalmers Johnson ’s warning that the US empire is not sustainable  that " this is the way empires end "  resonates rather ominously .
Johnson , whose most recent book is Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , the third volume in his " Blowback " trilogy , argues that military expenditures are a drain on the productive capacity of the economy , and that the mistaken idea of what he calls " military Keynesianism " will eventually be our economic undoing .
The US economy , he avers , has become increasingly dominated by what President Dwight Eisenhower dubbed the " military - industrial complex . "
Rampant militarism has diverted vital resources away from productive use and lines of research , and given other countries  Japan and the EU  the technological edge .
This trend has also hollowed out our economic base , caused a debilitating decay in the physical infrastructure , and led to a growing debt  that is an economic time - bomb that seems to be exploding now .
How many Americans realize the US military budget is greater than that of the rest of the world combined ?
This does n’t include our " off - budget " expenditures in the Iraqi and Afghan theaters , which surpass the combined military budgets of Russia and China .
For the first time , the bill for the " defense " of the United States  a task left to the Department of Homeland Security [ . pdf ] , not the Defense Department  exceeds $ 1 trillion .
And that ’s just what ’s public : the secret " black budget " costs are unknown , and on this score Johnson advises us to heed economist Robert Higgs , who advises us to take any official Pentagon figures and simply double them .
Empires are expensive , and the American version has a peculiarly altruistic twist to it , in that , as Garet Garrett remarked , " everything goes out , and nothing comes in . "
We ’ve financed it all with deficit spending , and rather than impose direct taxation  always a risky proposition  the powers that be have simply set the printing presses of the Federal Reserve on overdrive , creating a huge bubble that ’s about to pop .
As Johnson points out , the whole system is financed by massive borrowing :
" On November 7 , 2007 , the U.S. Treasury announced that the national debt had breached $ 9 trillion for the first time ever .
This was just five weeks after Congress raised the so - called debt ceiling to $ 9.815 trillion .
If you begin in 1789 , at the moment the Constitution became the supreme law of the land , the debt accumulated by the federal government did not top $ 1 trillion until 1981 .
When George Bush became president in January 2001 , it stood at approximately $ 5.7 trillion .
Since then , it has increased by 45 % .
This huge debt can be largely explained by our defense expenditures in comparison with the rest of the world . "
Just as the worldwide Islamist insurgency sparked by Al Qaeda is blowback visited on us by the exigencies of the cold war era , so what we are experiencing , today , is economic blowback from our reigning ideology of military Keynesianism , which has built an economy embedded with a fatal flaw .
In the wake of World War II , the fear of another great depression was rife , and this was a motivating factor in the growth of the " defense " sector  neatly rationalized , as Johnson points out , by the Pentagon ’s NSC - 68 , a document outlining US strategic doctrine authored by Paul Nitze , which proclaimed the cold war dogma of " guns and butter " :
“ One of the most significant lessons of our World War II experience was that the American economy , when it operates at a level approaching full efficiency , can provide enormous resources for purposes other than civilian consumption while simultaneously providing a high standard of living . ”
Except it was n’t , and is n’t , so .
Public works , in the form of ever - higher military spending , created an ever - expanding war - industry that sucked vital resources into avenues that led to a cul de sac , i.e. that had no productive use , such as nuclear bombs .
Our mighty nuclear arsenal , which continues to expand even after the Soviet meltdown , represents trillions of dollars in frozen resources which go nowhere  that is , which produce no goods , and yield no continuing economic benefits .
This has led to the fatal distortion of the American economy , and the massive misallocation of scarce resources : it is the root cause of the collapse of the US manufacturing sector .
As Johnson puts it :
" Over time , a commitment to both guns and butter has proven an unstable configuration .
Military industries crowd out the civilian economy and lead to severe economic weaknesses .
Devotion to military Keynesianism is , in fact , a form of slow economic suicide . "
Not only has America fallen behind by failing to modernize its capital assets and losing its technological edge , it has also corrupted its own currency .
By exponentially expanding credit , the Federal Reserve is weighing down future generations with an unprecedented albatross of debt .
The sheer weight is crushing the vitality out of the American economy , as military development crowds other investments out of the market .
The dollar is no longer the currency of choice : the Euro has taken its place .
All that has to happen , as Johnson points out in the video above , is for the Saudis and other oil - producers to demand Euros instead of dollars , and we ’re sunk .
What is likely to stop the rise of the American empire dead in its tracks is n’t a sudden upsurge in the antiwar movement , the election of a rational President , and / or a sudden radical reversal by the policymaking elite after more than half a century of folly  it ’s bankruptcy that will do it , long before any of these possibilities have a chance to take shape .
Not that this is anything to anticipate with glee : it means social and political disruption on a scale we have scarcely experienced before in this country , perhaps even a revolution .
It surely means the end of our republican form of government , and the institution of something less free , less secure , less faithful to the teachings and traditions of the Founders .
It almost certainly means the end of constitutional government in America , and the beginning of our long , slow decline  or , perhaps , a more dramatic , meteoric descent than anyone now imagines .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Speaking of Chalmers Johnson , our very own Scott Horton has done a great interview with him on Antiwar Radio .
Why militarism is bad economics , how we ’re like the ( late ) Roman Empire , and the strange silence from the " major " presidential candidates on the economic turmoil we ’re facing  all this and more on Antiwar Radio !
A Purdue University archaeologist discovered an intact ancient iron ore mine in South America that shows how civilizations before the Inca Empire were mining this valuable ore .
" Archaeologists know people in the Old and New worlds have mined minerals for thousands and thousands of years , " said Kevin J. Vaughn , an assistant professor of anthropology who studies the Nasca civilization , which existed from A.D. 1 to A.D. 750 .
" Iron mining in the Old World , specifically in Africa , goes back 40,000 years .
And we know the ancient people in Mexico , Central America and North America were mining for various materials .
There is n't much evidence for these types of mines .
" What we found is the only hematite mine , a type of iron also known as ochre , recorded in South America prior to the Spanish conquest .
This discovery demonstrates that iron ores were important to ancient Andean civilizations . "
In 2004 and 2005 , Vaughn and his team excavated Mina Primavera , which is located in the Ingenio Valley of the Andes Mountains in southern Peru .
The research team performed field checks and collected some samples in 2006 and 2007 .
The researchers determined that the mine is a human - made cave that was first created around 2,000 years ago .
An estimated 3,710 metric tons was extracted from the mine during more than 1,400 years of use .
The mine , which is nearly 700 cubic meters , is in a cliffside facing a modern ochre mine .
Vaughn hypothesizes that the Nasca people used the red-pigmented mineral primarily for ceramic paints , but they also could have used it as body paint , to paint textiles and even to paint adobe walls .
The Nasca civilization is known for hundreds of drawings in the Nasca Desert , which are known as the Nasca - Lines and can only be seen from the air , and for an aqueduct system that is still used today .

Vaughn and his team discovered a number of artifacts in the mine , including corncobs , stone tools , and pieces of textiles and pottery .
The age of the items was determined by radiocarbon dating , a process that determines age based on the decay of naturally occurring elements .
" Archaeologists have a very good sequence of pottery from this region , so I can look at most pots from this region and determine a date within a century that is based on stylistic changes of the pottery , " Vaughn said .
" Even before the dating , we knew this was an ancient mine because of the ceramic pieces .
These very small fragments , about the size of a penny , had distinct designs on them that are characteristic of the early Nasca civilization . "
The artifacts from the excavation are being curated by the Instituto Nacional de Cultura of Peru at its museum in Ica , Peru .
Now that there is archaeological evidence that ancient cultures in the Andes were mining iron ore , it is important to give credit to New World civilizations , Vaughn said .
" Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals , such as copper , they never smelted iron like they did in the Old World , " he said .
" Metals were used for a variety of tools in the Old World , such as weapons , while in the Americas , metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite . "
This excavation was part of Vaughn 's Early Nasca Craft Economy Project , a multiyear National Science Foundation - funded study of Nasca ceramic production and distribution .
The project 's goal is to better understand the origins of inequality and political economy in this ancient culture .

Vaughn says material scientists and engineers , as well as mineralogists , will be interested in this discovery .
" This study of mining is a great example of how archaeology bridges the social and physical sciences , " he said .
The National Science Foundation and the Heinz Foundation funded the Mina Primavera excavation .
Next , Vaughn will be excavating a habitation site that has a 4,000 - year occupation in hopes of understanding the long - term settlement history of the region .
" I hope to continue surveying for mines and mining - related sites in the region , and hopefully undertake additional excavations at the mine , " he said .
The findings of the excavation are published in December 's Journal of the Minerals , Metals & Materials Society .
Intermediate Python : Pythonic file searches
It 's very easy to get up and running with Python , but programmers coming from other more verbose or procedural languages tend to write code that 's not very pythonic — that is , it does n't use Python idioms that experienced programmers use .
The problems with un - pythonic code are that it tends to be more verbose , more difficult to understand , and even to run slower .
Here 's a naive implementation of a function to find every line in a supplied filename containing a specified string .
It returns a list of ( line_num , line ) tuples .
def naive_way ( to_find , filename ) :
" " " Find string to_find in file filename " " "
file_handle = open ( filename )
line_number = 0
lines = [ ]
done = False
while done == False :
line = file_handle .
readline ( )
if not line :
done = True
else :
line_number += 1
index = line .
find ( to_find )
if index > - 1 :
lines . append ( ( line_number , line ) )
return lines
This code is fairly readable and it gets the job done , but we can do better .
Notice all these variables lying around ?
Those are bad because they clutter up the function ( making the intent of the function harder to see ) , and actually slow down the code .
Things like " line_number += 1 " are more costly than you might expect , because every time you write " 1 " you 're creating an object .
We can get rid of " done " and " file_handle " by iterating over the file rather than using the low - level readline ( ) method .
We can avoid the code to increment " line_number " by using the built - in enumerate generator function .
Finally , we can get rid of " index " by using the " in " statement .
Here 's a more pythonic version of the above function :
def pythonic_way ( to_find , filename ) :
" " " Find string to_find in file filename " " "
lines = [ ]
for line_num , line in enumerate ( open ( filename ) ) :
if to_find in line :
lines . append ( ( line_num +1 , line ) )
return lines
Remember what I said about pythonic code being faster ?
Here are the times I got for running these functions 100 times , searching for " your system " in " / python25/readme.txt " ( rounded to nearest three decimals ) :
Without psyco With psyco naive_way 0.411 s 0.213 s pythonic_way 0.116 s 0.082 s
Psyco manages to narrow the gap a bit ( probably by optimizing away those object creations ) , but even with psyco the pythonic function is 2.5 x faster , not to mention more readable ( to a Python programmer , at least ! ) .
And since bugs are directly correlated to number of lines of source code , it 's likely to have fewer bugs as well .
Aamer Anwar ( front right ) with Mohammed Siddique senior
The move follows a statement read by Aamer Anwar after the trial of Mohammed Atif Siddique in September .
Judge Lord Carloway said the matter should now be considered by the High Court in Edinburgh .
In response Mr Anwar said the right to freedom of speech was one of the pillars of liberty and justice .
Siddique , 21 , from Alva , in Clackmannanshire , was convicted of three terror charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison .
After the verdict , outside the High Court in Glasgow , Mr Anwar said his client did not receive a fair trial and it took place in an " atmosphere of hostility " .

The Glasgow lawyer described the trial outcome as a " tragedy for justice " .
Siddique 's solicitor also said that the prosecution was " driven by the State " .
Mr Anwar faces a hearing before up to three judges at the High Court .
In his written note , Lord Carloway said the remarks made by Mr Anwar were his personal views .
He described the statement to the media after the verdict as a " multi- faceted tirade " .
" The remarks appeared to be an unjustified attack on almost every area of the trial process , other than the defence , " said Lord Carloway .
The judge said that " the statement seems to be an attack on the fairness of the trial and thus presumably an attack on the court itself " .
He added : " I will remit this matter for determination of the High Court in Edinburgh . "
In response to Lord Carloway 's note , Mr Anwar said : " I cherish the right to freedom of speech which is one of the pillars of liberty and justice , but as matters are under judicial consideration it would be inappropriate for me to comment until proceedings are concluded . "
A date has yet to be fixed for the High Court hearing .
At a hearing two weeks ago , Mr Anwar 's counsel said the solicitor believed he was " espousing the word of his client " .

Rep. Shea-Porter Discusses Impeachment
“ Congresswoman Carol Shea - Porter discusses the contempt against Josh Bolten and Harriet Miers .
She also talks about whether the Congress should impeach President Bush . ”
Her excuses ?
Chaos , and Time .
So , apparently once the president has been in office for over 3 years , they can do anything they wish .
And apparently she does n’t like the stress of a chaotic work place .
Drama is a bummer .
So is lawlessness .
Bush 's radio address this morning brought few surprises .
WASHINGTON - President Bush said Saturday that Democratic leaders in the House are blocking key intelligence legislation so trial lawyers can sue phone companies that helped the government eavesdrop on suspected terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Terrorists are plotting new attacks against America " at this very moment , " Bush said in renewing his call for the House to pass legislation needed to renew the intelligence law that expired last weekend .
And the AP stenographer somehow misses the fact that it was Bush and the Republicans in Congress who blocked key intelligence legislation and are continuing to do so by refusing to participate in the House / Senate conference on the bill .
Oh , those pesky facts .
But , there are still some reporters on the job , exploring administration claims .
Here 's WaPo's Dan Eggen and Ellen Nakashima on yesterday 's letter from Mukasey and McConnell on " lost intelligence . "
Eggen and Nakashima report :
The Bush administration said yesterday that the government " lost intelligence information " because House Democrats allowed a surveillance law to expire last week , causing some telecommunications companies to refuse to cooperate with terrorism - related wiretapping orders .
But hours later , administration officials told lawmakers that the final holdout among the companies had relented and agreed to fully participate in the surveillance program , according to an official familiar with the issue .
In other words , Mukasey and McConnell lied in their letter to Congress .
Again .
Which leads
Glenn to make this point :
But even if telecoms were refusing to cooperate , the reason for their refusal was not because they do n't have retroactive immunity , but rather , it 's because there is alleged uncertainty over the legality of current surveillance requests , and uncertainty over the ongoing validity of the prospective immunity provided by the PAA , because the PAA expired .
If the PAA had been extended , they would be completely protected with prospective immunity for future surveillance cooperation .
And , of course , the PAA would not have expired had Congressional Democrats had their way -- they wanted to extend it until they could agree to a new bill .
Thus , any alleged refusal on the part of telecoms to cooperate is exclusively the fault of Bush and House Republicans for forcing expiration of the PAA .
That 's just true as a matter of basic logic .
But leave all of that aside for a moment .
Since Mike Mukasey himself just said in this letter that spying outside of FISA is " illegal , " and since it 's indisputable that the Bush administration did just that for years , does n't that compel him as Attorney General to commence a criminal investigation into this " illegal " conduct ?
An interesting point , and one our House and Senate leaders should be carefully considering before they move on with this legislation .
The Attorney General of the United States - - our nation 's chief law enforcement officer -- just admitted , in a letter to them , that the wiretapping the government has been conducting since 2001 is illegal .
And they knew it .
Does Congress really want to be rewarding such a brazen flouting of the law ?
Tuesday , March 11 , 2008
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has described President Bush 's veto of CIA waterboarding ban as , among other things , " a brazen move signaling a callous disregard for human rights . "
The executive director of the ACLU , Anthony Romero , said that " it is fundamentally un-American when our president vetoes laws against torture . "
Romero believes " the president 's veto sends a message to the world that despite Congress ' actions , our country will continue to engage in this inhumane and heinous conduct when we should be affirming unequivocally and in one voice that torture and abuse will stop and never happen again .
No one is above the rule of law , including the president .
Congress should hold firm and persist in trying to get an anti-torture bill signed into law . "
John McCain 's support of the bill was also mentioned with Caroline Fredrickson saying that " Senator McCain has been the leading voice in Congress on the issue of torture for many years .
He led the charge in 2005 to extend the Army Field Manual to all DoD agencies .
But by voting ' no ' last month , he has given President Bush cover to veto a further extension that would rein in the CIA .
The president cannot continue telling our citizens and the world that the United States does not torture when , at the same time , he vetoes legislation that would outlaw such policies .
America needs Congress to continue sending President Bush anti-torture legislation until he complies with the will of the people and the Congress and signs it in to law . "
The bill , which passed the House of Representatives in November and the Senate in February despite warnings that it would be vetoed , established guidelines for intelligence activities .
One of these guidelines would limit the CIA to only using interrogation methods allowed in the U.S. Army Field Manual .

The bill would add $ 35 billion to the child health program , providing a total of $ 60 billion over the next five years .
The money would allow states to cover nearly four million children , in addition to the six million already on the rolls .
The program helps families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid , but not enough to afford private insurance .
Democrats made impassioned pleas for the bill as a way to alleviate hardship caused by the nation ’s economic difficulties .
But they did not convert the Republicans .
On Oct. 18 , when the House sustained the president ’s veto of a similar bill , 44 Republicans voted for it .
By contrast , on Wednesday , 42 Republicans voted with 218 Democrats to override the veto .
Some Republicans said the nation ’s economic problems strengthened their case against the bill to expand the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , commonly known as S - chip .
“ We will come back to this floor in the next week or two with a $ 150 billion economic stimulus package to get us out of a recession , ” said Representative Phil Gingrey , Republican of Georgia .
“ We need the money for that .
We do n’t want to be squandering money to provide health insurance for those who can afford to do it for themselves . ”
In his latest veto message , Mr. Bush said the bill would “ result in government health care for approximately two million children who already have private health care coverage , ” from employers or other sources .

Recent finds could turn Brazil into a leading global energy supplier
The company believes the new field , Jupiter , could match the recently discovered Tupi oil field in size .
Tupi is thought to be one of the largest fields discovered in the past 20 years .
But Petrobras officials say further work needs to be done to establish Jupiter 's exact dimensions .
The new field is located just 37 km ( 23 miles ) from Tupi , some 5,100 m ( 5,600 yards ) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean , around 290 km from Rio de Janeiro , Petrobras says .
While not providing any specific details on the size of the new reserve , Petrobras said " its structure could have dimensions similar to Tupi " .
Petrobras estimates Tupi contains between five and eight billion barrels of light oil .
Checking proportions
When the oil field 's discovery was announced last November , the Brazilian government said Tupi could turn the country into one of the World 's major oil suppliers .
Analysts were more cautious , pointing out the difficulty of extracting Tupi 's oil from beneath deep layers of rock and salt .
Petrobras , though , is a world leader in deep water oil production , and the find was hailed as a major discovery for Latin America 's largest country .
The discovery was made by a consortium made up of Petrobras - which has an 80 % stake in the find - and Portugal 's Galp Energies .
A number of surveys will now have to be carried out to try to establish the scale of the new field .
Brazil 's government has recently been forced to deny there was a risk of energy shortages caused by drought at hydroelectric plants which are the country 's main source of energy .
It currently relies on Bolivia for much of its natural gas .
An overwhelming majority are not trying to take Google head on , but rather are focusing on specialized slices of the search world , like searching for videos , blog postings or medical information .
Since Google ’s stated mission is to organize all of the world ’s information , they may still find themselves in the search giant ’s cross hairs .
That is not necessarily bad , as being acquired by Google could be a financial bonanza for some of these entrepreneurs and investors .
But in the current boom , there is money even for those with the audacious goal of becoming a better Google .
Powerset recently received $ 12.5 million in financing .
Hakia , which like Powerset is trying to create a “ natural language ” search engine , got $ 16 million .
Another $ 16 million went to Snap , which has focused on presenting search results in a more compelling way and is experimenting with a new advertising model .
And ChaCha , which uses paid researchers that act as virtual reference librarians to provide answers to users ’ queries , got $ 6.1 million .
Still , recent history suggests that gaining traction is going to be difficult .
Of dozens of search start - ups that were introduced in recent years , none had more than a 1 percent share of the United States search market in November , according to Nielsen NetRatings , a research firm that measures Internet traffic .
Amassing a large audience has proved to be a challenge even for those with a track record and resources .
Consider A9 , a search engine owned by Amazon.com that received positive reviews when it began in 2004 and was run by Udi Manber , a widely recognized search specialist .
Despite some innovative features and early successes , A9 has captured only a tiny share of the market .
Mr. Manber now works for Google , where he is vice president of engineering .
The setback apparently has not stopped Amazon or its chief executive , Jeffrey P. Bezos , from pursuing profits in search .
ChaCha said it counts an investment company owned by Mr. Bezos among its backers , and Amazon is an investor in Wikia .
An Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Bezos does not comment about his personal investments .
Image From left , Steve Newcomb , Lorenzo Thione and Barney Pell are the founders of Powerset , a search engine .

Some start - ups are similarly bullish .
“ We expect to be one of the top three search engines , ” said Riza C. Berkan , the chief executive of hakia .
It is a bold claim , given that hakia ’s technology is not yet ready for prime time , and Mr. Berkan readily concedes it will take time to perfect it .
Lufthansa said it was co-operating fully with the European Commission
Several international airlines have been raided by European Commission officials investigating price - fixing on flights between Europe and Japan .
Germany 's biggest airline Lufthansa confirmed that its offices in Frankfurt had been searched .
Sources at Alitalia quoted by Reuters said that the Italian flag - carrier had also been raided .
Surprise searches happen at an early stage in investigations and do not imply any wrongdoing by the companies .
A statement from the Commission simply confirmed that it had , " carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of a number of international airline passenger carriers " .
It is not clear , how many other airlines are under suspicion .
Lufthansa explained the motive behind the raid on its offices .
" The Commission has information that passenger aviation companies including Lufthansa in Europe and in Japan may have taken part in anti-competitive price fixing and collusive behaviour in traffic between the EU and Japan , " Lufthansa said in a statement .

The News : Ruby on Rails performance is dominated by garbage collection .
We present a set of patches to greatly improve Rails performance and show how to profile memory usage to get further performance gains .
What 's at Stake : Rails is slow for many uses and did not lend itself well to optimization .
Significant performance gains could only be achieved at application level at large development cost .
The Upside : 5 x potential performance gains ; easy way to identify whether GC is a bottleneck ; deterministic process to fix memory bottlenecks ; set of canned patches to solve the biggest problems ; you can help
I do n't have time , make my app 5 times faster !
Apply the monkey patches below .
Enjoy .
Time your app with garbage collection disabled to figure out how much more performance you are leaving on the table .
Enjoy .
Come back for more patches .
Enjoy .
What 's going on here ?
Ruby runtime uses garbage collection .
Your code allocates memory as it runs .
From time to time garbage collector kicks in , halts the whole system , and cleans up no - longer - referenced memory using mark - and - sweep algorithm .
GC gets triggered by multiple conditions .
The one that matters the most is 8 M trigger .
Every time you allocate 8 M of memory GC runs .
Complex Rails request can allocate hundreds or even thousands of megabytes of memory , making GC runs dozens of times .
Each GC pass takes 50 - 150 ms .
You do the math .
It 's possible to patch ruby interpreter , increase the triggers and reduce frequency of garbage collection at the cost of additional memory use .
This helps , but does not resolve the problem .
If there is more garbage , each GC run takes longer .
We 'll devote a separate post to this later .
But , I am running ruby - prof already , you ignorant fool !?
And so are we .
It does not really help :
ruby - prof attributes full cost of garbage collection to the method where GC gets triggered , not the methods that allocate the memory .
That 's like blaming the last straw for breaking the camel 's back .
.
That 's like blaming the last straw for breaking the camel 's back .
ruby - prof does not show that garbage collection took place and how much time it took .
All you can tell is that some method took a long time .
If you go by the these result , and remove the straw that 's breaking the camel 's back his load does not get much lighter .
Statistics being on your side , things are not entirely hopeless .
GC gets triggered within malloc , so methods doing a lot allocations are also likely to trigger GC .
Further , simply allocating memory is relatively expensive , and that will also show up in profiler output .
You might get lucky , optimize ruby - prof hotspot and get better performance , but more often than not you will fail .
The correlation is just too weak .
We believe this is exactly why Rails resisted performance optimization .
Up till now .
Profiling memory allocations
Ruby - prof is almost the right tool for memory profiling .
" Almost " is because the free cheese is only found in the mousetrap .
You 'll have to do some work first .
You need to build patched ruby ( patch here ) and latest ruby - prof ( patch here ) .
With both tools patched , set RubyProf.measure_mode = RubyProf:: MEMORY before running the profiler .
Make sure to turn off GC when profiling for pure performance .
You 'll get get much more representative results .
The detailed HOWTO and description on the process is in our next blog post .
Will it help me ?
In general your code will benefit most if you :
Create or update a lot of rows using ActiveRecord
Run large number of SQL statements of any kind using ActiveRecord , e.g. load many AR object through separate #find calls
Use ActiveView helpers , especially in a loop , to generate complex HTML
Use has_many AR association
It 's easy to tell for sure if you have performance tests .
All that " performance test " means is that you can run a single request and time how long it takes .
Just run the same test as usual , and then with GC disabled and compare the results .
Most code will run much faster with GC disabled .
E.g. for Acunote we test how long it takes to copy 120 tasks from one sprint from another .
Before optimizations with GC : 14 sec Before optimizations w/ out GC : 6 sec
You can't run ruby without GC in production .
It will rapidly run out of memory and crash .
You can , however , apply optimization , produce less garbage and get your code be even faster than original benchmark with GC turned off !
After optimizations with GC : 3 sec
The code that allocates little memory , but is algorithmically complex and is slow because of that , will see little improvement .
For example Acunote 's burndown and sprint completion date calculations fall squarely into this category and did not benefit .
These aside , Acunote performance was dominated by the cost of memory allocation .
Give me the patches !
Problem Patch ActiveRecord :: Base # create calls attributes_with_quotes twice , ActiveRecord : : Base #update once .
# attributes_with_quotes calls #attributes , which clones all attribute values .
None of these clones are necessary .
Impact :
When copying 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 650 M .
Patch improves performance from 14s to 6s .
Notes :
Helps when you do a lot of creates and updates through ActiveRecord .
Rails 1.2 module ActiveRecord class
Base private def attributes_with_quotes ( include_primary_key = true ) result = {} @attributes .
each_key do | name | if column = column_for_attribute ( name ) result [ name ] = quote_value ( read_attribute ( name ) , column ) unless !
include_primary_key && column .
primary end end result end end end Rails 2.0 module ActiveRecord class Base private def attributes_with_quotes ( include_primary_key = true , include_readonly_attributes = true ) quoted = {} @attributes .
each_pair do | name , value | if column = column_for_attribute ( name ) quoted [ name ] = quote_value ( read_attribute ( name ) , column ) unless !
include_primary_key && column .
primary end end include_readonly_attributes ?
quoted : remove_readonly_attributes ( quoted ) end end end Rails surrounds every SQL call and ActionView : : Base #render with Benchmark # realtime .
Benchmark # realtime allocates unnecessary 45 k per call .
Impact :
When copying 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 120M .
Patch improves performance from 6s to 5s .
Notes :
Helps when you do read , create , update lots of AR records , or execute any other SQL , or call # render ( : partial ) in a loop .
module Benchmark def realtime r0 = Time .
now yield r1 = Time .
now r1 . to_f - r0 . to_f end module_function : realtime end Rails 1.2 tries to pretty - print and log every SQL statement even when logger is in Logger : : INFO mode ( production environment ) and prints nothing .
Impact :
When copying 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 17 M .
Patch improves performance by 1s .
Notes :
Helps when you do read , create , update lots of AR records , or execute any other SQL in a loop .
Patch only applicable to Rails 1.2 .
Rails 2.0 has the correct log_info implementation .
Rails 1.2 module ActiveRecord module ConnectionAdapters class AbstractAdapter protected def log_info_with_level_check ( sql , name , runtime ) return unless @logger and @logger .
level == Logger :: DEBUG log_info_without_level_check ( sql , name , runtime ) end alias_method_chain :log_info , : level_check end end end Rails 2.0
No patch necessary .
Comparison of BigDecimal 's ( used by Rails for Numeric data types ) to booleans is slow because it requires unnecessary method_missing call and exception catch .
Impact :
When rendering 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 4 M .
Patch improves performance by 100 - 120ms .
Notes :
Helps when you have the imprudence to accidentally compare BigDecimal 's with true or false .
class BigDecimal alias_method :eq_without_boolean_comparison , :== def eq_with_boolean_comparison ( other ) return false if [ FalseClass , TrueClass ]. include ?
other .
class eq_without_boolean_comparison ( other ) end alias_method :== , :eq_with_boolean_comparison end ActionView :: Helpers :: JavaScriptHelper #link_to_function allocates lots of memory when run .
It runs every time view is rendered .
Impact :
When rendering 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 5 M .
This improves performance by 100 - 110 ms .
Notes :
Helps when you have rich AJAX page with lots of dynamic elements .
It 's worth elimitinating helpers in hostposts identified by memory profiler .
Cumulatively this has huge impact on render - bound requests .
Hand - replace link_to_function with < a href= " # " onclick= " ... " /> .
ActionView :: Helpers :: FormTagHelper # text_field_tag allocates lots of memory when run .
It runs every time view is rendered .
Impact :
When rendering 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 2 M .
This improves performance by 40 - 50 ms .
Notes :
Helps when you have page with lots of input boxes .
It 's worth elimitinating helpers in hostposts identified by memory profiler .
Cumulatively this has huge impact on render - bound requests .
Hand - replace text_field_tag with < input type = " text " /> .
ActionView :: Helpers : : AssetTagHelper #image_tag allocates lots of memory when run .
It runs every time view is rendered .
Impact :
When rendering 120 tasks in Acunote this costs 8 M .
This improves performance by 110 - 150 ms .
Notes :
Helps when you have page with lots of images .
It 's worth elimitinating helpers in hostposts identified by memory profiler .
Cumulatively this has huge impact on render - bound requests .
image_tag itself can be optimized .
Help wanted .
If you do n't use asset hosts , hand - replace image_tag with < img src= " ... " /> .
If you use asset hosts , there 's no patch .
Passing a block to a method on instance of ActiveRecord : : Associations ::{HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation /etc.} chews up memory .
An example ( from activerecord / lib /activerecord /associations.rb ) is association .
select { |record| record .
new_record ?
} line inside # add_multiple_associated _save_callbacks method .
Impact :
This is used all over ActiveRecord code , and often by application code .
Notes :
We have been unable to figure out the root cause .
Help wanted .
Separate article to come .
None known .
Sometimes it helps to convert association to array before using , for example association.to_a.select { |record| record.new_record ? }
How can I help ?

Forget about jogging round the block , the NHS says
The NHS has some new advice for people struggling to schedule a fitness routine into their daily lives - a workout between the sheets .
According to the NHS Direct website , " sexercise " can lower the risk of heart attacks and helps people live longer .
Endorphins released during orgasm stimulate immune system cells , which also helps target illnesses like cancer , as well as wrinkles , it states .
Sexual health experts said such claims could not be scientifically proven .
" It 's good to see the NHS are promoting sexual wellbeing , " Dr Melissa Sayer told the Guardian newspaper .
" Yes , there is evidence that sex has benefits for mental wellbeing , but to say there is a link with reduced risk of heart disease and cancer is taking the argument too far . "
NHS Direct , however , told the paper the content was " backed by science and clinical evidence " and " is n't just a bit of fun " .
' Regular romps '
The advice , published under the headline " Get more than zeds in bed " , is one of several sexual health - related articles to be found on the NHS Direct website .
Sex with a little energy and imagination provides a workout worthy of an athlete , the article says .
If you 're worried about wrinkles - orgasms even help prevent frown lines from deepening
NHS Direct " Forget about jogging round the block or struggling with sit-ups .
" Sex uses every muscle group , gets the heart and lungs working hard , and burns about 300 calories an hour . "
The advice suggests " regular romps this winter " could lead to a better body and a younger look .
Increased production of endorphins " will make your hair shine and your skin smooth , " it adds .
" If you 're worried about wrinkles - orgasms even help prevent frown lines from deepening . "
The article goes on to say that orgasms release " painkillers " into the bloodstream , which helping keep mild illnesses like colds and aches and pains at bay .
The production of extra oestrogen and testosterone hormones " will keep your bones and muscles healthy , leaving you feeling fabulous inside and out " .

What the Price of Gold Is Telling Us
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
The financial press , and even the network news shows , have begun reporting the price of gold regularly .
For twenty years , between 1980 and 2000 , the price of gold was rarely mentioned .
There was little interest , and the price was either falling or remaining steady .
Since 2001 however , interest in gold has soared along with its price .
With the price now over $ 1000 an ounce , a lot more people are becoming interested in gold as an investment and an economic indicator .
Much can be learned by understanding what the rising dollar price of gold means .
The rise in gold prices from $ 250 per ounce in 2001 to over $ 1000 today has drawn investors and speculators into the precious metals market .
Though many already have made handsome profits , buying gold per se should not be touted as a good investment .
After all , gold earns no interest and its quality never changes .
It ’s static , and does not grow as sound investments should .
It ’s more accurate to say that one might invest in a gold or silver mining company , where management , labor costs , and the nature of new discoveries all play a vital role in determining the quality of the investment and the profits made .
Buying gold and holding it is somewhat analogous to converting one ’s savings into one hundred dollar bills and hiding them under the mattress — yet not exactly the same .
Both gold and dollars are considered money , and holding money does not qualify as an investment .
There ’s a big difference between the two however , since by holding paper money one loses purchasing power .
The purchasing power of commodity money , i.e. gold , however , goes up if the government devalues the circulating fiat currency .
Holding gold is protection or insurance against government ’s proclivity to debase its currency .
The purchasing power of gold goes up not because it ’s a so - called good investment ; it goes up in value only because the paper currency goes down in value .
In our current situation , that means the dollar .
One of the characteristics of commodity money — one that originated naturally in the marketplace — is that it must serve as a store of value .
Gold and silver meet that test — paper does not .
Because of this profound difference , the incentive and wisdom of holding emergency funds in the form of gold becomes attractive when the official currency is being devalued .
It ’s more attractive than trying to save wealth in the form of a fiat currency , even when earning some nominal interest .
The lack of earned interest on gold is not a problem once people realize the purchasing power of their currency is declining faster than the interest rates they might earn .
The purchasing power of gold can rise even faster than increases in the cost of living .
The point is that most who buy gold do so to protect against a depreciating currency rather than as an investment in the classical sense .
Americans understand this less than citizens of other countries ; some nations have suffered from severe monetary inflation that literally led to the destruction of their national currency .
Though our inflation — i.e. , the depreciation of the U.S. dollar — has been insidious , average Americans are unaware of how this occurs .
For instance , few Americans know nor seem concerned that the 1913 pre-Federal Reserve dollar is now worth only four cents .
Officially , our central bankers and our politicians express no fear that the course on which we are set is fraught with great danger to our economy and our political system .
The belief that money created out of thin air can work economic miracles , if only properly managed ,  is pervasive in D.C .
In many ways we should n’t be surprised about this trust in such an unsound system .
For at least four generations our government - run universities have systematically preached a monetary doctrine justifying the so - called wisdom of paper money over the foolishness of sound money .
Not only that , paper money has worked surprisingly well in the past 35 years — the years the world has accepted pure paper money as currency .
Alan Greenspan bragged that central bankers in these several decades have gained the knowledge necessary to make paper money respond as if it were gold .
This removes the problem of obtaining gold to back currency , and hence frees politicians from the rigid discipline a gold standard imposes .
Many central bankers in the last 15 years became so confident they had achieved this milestone that they sold off large hoards of their gold reserves .
At other times they tried to prove that paper works better than gold by artificially propping up the dollar by suppressing market gold prices .
This recent deception failed just as it did in the 1960s , when our government tried to hold gold artificially low at $ 35 an ounce .
But since they could not truly repeal the economic laws regarding money , just as many central bankers sold , others bought .
It ’s fascinating that the European central banks sold gold while Asian central banks bought it over the last several years .
Since gold has proven to be the real money of the ages , we see once again a shift in wealth from the West to the East , just as we saw a loss of our industrial base in the same direction .
Though Treasury officials deny any U.S. sales or loans of our official gold holdings , no audits are permitted so no one can be certain .
The special nature of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world has allowed this game to last longer than it would have otherwise .
But the fact that gold has gone from $ 252 per ounce to over $ 1000 means there is concern about the future of the dollar .
The higher the price for gold , the greater the concern for the dollar .
Instead of dwelling on the dollar price of gold , we should be talking about the depreciation of the dollar .
In 1934 a dollar was worth 1/20th of an ounce of gold ; $ 20 bought an ounce of gold .
Today a dollar is worth 1/1000th of an ounce of gold , meaning it takes $ 1000 to buy one ounce of gold .
The number of dollars created by the Federal Reserve , and through the fractional reserve banking system , is crucial in determining how the market assesses the relationship of the dollar and gold .
Though there ’s a strong correlation , it ’s not instantaneous or perfectly predictable .
There are many variables to consider , but in the long term the dollar price of gold represents past inflation of the money supply .
Equally important , it represents the anticipation of how much new money will be created in the future .
This introduces the factor of trust and confidence in our monetary authorities and our politicians .
And these days the American people are casting a vote of no confidence  in this regard , and for good reasons .
The incentive for central bankers to create new money out of thin air is twofold .
One is to practice central economic planning through the manipulation of interest rates .
The second is to monetize the escalating federal debt politicians create and thrive on .
Today no one in Washington believes for a minute that runaway deficits are going to be curtailed .
In March alone , the federal government created an historic $ 85 billion deficit .
The current supplemental bill going through Congress has grown from $ 92 billion to over $ 106 billion , and everyone knows it will not draw President Bush ’s first veto .
Most knowledgeable people therefore assume that inflation of the money supply is not only going to continue , but accelerate .
This anticipation , plus the fact that many new dollars have been created over the past 15 years that have not yet been fully discounted , guarantees the further depreciation of the dollar in terms of gold .
There ’s no single measurement that reveals what the Fed has done in the recent past or tells us exactly what it ’s about to do in the future .
Forget about the lip service given to transparency by new Fed Chairman Bernanke .
Not only is this administration one of the most secretive across the board in our history , the current Fed firmly supports denying the most important measurement of current monetary policy to Congress , the financial community , and the American public .
Because of a lack of interest and poor understanding of monetary policy , Congress has expressed essentially no concern about the significant change in reporting statistics on the money supply .
Beginning in March , though planned before Bernanke arrived at the Fed , the central bank discontinued compiling and reporting the monetary aggregate known as M3 .
M3 is the best description of how quickly the Fed is creating new money and credit .
Common sense tells us that a government central bank creating new money out of thin air depreciates the value of each dollar in circulation .
Yet this report is no longer available to us and Congress makes no demands to receive it .
Though M3 is the most helpful statistic to track Fed activity , it by no means tells us everything we need to know about trends in monetary policy .
Total bank credit , still available to us , gives us indirect information reflecting the Fed ’s inflationary policies .
But ultimately the markets will figure out exactly what the Fed is up to , and then individuals , financial institutions , governments , and other central bankers will act accordingly .
The fact that our money supply is rising significantly cannot be hidden from the markets .
The response in time will drive the dollar down , while driving interest rates and commodity prices up .
Already we see this trend developing , which surely will accelerate in the not too distant future .
Part of this reaction will be from those who seek a haven to protect their wealth — not invest — by treating gold and silver as universal and historic money .
This means holding fewer dollars that are decreasing in value while holding gold as it increases in value .
A soaring gold price is a vote of no confidence in the central bank and the dollar .
This certainly was the case in 1979 and 1980 .
Today , gold prices reflect a growing restlessness with the increasing money supply , our budgetary and trade deficits , our unfunded liabilities , and the inability of Congress and the administration to rein in runaway spending .
Denying us statistical information , manipulating interest rates , and artificially trying to keep gold prices in check wo n’t help in the long run .
If the markets are fooled short term , it only means the adjustments will be much more dramatic later on .
And in the meantime , other market imbalances develop .
The Fed tries to keep the consumer spending spree going , not through hard work and savings , but by creating artificial wealth in stock markets bubbles and housing bubbles .
When these distortions run their course and are discovered , the corrections will be quite painful .
Likewise , a fiat monetary system encourages speculation and unsound borrowing .
As problems develop , scapegoats are sought and frequently found in foreign nations .
This prompts many to demand altering exchange rates and protectionist measures .
The sentiment for this type of solution is growing each day .
Though everyone decries inflation , trade imbalances , economic downturns , and federal deficits , few attempt a closer study of our monetary system and how these events are interrelated .
Even if it were recognized that a gold standard without monetary inflation would be advantageous , few in Washington would accept the political disadvantages of living with the discipline of gold — since it serves as a check on government size and power .
This is a sad commentary on the politics of today .
The best analogy to our affinity for government spending , borrowing , and inflating is that of a drug addict who knows if he does n’t quit he ’ll die ; yet he ca n’t quit because of the heavy price required to overcome the dependency .
The right choice is very difficult , but remaining addicted to drugs guarantees the death of the patient , while our addiction to deficit spending , debt , and inflation guarantees the collapse of our economy .
Special interest groups , who vigorously compete for federal dollars , want to perpetuate the system rather than admit to a dangerous addiction .
Those who champion welfare for the poor , entitlements for the middle class , or war contracts for the military industrial corporations , all agree on the so - called benefits bestowed by the Fed ’s power to counterfeit fiat money .
Bankers , who benefit from our fractional reserve system , likewise never criticize the Fed , especially since it ’s the lender of last resort that bails out financial institutions when crises arise .
And it ’s true , special interests and bankers do benefit from the Fed , and may well get bailed out — just as we saw with the Long - Term Capital Management fund crisis a few years ago .
In the past , companies like Lockheed and Chrysler benefited as well .
But what the Fed cannot do is guarantee the market will maintain trust in the worthiness of the dollar .
Current policy guarantees that the integrity of the dollar will be undermined .
Exactly when this will occur , and the extent of the resulting damage to the financial system , cannot be known for sure — but it is coming .
There are plenty of indications already on the horizon .
Foreign policy plays a significant role in the economy and the value of the dollar .
A foreign policy of militarism and empire building cannot be supported through direct taxation .
The American people would never tolerate the taxes required to pay immediately for overseas wars , under the discipline of a gold standard .
Borrowing and creating new money is much more politically palatable .
It hides and delays the real costs of war , and the people are lulled into complacency — especially since the wars we fight are couched in terms of patriotism , spreading the ideas of freedom , and stamping out terrorism .
Unnecessary wars and fiat currencies go hand - in - hand , while a gold standard encourages a sensible foreign policy .
The cost of war is enormously detrimental ; it significantly contributes to the economic instability of the nation by boosting spending , deficits , and inflation .
Funds used for war are funds that could have remained in the productive economy to raise the standard of living of Americans now unemployed , underemployed , or barely living on the margin .
Yet even these costs may be preferable to paying for war with huge tax increases .
This is because although fiat dollars are theoretically worthless , value is imbued by the trust placed in them by the world ’s financial community .
Subjective trust in a currency can override objective knowledge about government policies , but only for a limited time .
Economic strength and military power contribute to the trust in a currency ; in today ’s world , trust in the U.S. dollar is not earned and therefore fragile .
The history of the dollar , being as good as gold up until 1971 , is helpful in maintaining an artificially higher value for the dollar than deserved .
Foreign policy contributes to the crisis when the spending to maintain our worldwide military commitments becomes prohibitive , and inflationary pressures accelerate .
But the real crisis hits when the world realizes the king has no clothes , in that the dollar has no backing , and we face a military setback even greater than we already are experiencing in Iraq .
Our token friends may quickly transform into vocal enemies once the attack on the dollar begins .
False trust placed in the dollar once was helpful to us , but panic and rejection of the dollar will develop into a real financial crisis .
Then we will have no other option but to tighten our belts , go back to work , stop borrowing , start saving , and rebuild our industrial base , while adjusting to a lower standard of living for most Americans .
Counterfeiting the nation ’s money is a serious offense .
The founders were especially adamant about avoiding the chaos , inflation , and destruction associated with the Continental dollar .
That ’s why the Constitution is clear that only gold and silver should be legal tender in the United States .
In 1792 the Coinage Act authorized the death penalty for any private citizen who counterfeited the currency .
Too bad they were n’t explicit that counterfeiting by government officials is just as detrimental to the economy and the value of the dollar .
In wartime , many nations actually operated counterfeiting programs to undermine our dollar , but never to a disastrous level .
The enemy knew how harmful excessive creation of new money could be to the dollar and our economy .
But it seems we never learned the dangers of creating new money out of thin air .
We do n’t need an Arab nation or the Chinese to undermine our system with a counterfeiting operation .
We do it ourselves , with all the disadvantages that would occur if others did it to us .
Today we hear threats from some Arab , Muslim , and far Eastern countries about undermining the dollar system - not by dishonest counterfeiting , but by initiating an alternative monetary system based on gold .
Would n’t that be ironic ?
Such an event theoretically could do great harm to us .
This day may well come , not so much as a direct political attack on the dollar system but out of necessity to restore confidence in money once again .
Historically , paper money never has lasted for long periods of time , while gold has survived thousands of years of attacks by political interests and big government .
In time , the world once again will restore trust in the monetary system by making some currency as good as gold .
Gold , or any acceptable market commodity money , is required to preserve liberty .
Monopoly control by government of a system that creates fiat money out of thin air guarantees the loss of liberty .
No matter how well - intended our militarism is portrayed , or how happily the promises of wonderful programs for the poor are promoted , inflating the money supply to pay these bills makes government bigger .
Empires always fail , and expenses always exceed projections .
Harmful unintended consequences are the rule , not the exception .
Welfare for the poor is inefficient and wasteful .
The beneficiaries are rarely the poor themselves , but instead the politicians , bureaucrats , or the wealthy .
The same is true of all foreign aid — it ’s nothing more than a program that steals from the poor in a rich country and gives to the rich leaders of a poor country .
Whether it ’s war or welfare payments , it always means higher taxes , inflation , and debt .
Whether it ’s the extraction of wealth from the productive economy , the distortion of the market by interest rate manipulation , or spending for war and welfare , it ca n’t happen without infringing upon personal liberty .
At home the war on poverty , terrorism , drugs , or foreign rulers provides an opportunity for authoritarians to rise to power , individuals who think nothing of violating the people ’s rights to privacy and freedom of speech .
They believe their role is to protect the secrecy of government , rather than protect the privacy of citizens .
Unfortunately , that is the atmosphere under which we live today , with essentially no respect for the Bill of Rights .
Though great economic harm comes from a government monopoly fiat monetary system , the loss of liberty associated with it is equally troubling .
Just as empires are self - limiting in terms of money and manpower , so too is a monetary system based on illusion and fraud .
When the end comes we will be given an opportunity to choose once again between honest money and liberty on one hand ; chaos , poverty , and authoritarianism on the other .
The economic harm done by a fiat monetary system is pervasive , dangerous , and unfair .
Though runaway inflation is injurious to almost everyone , it is more insidious for certain groups .
Once inflation is recognized as a tax , it becomes clear the tax is regressive : penalizing the poor and middle class more than the rich and politically privileged .
Price inflation , a consequence of inflating the money supply by the central bank , hits poor and marginal workers first and foremost .
It especially penalizes savers , retirees , those on fixed incomes , and anyone who trusts government promises .
Small businesses and individual enterprises suffer more than the financial elite , who borrow large sums before the money loses value .
Those who are on the receiving end of government contracts — especially in the military industrial complex during wartime — receive undeserved benefits .
It ’s a mistake to blame high gasoline and oil prices on price gouging .
If we impose new taxes or fix prices , while ignoring monetary inflation , corporate subsidies , and excessive regulations , shortages will result .
The market is the only way to determine the best price for any commodity .
The law of supply and demand cannot be repealed .
The real problems arise when government planners give subsidies to energy companies and favor one form of energy over another .
Energy prices are rising for many reasons : Inflation ; increased demand from China and India ; decreased supply resulting from our invasion of Iraq ; anticipated disruption of supply as we push regime change in Iran ; regulatory restrictions on gasoline production ; government interference in the free market development of alternative fuels ; and subsidies to big oil such as free leases and grants for research and development .
Interestingly , the cost of oil and gas is actually much higher than we pay at the retail level .
Much of the DOD budget is spent protecting our oil supplies , and if such spending is factored in , gasoline probably costs us more than $ 5 a gallon .
The sad irony is that this military effort to secure cheap oil supplies inevitably backfires , and actually curtails supplies and boosts prices at the pump .
The waste and fraud in issuing contracts to large corporations for work in Iraq only add to price increases .
When problems arise under conditions that exist today , it ’s a serious error to blame the little bit of the free market that still functions .
Last summer the market worked efficiently after Katrina — gas hit $ 3 a gallon , but soon supplies increased , usage went down , and the price returned to $ 2 .
In the 1980s , market forces took oil from $ 40 per barrel to $ 10 per barrel , and no one cried for the oil companies that went bankrupt .
Today ’s increases are for the reasons mentioned above .
It ’s natural for labor to seek its highest wage , and businesses to strive for the greatest profit .
That ’s the way the market works .
When the free market is allowed to work , it ’s the consumer who ultimately determines price and quality , with labor and business accommodating consumer choices .
Once this process is distorted by government , prices rise excessively , labor costs and profits are negatively affected , and problems emerge .
Instead of fixing the problem , politicians and demagogues respond by demanding windfall profits taxes and price controls , while never questioning how previous government interference caused the whole mess in the first place .
Never let it be said that higher oil prices and profits cause inflation ; inflation of the money supply causes higher prices !
Since keeping interest rates below market levels is synonymous with new money creation by the Fed , the resulting business cycle , higher cost of living , and job losses all can be laid at the doorstep of the Fed .
This burden hits the poor the most , making Fed taxation by inflation the worst of all regressive taxes .
Statistics about revenues generated by the income tax are grossly misleading ; in reality much harm is done by our welfare / warfare system supposedly designed to help the poor and tax the rich .
Only sound money can rectify the blatant injustice of this destructive system .
The Founders understood this great danger , and voted overwhelmingly to reject emitting bills of credit ,  the term they used for paper or fiat money .
It ’s too bad the knowledge and advice of our founders , and their mandate in the Constitution , are ignored today at our great peril .
The current surge in gold prices — which reflects our dollar ’s devaluation — is warning us to pay closer attention to our fiscal , monetary , entitlement , and foreign policy .
Meaning of the Gold Price — Summation
A recent headline in the financial press announced that gold prices surged over concern that confrontation with Iran will further push oil prices higher .
This may well reflect the current situation , but higher gold prices mainly reflect monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve .
Dwelling on current events and their effect on gold prices reflects concern for symptoms rather than an understanding of the actual cause of these price increases .
Without an enormous increase in the money supply over the past 35 years and a worldwide paper monetary system , this increase in the price of gold would not have occurred .
Certainly geo-political events in the Middle East under a gold standard would not alter its price , though they could affect the supply of oil and cause oil prices to rise .
Only under conditions created by excessive paper money would one expect all or most prices to rise .
This is a mere reflection of the devaluation of the dollar .
Particular things to remember :
If one endorses small government and maximum liberty , one must support commodity money .
One of the strongest restraints against unnecessary war is a gold standard .
Deficit financing by government is severely restricted by sound money .
The harmful effects of the business cycle are virtually eliminated with an honest gold standard .
Saving and thrift are encouraged by a gold standard ; and discouraged by paper money .
Price inflation , with generally rising price levels , is characteristic of paper money .
Reports that the consumer price index and the producer price index are rising are distractions : the real cause of inflation is the Fed ’s creation of new money .
Interest rate manipulation by central bank helps the rich , the banks , the government , and the politicians .
Paper money permits the regressive inflation tax to be passed off on the poor and the middle class .
Speculative financial bubbles are characteristic of paper money — not gold .
Paper money encourages economic and political chaos , which subsequently causes a search for scapegoats rather than blaming the central bank .
Dangerous protectionist measures frequently are implemented to compensate for the dislocations caused by fiat money .
Paper money , inflation , and the conditions they create contribute to the problems of illegal immigration .
The value of gold is remarkably stable .
The dollar price of gold reflects dollar depreciation .
Holding gold helps preserve and store wealth , but technically gold is not a true investment .
Since 2001 the dollar has been devalued by 60 % .
In 1934 FDR devalued the dollar by 41 % .
In 1971 Nixon devalued the dollar by 7.9 % .
In 1973 Nixon devalued the dollar by 10 % .
These were momentous monetary events , and every knowledgeable person worldwide paid close attention .
Major changes were endured in 1979 and 1980 to save the dollar from disintegration .
This involved a severe recession , interest rates over 21 % , and general price inflation of 15 % .
Today we face a 60 % devaluation and counting , yet no one seems to care .
It ’s of greater significance than the three events mentioned above .
And yet the one measurement that best reflects the degree of inflation , the Fed and our government deny us .
Since March , M3 reporting has been discontinued .
For starters , I ’d like to see Congress demand that this report be resumed .
I fully believe the American people and Congress are entitled to this information .
Will we one day complain about false intelligence , as we have with the Iraq war ?
Will we complain about not having enough information to address monetary policy after it ’s too late ?
If ever there was a time to get a handle on what sound money is and what it means , that time is today .
Inflation , as exposed by high gold prices , transfers wealth from the middle class to the rich , as real wages decline while the salaries of CEOs , movie stars , and athletes skyrocket — along with the profits of the military industrial complex , the oil industry , and other special interests .
A sharply rising gold price is a vote of no confidence in Congress ’ ability to control the budget , the Fed ’s ability to control the money supply , and the administration ’s ability to bring stability to the Middle East .
Ultimately , the gold price is a measurement of trust in the currency and the politicians who run the country .
It ’s been that way for a long time , and is not about to change .
If we care about the financial system , the tax system , and the monumental debt we ’re accumulating , we must start talking about the benefits and discipline that come only with a commodity standard of money — money the government and central banks absolutely cannot create out of thin air .
Economic law dictates reform at some point .
But should we wait until the dollar is 1/1,000 of an ounce of gold or 1/2,000 of an ounce of gold ?
The longer we wait , the more people suffer and the more difficult reforms become .
Runaway inflation inevitably leads to political chaos , something numerous countries have suffered throughout the 20th century .
The worst example of course was the German inflation of the 1920s that led to the rise of Hitler .
Even the communist takeover of China was associated with runaway inflation brought on by Chinese Nationalists .
The time for action is now , and it is up to the American people and the U.S. Congress to demand it .

この↓WiFiリフレクタの効果すげー！ という話。
http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template2/index.html
Wii の WiFi受信感度はあまりよろしくないようで、自宅リビングでのWii Opera Browserが快適に使えないことがある。そこで、WiFi環境を調整することにした。現状、無線LAN APとリビングが自宅の対角線上にあり、間に壁(ドア)が2枚挟まっている上体。メーカーが発売している指向性アンテナを購入することで受信感度が良化することは想像できたが、何千円という出費を覚悟せねばならないし、購入したからといってどれぐらい良化するかはやってみないとわからない。さらに、
802.11nへと切り替わらんとする時期のため、ルーター(AP)買い替えの際に使えなくなってしまう可能性が高いアンテナを買う気にはなれなかった。
で、ダメモトで試してみたのがこちらの動画にある、自作無線LAN電波リフレクタ(以下反射板 )だ。
詳しくは日本語で下記ページに説明があるので割愛するが、材料はA4用紙1枚と料理用のアルミホイルのみ。原価10円ぐらい？時間も10分もあれば作れてしまうお手軽アイテムなのだが効果は絶大。
下記がリビングで計測した802.11b電波受信感度状態。Think Pad x30*1内蔵無線LANを利用し、network stumblerを用いて計測。
反射板を取り付けた状態で計測を開始、10:45:50時点で反射板を取り外してメーカー出荷状態のダイポールアンテナのみの状態に。速度差があるだけでなく、反射板なしの状態だと電波状態が安定せず、乱高下を繰り返しているのが見て取れる。それじゃぁと、リフレクタを逆方向(リビングルームと正反対の向き)にしてみたところ、感度激DOWN。明らかに『リフレクタ』として機能していることがよくわかる。
数値にすると10〜15dBm近い感度UPを実現し、さらにその状態で安定した受信状態を確保できることもわかった。無線LANの感度でお悩みの諸氏は是非ともだまされたと思って一度試してみて欲しい。尚、送信側・受信側双方に取り付けるがベストだが、今回は受信側がノートPCだったこともあり、送信側( WiFi AP ) のみにリフレクタを取り付けた状態での計測である。
尚、無線LANアンテナの改造は違法だが、反射板の設置は問題ない模様。

Raham , Ali and Safi perform in a warehouse used by the UN
A few months ago the group started receiving death threats warning them against continuing their show , entitled A Child is as Scared as a Country .
But the clowns kept going , until two members of the troupe were murdered .
This was enough to drive the surviving three to leave Iraq .
" We do n't know why they targeted us .
We were entertaining children , " says Rahman .
Like many thousands of fearful Iraqis , Rahman and his fellow clowns left their home and fled to Syria .
Not knowing what awaited them in Syria , they went to the UN refugee agency to register and ended up working with the UNHCR to entertain refugee children .
Harmless victims
Despite all efforts to provide security in Iraq , large numbers of Iraqis are still fleeing the country , with about 1,000 reportedly crossing into Syria daily , where they join a population of more than one million .
The show brings laughter to a community struggling to survive
" We are lucky to find a job here , but we are stuck .
We cannot leave , and we cannot even develop our work , " says Rahman .
" We want to continue our studies and live safely .
I left everything behind , my family and home . "
The group hopes to be able to develop its repertoire , and maybe even travel the world giving performances .
" I miss Iraq but I can not go back .
We are afraid we will be killed ...
That 's our destiny , " said Rahman .
It always seems hard to understand the seemingly ceaseless killing in Iraq - even more so when the victims are as apparently harmless as a troupe of clowns .
If you do n’t feel comfortable doing this , simply tell the waitperson that you are on a diet and will share a meal .
Be sure they do n’t bring you an extra plate and charge an extra
We are not asking you to become thin like some of your Hollywood stars .
We encourage you to stay at home to save money ( See our Couple Tips ) , but when you dine at a restaurant , please share the meal with your mate .
Split your meal with your sweetie when you eat out .
Earthling , you have to stop eating so much .
We are amazed at how large the meals are when we go out in the public to eat .
To survive the recession , you are going to have to start cutting down on everything .
That includes your meals at a restaurant or at home .
" split plate " charge .
We have seen some restaurants do this .
Can you believe the cheesiness ?
You wo n’t starve by sharing a meal .
American humans throw away much of their food anyway .
Eating less during recession allows you to lose weight , look better and fitter .
This will enable you to have more passionate sex with your mate , or to help you find a new mate .
We did not understand what the big fuss was about looking thin and fit when we landed here on Planet Earth .
However , we successfully assimilated into the Earthling culture to understand that watching your weight is good for your health , body and mind .
Warning , Earthlings .
Please do not share a meal with a complete stranger at the next table .
We tried it once and it was not successful .
We later learned that even if you are trying to pick up that stranger to be your future mate , so that you can have mad passionate sex with them , it is not proper to try to share a meal with them unless they are already your mate .
Live and learn .
We did .
Splitting with friends .
Whether you can get them to agree to split a meal or not , at least split the tab during the recession .
Be lean and save money like us .
Split your meals at restaurants .
A " mature " videogame rating is usually meant to warn players -- and parents -- of oozing wounds , virtual nudity or other adult fare .
But " Passage , " a downloadable PC game released in late November , shows that a videogame can be considered mature for its artful design and emotional payoff .
" Passage " was developed by 30 - year - old programmer Jason Rohrer for an indie game exhibition , and before long the game was the subject of intense , sometimes moving commentary among bloggers .
It 's impossible to discuss the game without trampling ...
One of the workshops I ’m most commonly asked to give at my university is usually called “ Alternative Careers in Science . ”
I do n’t give it that name myself –it ’s what the group inviting me , or the program director , always calls it .
They do n’t mean becoming a music composer or a patent examiner ; they mean getting a job that is n’t a professor in academia .
Because , to them , anything else IS alternative , and , ergo , inferior .
Here ’s a list of the common characteristics of a cult :
1. Authoritarian structure
2. Isolation from society and use of mind control techniques
3. Control of the environment
Let ’s look at academia and graduate training from this standpoint :
1. Authoritarian structure
How many blogs are there by grad students writing about their frustration with their advisor , or Post - docs and PI friction ?
One person has the power .
2. Isolation from society and use of mind control techniques
Some of the lists of mind control techniques are both amusing and horrifying when viewed in the context of academia and grad students :
Peer Group Pressure – Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to belong .
Confusing Doctrine – Encouraging blind acceptance through complex lectures on an incomprehensible doctrine .
Verbal Abuse , Sleep Deprivation and fatigue – Creating disorientation and vulnerability by prolonging mental and physical activity and withholding adequate rest and sleep .
Dress Codes – Removing individuality by demanding conformity to the group dress code .
Financial Committment – Achieving increased dependence on the group
Controlled Approval – Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and punishing similar actions .
Yep .
That lab coat you have to wear does n’t seem so innocent now , does it ? :)
Who do grad students and faculty hang out with ?
Other grad students and faculty .
Students and faculty are pressured to put long hours in at the lab , which further isolates them .
To succeed , you must learn a way of speaking and thinking that is utterly unlike that of others .
We teach students a “ special language ” of science , which is incomprehensible to outsiders .
( Try having a non-scientist examine an issue of Science , if you do n’t believe me . )
We teach a special way of writing , which makes information even less accessible to outsiders .
In fact , I ’ve had a paper criticized for being “ too literary . ”
In other words , “ I could understand it easily , so it must not be any good . ”
3. Control of the environment
If you have n’t seen it yet , here ’s where it becomes very clear .
A career in Academia is the Only True Way .
Anything else is inferior :
“ Mystical Manipulation : “ principles ” can be put forcibly and claimed exclusively , so that the cult and its beliefs become the only true path to salvation ( or enlightenment )
Demand for Purity :
The world becomes sharply divided into …the absolutely good and the absolutely evil … tendencies towards guilt and shame are used as emotional levers for the group ’s controlling and manipulative influences ( emphasis mine )
You did n’t publish your thesis ?
Wait , it was in that journal ?
You want to get a job WHERE ??
Confession : sessions in which one confesses to one ’s sin are accompanied by patterns of criticism and self - criticism , generally transpiring within small groups with an active and dynamic thrust toward personal change ( emphasis mine )
Journal club and peer review , anyone ?
Doctrine Over Person :
If one questions the beliefs of the group or the leaders of the group , one is made to feel that there is something inherently wrong with them to even question …. one is made to feel that doubts are reflections of one ’s own evil when doubt arises , conflicts become intense
“ I just was n’t good enough for tenure . ”
“ She just is n’t strong enough to deal with the normal demands of working in a lab . ”
“ She ’s too sensitive about her race . ” ….etc .
Dispensing of Existence : those who are not in the group are not enlightened ; impediments to legitimate being must be pushed away or destroyed …. if one leaves this group , one loses their salvation / transformation , or something bad will happen to them
Alternative careers =not a faculty member = not my choice , therefore , inferior choice .
I really hate doing that ‘ alternative career ” workshop , so I started giving this little presentation on cults at the beginning , whenever I talk to grad students .
The reaction has been really amazing –the grad students love it .
The faculty hate it .
They find it insulting .
Huh .
Obama sweeps in the Virgin Islands
Simon Caines , the executive director of the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands , shared in a brief interview just now the preliminary results of that territory 's caucuses , which produce the equivalent of three delegates .
With all of the votes there in , Caines said , the preliminary count is :
Obama : 1,772 votes ( 89.9 percent )
Clinton : 149 votes ( 7.6 percent )
" We believe Sen . Obama will receive all three of our pledged delegates , " said Caines .
( He then explained that -- because nothing can be simple -- the territory actually has six delegates , each of whom has half a vote -- so the equivalent of three . )
West Texas Oil Drilling Is Booming — No Surprise
We just returned from four days of hiking in Big Bend National Park , and today we drove 500 miles in Texas along I - 10 .
A number of oil wells were pumping vigorously along the highway .
When we took the same road 6 years ago , the wells were there , but they were not pumping .
This is no surprise : in 2002 the price of crude oil was below $ 30 per barrel , and today it is over $ 100 per barrel .
The 2002 price of $ 30 exceeded the marginal cost of pumping oil out of these wells , which probably are not among the most efficient .
At today ’s price , every barrel pumped yields a profit , so profit - maximizing rig owners have reactivated these old wells .
This is a standard response in a competitive industry – as the product price rises , suppliers move up the short - run supply curve .

March 24 , 2008 – 10:45 pm
During my college years , I was able to get away with 3 - 4 hours of sleep a day during the week , but ended up sleeping 12 + hours during the weekend .
Polyphasic sleep , a method of taking multiple short naps during the day , theoretically allows you to stay up 21 hours a day indefinitely .
Imagine being able to stay up 21 - 22 hours a day with no ill effect or degradation of your cognitive or physical functionality .
The personal projects you would be able to start / finish , the quiet time you would have for yourself , the endless late night reruns you can watch , all things you can do with your extra time .
Well , you can ! by adopting an Polyphasic Sleep schedule .
“ Polyphasic sleep is a sleep pattern specification intended to compress sleep time to 2 - 5 hours daily .
This is achieved by spreading out sleep into short ( around 20 - 45 minute ) naps throughout the day .
This allows for more waking hours with relatively high alertness . ” – wikipedia
There are several variations of schedules for the Polyphasic sleep , Uberman , Everyman and Dymaxion , each having its own schedules and nap length .
Blogger Steve Pavlina provides a detailed log of his foray into adopting a Polyphasic Sleep schedule .
Adopting a Polyphasic sleep schedule definitely seems possible , and appealing .
Of course , you would have to have a lifestyle that would accommodate naps at scheduled points during the day , college schedules , or self employed or a being employed at a very liberal work environment could definitely would fit this mold .
Wikipedia cites several notable individuals who may have adopted some form of Polyphasic sleep :
New Mexico‘s Regulation and Licensing Department has denied US Airways a permit to serve alcohol in the state — and that includes the state ’s airspace .
The decision came after a temporary 90 - day permit expired , which was put into place after a passenger who was allegedly over - served on a US flight got behind the wheel .
Dana
Pabst then drove the wrong way down I25 and hit a van carrying a family of 5 .
Everyone 6 people including Pabst were killed .
Other incidents where flight attendants reportedly over - served passengers were also taken into account .
US Airways can apply again for a state liquor license , but the company would have to show that it was “ prepared to meet New Mexico standards in their practices . ”

How Animals See The World :
Horse Vision :
Horses and similar animals such as zebras have their eyes pointing sideways ( as opposed to straight ahead ) in order to give them outstanding peripheral vision .
This will give them advanced warning of predators , enabling them to escape if necessary .
This benefit does come with a few drawbacks , though .
For one , these animals will have a blindspot directly in front of their noses ( as illustrated in the picture at right ) .
Another disadvantage is a lack of binocular vision .
A horse will always see two images , and cannot merge the images together like a human can ( right ) .
Although horses have better night vision than humans , their color vision is rather poor .
They can make out greens and blues , but a horse 's sight is mostly in shades of gray .
Bee Vision :
The bee also uses compound eyes , but can not see the color red .
Their visual world is mostly made up of yellow , green , and blue .
They can , however , see the ultraviolet spectrum .
Honeybees also have three additional eyes called " ocelli " that can't make out images , but are sensitive to light .
Insect Vision :
Most insects use compound eyes , made up of hundreds or even thousands of tiny lenses placed together in a honeycomb pattern .
Contrary to popular belief , the insect does not see hundreds of copies of the same image at once .
Rather , each lens makes up a small part of the overall picture , similar to a mosiac or jigsaw puzzle .
One compound eye can have from 10 to 30,000 sections , depending on the insect .
Dragonflies and Praying Mantises can have the most sections , up to 30,000 .
Color perception can vary greatly , as well .
Some insects such as butterflies can see far more colors than us , while others see far fewer .
Bird Vision :
Daytime birds see a greater range of colors than humans , including ultraviolet light .
As humans , we have never actually seen many of these colors , so a bird 's actual vision would be very difficult ( if not impossible ) to emulate here .
It is generally accepted that color is much more vibrant in a typical bird 's vision than it is in humans .
Hunting birds such as the eagle , kestrel and vulture are know to have outstanding binocular vision , enabling them to easily spot prey from thousands of feet away .
Snake Vision :
Snakes will use their normal eyes during the day , but at night it will change over to its other pair of " eyes " .
These pit organs can pick up infrared heat signals from warm objects in their surroundings .
During the day , a snake 's vision is very dependent on movement .
In fact , they have been known to ignore ( or not notice ) any prey that is completely motionless .
Shrimp And Crab Vision :
Shrimps and crabs have the least developed vision on our list .
They have compound eyes similar to an insect , but give much less detail .
The picture on the right shows what one shrimp would look like to another .
Luckily , shrimps and crabs are very good at picking up signals from sudden movements in their surroundings .
This is one of their best defences against predators .
Dog And Cat Vision :
It is generally accepted that dogs and cats are color blind .
They only see very pale shades of color , and many have vision that is comparable to a human who is red - green color blind ( which means they can't tell the difference between red and green ) .
However , they do have better peripheral and night vision than us , with eyes that are much more sensitive to movement .
These traits were helpful when these animals actually had to hunt for a living !
Not all animals see the world as humans do .
For many animals , the world is seen in fuzzy shades of gray , or very " washed out " and pale colors .
But some animals can see in total darkness , or even see colors beyond the visual spectrum , that humans have never seen .
Still others can use binocular vision to spot prey from thousands of feet away .
Here 's a look at vision from an animal 's point of view :
Horse - Eye View
Human - Eye View
Shark Vision :
Although a shark 's eyes are similar to ours ( both are made up of a retina , lens , iris , cornea and pupil ) , our visual abilities are quite different .
A shark has no retinal cones , and therefore cannot detect colors .
In addition , a shark 's eyes are designed to pick up as much light as possible , in order to see further in murky waters .
But although they can use this extra light to see objects up to 60 feet away , their vision is still not as acute ( sharp ) as ours .
Singapore 's Health Care System : A Free Lunch You Can Sink Your Teeth Into By Bryan Caplan
In The Undercover Economist , Tim Harford highly praised the health care policies of Singapore .
But it was n’t until I read the section on health care in Ghesquiere ’s Singapore ’s Success that I realized how amazing the official numbers are .
If the following is true , all the comparisons showing that the U.S. greatly outspends Europe without getting better health are beside the point , because Singapore makes Europe look like the U.S. :
The Singapore government spent only 1.3 percent of GDP on healthcare in 2002 , whereas the combined public and private expenditure on healthcare amounted to a low 4.3 percent of GDP .
By contrast , the United States spent 14.6 percent of its GDP on healthcare that year , up from 7 percent in 1970 …
Yet , indicators such as infant mortality rates or years of average healthy life expectancy are slightly more favorable in Singapore than in the United States …
It is true that such indicators are also related to the overall living environment and not only to healthcare spending .
Nonetheless , international experts rank Singapore ’s healthcare system among the most successful in the world in terms of cost - effectiveness and community health results .
How does Singapore do it ?
Singapore is no libertarian health care paradise , but it does self - consciously try to maintain good incentives by narrowly tailoring its departures from laissez - faire :
The price mechanism and keen attention to incentives facing individuals are relied upon to discourage excessive consumption and to keep waste and costs in check by requiring co-payment by users . [… ]
The state recovers 20 - 100 percent of its public healthcare outlay through user fees .
A patient in a government hospital who chooses the open ward is subsidized by the government at 80 percent .
Better - off patients choose more comfortable wards with lower or no government subsidy , in a self - administered means test .
I ’ve heard a lot of smart people warn that co-payments are penny - wise but pound - foolish , because people cut back on high - benefit preventive care .
Unless someone is willing to dispute Singapore ’s budgetary and health data , it looks like we ’ve got strong counter - evidence to this view : Either Singaporeans do n’t skimp on preventive care when you raise the price , or preventive care is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be .
More details on how Singapore ’s system works :
There are mandatory health savings accounts : “ Individuals pre-save for medical expenses through mandatory deductions from their paychecks and employer contributions …
Only approved categories of medical treatment can be paid for by deducting one ’s Medisave account , for oneself , grandparents , parents , spouse or children : consultations with private practitioners for minor ailments must be paid from out - of - pocket cash … ”
“ The private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare , which helps contain prices in both directions .
Private medical insurance is also available . ”
Private healthcare providers are required to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping .
to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping .
The government pays for “ basic healthcare services … subject to tight expenditure control . ”
Bottom line :
The government pays 80 % of “ basic public healthcare services . ”
Government plays a big role with contagious disease , and adds some paternalism on top : “ Preventing diseases such as HIV / AIDS , malaria , and tobacco - related illnesses by ensuring good health conditions takes a high priority . ”
The government provides optional low - cost catatrophic health insurance , plus a safety net “ subject to stringent means - testing . ”
Last year , Robin Hanson stuck his neck out and argued that we should cut health spending in half .
If Singapore ’s numbers are right , Robin was being conservative .
Singapore has achieved American health outcomes for about a quarter of the share of GDP the U.S. spends .
Furthermore , if Canada shows that socialized medicine can save a few percent of GDP without hurting health , Singapore shows that the free lunch offered by greater government control is meager compared to the free lunch offered by old - fashioned individual incentives .
WILMINGTON , Del . 
Five years after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , Bree Tease is trying to balance the obligations she feels to Iraqis and to the children whose needs she sees every day in her fourth - grade class .
" Over here , there are so many ways we could use that money , " the teacher , 27 , says .
" But then I think about the poor families and children in Iraq , and they did n't do anything wrong . "
If U.S. troops withdraw , Iraq could fall into chaos .
So should they stay ?
" You have to leave at some point , " she says , uncertain over when .
Her frustration is repeated around the table when a dozen Delaware residents of various political bents gathered one evening last week to talk about the Iraq war with USA TODAY .
As the fifth anniversary of the invasion approaches next week , their conversation mirrors a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll that finds attitudes toward the nation 's deadliest conflict since Vietnam threaded with crosscurrents — particularly among those who want to set a firm timetable to pull out U.S. troops .
The survey finds the 40 % of Americans who want to stay the course in Iraq are relatively united — confident the invasion was justified and the consequences of withdrawing too soon disastrous .
IN THEIR OWN WORDS : Americans ' views on what 's next in Iraq
However , the 60 % who call the invasion a mistake and want to set a timetable to get out are fractured into four distinct groups , a USA TODAY analysis of public opinion toward the war concludes .
They include those who want U.S. troops out immediately and others , like Tease , who argue America has an obligation to improve Iraq 's stability before going .
Such divisions have complicated efforts in Congress to force a change in President Bush 's war policy .
The unsettled sentiment over the war is clear in the conversation about Iraq in a conference room at The News Journal in Wilmington ( which , like USA TODAY , is owned by Gannett ) .
Meeting over sandwiches and soft drinks after the workday is over , the discussion begins when each participant is asked to write down a word or two that describes the situation in Iraq .
" People in need , " writes Lynn Tarney , 64 , a retired camp director .
" Mistake , " writes Joseph Coccia , 27 , a technical writer for a chemistry company .
" Unnecessary death and destruction , " writes Yahna Talley , 38 , a program coordinator at a family resource center .
" Sand , " writes Bill Shields , 49 , the vice president of a plastics manufacturing company .
Sand ?
" It 's easy to step in it , but it 's hard to get out , " he explains .
Seven of the 12 have seen the war touch their lives — much like the 55 % in the USA TODAY poll who say a family member , friend or co-worker has served in Iraq .
Ron Burkett , 49 , a real estate agent and former teacher who argues in favor of getting out as quickly as possible , has bumped into former students who have been deployed there .
A childhood pal of Coccia has completed one tour in Iraq and another in Afghanistan .
Talley and Kassia Bradigan have close friends whose husbands are serving in Iraq .
A former boyfriend of Tease was killed there a year ago .
An analysis of the telephone survey of 2,021 adults taken Feb. 21 - 24 and the conversation around the table in Wilmington reflect the complex and sometimes conflicting ways Americans view the war .
Respondents clustered into five distinct groups :
• The war 's defenders make up 40 % of the total and are the most affluent and conservative group .
They say Iraqis will be better off in the long run as a result of the invasion and warn the consequences of pulling out would be catastrophic .
Nearly two - thirds say terrorist attacks on the United States are more likely if U.S. troops leave .
Seven in 10 back Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , over his Democratic rivals .
" There have been some good consequences for ( Iraqis ) — school systems … and police training , " Tarney says .
The United States ' status as a world power carries obligations that " the American spirit " will meet , she says .
" We always come up with solutions and we always will , " learning from mistakes that were made in Iraq in the past .
• Those who want to get out now , whatever the consequences , include nearly one in five Americans .
They see no U.S. obligation to establish better security in Iraq before leaving , arguing that the U.S. troop presence is provoking violence and making things worse for Iraqis and Americans .
They decry the war 's cost and say the money being spent on it ought to be devoted to problems at home .
In a new book , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz estimates the total cost of the war will reach $ 3 trillion or more , a number the Pentagon calls inflated .
Last fall , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and anti-terrorism expenditures overseas had cost $ 600 billion since 2001 and could cost a total of $ 2.4 trillion over the next decade .
" There 's going to be a civil war " in Iraq , Shields says .
" It 's either going to be now , if we get out now , or it 's going to be 15 years from now , if we pull out 15 years from now . "
• War opponents who want security established first , before withdrawing , make up another one in five Americans .
This is the group that most strongly supports Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama over Hillary Rodham Clinton — no surprise since it is dominated by the younger voters who have streamed to his campaign .
" The soldiers need to be home , " says Tally , calling herself " torn " on the question of how quickly to pull out .
" There 's a lot of destruction , a lot of death , and it needs to stop .
At the same time , I 'm concerned about the people there , the families there .
…
Those people are just going to be left vulnerable . "
• The most pessimistic , just over one in 10 Americans , say the conflict has been a disaster for both the United States and Iraq , and they see no end in sight .
Most expect a significant number of U.S. troops to remain there for at least five more years .
Iraqis will be much worse off over the long run as a result of the invasion , most in this group say , predicting history will judge the war as a failure .
" At the time we invaded Afghanistan there was al - Qaeda in Afghanistan , " Coccia says .
" Now there 's al - Qaeda in Iraq because of what we did there .
What 's next ?
Pakistan ?
Saudi Arabia ?
It 's a mess over there , and we 're knee - deep in it . "
• One anti-war group has largely tuned out .
This cluster , including one in 10 Americans , calls the invasion a mistake and backs a timetable for withdrawal but declines to assess the consequences of keeping troops in Iraq or bringing them home .
This group gives Clinton her strongest support .
" I think so , yes … but I do n't really know much about what 's going on , " Bradigan , 38 , says about whether she thinks U.S. troops should pull out .
She is an administrative assistant at a bank and the mother of three school - age children , including 9 - year - old twin boys .
" I do n't watch the news . "
Election ' a referendum ' on war
The debate over Iraq is likely to be sharpened in this year 's presidential campaign in a way not seen since President Bush ordered the invasion launched in 2003 .
McCain has been the invasion 's most consistent defender on Capitol Hill and an early critic of how the administration was executing the war .
He 's likely to stand against Illinois Sen .
Obama , who has made his opposition to the war the foundation of his presidential bid , or New York Sen .
Clinton , who says she would withdraw her vote to authorize the Iraq war if she could and promises to start a pullout within 60 days of taking office .
" This election is going to be a referendum , to some extent , on the war , " says Alan Abramowitz , a political scientist at Emory University who studies public opinion on Iraq .
In the USA TODAY poll , six in 10 Americans said the United States should set a timetable for withdrawal and stick to it no matter what .
Just 35 % said U.S. troops should remain until the situation in Iraq gets better , a number as low as it's ever been .
That would seem to be a boon to Democrats , but the politics of Iraq are n't that simple .
Among the groups of anti-war voters , McCain draws support from one - third of those who are the most pessimistic about the future of the Iraq conflict , a group that includes a mix of Republicans and Democrats .
In a head - to - head contest against Clinton , McCain also wins one - third of those who want to get out but feel obliged to achieve more security first .
He has argued to them that , whatever differences they have on the wisdom of the invasion , he is the candidate best able to stabilize Iraq .
McCain 's appeal to some anti-war voters makes it possible that he could put together a majority coalition — or at least neutralize the issue — despite the downturn in public opinion toward the war .
" You can not go into a country and destroy everything and leave it in chaos without helping them rebuild some kind of infrastructure , " says Jennifer Curry , 59 , one of the Delaware residents who joined the roundtable discussion .
She supports withdrawing U.S. troops but only when Iraq is reasonably stable .
" I mean , there 's a limit , " she says , " but I think we owe it to them to give them a shot . "
" If we leave there now , what will happen ? " counters Burkett , a former Marine .
" If we wait a year and leave there , what will happen ?
The answer will still be the same whether we 're there six months or whether we wait 10 years and leave . "
Anthony Lewis , 59 , an audio- visual specialist , wants policymakers to brainstorm for fresh solutions .
" We 've tried the Army , the Navy , the Marines , and that has n't worked , " he says .
" Somebody needs to say , ' Switzerland knows somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody — let 's see if we can't sit down and talk . '
What we 're doing is not working .
We 've spent millions of dollars at this .
Somebody has to say , ' Time out . ' "
What happens next ?
Support for setting a timetable for withdrawal has n't wavered even as attitudes toward last year 's increase in U.S. force levels improve :
Four in 10 now say it has made the situation in Iraq better , a more positive reading than last summer and early fall .
And most Americans support a pull - out plan even though they also predict damaging repercussions as a result .
By wide margins , those surveyed said that pulling out U.S. troops would make it more likely that a broader war in the Middle East erupts , more likely that Iraqis will die from violence and more likely that al - Qaeda will use Iraq as a base for terror operations .
They were evenly split over whether staying or going makes it more likely that the United States would be attacked by terrorists .
" I think we keep forgetting that the war is going to come to us , " says Rafael Castro , 45 , the facilities director at a Wilmington community center .
" And I do n't think that America 's prepared for that — the terrorism , the way it 's growing . "
Castro and others worry , too , about the impact the war has had in the United States , especially for the troops who have served there .
Talley thinks " all the time " about " just how they 're going to get on with their lives and rebuild their own lives at home with their families — all the time lost , all the deaths they 've seen . "
The war has changed the nation in ways that may be hard to recognize , Lewis says .
" Iraq , to me , is like a puddle , " he says .
" We 've thrown a rock into it and the effects have come out like ripples . "
Cynicism toward the government has swelled .
By 53 % - 42 % , the widest margin ever , those polled said the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , the prime justification given for going to war .
" I 'm so distrustful of our government , " Curry says .
Jeffrey Loveland , 32 , a business analyst , adds , " I still wonder what 's going on with Osama bin Laden . "
Several are suspicious about why and how bin Laden has eluded capture , 6 ½ years after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The conversation ends with the participants writing down a word or two that describes the impact on the United States of the Iraq war , five years after it began .
" Awareness , " writes Tarney , the retired camp director .
" Politically activating , " writes Shields , the businessman .
" Questioning government 's motives , " writes Tease , the teacher .
" Loss ; grief ; frustration , " writes Janice Chandler , 57 , a retired operations analyst .
Lewis struggles aloud over finding precisely the word he wants .
" You 're for the war or you 're against the war , " the audio - visual specialist says , finally settling on " divisive " as his word .
" It 's put us in two different camps . "
A spectrum of views on what 's next in Iraq
A USA TODAY / Gallup Poll found that four in 10 Americans are relatively unified in supporting the Iraq invasion and opposing timetables for withdrawing U.S. troops .
Among the six in 10 who oppose the war , however , there are significant differences about what to do now .
Here 's a look at how public opinion divides :
We will win Invasion wrong , but U.S. obliged to stay in Iraq
It makes no difference Get out now The profoundly pessimistic Percentage of sample 40 % 20 % 10 % 17 % 12 % Views
This is the only group with majorities saying the invasion was n't a mistake and opposing a timetable for withdrawal .
They opposed the invasion but believe the United States must establish reasonable stability in Iraq before withdrawing troops .
Most say neither staying nor withdrawing troops would affect terrorist attacks on the USA or have other consequences .
This group strongly supports a quick withdrawal , and believes staying would only make things worse for the USA and Iraqis .
Most in this group predict U.S. troops will be in Iraq for years .
They are the most downbeat about the war 's impact on Iraqis and how history will judge the war .
Characteristics
Most affluent group ; mostly conservative , Republican Youngest group ; mostly Democratic , liberal Oldest and least affluent group Mostly Democratic , liberal A mix of Republicans , Democrats
In their own words " The media does n't spell out all the good things , establishing schools and that kind of stuff .
If we can stay the course , we should be able to get Iraq on its own two feet . "
Greg Huddleson , 44 , Durham , Calif .
" I do think we should set a timetable .
It 's important that the region is stabilized to an extent . "
Jon Gos , 26 , Atlanta
" It is such a complex situation I do n't even know " what will happen .

I really have mixed feelings . "
Barbara Longo , 61 , Pequabuck , Conn .

The Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index fell 2 percent in the morning , then rebounded partly in reaction to a report that said banks were nearing the end of subprime mortgage losses .
It was up nearly 1 percent in the afternoon before paring that gain to close up 0.5 percent , to 1,315.48 points .
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 35.5 points , to 12,145.74 points .

A toxic blend of economic and financial developments is testing policy makers and lawmakers who are struggling to contain the slump brought on by the collapse of the mortgage market , a downturn that now looks sure to push the economy into a recession .
Though current conditions are a far cry from the 1970s , resurgent inflation is raising the threat of stagflation  a condition in which unemployment and the price of goods and services both rise .
Since the credit markets began to seize up in August , the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and the rest of the federal government have often bolstered stocks briefly , but so far they have done little to stem the larger downward drift .
Many specialists say policy makers can do only so much to protect the economy and warn that the government should be careful not to exacerbate inflation and create a new bubble like the one in housing that has burst .
Lower interest rates and increased federal spending may not be enough to shore up growth , and some suggest that the only remedy for the pain may be the pain itself .
A Standard & Poor ’s report predicted that subprime mortgage write - downs at banks were nearly done , though losses in other areas might continue .
“ We have to be careful about what medicines we throw at this , whether it ’s stimulus packages or a bailout , ” said Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Company .
“ A lot of what we are dealing with is a solvency problem .
We need to let the system wash it out . ”
One - Page Flier ( pdf ) of " The L - Curve " / Links to L - Curve related sites / Other writings by David Chandler
The red line , in the image seen below , represents a graph of U.S. household income across the population , mostly based on 2014 census data .
The height of the curve at any point is the height of a stack of $ 100 bills equalling that income .
The census data leaves out incomes over $ 250,000 , which produces a very misleading sense of the disparity in the income distribution .
Your browser does n't support the canvas element .
What are the implications of this picture ?
I am not an economist , but then again , most likely you are n't either .
On the other hand , the economy affects you and me , so we need to come to grips with these issues to participate intelligently in the political process .
There needs to be a genuine national dialog on these issues at all levels .
The L - Curve graph represents income , not wealth .
The distribution of wealth is even more skewed .
Quoting from a recently - published book by political philosopher David Schweickart ,
If we divided the income of the US into thirds , we find that the top ten percent of the population gets a third , the next thirty percent gets another third , and the bottom sixty percent get the last third .
If we divide the wealth of the US into thirds , we find that the top one percent own a third , the next nine percent own another third , and the bottom ninety percent claim the rest .
( Actually , these percentages , true a decade ago , are now out of date .
The top one percent are now estimated to own between forty and fifty percent of the nation 's wealth , more than the combined wealth of the bottom 95 % . )
Quoting from a recently - published book by political philosopher David Schweickart , Think of the L - Curve when you read your daily news [ I hope you do READ your daily news rather than rely on the TV infotainment that masquerades as news ] .
What are its implications for tax structures , campaign finance reform , the policies of the IMF , the WTO , and the World Bank , abandonment of inner cities , factory closings , sweatshop labor , " guest worker " programs , US foreign policy , why we go to war , etc .
How does welfare for the poor stack up against corporate welfare ?

Should the goal be to get motivated and get yourself onto the vertical spike ?
[ Some people who have responded to this site see it this way , but I think that misses the point . ]
I saw a bumper sticker recently that says it best for me :
Our economy produces tremendous wealth but it also produces tremendous poverty .
Sure , some people can be lazy , but when large numbers of hard working people live in poverty and the middle class is shrinking , it is a systemic , not an individual problem .
There is plenty to go around , but it does n't adequately go around .
It goes to the top , and leaves the masses to fight over the crumbs .
( If you are mathematically inclined , check out a recent study of the income distribution that identifies two distinct income classes in the US with different mathematical bahavior . )
True , it has been this way through the ages , but that does n't mean we should be satisfied with such a system .
I believe we can do better .

Some doctors and lawyers and professional people , with incomes over a hundred thousand dollars may feel " rich " .
They may have nicer homes and cars , and they may have attitudes that separate them from the masses .
But they still must work for a living and are primarily consumers of their earnings .
Whether they recognize it or not , they actually have more in common with the people at the bottom than they do with the people in the top 1/2 % .
The horizontal spike has the votes .
The vertical spike has the money .
Who wins , when it comes to electoral politics ?
Who has influence ?
Whose interests are being represented in Washington ?
Can democracy meaningfully exist where the distribution of wealth , and thus the distribution of power , is this concentrated ?
Even in the economic boom times since Ronald Reagan 's presidency , people on the horizontal spike have showed little if any improvement in their condition while huge gains went to the people on the vertical spike .
Can this be considered " prosperity " ?
Do we really want to gear up our national policies to repeat this performance ?
Those in the vertical spike would like to have you resent the poor who are portrayed as welfare leeches .
Which group actually has a bigger negative impact on your lifestyle : the people in the bottom half of the graph , or the people in the vertical spike ?
The people at the bottom are politically virtually powerless .
Those in the vertical spike hire lobbyist 's to craft public policy even more to their advantage .
People on the vertical spike can use their influence single - mindedly and very effectively .
A single billionaire can get the undivided attention of any politician he wants , any time he wants .
If he does n't get what he wants he can , in fact , " fight city hall , " the statehouse , and even the federal government .
People on the horizontal spike must pool their limited individual power and organize to have any effect at all .
This is a very difficult thing to manage , in practice .
, " fight city hall , " the statehouse , and even the federal government .
People on the horizontal spike must pool their limited individual power and organize to have any effect at all .
This is a very difficult thing to manage , in practice .
All of mainstream media has been bought up by people in the " vertical spike . "
The primary channels for information and expressed opinion are controlled and filtered by a small , powerful group on the vertical spike whose interests are not representative of the majority of Americans .
Even when there is no direct political message the programming is tailored to the perspectives and sensitivities of large corporations .
The business of media is to sell advertising .
Television programming is simply the hook to hold an audience until the next commercial .
Serious examination of ideas of any kind is seen as counterproductive to the corporate sponsors because it may alienate or bore part of the potential audience .
The result is nonstop sensationalistic binges ( O.J. , Princess Di , Monica Lewinsky , etc. ) instead of real news .
The growing media monopoly dilutes and distorts the national dialog , and thereby destroys the basis for democracy .
We must find ways to rebuild community and learn to talk to each other directly .
When taxes are cut , whose taxes are cut and whose programs are cut ?
What kinds of taxes are being cut and what kinds of taxes ( whether they are called taxes or not ) are being imposed ?
Sales tax and use fees tax primarily the horizontal spike .
The pre-Reagan progressive income tax drew more from the vertical spike .

Sales tax and use fees tax primarily the horizontal spike .
The pre-Reagan progressive income tax drew more from the vertical spike .
The flat tax would shift the burden downscale even more .
The sales pitch for this shift usually focuses on " simplification . "
Simplification is unrelated to the issue of who the money is coming from .
You could have a simple progressive tax just as easily as a simple flat tax .
The proposal to eliminate the income tax entirely would be disastrous .
Those on the vertical spike would escape virtually all of their obligations and the burden of government would be born almost entirely by those of us on the horizontal spike , both through increases in other forms of taxation and reduction of services .
The income tax originally taxed ONLY the vertical spike .
This is the direction tax reform needs to take if it is to be truly considered " reform . "

This is the direction tax reform needs to take if it is to be truly considered " reform . "
Can the people on the horizontal spike take control of their own destinies and truly make this a nation governed in the best interests of the people ?
If so , how ?
Is the L - Curve " good " or " natural " or " inevitable " ?
What are the alternatives ?
The economy is a complex system , but it is essentially a human invention .
It can be " managed " ( or influenced ) in many ways .
If it is not managed intentionally , then it is managed ( or manipulated ) by those who hold political and economic power , typically to their own advantage .
It is not enough to create a strong economy .
It is just as important to ask how the benefits of the economy are distributed through the population .
We all participate in generating our nation 's wealth .
Why do so few benefit so disproportionately ?
A truly democratic society needs to find ways to manage the economy to benefit the population as a whole .
This is not being done .

( Data sources : Census Bureau / Internal Revenue Service / Economic Policy Institute )
Note : these data sources are notably lacking in data within the top 1 % .
Census data goes up to $ 250,000 and IRS data goes up to $ 1 million .
Information to plot the vertical spike had to be obtained from news articles and other sources of commentary .
If information on the top 1 % is not known or easily obtained , statements about the socioeconomics of income and wealth are suspect .
Michael Parenti has written an illuminating article on this topic .
* Since I first posted this site , several people have quibbled over various technical points .
Here are a few of the issues raised :
" Increase in net worth " is not the same thing as " income , " according to one reader .
However , I recently received a comment from economist John Maher who wrote , " I believe the first reader 's comment is incorrect .
Increase in net worth IS income according to the renowned economist , John R. Hicks in Value and Capital .
Hicks is right . "
The income of very wealthy people typically varies radically from one year to the next .
Sometimes years of huge earnings are followed by years with similarly huge losses .
I agree .
I have added a comment to this effect in the main body of the text above .
Those of us on the horizontal spike , however , find radical jumps in income much harder to achieve .
The overall L - Curve pattern persists through it all .
The published wealth of billionaires is typically estimated by their holdings in their own companies .
These estimates do not include their typically vast diversified investments .
Income on paper , from growth of investments , needs to be distinguished from " taxable income . "
It 's true that there are differences among different kinds of income , so they are n't strictly comparable , but political and economic power derives from wealth , whether it is taxable or not .
My response to all of these kinds of questions , in short , is that the truth of my central thesis is not dependent on the exact height of the graph or shadings of definitions .
As one correspondent put it , there is a " money spike " and there is a " population spike " .
There are two classes in this country .
One class derives concentrated power from its concentrated wealth .
The other class has power only in numbers .
That power is effective only to the extent that it can be mobilized through organization .
Until we come to terms with these issues , phrases such as , " We the people ... , " and , " of the people , by the people , and for the people , " are hollow clichés .

Touch Screen UI Designs
The Touch Screen UI design has the following goals :
1 - 2 taps for most frequent activities
Finger taps -- no stylus required
Familiar ( to desktop users ) where possible
Intuitive
The design proposals described below attempt to meet all these goals .
Touch Screen UI Design V1
Update : Some changes being considered :
Replace the Bookmarks screen with a Places screen that allows access to bookmarks and history , a la FF3 desktop .
The chevron in the URL textbox will not launch a history screen - options are typed URLs , most frequent URLs , or a combination .
Feedback already posted below .
Main Screen
Main Screen
The main browser screen is shown at right .
The toolbar at the bottom contains the most frequently used functions - back / forward , zoom in / out and tabs .
This toolbar cannot be hidden , and is generally present in all browser screens .
The buttons may sometimes change depending on the screen .
Web page content is displayed in the center panel , and can be scrolled / panned directly by dragging .
Scrollbars are normally not shown to maximize screen real estate , but can be shown during scrolling to provide a visual cue of the overall page size .
( Suggest persisting scrollbar on screen for , say , 3 sec after panning , allowing user to then drag scrollbar .
This provides much faster scrolling through long documents since with such a small screen , getting to bottom of long document takes many many pans on an iPhone . )
At the top of the screen is a title bar with a hideable toolbar beneath .
This toolbar has a reload button , a URL bar , and a bookmark button .
This UI layout enables quick 1 - touch access to the most frequent browser activities .
Comment Discussion
I 'm not sure if this belongs in the comment section but I 've created another wiki entry containing a few design notes for smaller screens ... just a few notes and a few mockups .
Basically , I tried to come up with a structure that could be used on anything from a 160x160 numpad - device to a 640x480 touchscreen while sticking as closely as possible to the usual cellphone UI conventions ...
It 's not finished yet ( for example there are no notes so far on how the numpad could be used to get to far away UI elements without continously hitting the direction buttons ) but maybe you can get a few ideas from it .

It may be tough to tap the title bar with your finger without hitting the URL bar by mistake .
True , this will probably be frustrating .
-- Venky I know its never been a popular idea , but there 's also the option of combining the titlebar and urlbar into one thing .
Only show the url when its being edited .
That actually should compliment Places match - the - title - or - url abilities .
- DD2K
One thing to consider is simply scrolling the title bar off the top of the screen when you scroll down through the page , as the iPhone does .
Another option is you can just drag the title + toolbar away to the top , and it vanishes .
The key here is to distinguish between a tap and a tap+drag .
-- Venky
One of the design principles / goals for the original Firefox was to maximize the amount of space available for web content .
I think that is a very good goal to have as it makes you think about what is really necessary to have on the screen all the time .
So one option to consider is to have the " cannot be hidden " items , be available through e.g. a transparent icon ( perhaps an embossed Firefox icon as TV channels use ) that when tapped will bring up these " cannot be hidden " items .
/ Christian Another way to pull the title and toolbar back into view would be to scroll to the top of the page , then , once you have reached the top of the page , keep scrolling , which brings you to the title and tool bar .
To keep people from accidentally bringing up the title and toolbar , there would be a distinctive " click " sound when you reached the top of the page and could n't scroll up it any farther .
Then you would just scroll up a little more , and the title and toolbar would appear .
It would be intuitive .
Many smartphones ( incl all Windows Mobile 5 + devices ) only have 2 smart buttons at the bottom .
It would be logical to offer just two options in the bottom button bar .
And map zooming to a tap - drag button on the top bar or the scroll wheel / updown buttons on some devices .
Or at least visually highlight the button that is bound to the smart buttons .
Another option would be to have a history context menu and a zoom context menu .
The smartnutton would activate the respective option .
The D - pad or a tap +drag would then result in the requested action .
Not that I do n't like the easy accessibility this design offers , it just does n't match any of the UI design principles used by the hardware vendors atm .

It seems to me that the zoom in and out would be much more useful as a slider .
- Nick
It may be better to have just a gesture for zooming , similar to picsel browser , so the browser can be operated with one hand .
Perhaps having a flick and natural scroll like in PocketCM to move throughout the page and if the picsel gesture is copy written then just making a clock wise circle with your thumb to zoom in and counterclockwise to zoom out .
I did not see this covered , but I would like to be able to tap and hold on a link or image in a web page and have a menu pop - up just like when a link or image is right - clicked in the desktop version of Firefox .
Some of the items I 'd like to see in this menu include : Link Info ( or Link Properties ) ,
Open Link in New Tab ,
Copy Link Location ,
View Image ,
Copy Image Location ,
etc. -- Kpr 01:03 , 8 February 2008 ( PST )
I 'd like to be able to zoom in and zoom out on images too instead of only text .
Furthermore , I would like to be able to zoom in on text and images as much as I like without any limitation .
-- Kpr
Will there be a way to drag - select text for copy and paste ?
Potentially a mode where this is the default action for tap and drag ?
-- JimPark I did n't read this anywhere , but for the G1 there was a Tetris game that you could choose which button did what to the tiles , like I would decide the rolly ball to flip the tiles , tap to drop them and slide to move them side to side .
Something along those lines .
So when creating this for the G1 which I hope you will , you can have it where we can choose which button or function does what .
And I think the rolly ball would be best for zooming in and out ! -- : [ [ Kokoroneko 07:28 , 2 February 2009 ( UTC ) ] ]
I really wonder how this is going to work in Landscape Mode , as this draft of the button bar seems to take away a lot of screen space , once the screen is turned by 90deg ( assuming it remains at the bottom of the screen ) ...
You might reduce the size of the buttons and place them at the right hand side of the screen .
2ndly : Do the Buttons really have to be that much bigger than the common Windows Mobile Softkeyboard ?
-- Lukx 22:00 , 3 February 2009 ( UTC )
It looks to me like the toolbars will take up alot of space ( as other people seem to be saying ) .
I 'd just like to throw out there the idea of having the toolbars be " embedded " into the webpage , so the top bar will be above the content of the webpage and the bottom one below it , so you 'll have to scroll to the top of the page to access the top toolbar .
IDK if that 's really doable , but if so it might at be done just with the bottom toolbar ( personally I would n't access those features much ) .
Alternatively the " press and hold " ( or equivalent of a double click ) might reveal a menu that gives you the options of the toolbar (s ) .

Maximized Main Screen
Maximized Main Screen
The URL toolbar may be hidden by tapping on the title bar .
This increases the display area for the web page .
Tapping the title bar again re-displays the URL bar .
Mobile phones screens are SMALL .
The full screen mode should be a real full screen : no title , no URL , no buttons , no Windows / Palm / Symbian / Mac bar , no scroll bar , NOTHING but the web page .
Of course , double - tap should turn full - screen off .
And a popup menu should appear on a long - tap to offer common items ( bookmarks , URL , previous / next , quit , refresh , ... ) .
In addition , a x - small font should be available in the browser .
URL Entry Screen
URL Entry Screen
Tapping the URL textfield opens a new screen as shown to the right .
This screen displays a textbox at the top that displays the currently entered text .
The user may enter a search term or a URL .
Below the URL / search - term text field is a panel that display hints from browsing and search history and bookmarks that match the entered text .
The number of hints shown depends on the display height but in any case the height of each entry field will be sufficient to allow easy touch access .
Note : Clicking on any hint will immediately launch that URL .
The system provided software keyboard is displayed below the hints panel .
This is optional and is displayed only on touch screen devices that do not have an integrated QWERTY keyboard .

When the user clicks " Go " or " Search " in the URL entry screen , the browser displays the page loading screen .
This screen is essentially identical to the Main screen , except that the " reload " button is now a " Stop " button , and allows the user to cancel the request .
Page download progress is displayed in the URL box .
Comment Discussion Changing of the reload to stop has a really nasty effect ; talk to any iPhone user and you will likely encounter them griping about it .
The issue is that you start a page load , decide to stop , and while that command is moving your hand to click the stop button the button changes to reload , so you end up reloading the page you tried to stop loading .
Very confusing , and annoying .
-- Heikki
It is probably a good idea to have the stop button switch to an intermediate disabled reload button ( having a visible difference in color with the real reload ) for a couple of seconds before becoming a reload button .
If the user presses the button just as it is changing state from stop to disabled reload , nothing will happen .
Two seconds later , he will be able to reload the page for real , .
There probably is n't any real world usage where the user needs the real reload button less than two seconds after the page has loaded .
-- Pat Good idea , Pat .
I was thinking along the same lines also .

History on Main Screen
History on Main Screen
To allow easy access to browsing history , the URL box includes a history chevron at the right .
Tapping the history chevron displays the most recently viewed pages .
The list is displayed with the most recent page at the top .
For discussion :
The toolbar icon at the bottom can show different buttons that allow the user to sort the history list in other ways - name , frequency of access , etc .
The title bar and URL bar can be removed in this screen to make more room for history items .
Bookmarks
Bookmarks
The bookmark button allows one tap access to bookmarks .
The bookmarks are displayed as a list that can scrolled easily by dragging .
This design assumes that mobile users do not typically have many bookmarks that are organized in folders .
Double - tapping the bookmark icon will add the current page to the list of bookmarks .
This can be done either in the Main Screen , or in the Bookmark screen .
For discussion :
The toolbar at the bottom can show different buttons for bookmark - specific functions such as sorting by name or frequency , display folders , etc .
The title bar and URL bar can be removed in this screen to make more room for bookmark items .
Comment Discussion In Firefox 3 ( desktop ) , a single click on the star adds a bookmark .
Introducing this inconsistency should only be for a very good reason .
Can we look for alternatives on this one ?
This is possible .
We could have a single tap bookmark the current page , and a double tap open the bookmarks .
The reason for the proposed design is that we more often access bookmarks than create bookmarks , so use 1 - tap to show bookmarks , and 2 - taps to add .
-- Venky
If a single tap on the star opens the bookmarks list , then please add a " plus " (+ ) button in the bookmarks list to bookmark the current page .
I do not think double tapping the star to bookmark a page is very intuitive .
Furthermore , consider changing the star to a book icon to make this functionality more clear and make it look different than Firefox 3 since it is acting different than Firefox 3 .

Tabs Screen
Tabs Screen
Tapping on the " tabs " button in the Main Screen brings up the Tabs Screen .
This screen displays thumbnails of up to 4 tabs and allows the user to tap and select a tab .
The back and forward buttons in the toolbar can be used to scroll / pan across additional tabs if present .
Tapping on the + icon at the center creates a new tab , and automatically selects it , returning to the Main Screen .
For discussion : Scroll / Pan can also be done by dragging the screen .
The toolbar can also display a different set of buttons that are more relevant to the tab operations .
Comment Discussion
The use of Back / Forward buttons to navigate among sets of 4 tabs is not intuitive .
What about adding left and right arrows at the left and right sides of the screen in a row with the plus sign ?
True .
In hindsight ( being 20 /20 ) , we should have removed the titlebar , put only X ( cancel ) and + ( new ) buttons in the bottom toolbar , and let the user scroll by dragging left or right in between the thumbnails .
What do you think ?
-- Venky I think " Tabs " should be renamed to " Pages " since there really are not any tabs like we are used to seeing in Firefox .
For devices with bigger screens , please consider adding real tabs to the top of the Main Screen .
These tabs can be named " 1 " , " 2 " , etc. to save space .

My friends in the UK say I must be mad to stay here , and my family would love us to return .
But it 's not that simple .
We can't just pack up our stuff and go .
My kids have spent most of their lives here - my eldest was only two when we left Britain .
So we stay .
We hope .
We pray .
Newly painted concrete barriers have appeared .

We moved into a house with 10 other adults from my husband 's family .
I did n't have the freedom to do what I wanted and had only my room as my space .
I had to learn a new language , culture and a new way of life .
You can be surrounded by people but still feel lonely and homesick .
It was also the beginning of the sanctions .
The country was starved of commercial goods - for example , disposable nappies were not available , TVs and electrical goods were not permitted .
And I 'm a coffee drinker , and I could n't get hold of the stuff for months at a time .
IRAQ TIME LINE 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war 1990 2 August Iraq invades Kuwait 1990 6 August - UN imposes economic sanctions on Iraq 1991 - 1991 Gulf war 2003 20 March - American - led invasion begins with bombing campaign 2003 9 April - US forces advance into central Baghdad .
2003 14 December - Saddam Hussein captured in Tikrit 2006 February - a bomb attack on an important Shia shrine in Samarra unleashes sectarian violence 2006 30 December - Saddam Hussein is executed by hanging 2007 January - US " surge " strategy announced - thousands more US troops to be dispatched to shore up security in Baghdad .
The 2003 invasion was also a really distressing time .
My mum would tell us about her life in World War II - but I would never have imagined that I would have to live through a war first - hand .
My neighbourhood lies next to the Tigris , about five kilometres ( 3 miles ) from the Green Zone .
It has a Shia majority , but is mixed with Sunnis and some Christians too .
Most of the families are well - established in the area - and we have relatively good community relations .
If you were to come here , you would notice the sounds of generators running all day and night , explosions in the background - but also birds singing in the trees .
Things are getting better .
The surge really does seem to have made a difference , although the death toll is still so high .
It 's alarming to hear some of the stories of what happens to people every day .
Families are torn apart because of the sectarian divide .
A ' normal ' life
Julie 's neighbourhood lies near the Tigris .

In some ways my life is ' normal ' .
I 'm now working for a logistics company after a decade as a housewife .
I take my three girls to school and my son gets a ride with his teacher .
Their dad picks them up after school and takes them to private tutors .
This is a must because teaching is poor and classes are packed with more than 40 pupils .
And I struggle with written Arabic , so I 'm not much help .
But even the school run may be hit by the security situation .
The authorities may block off our roads with trucks , barbed wire and so on - all without any notice .
A five minute journey can become an hour 's trip .
All the small roads are now blocked with newly - painted concrete barriers .
Car bomb
Julie was less than 100 metres from a bomb attack
Back in January , I was less than 100 metres from a car bomb .
I was walking with my husband and my 17 - year - old daughter through an area packed with people shopping .
Suddenly there was an explosion .
A second of silence .
Then a barrage of glass , metal , pieces of wood and shrapnel flew over our heads .
A metallic piece from a neon sign landed a few inches from us .
My husband pulled me and my daughter onto the floor .
We hid our heads under a parked car .
Then people from the small side roads dragged us into their front doors , and gave us water and towels to clean our faces from the dust and dirt .
People were rushing around looking for lost relatives and coming into the alleyways covered in blood from flying glass .
An hour later , they captured another car bomber whose vehicle had broken down .
His car had been packed with explosives , calor gas , nails and petrol canisters .
That event shows the two sides of life here .
The violence , but also the support - from the extended family and the wider community .
People who do n't know you , have never seen you before , will rush to help you .
The future
Julie loves the endless sunshine in Baghdad .

I hope for a prosperous and peaceful Iraq in the future - and I do think it 's possible .
They need to start putting society back together - from the bottom up .
People need the basics to be back in place - like electricity .
But there are signs of progress .
Everyone seems to be using mobile phones now .
Bizarrely , you can also find internet cafes everywhere .
Even in poor areas there are these little oases of knowledge and connection .
Whenever I see young people they 're chatting online , on Facebook .
Young people really want to grow up and be part of the world .
So there is hope .
Dems fret over warring words
WASHINGTON  Democrats are increasingly worried about their chances for victory in November after a series of attacks by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton on rival Sen. Barack Obama 's leadership , credibility , readiness as commander in chief and , now , his ability to win the White House .
The latest twist came Thursday on a conference call with reporters about Pennsylvania , where polls give Clinton a double - digit lead .
Chief Clinton strategist and pollster Mark Penn said the April 22 primary will show that " Hillary is ready to win and that Sen.
Obama really can't win the general election . "
NOMINATION FIGHT :
The voting road ahead
Clinton 's communications director , Howard Wolfson , who was on the call , said later that the context was clear : " If you do n't compete in Pennsylvania , you can't win a general election . "
Clinton is making the case that she 's more electable because she has won primaries in big states .
Obama has won twice as many contests , leads in the delegate count and does as well as or better than Clinton against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in most polls .
" It can not inspire too much confidence in the Clinton campaign when their pollster ignores both polls and math by making comments that are so divorced from reality , " Obama spokesman Bill Burton said .
Democratic pollster Peter Hart said Penn 's assertion is " factually inaccurate " and underscores the potential for Democrats " to take what is a golden year and to turn it into dust . "
Wolfson said the escalation of attacks is not one - sided .
He noted that Obama aides in recent days have called Clinton , among other things , " a monster " and " the most secretive politician in America . "
Penn 's comments about Pennsylvania — a state where the governor , Clinton ally Ed Rendell , has predicted that Obama will have trouble winning the support of white voters — come as the Democrats already are on edge over race and gender politics .
" I think all Democrats are concerned , " said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake .
" If people are n't careful about how they campaign , there 's definitely a danger . "
Clinton fundraiser Geraldine Ferraro , the Democrats ' 1984 vice presidential nominee and the first woman on a major - party ticket , left her campaign post Wednesday after saying Obama would n't be a leading candidate if he were white or a woman .
" There 's a pattern of identifying his race , " said Ofield Dukes , a public relations consultant who attended a meeting of black newspaper publishers here this week .
He said the Clinton campaign is trying to make white voters " see him more as a black candidate than as a person who has a message and a vision . "
There 's also resentment among Clinton loyalists .
Irene Natividad , a past president of the National Women 's Political Caucus , said she has " anger boiling over " because Obama 's critics take more heat than Clinton's .
Some Democrats suggest Clinton 's tactics have already sabotaged one way to reconcile the two camps .
" Take it from me , that wo n't be the ticket , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday about Clinton and Obama in any configuration .
Clinton " has fairly ruled that out by proclaiming that Sen.
McCain would be a better commander in chief than Obama , " she told New England Cable Network earlier in the week .
Obama and Clinton have agreed to face off in an ABC debate April 16 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia .
Obama also has agreed to a CBS debate April 19 in North Carolina , which has a May 6 primary , but Clinton has not said whether she 'll attend .

Opinion
A plan for Barack Obama
It 's been a rough week for Sen.
Barack Obama , and an even rougher week for his supporters .
He took his eye off the ball for a minute to attack Sen. John McCain - and Sen. Hillary Clinton pounced , throwing the kitchen sink at him .
Meanwhile , the thin - skinned media , falling prey to her campaign 's whining about how much " tougher " they 've been on her than on him , allowed her to set the tone for the entire news cycle during the last week before the elections in Ohio and Texas .
( You can fill my in - box all you want , Clinton fans , but the media has been sweeter to Clinton than you know .
There 's been scant mention of Monica , Whitewater , Marc Rich , cattle futures ... oh , did I just say all that ? )
Those of us who admire the senator , meanwhile , are feeling wrung out and exhausted .
Obama 's got to bounce back .
I think that he will - but he 'll have to do it smartly , because for him , the race has entered its most precarious phase .
If he attacks the Clintons using gutter politics , he 'll lose - those are the tactics that they excel at , and he can't beat them at their own game .
More importantly , he risks losing his message and his base by stooping to their level .
Here 's my advice for him and his supporters .
-- Ignore John McCain for now .
The split results in Ohio and Texas offered Obama one advantage - it confused his eventual opponent , John McCain .
McCain had started to attack Obama , but now he 's got to sit tight and watch how this plays out .
Putting the Republican nominee on the sidelines right now probably is n't the best thing for the Democrats in the fall - the Republican National Committee has taken advantage of the calm to outraise the Democratic National Committee by tens of millions of dollars so far - but we 'll have to deal with that later .
For now , Obama can - and must - focus on the battle in front of him .
If he wants to mention how much stronger a president he 'll be than McCain , that 's cool , but only after he 's reminded voters how much stronger he 'll be than Clinton .
--
Be an iron fist in a velvet glove .
There 's no need to be impolite to Clinton .
Unlike some observers , I do n't think it was weak at all for him to accept Samantha Power 's resignation after she called Clinton a " monster . "
It showed that Obama keeps his staff on a tight leash - unlike Clinton - and emphasizes positivity in every aspect of his campaign .
Besides , after the Clinton campaign has impugned Obama 's patriotism , tossed out racial and religious smears , and said that John McCain would make a better president than Obama would , they 're expecting Obama to go ballistic .
Kill the Clintons with kindness - and , since Hillary Clinton is running on the false pretense that she was also president during Bill 's years in the White House , offer calm reminders of how there were a lot of things about the 1990s that were n't so great after all .
Remember losing control of Congress in the 1990s , Democrats ?
Remember losing Democratic control of governorships across the country ?
Remember all the useless psychodramas , remember losing all chance to further any kind of political agenda for the last two years of Bill Clinton 's last term because of his personal problems ?
Say it like that , and the voters will remember .
Even if they do n't want to .
-- Let your surrogates be nastier than you are - up to a point .
Really , there 's so much to be nasty about with this couple that it 's important to remind voters only of the issues that are germane to the race .
Obama should have a couple of his supporters who worked in the Clinton White House remind people that Hillary Clinton has no experience with foreign - policy crises , no experience with economic policy , and that her one experience with health care was a disaster from start to finish .
Pound Clinton on the " experience " meme , and it will quickly become apparent how thin her resume really is .
-- Get on the bus .
Town hall meetings in endless succession .
Photo ops with his sleeves rolled up while in conference with working - class voters about their fears and wishes .
Walk door - to - door talking to people about their health care and explain to them why he's the best person to actually get it done .
You get the picture : Obama 's got to show the skittish undecideds that he works as hard as Clinton does .
Now , for the rest of us , his supporters :
-- Chill out .
I went in to see my acupuncturist a few days ago , and he asked why I was so stressed .
" I wo n't vote for Hillary ! " I yelled .
" I won't ! "
He looked at me impassively for a moment , then said , " I wo n't either .
Half the country wo n't .
But , umm , it 's a long time till November , and how often do you want to be on this table ? "
A view of the Bering Strait land bridge , as it would have appeared about 21,000 years ago .
Humans probably migrated across the temporary link to the New World , recent genetic evidence suggests .
Humans somehow made their way into the Americas from distant lands , but knowing precisely when and from where they made the journey are matters of heated scientific debate .
New genetic evidence , however , backs up a chilly northwestern arrival to North America from Siberia about 12,000 years ago , via a temporary land bridge spanning the Bering Strait .
The findings further challenge an alternative idea that humans sprinkled in to both North and South America on open sea voyages 30,000 years in the past .
" We have reasonably clear genetic evidence that the most likely candidate for the source of Native American populations is somewhere in east Asia , " said Noah Rosenberg , a genetic researcher at the University of Michigan Medical School .
Rosenberg explained that the evidence stems from two genetic trends between Siberian and Native American people :
One , that genetic similarity between the peoples thins out the further south a native is sampled , and two , that a unique genetic mutation can be found only in Native American and Siberian ancestors .
" If there were a large number of migrations , and most of the source groups did n’t have the variant , then we would not see the widespread presence of the mutation in the Americas , " he said .
Because the harmless genetic fluke is reliably found in the two populations , Rosenberg added that the first humans of the New World likely made a single migration — not in several waves as some alternative theories posit .
Rosenberg and his team sampled DNA from 50 populations from around the world and looked specifically at 678 unique genetic markers to investigate human arrival to North America .
The technique allows them to glean information about long - dead ancestors of those tested .
The scientists said genetic oddities in those genes are very fresh , which they take as a strong sign that humans migrated in a recent and single wave instead of arriving in several waves all across North and South America .
How they ventured south once traversing an icy northwestern passage , however , is another question .
In Rosenberg and his colleagues ' study , detailed in a recent edition of the journal PLoS Genetics , the scientists support the idea that humans migrated south along the coasts by boat rather than toughing it out on land .
" A migration route along the coast provides a slightly better fit with the pattern we see in genetic diversity , " Rosenberg said .
( LifeWire ) --
He 's a 38 - year - old executive .
She 's a 34 - year - old homemaker .
He says they never fight , and in many ways they 're compatible -- but not when it comes to sex .
" It 's almost like a checklist , " says Jon ( who asked that his real name not be used ) of their once - a - month lovemaking .
The problem , he believes , is a lack of desire .
Sexually unfulfilling marriages are n't limited to new parents or aging baby boomers with hormone imbalances .
They can ensnare even the relatively young and the recently married .
When they are unable to blame kids , stress or physical issues , many couples struggle unhappily to identify -- and resolve -- the problems behind their lackluster sex life .
Couples end up in sexually unfulfilling marriages for a variety of reasons , says Marty Klein , a licensed marriage counselor and certified sex therapist in Palo Alto , California .
One reason , he says , is America 's obsession with marriage .
Laura Berman , a Chicago sex therapist and relationship expert , agrees .
" We put the blinders on when we 're dating , " she says .
" We focus so much on the wedding , we do n't notice the warning signs . "
Those who believe passion inevitably fades may downplay the sex factor , picking someone they think would be a good father or a good wife even if they 're not an ideal lover , Berman adds .
" I chose her because I thought it would enhance me in some way , " Jon says of his wife .
Berman has seen it before : " People choose partners who have the right resume but maybe not the entire package . "
Other couples enter into relationships with so - so chemistry because they think they 're in love and overlook key differences , says Klein .
Bobbie Jonas , a holistic health practitioner in Calistoga , California , acknowledges she ignored obvious warning signs during her courtship .
" I was more interested in a way out from home , " she says of her first marriage .
Poor communication compounded the effects of weak chemistry .
After 10 years , they divorced .
" Couples wondering where the sex went should be asking if it was ever really there , " says Berman .
That explanation makes sense to Jon .
Although he said he and his wife , who live on the West Coast , started off with great chemistry , the cracks in the relationship began to show before they traded rings .
After a four - month dry spell during their engagement , his wife brought up the idea of canceling the wedding .
" I just really wanted to get married , " Jon says .
" I felt that it was what I was supposed to do . "
Now Jon is having an affair with a woman -- also in a sexually unsatisfying marriage -- for whom he feels intense passion .
" I did n't realize the importance of sex , " he says .
It 's not always a problem
On average , Americans report having sex 85 times a year , according to the 2007 Sexual Wellbeing Global Survey conducted by Harris Interactive for Durex .
The largely online survey polled 26,032 people in 26 countries using random samples of those aged 16 and older .
Therapists generally define " sexless " marriage as having sex less than about 10 times a year , and they estimate 1 in 5 couples are in such a relationship .
But Klein cautions against looking for problems where there are none .
" A dry spell is only a problem if the couple thinks it is , " he says .
" There are plenty of couples who do n't have sex and do n't think there 's anything wrong with it .
And there 's others that are in a lot of pain about it . "
Klein notes that the expectation of eternally passionate sex may be setting people up to fail .
" People have the assumption that you can have long - term , monogamous , hot sex , " he says .
" It 's never been done ( on a large scale ) in the history of the world . "
Getting more sex
Berman offers at least one reason to resolve unsatisfying love lives : " Often , when you 're not having sex , your empathy and ability to connect is lower , and it 's easier to have conflict , " she says .
" It amplifies ( marital ) problems . "
At the Berman Center in Chicago , she counsels couples on repairing their sex lives .
Some advice :
• Try traditional gender roles :
Men may become more sexually assertive if they feel more in control , and women may feel more desire for a mate with newfound machismo .
" You do n't have to get his slippers , " explains Berman .
" You just have to give him some control . "
She suggests a date where the man chooses everything -- her clothes , the restaurant , the food -- as a starting point .
• Engage in exciting activities :
Whether it 's trying an extreme sport like skydiving or snowboarding , or exploring new options in the bedroom , activities that get the pulse racing can open the brain 's dopamine centers and increases desire .
• Talk about it : Couples also would benefit from simply communicating with their partners about what they want in bed .
" There is no secret to hot sex , " says Klein .
" Sexy lingerie and dinners out are no substitute for an honest conversation about sex . "

There 's no question that mobile mapping software on a phone can be a very cool thing , but if you do n't have a GPS - enabled phone , it can also be incredibly tedious : to plot a route or figure out what 's nearby , you have to laboriously determine and enter your own location , and then ( potentially ) the address of your destination as well .
To ease your frustration , Google has added a new beta My Location feature to its Google Maps for Mobile service : even if you do n't have a GPS - enabled phone , pressing " 0 " will plot a blue dot on the map to show your current location .
If you have a GPS phone , the blue dot is a precise little point .
Without a GPS phone , the blue point is surrounded by a light blue area , indicating some uncertainty about where you are .
The larger location area results from Google using information broadcast from mobile towers to get an approximate idea of where you are .
Google says the algorithm , on average , can pinpoint your phone within about 1,000 meters ( a little over half a mile ) .
Google built the service independently of mobile phone carriers by anonymously analyzing mobile signals received by Google Maps users and constructing its own database of cell towers .
Using that information , Google can compare the mobile signal readings on a particular mobile phone and make a reasonable guess where that phone must be located .
The feature is available on most Web - enabled phones , including Java - enabled phones , BlackBerry devices , Windows Mobile phones , and Nokia / Symbian devices .
Google is offering the service free of charge ; eventually , the company hopes to tie it in with local advertising and other location - aware services .
Getting Things Done is “ The Book ” on managing your projects while keeping your blood pressure down .
Like many technologists , I find it ideal because it provides a framework for handling the “ loops , ” the obligations you have to others and others have to you .
It is especially relevant for my life within an office because it emphasizes organizing tasks by context .
It ’s part of the system to work on office tasks when at the office , phone tasks when you have set aside time for calling , and errands when you 're on the road .
This fits perfectly with people who need to block aside time for actual programming and still do a myriad of other little tasks in collaboration with others .
Someone asked how I seem to get so much done .
I had to answer honestly :
The unfortunate truth about my personality and my day is that I lurch back and forth between being intensely focused and very distractible .
There is some daily rhythm to these swings in attention capacity , some random X factor , and the undeniable fact that if I am “ in the zone ” and you interrupt me enough , I lose focus and I ca n’t get back into it .
When I am working from home ( either for clients or on my own projects ) , the key to productivity is not letting those focus hours slip through my fingers .
When I ’m “ on , ” that ’s the time to put TextMate front and centre .
When I ’m “ off , ” I try not to force it too much , there are plenty of things to do that can be done in short dribs and drabs .
My current day job involves working in an office where the prevailing culture is “ interrupt - driven , ” to the point where it is mandatory ( yes , a company rule ) to have IM on so that people can interrupt your coding without even bothering to invest the five minutes to walk over to your desk .
Needless to say , the day job environment does not feature offices for programmers .
Nor do people respect the fact that there is code on your screen and headphones over your ears as signs you may be performing a billable activity .
This would be a complete block to productivity , except for the fact that our clientele impose so much bureaucracy on getting anything done that my ratio of virtual paperwork to code approaches one .
So :
When I have some serious code to write , I do it at home before I go to the office , or after five when everyone leaves ( you can tell a lot about the company culture by observing the stampede for the exits every afternoon ) .
I can debug , embellish , and tinker during the day , but I can’t actually concentrate enough to write anything serious , so I no longer bother trying .
That ’s when I usually lurk on reddit , talk to colleagues , talk to clients , and answer emails .
It ’s a good time for lightweight research , like figuring out how to get JRuby working so it can be called as a scripting language from a Java application I use Actiontastic to manage my GTD system on my Apple MacBook Pro .
That way , although I ’m not getting hard coding done , I am advancing my projects and my clients love my high - bandwidth , real - time communication .
Now , from time to time there is a crunch of some kind where I absolutely must get something done and for whatever reason I ca n’t just leave .
I usually hide in the board room and crank .
I have to slap myself if the mouse hovers over the Firefox icon .
In extreme cases , I turn Internet Access off entirely .
I also get some night hacking time , and if I ’m not too exhausted , that ’s a good time for coding .
I like to save several evenings each week for family time : from dinner with my family to putting my son to bed is a time slot where work , blogs , and even start ups do not intrude .
I 'm back from the Beyond Belief II conference at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , which packed an extraordinary amount of intellectual stimulation into a few short days .
Any conference where you wander into the opening reception , get drawn into a conversation about reductionism and meaning with Stuart Kauffman , Rebecca Goldstein , and Sir Harold Kroto , and end up closing down the bar , is bound to be a good one , and this did not disappoint .
( The title notwithstanding , much of the conference had little to do with atheism or religion -- the subtitle " Enlightenment 2.0 " gave a better flavor . )
The talks provided fodder for at least ten to twenty blog posts , of which I 'll probably get around to writing one or two .
One of the talks was by local neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran , or " Rama " to his friends .
( Like any good neuro person , his web page includes a fun collection of optical illusions . )
He talked about his experiments with synesthesia , the phenomenon in which people see graphemes ( e.g. numbers or letters ) as associated with colors .
I do that a little bit -- five is certainly yellow , seven is red , and eight is blue -- but it 's closer to a vague association than a vivid experience .
Some people report very strong synesthetic reactions , and for a long time researchers have wondered whether the experience was mostly metaphorical or something stronger .
To test synesthesia , Rama and collaborators designed an experiment where they could measure the vividness of the colors associated with the numbers 2 and 5 .
They chose those because you can make them look almost identical , although reversed , by choosing a boxy font .
Then they made up a picture ( on left ) of mostly fives , with a few twos scattered within there .
Then they asked people to pick out the twos .
Most ordinary folks could do it within about twenty seconds or so .
But true synesthetes could do it immediately .
That 's because to them , the twos popped out as a brightly colored triangle ( right ) .
This established beyond much doubt that synesthesia was " real , " and more particularly that was a measurable phenomenon with real consequences .
This , in turn , strengthened the hypothesis that the origin of synesthesia was to be found in the structure of the brain .
Indeed , it turns out that the region of the brain responsible for processing graphemes lies adjacent to the region responsible for processing colors .
It 's fairly easy to imagine that small alterations in " normal " brain wiring -- strengthening some pathways , inhibiting others -- could be responsible for synesthesia .
To test this idea further , Rama had synesthetes look at alternative representations of the numbers -- using Roman numerals , for example -- and found that the colors did not appear .
That 's perfectly consistent , as the relevant bits of brain are responsible for processing the graphical representation of the number 5 , not the abstract mathematical concept of " five . "
Further studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging have found that the brains of synesthetes and non-synesthetes really do light up in different ways when they look at numbers .
( There are other ways to be synesthetic -- associating colors with sounds or smells , for example -- which may also be traced to connections between different parts of the brain . )
But then here 's my favorite part .
They found a synesthete who was color blind .
That may seem strange , but what it really means is that the subject had problems with his retina that left him able to distinguish only an extremely narrow range of wavelengths when looking at most images in the world -- his brain was fine , but his eyes were n't quite up to the job .
But when he saw certain numbers , he experienced colors that he otherwise never saw .
Here is Ramachandran in Scientific American :
We also observed one case in which we believe cross activation enables a colorblind synesthete to see numbers tinged with hues he otherwise cannot perceive ; charmingly , he refers to these as " Martian colors . "
Although his retinal color receptors cannot process certain wavelengths , we suggest that his brain color area is working just fine and being cross-activated when he sees numbers ...
The effect is most obvious and pronounced in the colorblind synesthetes , but occurs in " regular " synesthetes as well .
The colors evoked by cross activation in the fusiform gyrus " bypass " earlier stages of color processing in the brain , which may confer an unusual tint to the colors evoked .
This is important for understanding the phenomenon of synesthesia , because it suggests that the qualia label -- that is , the subjective experience of the color sensation -- depends not merely on the final stages of processing but on the total pattern of neural activity , including earlier stages .
Martian colors !
How awesome is that ?

Not every proprietary program can drive a person crazy , right ?
Some , like Adobe Photoshop , are superb tools for anyone to use .
But , the fact that these tools are proprietary can drive open source fanatics up a wall .
It ’s not the price of the software that makes the real difference ( although that ’s one reason to migrate from one software to another for many people ) ; it ’s the idea that proprietary software comes with boundaries that keeps the user experience confined to …well , being the user .
That ’s enough to drive any developer crazy .
The following fifty sixty proprietary programs are listed in no particular order within broad categories along with their open source alternatives .
In some cases you could probably write your own book on frustrations with the proprietary programs shown here .
In other cases , you ’ll discover that the open source alternative is n’t quite up to snuff yet .
And , in other cases still , you ’ll learn that some proprietary programs are real gems , but that the open source advocate can replace those gems with equally shiny objects from the open source repertoire .
Operating Systems & Web Browsers
Windows 10 to Ubuntu :
This is Microsoft ’s operating system ( OS ) , and even Microsoft fans have become disillusioned with this product .
Open source OS alternatives are numerous ; but these OS often are difficult for the average user to install , learn , and operate .
Why deal with it when Ubuntu has become so easy to use that even the most computer illiterate can jump into this operating system with very little time spent on a learning curve ?
In fact , users can purchase a Dell computer with Ubuntu already installed .
Remember however , that when it comes to using open source software that the open source community often focuses on applications that can be used through Windows , Mac , Linux , or Unix , with the majority seemingly devoted to Windows .
( By the way , WHDb segments our provider database into separate lists of Windows web hosts , Linux web hosts , and Unix web hosts , so check out each provider list if you ’re considering the pro’s and con ’s of each OS from a hosting standpoint . )
Internet Explorer to Firefox : Sure , both programs are free ; but that ’s true of IE only because it comes pre-packaged with Microsoft ’s Windows operating systems .
Free is far different from open source software , where users have more control over how that software works .
While you might feel more comfortable with a proprietary operating system , you can still use an open source browser like Mozilla ’s Firefox , an exceptional product that expands its use with ‘ add - ons ‘ created by avid users .
Office Suites
Microsoft Office to OpenOffice :
If the price makes you feel that Microsoft has worked you over , then switch !
If you compare Microsoft ’s Office with other products , then you ’re looking for something that includes an email client , a word processor , a spreadsheet tool , and a multimedia presentation application .
The only product that provides a competitive edge against Microsoft is Google Drive , which when combined with Gmail , includes all the tools that Microsoft Office offers .
But , some would argue that Google is n’t truly open source .
So , the next best bet alternative would be OpenOffice , an open source project that includes everything you ’d find in Microsoft Office except the email client .
Microsoft Office for Mac to NeoOffice : Another Microsoft office suite , but this time meant for Macintosh computers .
Try NeoOffice instead , a full - featured set of office applications , including word processing , spreadsheet , presentation , drawing , and database programs for Mac OS X .
This suite is based on the OpenOffice.org office suite , but it has integrated dozens of native Mac features and can import , edit , and exchange files with other popular office programs such as Microsoft Office for Mac .
MathWorks MATLAB to Scilab : MATLAB is a highly used application for numerical computing .
It provides a programming language that allows users to work with numbers in any possible way imaginable through visualization .
Scilab is the open source alternative to MATLAB , and it provides visualization of numerical data just as MATLAB does .
Scilab is partly compatible with MATLAB , and both tools are suited for Windows , Linux , and UNIX .
Microsoft Access to Kexi : Microsoft
Access is a versatile tool for creating database - driven applications and to maintain office or personal data .
Access contains an embedded database engine , but it also connects to other databases through ODBC .
On the other hand , Kexi allows users to design forms to gain access to and to create data , just like Access .
Kexi also contains an embedded database engine and it can import data to Microsoft Access databases .
Plus , Kexi is open source , whereas Access belongs to Microsoft .
Microsoft Word to OpenOffice Writer :
If you want to break that office suite down and begin to replace the suite item by item , then you can start with this product first .
Writer is the word processor component of the OpenOffice.org software package that is similar to Microsoft Word , and with a roughly equivalent range of features .
Writer can be used across a variety of platforms , including Mac OS X , Microsoft Windows , Linux , FreeBSD and Solaris .
Writer also includes the ability to export Portable Document Format ( PDF ) files with no additional software , and can also function as a WYSIWYG editor for creating and editing web pages .
One plus over Word is that Writer carries functions and number formats in its tables from Calc , OpenOffice ’s spreadsheet application .
Microsoft Excel to OpenOffice Calc : Another Microsoft product , Excel still carries its productivity pluses as a spreadsheet , but it no longer carries an air of absolute necessity .
Google ’s Docs can bring an online , sharing atmosphere to your spreadsheets now .
As for a truly open source product that can replace Excel , try OpenOffice.org Calc .
This tool provides full spreadsheet functionality incl .
a huge number of statistical and scientific functions , pivot tables and charts .
Microsoft Visio to Dia : Visio actually is a great application that allows users to go from complicated text and tables that are hard to understand to diagrams that communicate information at a glance .
The only thing that spoils the context is the fact that this software is that it ’s not open source .
Instead , use Dia , a GTK + based diagram creation program for Linux , Unix and Windows released under the GPL license .
Dia was ‘ roughly ’ inspired by Visio , which should make this tool easy for transition .
Productivity
Blackboard to Moodle : Blackboard has been the CMS ( Course Management System ) ‘ industry standard ’ for educational purposes for many years .
This program allows instructors to build courses , manage student workloads , and more .
But Moodle has gained significant ground as an open source alternative to Blackboard , as it helps educators to create effective online learning communities in a scalable package that costs nothing to use .
Dropbox to Cabos :
If you ’re into file sharing , you ’ve probably heard of Dropbox , if not used them .
Not only can you share files , Dropbox allows you to store your files securely online , allowing you to access them from any computer , phone or mobile device .
Cabos , another file sharing program that ’s open source , provides simple sidebar user interface , firewall to firewall transfers , proxy transfers , Universal Plug and Play , iTunes +
iPod integration , “ What ’s New ? ” searches , international searches , and more .
All you need is Windows 2000 or later .
Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later .
Mac OS 8.6 or later .
Granted , you do n’t have the file storage capacity , but at least you can share files with Cabos without that extra storage capacity .
Microsoft Project to Open Workbench : Microsoft allows users to control project work , schedule , and finances , and effectively communicate project data to other users .
But , it costs to do that with Microsoft .
Instead , use open source Open Workbench to accomplish exactly the same project details for free .
When users need to move beyond desktop scheduling to a workgroup , division or enterprise - wide solution , they can upgrade to CA ’s PPM system ( formerly known as CA Clarity PPM ) , a project and portfolio management system that offers bidirectional integration with Open Workbench .
Mindjet to FreeMind : Mindmapping is a way to share ideas among individuals and groups for productivity .
This type of activity takes time , but it saves time .
So why should you pay for a product when you can save money by using FreeMind ?
This latter product will accomplish all the Mindjet does and more .
That “ more ” is the fact that FreeMind is open source .
Graphic Programs
Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape : Adobe ’s vector drawing system is one of the best in the industry .
However , like Photoshop , the price can be prohibitive for some designers and artists .
Try Inkscape instead , an open source vector graphics editor similar to Illustrator , CorelDraw , or Xara X. Inkscape uses the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) file format and it supports many advanced SVG features ( markers , clones , alpha blending , etc. ) .
Finally , the streamlined interface is easy to use to edit nodes , perform complex path operations , trace bitmaps and much more .
Adobe Photoshop to GIMP : Even if you ’re paying for upgrades instead of the original package , the price for Adobe ’s Photoshop can be prohibitive for some photographers and graphic designers .
Try GIMP to see if this open source tool can’t provide you with all the power you need for your photography and graphic design needs .
GIMP stands for Gnu Image Manipulation Program , and it ’s the solution that comes closest to emulating the Photoshop environment .
Adobe Premiere to Avidemux : Premier is state of the art real - time non-linear video editing for any format including High Definition ( HD ) .
Supports 16 - bit color resolution , GPU accelerated rendering for faster effects and even advanced DVD authoring .
On the other hand , Avidemux provides Windows , Mac , and Linux users with an easy - to - use open source tool for DVD / DivX converting and editing .
Avidemux also has scripting support for automation and even offers DVD authoring with the addition of the open source software , dvdauthor .
AutoCAD to Archimedes : AutoCAD is an AutoDesk tool used by any designer who creates design drafts — mostly architects .
Archimedes is an open source computer aided design ( CAD ) alternative that focuses primarily on architectural design .
AutoCAD definitely has the winning score thus far , but Archimedes shows promise .
The latter program contains all the drawing features a designer would need , but its interoperability is weak .
Designers still can export scalable vector graphics , so there ’s a real market for this open source tool .
Microsoft PowerPoint to OpenOffice Impress :
You can make a move away from this Microsoft tool with the use of Google ’s Presentation or with OpenOffice ’s Impress .
Both tools represent full - featured presentation applications that allow users to create and modify diagrams and pictures right within the application .
Microsoft Paint to Tux Paint :
While not a serious graphics program , it is widely used by many computer users , mostly children Try Tux Paint instead of Paint , as this open source product stands apart from typical graphics people edit software ( such as GIMP or Photoshop ) in that it was designed to be usable by children as young as 16 months of age .
The user interface is meant to be intuitive , and utilizes icons , audible feedback and textual hints to help explain how the software works .
Caligari TrueSpace ( now discontinued ) to Blender : Caligari used to offer a range of products that enable designers and artists to produce 3D images — at a hefty price .
Blender , on the other hand , provides one tool that provides full multiresolution sculpting capabilities with 2D bitmap / 3D procedural brushes ( Paint , Smooth , Pinch , Inflate , Grab ) supporting symmetry .
And , that ’s just the beginning of Blender ’s capabilities .
This open source software is free to download and use .
Web Editors
Adobe GoLive CS2 to Mozilla SeaMonkey : GoLive is an integral part of the Adobe Creative Suites products , so it works with your InDesign documents and allows those documents to be converted to Web pages .
But , you might want to try Mozilla ’s SeaMonkey before you commit to the total Adobe suite option .
The Mozilla SeaMonkey project includes a Web - browser , email and newsgroup client , HTML authoring program and IRC chat client .
The Composer is simple but it handles tables , CSS , positioned layers and more without sweat .
Add - ons currently include Scribefire , the blog blog editor that integrates with your browser and lets you easily post to your blog .
Adobe Dreamweaver to NVU :
While this tool is a powerful WYSIWYG ( What You See Is What You Get ) HTML editor , other options exist that can save money .
NVU ( pronounced N- view , for a “ new view ” ) is a complete Web Authoring System for Linux Desktop users as well as Microsoft Windows users to rival programs like FrontPage and Dreamweaver .
Use NVU to create Web pages and manage a Website with no technical expertise or knowledge of HTML .
Macromedia Flash Professional to Synfig Studio : Developers use Flash to create multimedia events on the Web .
Since the program utilizes vector - based graphics , it provides a venue that goes beyond the Web .
Synfig Studio provides developers with a platform to create 2D animations , and to sync your animation with a soundtrack using Sound Layer ( Linux users can edit audio through the JACK integration ) .
Synfig features HDRI , spatial resolution independence , and temporal resolution independence .
This open source animation software is designed with artists in mind , and can be used on tablets as well .
The draw tool on Synfig is able to read the pressure sensitivity channel on your tablet resulting in natural line weighting .
This , and several other features , is what will allow your animation to look and run smoothly .
Microsoft FrontPage ( now discontinued ) to Bluefish : While not as powerful as Dreamweaver , FrontPage was a widely - used proprietary application for creating Web pages .
Take a gander at this list to understand your many open source options for HTML editors .
Try Bluefish as one option that can save you money and , possibly , time .
Windows Notepad to ConTEXT : Yes , you can get the world ’s most versatile HTML editing tool absolutely FREE when you purchase Windows version 2.0 and above .
But , why would you want to do that when you can work with open source ConTEXT ?
This application is a small , fast and powerful freeware programmers text editor , developed to serve as a secondary tool for software developers .
Altova XMLSpy to XML Copy Editor : XMLSpy is one of the most popular XML editors on the market today .
Its editing features and support for both schema and DTD development along with XSLT , XQuery and XPath development make it an ultimate XML tool .
As an open source alternative , XML Copy Editor is a versatile XML editor primarily focused on text editing with XML files .
However , XML Copy Editor provides many other features including validation of DTD and XML schemas — as well as XSLT and XPath with tag - free editing .
Both tools are Windows applications .
Desktop Publishing
Adobe Acrobat to PDFCreator :
Yes , you have a free trial to create a PDF through Adobe .
However , this PDFCreator easily creates PDFs from any Windows program .
Use it like a printer in Word , StarCalc or any other Windows application .
Adobe Framemaker to DocBook : Adobe Framemaker software represents a powerful authoring and publishing solution for technical communicators who want to author and publish technical documentation in multiple languages .
While this software is reliable , so is DocBook , an open source publishing tool .
Additionally , you have access to all the free wikis and documentation that shows how to install , use , and customize the tools and stylesheets .
Microsoft Publisher to Scribus :
When it comes to Desktop Publishing ( DTP ) Microsoft ’s Publisher provides more control over document elements than Microsoft Word through a DTP - oriented approach .
However , professional users still consider this program an entry - level application .
Since it ’s part of the Microsoft Office Package , many users will find its costs negligible as well .
With that said , Scribus offers an open source DTP alternative .
Scribus brings award - winning professional page layout to Linux / Unix , MacOS X , OS / 2 and Windows desktops with a combination of “ press - ready ” output and new approaches to page layout .
Scribus supports professional publishing features , such as CMYK color , separations , ICC color management and versatile PDF creation .
Communications
Google Talk to Pidgin : Google
Talk is great and seemlessly integrates with Gmail , but if you ’re looking for an open source alternative , look no further tha Pidgin .
Pidgin is a multi-protocol Instant Messaging client that allows you to use all of your IM accounts at once .
Let ’s break that down :
No matter if you use Windows , Linux , BSD , and other Unixes .
You can talk to your friends using Google Talk in addition to AIM , ICQ , Jabber / XMPP , MSN Messenger , Yahoo ! , Bonjour , Gadu - Gadu , IRC , Novell GroupWise Messenger , QQ , Lotus Sametime , SILC , SIMPLE , MySpaceIM , and Zephyr .
FeedDemon to RSSOwl : FeedDemon for Windows constantly searches through feed search engines with keyword - generated searches as well as generalized searches .
It also allows offline reading as it ‘ prefetches ’ your subscribed feeds .
NewsGator also synchronizes with FeedDemon so you can gain access to news without your computer .
Except for the fact that FeedDemon is n’t open source and is no longer receiving updates , it ’s an ideal , robust reader .
But , for open source fanatics , RSSOwl provides an equally robust alternative RSS and Atom reader that allows you to keep track of all of the news feeds you follow .
It can be used on all major operating systems such as Windows , Linux , and Mac OSX .
RSSOwl has a robust search tool that lets you automate common actions on news items .
RSSOwl lets you customize which notifications you receive , and you can organize your news with labels and into bins .
Windows Messenger to Adium : Microsoft offers Windows Messenger to the masses as freeware on Windows , and it ’s grown from a simple IM application into a trendsetter in a competitive market .
Features include voice and video chatting , gaming , remote support .
On top of that , it allows connection through mobile devices when you are not near a computer .
Adium , the open source Windows alternative to Windows Messenger , aims to mimic its proprietary competitor as much as possible .
Most of its extra features are added through plug-ins .
You can add , at your leisure , POP3 email support and translation , voice clips , Webcam support , Chat logs , Conferencing support and more .
Microsoft Outlook to Thunderbird : Say that you decided to switch to OpenOffice , but you need an email client to replace Microsoft ’s Outlook .
Try Mozilla ’s Thunderbird , an application that carries a similar interface and that is easy to use .
Additionally , you can use Lightning to integrate Mozilla ’s Sunbird calendar application with Thunderbird .
Skype to Linphone : Skype is a very strong freeware internet VoIP ( Voice over IP ) product in the telecommunications industry .
It started with a simple and free PC - to - PC telephony , but today offers full integration with existing telephone systems .
Skype today also offers voicemail , video conversations and sending SMSs .
Its open source alternative , Linphone , can be operated on both mobile ( Windows , Apple , and Android ) and desktop ( Windows , Linux , and Mac OSX ) operating systems .
With Linphone you have access to many of the same features that are available with Skype , including making audio and video calls , and pausing , resuming , and transferring calls .
You are also able to manage multiple calls , access instant messaging , share pictures and other files , and so much more .
Media
iTunes to Songbird :
If you ’re accustomed to the equation where “ Apple + iPod + iTunes ” equals a ton of money , then you might consider a switch to Songbird .
Songbird is an open source player and a platform committed to “ playing the music you want + from the sites you want + on the devices you want . ”
Songbird thereby challenges the conventions of discovery , purchase , consumption and organization of music on the Internet .
Nero Burning Rom to K3b : Nero Burning
Rom is a popular tool to burn CDs , DVDs and Blu-ray discs .
This software includes backup , cd copying , audio features and more , and it ’s easy to use .
But , it ’s not open source like K3 b ( Windows ) .
This latter program creates and burns CDs and DVDs , including ripping with DivX / XviD encoding , DVD copy , ISO burning , Video CD ( VCD ) creation , Audio CD creation for almost any audio file , CD - TEXT support for audio CDs , support for DVD - RW and DVD +RW and much more .
Oh , and did we add that it was easy to use ?
Quicktime to Darwin Streaming Server : Apple ’s QuickTime 7
Pro is good for everything from creating podcasts to transcoding media in more than a dozen formats .
And , the software is n’t that expensive when compared to other products .
But , why not use an open source application that shares the same code base as Quicktime Streaming Server ?
Darwin Streaming
Server is an open source project that ’s perfect for developers who need to stream QuickTime and MPEG - 4 media on platforms such as Windows , Linux , and Solaris .
TiVo Desktop to Galleon TiVo Media Server : Tivo - to- Go users were disappointed to discover that their Tivo software would n’t work with Windows Vista .
Some answers to this problem included spending more time and money on various solutions that might work to restore that software ’s functionality .
One solution included using the open source software , Galleon , instead of trying to “ fix ” Tivo or Windows Vista .
Galleon is a free open source media server for the TiVo DVR which allows you to enjoy many kinds of content and interactive applications right on your TV .
The server runs on your home computer and organizes your media collection so that they can be viewed on your home network .
Galleon also brings Internet content and applications to your TV .
Windows Media Player to Miro :
This application seems ubiquitous … no matter what you try to open , Windows Media Player is in your face , right ?
Well , replace that in - your - face attitude with Miro , an open source program that turns your computer into an internet TV .
Miro has 2,500 unrestricted channels with a huge selection of HD content .
Plus , you have access to any publisher with video RSS feeds , including anyone on YouTube , Revver , Blip , and many , many more .
Utilities
CuteFTP to FileZilla : Sure , CuteFTP is cute , but it ’s not free .
Sure , it ’s reliable , but so are many other File Transfer Protocol applications .
Try FileZilla , a fast FTP and SFTP client for Windows with tons of features — easy to install , easy to use , very reliable , secure , and open source .
iBackup to Amanda :
Who can you trust with your backup files ?
It ’s difficult to decide , as price alone means nothing .
You want safe , reliable servers or tools that can keep your backups available and intact .
iBackup has proven to be worthy of that task , but you might want to look at Amanda as well .
This open source solution protects more than half a million of servers and desktops running various versions of Linux , UNIX , BSD , Mac OS -X and Microsoft Windows operating systems worldwide .
Not only do they backup information , they ’re into recovery as well .
Norton Ghost to Partimage : Norton
Ghost is n’t a shabby backup system , as it ’s a complete tool that backs up everything but the kitchen sink .
If you have a complete disk failure , Norton Ghost can bring it back to life on a new hard disk ( although you do n’t need to make a complete backup every time ) .
You can take this backup to external drives , CDs or DVDs .
If you ’re an open source advocate , however , Norton Ghost does n’t cut the cake .
You ’ll want something like Partimage ( for Linux ) or Ghost for Unix ( G4U ) for Windows or Unix users .
Both tools are disk cloners that act differently , but they ’re as robust as Norton Ghost .
Read more at their respective Web sites before you make the jump .
( For a complete rescue disk including Partimage see SystemRescueCd ) .
Rational Purify to Valgrind : IBM ’s Purify is a well respected and much used debugging tool .
It uses topnotch memory corruption and memory leak detection to keep hard - to - find bugs from any application .
As an open source alternative , Valgrind also detects leaks and other memory related programming errors .
But , it also detects threading bugs and includes a call - graph profiler that detects bottlenecks in code .
as well as threading bugs .
A user might say that Valgrind is better than Purify , even if it is open source .
WinZip to 7 - Zip : Some of us grew up with WinZip , so it ’s sad to say goodbye .
But , we all gotta leave home at some point , and when the open source 7 - Zip beckons , maybe you should heed the call .
Security
Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal to Winpooch Watchdog : Kaspersky Anti-Virus probably is among the top products on the market for Windows - based anti-virus tools , mainly because it ’s well known for its outstanding detection rates .
It commits to multiple tasks as it protects against viruses , script viruses , checks file archives ( such as zip files ) and removes viruses from mail .
It also provides protection against spyware as well as adware .
As an open source alternative , however , Winpooch also scans files on your computer , detects malware , and prevents all the viruses , trojan horses and other problems that Kaspersky hunts down as well .
Winpooch , by the way , adds a real - time scanning capability that ClamWin ( noted below ) lacks .
McAfee VirusScan to ClamWin : McAfee is well known as one of the oldest companies in the anti-virus market .
Many individuals need to deal with this software company , as its tools come packaged with many new Windows OS computer systems .
The plus side to McAfee is that it is reliable and that it offers 24/7 support .
The downside is that it ’s not open source .
ClamWin , on the other hand , is a free Antivirus for Microsoft Windows 98/Me/2000/XP/2003 .
It features high detection rates , scheduler , automatic download of virus database updates and a plug - in for Microsoft Outlook .
As noted above , ClamWin does n’t provide on access realtime scanning , but when combined with WinPooch , this capability is added .
Norton 360 to WIPFW : Many people could work with Norton in their sleep , as this company has been around that long .
Norton 360 for Windows will monitor and check all Internet traffic and it will reject any attack or intrusion attempt .
Ubiquitous popups and permissions are part of the game , as it seems that each new Website carries its own set of Norton no -nos .
As an alternative , WIPFW is a firewall for Windows based on IPFW for FreeBSD UNIX .
It provides virtually the same features , functionality , and user interface as Norton Personal Firewall .
The big difference ?
WIPFW is open source .
Financial
Authorize.net to OpenSSL : Granted , Authorize .
Net ’s preferred payment gateway connection , Advanced Integration Menthod ( AIM ) , provides the highest level of customization and security to merchants for submitting transactions online .
But , why pay for a secure SSL when you can get an open source product for free ?
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust , commercial - grade , full - featured , and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL v2/v3 ) and Transport Layer Security ( TLS v1 ) protocols as well as a full - strength general purpose cryptography library .
A worldwide community of volunteers uses the Internet to communicate , plan , and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation manages the project .
Microsoft Money ( Plus ) to TurboCASH : While Microsfot Money Plus is much more than a personal accounting software , TurboCASH can boast that claim plus more .
TurboCASH is open source and free to use .
In fact , you might compare TurboCASH more to QuickBooks than to Microsoft Money .
However , as a personal finance tool , TurboCASH is much more user - friendly to the average home budgeter than Compiere .
QuickBooks to Compiere : Few people are unfamiliar with QuickBooks , as this software has made its way into many a small business computer .
If you feel that few opportunities exist to switch , think again .
Compiere , produced by Global Era , provides one solution to open source ERP ( Enterprise Resource Planning ) and CRM ( Customer Relationship Management ) solutions for any small to large business .
Compiere 3.0 marks the introduction of Compiere Professional Edition , a new premium offering targeted at larger organizations that require more advanced services and commercial licensing from Compiere .
Bonus Programs
Blogger to WordPress : Blogger launched in 1999 and was all the rage in the early 2000s for any n00 b who wanted to start his own weblog .
But nowadays only true n00bs still use Blogger .
The more tech - savvy have converted to WordPress , or perhaps were on WordPress all along .
Open source and highly extensible , WordPress provides its users a hosted solution at WordPress.com or the ability to download the open source code at WordPress.org .
Salesforce.com to SugarCRM : While Salesforce.com is one of the most popular customer relationship management ( CRM ) cloud platforms , open source SugarCRM provides a robust alternative .
With mobile access , sales intelligence , and the ability to integrate email , calendar , and file management right out of the box , SugarCRM is an open source alternative that does n’t require compromise .
Quicken to GnuCash : While Intuit ’s Quicken is usually the go - to software product for personal financial management , GnuCash is an open source alternative that mimics Quicken in practically every way .
Except that it ’s free !
Available on all major desktop operating systems , GnuCash announced in 2012 that development of an Android app was underway .
Shopify to Magento : Shopify is an easy way to quickly set up your own ecommerce shop .
But if you ’re keen on doing a little more heavy lifting and do n’t mind digging into some code , Magento is an open source ecommerce solution that is highly extensible and much more powerful than Shopify can ever be , if only requiring that you be more developer than mom-and - pop - shop owner .
GarageBand to Audacity : Apple ’s GarageBand is a powerful audio editing and podcast creating program that is packaged with some versions of OS X and is available on iOS .
Audacity is GarageBand ’s equal in most ways , except that it is open source and is free to download .
And unlike GarageBand , Audacity is available for Windows and Linux in addition to Mac .
Google Chrome to Chromium : Google Chrome has quickly become one of the most popular Web browsers , actually surpassing IE and Firefox according to some counts .
Google Chrome is actually the Google - branded version of the open source Chromium Project , from which Google Chrome draws its source code and then adds an integrated Flash player , built - in PDF viewer , the Google name and Google Chrome logo , and more .
iOS to Android : The Apple iPhone is the most popular phone on the planet , but Google ’s Android OS powers more phones than does iOS , as of 2012 Q3 .
For those who do n’t know , iOS is the operating system that powers all Apple iPhone hardware .
Android is Google ’s open source mobile operating system that first debuted in 2008 and now powers dozens of non-iPhone smartphones .
Kaspersky Password Manager to KeePass :
With the proliferation of online account access for banks , credit cards , email , social media sites , and more , password management has become a headache for most people .
Fortunately , there are options .
Kaspersky Password Manager is one of the most popular proprietary solutions , integrating into Kaspersky ’s suite of anti-virus and desktop firewall software .
The primary open source alternative is KeePass , a free option that securely stores all of your passwords in an encrypted and password - secured database on your hard drive .
QuickBooks to FrontAccounting ERP : While the original list draws a comparison between QuickBooks and Compiere , we wanted to highlight FrontAccounting here as another good open source alternative to the popular small business accounting program .
Windows Media Player to VLC : Previously , we compared Windows Media Player to Miro .
And while Miro is still a great open source alternative , we want to also mention VideoLAN ’s VLC program as another alternative .
VLC is a powerful open source application that can play numerous video and audio formats with no codec packs required and can also do media conversion and streaming .

Rails Is A Ghetto
なんとなく読んだので、要約のつもり（いや、誤訳しそうなところはすっ飛ばしたものをさらに要約してるので、おおはずれかも）。
● Rails Is A Ghetto （Railsは吹き溜まり ）
会社や個人を特定してばんばんやるぜ。こいつら寄ってたかっておれのことをこけにしやがった。文句あるなら、リングの上で待ってるぜ。このくそめらめが。
まずはケビンクラークだ。こいつは、おれをサポート扱いしやがったうえに、間抜けあつかいしやがった。
でも、すべての原因は、このばかが、リポジトリ上のconfigureファイルを消しちまいやがったことにある。これじゃ、チェックアウトしてビルドできるわけないじゃん。それをおれが間抜けなせいだといいやがりやがった。
Rails界隈はこんなくずばかりだ。
● Tied To The Rails （Railsべったら漬け ）
おれは2006年の4から6ヶ月くらいを無一文で過ごしたんだぜ。そのほかといったらほんのちょっぴりだけ。MongrelとRailsのせいだ。
オビーフェルナンデス のおかげでマックで働く必要もなく、うまいことやれてたんだ。
Mongrelの前は、 ニューヨーク市刑務所でいかしたソフトを作ってたんだ。REST XMLを使った監獄管理システムさ。
その前は、指紋認証機。ネットワークプロトコロル、ビジネスプロセスのデザイン、ソフトウェアチームのリーダー、ポータル作り、コンサルタントもね。
なんてこった 。Mongrelの後ときたら、すべてのジョブが消えちゃった。ちんけなスタートアップばかりがおれに近づいてくる。くだらねぇSNSを作りたいとか言いながらだぜ。
● The Stories I Could （and will ）Tell（おれが話せる（つもりの）物語）
ある会社ときたら、1週間につき2時間のメンタリングに対して、あらゆる書類を書かせようとしやがった。馬鹿か？
別の会社は、結構良い条件だったんだ。ところが、それはRFPにMongrelで有名なおれの名前を入れたかっただけなんだ。実際に仕事が始まると、あっちからアーキテクトがきて、こっちからコンサルタントが来て、その会社の役立たずがリーダーになって……おい、おれの居場所はどこにあるんだ？
別の会社は単純な修正のためにおれを雇った。5分で片付けたら、それじゃ金はやれないな、ときたもんだ。
NYC の会社は上げたり下げたりした上で、すぐ金が欲しかったのになかなか払わないと言いやがる。おれの仕事はなにかといやぁ、Mongrelのカスタマイズなんだぜ。（要約注：よくわからない。NET-30ってなんだろう？）
そして、たわけ たSNS野郎どもだ。
Googleときたらねぇ。2回ほどオファーがあったんだ。でも、それが初級シスアドなんだぜ。え？
このおれが初級シスアド？ 馬鹿野郎。まともなポストを用意してきやがれ。
● Revenge Of The Zen Prick（禅ちんこの復讐 ）
バンクーバでのことだ。そこにはRailsはなかったわけで、ちょろいRailsの仕事をやったわけだな。ちょろかったぜ。しばらくして、メールが来た。
「お前のコードはかすだ。ブラックリストに乗ってるから、2度とこのあたりの会社は、お前を雇わないぜ。失せろ能無し」
なんのことだ？ おれはほとんどコードを書いてないんだぜ。そり
ゃ Javaのライブラリをリバースエンジニアしたやつとか、ソースがないやつのパッチを作ったりしたぜ。だからといってブラックリストってこた、ねぇだろ？
でも野郎は、これをバンクーバ中に回状を出しちまったってわけだ。おい、八方所払いかい？
そしたらメールがまたきやがった。
「 やぁ、すまん。ブラックリストにのってるのはShaiだった。君はShawだね。気にしないでくれ」
なんだって？ しかも後になって実際にはブラックリストなんて無いとか言いやがったし。
でも、そんな具合でバンクーバはおれの居場所じゃなくなった。（要約注：だと思うがわからん）
● How 'd this Happen ?
（どうしてこうなっちまったんだ？）
てな具合に、馬鹿ばかりだ。
おれは貧乏だから、修士課程が終わりそうなところで中退しなきゃならなかったんだ。でもほとんどMBAなんだぜ。ほぼ完全なソフトウェア開発教育も受けてるし、モデリングも統計学も、社会学だってそうだ。
そのおれさまが、こんなMBAのなりそこねの車のセールスマン
からどう思われているか知ってるか？
ただのコード猿だぜ ！
Railsから手を引いて、Mongrelから距離を置いて、Rubyコミュニティから離れて、さておれは自分のビジネススキルを見直してみた。なんでRailsコミュニティが役立たずで、馬鹿で、傲慢なのかわかったよ。
2007-1-20にDHHとこんなやり取りがあったんだ。
DHH：fastthreadより前は1日あたり400回リスタートしてたんだ。
DHH ：今、10回くらいで済むようになった。
おれ：そりゃ良かった。
おれ：で、相変わらずfastcgiを使ってるのか？（要約注：間違いかも）
おい、よくみてみろよ 。DHHがだぜ、ほかの誰でもないDHHがだぜ、1日400回リスタートだってよ？ fastthreadより前は。GCとスレッドのバグをだぜ、メンタルガイがfastthreadで直すまではだぜ（メンタルガイはすげぇやつだ。まるで忍者だよな）。
わかるかい ？ Railsの開発者本人のプロダクトは、4分に1回リスタートしなきゃ使えない代物だったってことだよ？
もし、DHHの言ったことが本当だとしたら、やつは、おれたち全員をペテンにかけてたってことだ。
実際のところ、DHHがやったこたそんなに悪くはない。野郎はあのくそたれなJavaをぶちのめしたわけだし。これでクラっときたんだよな。ああ、おいらは馬鹿だったよ。
GC、スレッド、それにIOが怪しいっておれが言ってるのに、デイブトーマスだのマイケルコジアルスキやらチャドファウラーだのは全員、それを否定したんだ。あのひでぇcgi.rbのバグを覚えてるかい？ おれがMongrelの修正版をリリースしようとしたら、デイブとマイケルは、3ヶ月待ってくれとか抜かしやがったんだ。やつらのせいで危険な状態が3ヶ月続いたってわけだよ。
つまり、最初から嘘ばかりだったんだ。
● The The Idiots Came（そして、バカがまとめてやって来る ）
Rails肥溜め理論をうまく要約するとだな、マイケルコジアルスキを観察すればよい。あの醜いデブ野郎のことだ。オンラインでは大口叩きやがるが、面をつきあわせりゃただの糞だ。
まあ、誰もあいつのこた知らないだろうよ。
ちゃんと調べる前は、おれにとってはRailsは金がなるプラットフォームに見えたんだ。だから気にしたしMongrelも提供してやった。でももう知ったこっちゃない。おれが手をひけば、マイケルは肥溜めの中に沈むのさ。ざまぁみろ。
もっといかしたフレームワークが出てきてるぜ。Merbとかさ。Mongrel Plus Erbだけど 、Erubis使ってるんだぜ。Railsのコアがスレッドがどうしたとか叫んでるのを尻目にうまいことやってるんだ。
Rails野郎たちが、もうちょっとおいらに敬意を表してくれて、言葉に耳を傾けてくれてれば、助けてやったんだけどな。でもやつらはそうしなかったんだ。
ん？ おれが間違ってる 、Kozはすげぇコーダーだって ？
おまえらRailsのあのくそを覚えているか？ URI に;が出てくるやつだ。そりゃパスパラメータだぜ。Mongrelはまともなパーザを持ってるからそんなんじゃまともに動かねぇよ。で、誰がこの間違ったことを仕出かしたか知ってるか？
Kozだよ。
Railsには、Kozみたいな連中でいっぱいだ。あいつがどれだけバグを入れたか見てみろよ。日付パーザを見てみたらどうだ？
ヒント：1月が30日じゃないこともあるんだぜ。
バカしかいない町にはな、スマートな人間の居場所はないんだよ。
● The Hysteria Of Consultancy（コンサルト会社のヒステリー）
ThoughtWorksときたら（要約注：めんどうだから略）
え、なんでおれがそんなくずどもと働いたのかって？ そりゃIBMやアクセンチュアなんかよりはましだからだよ。やつらはRailsを次のVBにしようとしてるんだからね。（略）
● From Industry to Corporate（産業から企業へ ）
（略）
で、ThoughtWorks はRailsを次のCOBOLにしようとしてるってわけさ。
● Fighting Consulting Firms（コンサル会社との戦い）
（略）
● More To Come
まだ続くぜ。こんだRubyカンファレンスのあほくささと、どうして ピッケル本がRuby殺しなのかについて書くぜ。
というぐあいに、RubyやRailsに文句をたれてるわけじゃなくて、DHHを含むRails界隈に集まった人々に文句をたれてるわけだな。というか、「おれはコードが好きなんだ」ってのが泣かせるなぁ。
ところで、アメリカではプログラマ（それもMongrelの作者のようなレベルの）の地位が低いということなのかな？
それは、そこらのブログで見かける、日本ではプログラマ（技術者）の地位は低い。それに対してアメリカでは……というような話とはずいぶん違うようだけど。ビジネスロジックプログラマの仕事はインドへ行っちゃったけど、コアテクノロジーのプログラマは……というような話もあるけど、Mongrelの作者にしても（書いてることが本当なら）そんなに仕事はないようだけど、それって学歴のせいなのかな？
だとしたら、これまたそこらで見かけるアメリカでは技術本位でどうしたことうしたってのとはまた異なる様相だな。
というわけで、世の中は必ずしも一枚岩でもなければ、紋切り型でどの国はこうであの国はどう、っていうような議論が成り立たないという例がまた見つかったということなのかも。
追記：上で軽く感想を書いてるけど、誤読に基づいてたみたいなんで、ちょっと困ったもんだが、直しようがないので、そのまま。米国の就職については、shiroさんのツッコミを参照してください。その他、ツッコミ欄でみなさんからの指摘を受けて修正してます（元のはコメントで残してます。日記にSCMは使ってないし、まあコメントで修正履歴を残すってのもありかなぁとか）。
別の追記：なんか読み直しているうちに、本人はきつい軽口程度のノリでバカバカ書いているだけなんじゃないかな（本気では怒ってない）とか、思わないでもない自分に気づく。DHHの400回ってのも軽口っぽいし、Javaをたたきのめしてくれてありがとうみたいなことも書いてるわけだ。ただ、それとKevin（誤解からZedをdick呼ばわり、これってずばりちんぽこ野郎みたいな言葉だよね？）やKoz（ばかなURIの組み方のせいでMongrelがだめ扱いされたのか？）についての怒りは別とか。
追 記(1/16 )：いいやつオビーによる解説も参照のこと。
Logic Programming with Perl and Prolog
Computing languages can be addictive ; developers sometimes blame themselves for perceived inadequacies , making apologies for them .
That is the case , at least , when one defends his or her language of choice against the criticism of another language ’s devotee .
Regardless , many programmers prefer one language , and typically ground that preference in a respect for that language ’s strengths .
Perl has many strengths , but two most often cited are its adaptability and propensity to work as a “ glue ” between applications and / or data .
However , Perl is n’t the only advantageous language : programmers have used C or even assembly to gain speed for years , and intelligent use of SQL allows the keen coder to offload difficult data manipulations onto a database , for example .
Prolog is an often overlooked gem that , when combined with the flexibility of Perl , affords the coder powerful ways to address logical relationships and rules .
In this article , I hope to provide a glimpse of the benefits that embedded Prolog offers to Perl programmers .
Moreover , I hope that my example implementation demonstrates the ease with which one can address complex logical relationships .
A Bit About Prolog
For the sake of demonstration , I would like to frame a simple problem and solution that illustrate the individual strengths of Perl and Prolog , respectively .
However , while I anticipate that the average reader will be familiar with the former , he or she may not be as familiar with the latter .
Prolog is a logic programming language often used in AI work , based upon predicate calculus and first developed in 1972 .
There are several excellent , free versions of Prolog available today , including GNU Prolog and the popular SWI Prolog .
For the Prolog initiate , I recommend checking out some of the free Prolog tutorials , either those linked from Wikipedia or from OOPWeb .
Prolog and Perl are n’t exactly strangers , however .
There are several excellent Perl modules available to allow the coder to access the power of Prolog quite easily , including the SWI module developed by Robert Barta , the Interpreter module by Lee Goddard , the Yaswi modules developed by Salvador Fandino Garcia , and the AI : : Prolog module written by Curtis “ Ovid ” Poe .
Poe has also recently provided a rather nice introduction to Prolog - in - Perl in an online - accessible format .
The Problem
There are many advantages to using Prolog within Perl .
In the general sense , each language has its own advantages , and can thus complement the other .
Suppose that I am building a testing harness or a logic - based query engine for a web application , where neither language easily provides all of the features I need .
In cases such as these , I could use Prolog to provide the logic “ muscle , ” and Perl to “ glue ” things together with its flexibility and varied , readily available modules on CPAN .
In my simple demonstration , I am going to posit the requirement that I take genealogical information built by another application and test relationships based upon a set of rules .
In this case , the rules are defined in a Prolog file ( an interesting intersection here is that both Perl and Prolog typically use the suffix .pl ) , while the genealogical information is contained in a Dot file readable by Graphviz .
As such , I am going to make certain assumptions about the format of the data .
Next , I am going to assume that I will have a query ( web - based , or from yet another application ) that will allow users to identify relationships ( such as brothers , cousins , etc. ) .
Here are my Prolog rules :
is_father ( Person ) :- is_parent( Person , _ ) , is_male ( Person ) . is_father ( Person , Child ) :- is_parent ( Person , Child ) , is_male ( Person ) . is_mother ( Person ) :- is_parent( Person , _ ) , is_female ( Person ) .
is_mother ( Person , Child ) :- is_parent ( Person , Child ) , is_female ( Person ) .
ancestor ( Ancestor , Person ) :- is_parent ( Ancestor , Person ) . ancestor ( Ancestor , Person ) :- is_parent ( Ancestor , Child ) , ancestor ( Child , Person ) .
is_sibling ( Person , Sibling ) :- is_parent ( X , Person ) , is_parent ( X , Sibling ) .
is_cousin( Person , Cousin ) :- is_parent ( X , Person ) , is_parent ( Y , Cousin ) , is_sibling ( X , Y ) .
One advantage to separating my logic is that I can troubleshoot it before I even write the Perl code , loading the rules into a Prolog interpreter or IDE such as XGP ( for Macintosh users ) and testing them .
However , AI :: Prolog conveniently provides its own solution : by typing aiprolog at the command line , I can access a Prolog shell , load in my file , and run some tests .
At this point , however , I am mostly interested in accessing these rules from Perl .
While there are several options for accessing Prolog from within Perl , the AI : : Prolog module is perhaps the easiest with which to start .
Moreover , it is quite simple to use , the rules used to build the Prolog database being fed in when creating the AI :: Prolog object .
The ability to hand the object constructor a filehandle is not currently supported , but would indeed be a nice improvement .
While there are other ways to accomplish the task of reading in the data , such as calling the Prolog command consult , I will read in the Prolog file ( ancestry.pl ) and provide a string representation of the contents .
open ( PROLOGFILE , ' ancestry.pl ' ) or die " $ !
" ; local $ / ; my $ prologRules = < PROLOGFILE > ; close ( PROLOGFILE ) ; my $ prologDB = AI :: Prolog -> new ( $ prologRules ) ;
Now that I have loaded my Prolog database , I need to feed it some more information .
I need to take my data , in Dot format , and translate it into something that my Prolog interpreter will understand .
There are some modules out there that may be helpful , such as DFA : : Simple , but since I can assume that my data will look a certain way –having written it from my other application –I will build my own simple parser .
First , I am going to take a look at the data .
The visualization program created the diagram in Figure 1 from the code :
digraph family_tree { { jill [ color = pink ] rob [ color = blue ] } -> { ann [ color = pink ] joe [ color = blue ] } ; { sue [ color = pink ] dan [ color = blue ] } -> { sara [ color = pink ] mike [ color = blue ] } ; { nan [ color = pink ] tom [ color = blue ] } -> sue ; { nan jim [ color = blue ] } -> rob ; { kate [ color = pink ] steve [ color = blue ] } -> dan ; { lucy [ color = pink ] chris [ color = blue ] } -> jill ; }
Figure 1 .
A family tree from the sample data
There are a few peculiarities worth mentioning here .
First , it may seem that the all - lower - case names are a bit strange , but I am already preparing for the convention that data in Prolog is typically lower - case .
Also , I inserted an extra space before the semicolons in an effort to make matching them easier .
While both of these conventions are easy to code around , they seems to create extra questions when illustrating a point .
Therefore , assume that the above Dot snippet illustrates the range of possible formats in the example .
While the “ real - world examples ” may provide a richer set of possibilities , the fact that applications with defined behavior generated this data will limit the edge cases .
Returning to the data , it will be easiest to parse the Dot data using a simple state machine .
Previously , I had defined some constants to represent states :
use constant { modInit => 0 , modTag => 1 , modValue => 2 } ;
Basically , I assume that anything on the left - hand side of the = is a parent and anything on the right is a child .
Additionally , modifiers ( in this case only color ) begin with a left square - bracket and males have the blue modifier , whereas females are pink .
I know that I have completed a parent - child relationship “ block ” when I hit the semicolon .
Past these stipulations , if it is n’t a character I know that I can safely ignore , then it must be a noun .
sub parse_dotFile {
##----------------------------------------
##
Examine data a word at a time ##---------------------------------------- my @dotData = split ( /\s+/ , shift ( ) ) ; my ( $ family Block , $ personName , @prolog Qry ) = ( ) ; my $ personModPosition = modInit ; my $ relationship = ' parent ' ; for ( my $idx = 3 ; $idx < @dotData ; $ idx ++ ) { chomp ( $ dotData [ $idx ] ) ; SWITCH : { ## ignore if ( $ dotData [ $idx ] =~ /[ {}=\ ] ] / ) { last SWITCH ; } ## begin adding attributes if ( $ dotData [ $idx ] eq ' [ ' ) { $ personModPosition = modTag ; last SWITCH ; } ## switch from parents to children if ( $ dotData [ $idx ] eq '->' ) { $ relationship = ' child ' ; last SWITCH ; } ## end of this block if ( $ dotData [ $idx ] =~ /\;/ ) { ##-----------------------------------------
##
Generate is_parent rules for Prolog ##-----------------------------------------
foreach my $ parentInBlock ( @{ $ family Block - > { parent } } ) { foreach my $ childInBlock ( @{ $ family Block - > { child } } ) { push ( @prologQry , " is_parent ( ${parentInBlock} , $ {childInBlock} ) " ) ; } } $ family Block = ( ) ; $ relationship = ' parent ' ; last SWITCH ; } ## I have a noun , need to set something else { ##
I have a modifier tag , next is the value if ( $ personModPosition == modTag ) { $ personModPosition = modValue ; last SWITCH ; } elsif ( $ personModPosition == modValue ) {
##--------------------------------------
##
Set modifier value and reset ##
We currently assume it is color ##-------------------------------------- if ( $ dotData [ $idx ] eq ' blue ' ) { push ( @prologQry , " is_male ( ${personName} ) " ) ; } else { push ( @prologQry , " is_female ( ${personName} ) " ) ; } $ personModPosition = modInit ; $ personName = ( ) ; last SWITCH ; } else {
##--------------------------------------
##
Grab the name and id as parent or child ##--------------------------------------
$ personName = $ dotData [ $ idx ] ; push ( @{ $ family Block ->{ $ relationship } } , $ personName ) ; } } } } return ( \@prologQry ) ; }
Rather than simply pushing my new rules into the Prolog interpreter directly , I return an array that contains the full ruleset .
I am doing this so that I can easily dump it to a file for troubleshooting purposes .
I can simply write the rules to a file , and consult this file in a Prolog shell .
With a subroutine to parse my Dot file into Prolog rules , I can now push those rules into the interpreter :
##-------------------------------------------
## Read in
Dot file containing relations ## and feed it into the Prolog instance ##------------------------------------------- open( DOTFILE , ' family_tree.dot ' ) or die " $ !
" ; my $ parsedDigraph = parse_dotFile ( < DOTFILE > ) ; close ( DOTFILE ) ; foreach ( @$parsedDigraph ) { $ prologDB - > do ( " assert ( $ _ ) . " ) ; }
Now I can easily query my Prolog database using the query method in AI :: Prolog :
##-------------------------------------------
##
Run the query ##------------------------------------------- $ prologDB->query ( " is_cousin ( joe , sara ) . " ) ; while ( my $ results = $ prologDB -> results ) { print " @$results
" ; }
What Next ?
Even though this is a trivial example , I think that it provides an idea of the powerful ways in which Perl can be supplemented with Prolog .
Just within the context of evaluating genealogical data ( a mainstay of Prolog tutorials and examples ) , it seems that a Perl / Prolog application that uses genealogical data from open source genealogical software or websites would be a killer application .
The possibilities seem endless : rules based upon Google maps , mining information from online auctions or news services , or even harvesting information for that new test harness are all tremendous opportunities for the marriage of Perl and Prolog .
As I raced into our TV studio for our Super Tuesday morning - after show , I was excited .
Across the country , initial reports indicated there was unprecedented voter participation , at least in the Democratic primaries , several times higher than in previous elections .
For years I have covered countries like Haiti , where people risk death to vote , while the U.S. has one of the lowest participation rates in the industrialized world .
Could it be this year would be different ?
Then I bumped into a friend and asked if he had voted .
“ I ca n’t vote , ” he said , “ because I did time in prison . ”
I asked him if he would have voted .
“ Sure I would have .
Because then I ’m not just talking junk , I ’m doing something about it . ”
Felony disenfranchisement is the practice by state governments of barring people convicted of a felony from voting , even after they have served their time .
In Virginia and Kentucky , people convicted of any felony can never vote again ( this would include “ Scooter ” Libby , even though he never went to jail , unless he is pardoned ) .
Eight other states have permanent felony disenfranchisement laws , with some conditions that allow people to rejoin the voter rolls : Alabama , Arizona , Delaware , Florida , Mississippi , Nevada , Tennessee and Wyoming .
Disenfranchisement — people being denied their right to vote — takes many forms , and has a major impact on electoral politics .
In Ohio in 2004 , stories abounded of inoperative voting machines , too few ballots or too few voting machines .
Then there was Florida in 2000 .
Many continue to believe that the election was thrown to George W. Bush by Ralph Nader , who got about 97,000 votes in Florida .
Ten times that number of Floridians are prevented from voting at all .
Why ?
Currently , more than 1.1 million Floridians have been convicted of a felony and thus are n’t allowed to vote .
We ca n’t know for sure how they would have voted , but as scholar , lawyer and activist Angela Davis said recently in a speech honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Mobile , Ala . , “ If we had not had the felony disenfranchisement that we have , there would be no way that George Bush would be in the White House . ”
Since felony disenfranchisement disproportionately affects African - American and Latino men in the U.S. , and since these groups overwhelmingly vote Democratic , the laws bolster the position of the Republican Party .
The statistics are shocking .
Ryan King , policy analyst with The Sentencing Project in Washington , D.C. , summarized the latest :
About 5.3 million U.S. citizens are ineligible to vote due to felony disenfranchisement ; 2 million of them are African - American .
Of these , 1.4 million are African - American men , which translates into an incredible 13 percent of that population , a rate seven times higher than in the overall population .
Forty - eight states have some version of felony disenfranchisement on the books .
All bar voting from prison , then go on to bar participation while on parole or probation .
Two states , Maine and Vermont , allow prisoners to vote from behind the walls , as does Canada and a number of other countries .
The politicians and pundits are all abuzz with the massive turnouts in the primaries and caucuses .
There are increasing percentages of women participating , and initial reports point to more young people .
The youth vote is particularly important , as young people have less invested in the status quo and can look with fresh eyes at long - standing injustices that disenfranchise so many .
In this context , one of The Sentencing Project ’s predictions bears repeating here : “ Given current rates of incarceration , 3 in 10 of the next generation of black men can expect to be disenfranchised at some point in their lifetime .
In states that disenfranchise ex-offenders , as many as 40 percent of black men may permanently lose their right to vote . ”
The Sentencing Project ’s King said : “ We are constantly pushing for legislative change around the country .
But public education is absolutely key .
There are so many different laws that people simply do n’t know when their right to vote has been restored .
That includes the personnel who work in state governments giving out the wrong information . ”
I called my friend to tell him he was misinformed .
He had n’t been on probation or parole for years .
“ You can vote , ” I told him .
“ You just have to register . ” I could hear him smile through the phone .

What is The Rubber Room ?
Simply put , " The Rubber Room " is a room where hundreds and hundreds of New York City schoolteachers presently sit , being paid full salary to do absolutely nothing .
But , like so many things , it 's not quite so simple ...
What Happens ?
Each year in New York City hundreds of schoolteachers are suspended .
Their teaching privileges are temporarily , but indefinitely , revoked .
Accused of a wide range and varying degrees of misconduct , these teachers are no longer allowed in the classroom .
Instead , while awaiting a lengthy adjudication process , they are compelled to report of an off - campus location commonly refereed to as The Rubber Room .
Annual Costs in Excess of $ 25 Million Teachers assigned to a Rubber Room can spend months and often years there .
Though they continue to collect their full salaries , they are not asked or allowed to perform work of any kind , instead sitting idle day after day .
The annual cost of the New York City Department of Education 's Rubber Room is estimated to be in excess of $ 25 million , with some estimates ranging as high as $ 40 million .
In addition , there is a general consensus that this cost is rising steeply with each passing year .
The Rooms
There exists , at any given time , at least one Rubber Room in each of New York City 's five boroughs .
The rooms are often medium - sized , non-descript administrative spaces with chairs and sometimes tables .
Because almost no one in the New York City public education system is willing to discuss the issue on record , it is difficult to obtain a figure regarding the total number of teachers housed in these rooms , but educated guesses usually place it at a population of approximately 400 to 500 occupants , a population that , according to most , is steadily and even dramatically increasing .
Psychological Impact and Taboo Rubber Room occupants often report feelings of being deprived of their dignity and sense of self worth .
Forced to languish in a state of silent , inactive limbo day after day , they describe being treated like prison inmates in the face of what they feel are baseless charges or complaints .
They often recount an almost Kafkaesque set of procedures , whereby they are transferred to a Rubber Room without being told what they are accused of , who their accusers are , or even , in many instances , that they have been accused of anything at all .
Once assigned to a Rubber Room , teachers are often shunned by their peers and former school administrators .
A general atmosphere of taboo will in many cases follow them for the remainder of their careers , long after they have returned to regular teaching and even , in many cases , after having been fully acquitted of their accusations .
Criticisms
The Rubber Room is an extremely controversial subject , with many involved in New York education regarding it as simply too dangerous a topic to discuss .
Some complain that the Rubber Room allows teachers guilty of atrocious and even criminal misconduct to remain on the public payroll , being paid a full salary to sit and do nothing .
On the other side , there are those that claim the entire process , although initially created as an instrument to protect child safety , has now been expanded into a lethal weapon , used by principals and other administrators to remove teachers from their classrooms based on minor insubordination , personality conflicts , or even for budgetary reasons such as making way for a new replacement teacher who will be paid a far lesser salary .
Although opinions vary widely with respect to the Rubber Room , they do seem to share one common denominator : they are impassioned , sometimes inflammatory , and never positive .
Put another way , you would find it extremely difficult to locate an individual , either working in the New York City public education system or not , who thinks the Rubber Room is a system that works even moderately well .
The Documentary The Rubber Room , a Five Boroughs ' documentary film , is an in - depth , unbiased exploration of the New York City Department of Education 's teacher suspension process .
The Rubber Room asks the tough questions about " the room " itself , but also closely examines teaching in general and relates these questions to larger trends in both New York City and national education .
We encourage all individuals with direct experience or information regarding the New York City Department of Education 's teacher suspension process to contact Five Boroughs Productions for this most important project .
Five Boroughs Productions , a New York City based production company , is comprised of a diverse group of artists and professionals with backgrounds in film , video , multimedia and marketing .
The company is devoted to producing and distributing high - quality films about important issues affecting the lives of each and every one of us .
With a low cost , high impact philosophy , the company is nimble , adaptive and beholden to no one and nothing except the integrity of its founders .

Five Boroughs ' current project , The Rubber Room , is an in - depth , unbiased exploration , via documentary film , of the New York City Department of Education 's teacher suspension process , more commonly known as " The Rubber Room " .
Why is this an important project ?
We at Five Boroughs believe that our public education system is a direct reflection of who we are as a society .
How we choose to implement that system dictates not only our future , but also tells us , in no uncertain terms , who we are today , right at this very moment .
In fact , we believe this subject matter to be of such consequence that it simply speaks for itself .
We encourage all individuals with direct experience or information regarding the above to contact Five Boroughs Productions .
It 's a little known fact that it 's possible to have your DNA profile removed from the National DNA Database ( NDNAD ) .
While the Police have processes to gather and retain DNA samples - they do n't yet have a procedure to delete the DNA of innocent members of the public .
It 's complicated - but for now , this is what you should do .
Over four million profiles have been added to NDNAD since 1995 .
Last year , 115 profiles were deleted and 667,737 added .
In the last five years , 634 DNA profiles have been removed from the database , while 2,649,937 profiles were added .
In other words , the number of DNA profiles removed is around 0.02 per cent of the number of profiles added in the period - where we have the information .
According to a document called the Step model - Retention guidelines , it is considered " exceptional " for an innocent citizen to have one 's DNA sample destroyed , and the associated DNA profile removed .
Currently , the destruction of DNA samples and removal of DNA records are " completed by way of an approved form being sent [ by a Senior Information Manager from the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Crime Directorate 12 ( MPS SCD 12 ) ] to designated staff in each of the departments concerned who are aware of the exceptional case procedure , once deletion / destruction has taken place we are informed and subsequently we notify the applicant , there is no process map in existence for this practice . "
My own fingerprints and DNA were added to the database on 2005 - 07 - 28 when I was arrested on the London Tube .
Then ensued a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , an investigation , an appeal to the outcome and a final decision by the IPCC .
The final decision , dated 2007 - 05 - 03 , " requested that the Metropolitan Police Service reconsider your request for your records and samples to be physically destroyed and electronically deleted , and for the summary information in the Police National Computer to be expunged . "
The Misconduct Office informed me , on 21 August last year , that they had agreed to this request .
Department SCD12 confirmed that my fingerprints were destroyed and the entry on the fingerprint database was deleted on 2007 - 07 - 24 , my DNA samples destroyed and the entry on the DNA database deleted on 2007 - 08 - 20 and my Police National Computer ( PNC ) record deleted on 2007 - 08 - 30 .
If you read the previous paragraph carefully , you may notice that the Misconduct Office requested the exceptional case to be dealt with by SCD12 before informing me of its decision , and SCD12 appears to have been prompt .
So it was no longer possible for me to witness the destruction and removal actions .
Hopefully there was no break in communications , and all those involved did their job properly without making any mistake .
The information I received , unfortunately , leaves room for interpretation .
For instance , there was mention of " DNA sample " ( singular ) when two mouth swabs were taken - most likely a shortcut .
Another example is that SCD12 asks " departments " , but the labs that are contracted to analyse the DNA samples and keeping them are not part of the Police and hence not departments , most likely another shortcut .
So how would I know that my DNA profile really had been deleted ?
One way to verify this would be to plant some of my DNA at a crime scene and wait for a knock at the door .
Obviously this is an experiment I will not undertake .
I 'd much prefer to have ( verifiable ) specific assurances rather than assumptions , but instead I 'll have to trust the Police and the labs they use .
To avoid others having to go through this same situation , I shared these concerns with the SCD12 Senior Information Manager .
The outcome : " An exceptional case process map will be available on the MPS Publication Scheme early 2008 . "
Having a documented process in place instead of the current ad - hoc mechanisms will go some way to increase confidence in the efficacy of what must be a complex procedure .
Unsurprisingly , the Information Commissioner 's Office has also been keen for a long time for the Police to implement such a step - out ( deletion ) procedure .
Publishing a process - which describes in detail the actions to be taken by the Police departments and their contractors - will help ensure other innocents get fair and open treatment in getting off the NDNAD .
This , in turn , will help make exceptional cases the norm . ®
David Mery , a technologist based in London , was arrested in July 2005 for " suspicious behaviour " : carrying a rucksack , and his home computers were confiscated .
He was released without charge .
Last year he succeeded in having his DNA profile purged .
His website is gizmonaut.net .
THIS was the week that seemed to confirm the new balance of power in the technology industry .
Computing is moving online , away from the desktop — and away from Microsoft , the desktop - software leviathan , to Google , master of online search .
Microsoft 's determination not to lose the struggle became clear when it bid $ 44.6 billion in cash and shares for Yahoo ! , an ailing internet giant ( see article ) .
If the deal goes ahead , it will reshape the technology industry and clear the way for a straight fight between Microsoft and Google for dominance in the internet era .
But whether Microsoft 's bid succeeds or fails , it changes how all three firms are perceived .
Yahoo !'s status as the also - ran that seemed poised to inherit the internet , but failed to keep up with the changing technological times , is cemented .
Microsoft , which has never made an acquisition on anything like this scale , has in effect conceded that it cannot compete with Google on its own ; its bid highlights its own weakness almost as much as Yahoo !'s .
Meanwhile , Google 's objections to the proposed deal on antitrust grounds — even though the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo !
would still trail far behind it in both internet search and advertising — show that the firm has failed to grasp that it , not Microsoft , is now regarded as the industry 's Goliath .
Microsoft is the larger company by market capitalisation , of course , being worth some $ 270 billion , compared with Google 's $ 160 billion or so .
But the software market in which Microsoft mainly operates offers far weaker growth prospects than the intertwined search - and - advertising market dominated by Google .
The search giant 's pre-eminence in these fields is not related to a proprietary technological lock - in ( internet users can easily switch between search engines ) ; its market share falls far short of the 90 % that Microsoft boasts in desktop operating - systems and office - productivity software ; and it is not a convicted monopolist .
So to call Google the new Microsoft is , in many ways , unfair .
But it is undeniably the company that other technology firms and media giants are now most scared of — including Microsoft itself .
Google 's growing market share in search , and hence its clout in online advertising , make it look unstoppable .
Searching for scale
What particularly worries Microsoft is the prospect that software will increasingly be delivered as an internet - based service , supported by advertising .
Google already offers a few such services , and is venturing onto Microsoft 's patch .
Microsoft 's counter - attack has failed to make headway .
Despite repeated relaunches , its search engine has a worldwide market share of 2.9 % , against Google 's 62.4 % .
Microsoft 's share of online advertising is equally puny .
Hence its bid for Yahoo ! , the number two in search and advertising .
The two talked about a merger or partnership in 2006 and 2007 , but at the time Yahoo !
still hoped that Panama , a new system for placing advertisements next to the results of internet searches , would enable it to catch Google .
Panama has failed to live up to expectations , however , and Yahoo !'s latest results caused its share price to fall to a four - year low on January 30th .
Microsoft duly pounced .
Unless a rival bid emerges , which is unlikely , or Yahoo !
tries to save itself from the beast of Redmond by outsourcing its search - and - advertising operations to Google , Microsoft seems likely to get its prize .
Just how anti-competitive would a Microsoft - Yahoo ! merger be ?
It is true that the combined firm would dominate the markets for instant messaging and web - based e-mail , but neither is lucrative .
In the markets that really matter — search and advertising — the Microsoft - Yahoo !
combination would still trail far behind Google , which is hoping to extend its reach in advertising even further by buying DoubleClick .
The danger remains that Microsoft will somehow exploit its desktop monopoly to push Google aside .
But how , exactly ?
Microsoft is being closely monitored by regulators , and if there were any way for it to use its desktop monopoly against Google it would surely have done so by now .
Buying Yahoo !
does not help it in that respect — and the deal may well backfire anyway .
Microsoft has never done a merger of this size , and the two companies have very different cultures : there could be an exodus of engineers to other firms , including Google .
From a regulator 's point of view , there are two decisions to make .
The immediate one — whether to let a Microsoft - Yahoo !
tie - up go ahead — is simple enough : creating a more convincing counterweight to Google can only be good for competition .
( By contrast , a tie - up between Google and Yahoo ! would constitute a worrying concentration of power . )
If Microsoft tries any of its old tricks , it should be punished .
As for the longer - term question — what to do about Google ? — the answer is essentially the same .
Like Microsoft , Google has enormous power in its market , so regulatory vigilance is necessary .
But so far nobody , despite much grumbling , has shown that Google is abusing that power .
So leave Google alone too , and prepare for an epic battle between the two tech titans .
Online retailer Amazon.com recently announced that Wii systems were among its top - selling items in 2007 , and sales of the console helped make the year its most profitable one to date .
Amazon said it sold about 17 Wiis per second when the product was in stock .
Additionally , the retailer noted that along with Wii sales , its best - selling video games , Super Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , were top sellers in its entire video games and hardware division .
In PCs , the top sellers included Apple MacBook , Nokia Internet Tablet PC and HP Pavilion Entertainment Notebook PC , Amazon also highlighted .
The strongest day of holiday sales for Amazon was December 10th , on which customers ordered 62.5 items pers second for a total of 5.4 million items .
On its peak shipping day , the retailer shipped products internationally to more than 200 countries , moving more than 3.9 million shipments .
Updated Microsoft boffins are researching the possible benefits of distributing software patches or other content using the same techniques as computer worms .
The mechanism , part of a fundamental research project rather than product development work , aims to reduce the load on servers handling content distribution functions including database maintenance , and streaming broadcasting and patching .
Milan Vojnovic his associates from Microsoft Research in Cambridge have come up with an approach for spreading " good worms " more efficiently by targeting groups of machines on the same subnet that are likely to have the similar security profiles , New Scientist reports .
A Microsoft spokesman clarified that the research , as in common with most of the work at Cambridge , is looking five years or so into the future .
" We 're certainly not intending to replace Windows Update with something based on this .
The research is general computer science research looking at the question of what can be learned from epidemiology and applied to content distribution , " he explained .
In a statement , Microsoft explained that Vojnovic 's research is focused on " improving the efficiency of data distribution of all types across networks , and is n’t limited to certain scenarios or types of data , but investigating underlying networking techniques .
Using understanding from the field of epidemiology is one of the methods that we ’re investigating in this area , and we hope that our research will help inform future computer science research and networking technology .
" This project is basic research , and there no current plans to incorporate this into Microsoft products , " it said .
Security experts expressed doubts about whether the research was going down a bit of a blind alley , at least in the case of patch distribution .
The supposed benefits of Microsoft's " friendly worm " approach are not readily apparent while the possible disadvantages of the scheme are well understood in security circles .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , said its unclear how Microsoft 's proposal deal with the known drawbacks of using self - replicating code for patching .
" Every few years someone comes up with the idea of using virus - like technology to fix a problem .
Every proposal seen so far , however , has suffered from a number of drawbacks - the primary one being that viruses do not give you the benefits of control , consent and testing , " Cluley explained .
" Computer networks and the internet are jammed up enough with Trojan horses , viruses and other malcode without having to add more self - replicating programs to the mix , " he added .
The good virus idea , while appealing at first blush , is problematic .
Security experts including Paul Ducklin of Sophos ( here ) and Vesselin Bontchev of rival antivirus firm Frisk ( here ) have waded in with responses pointing out that friendly worms create more problems than they solve .
A paper on Microsoft 's research - entitled Sampling Strategies for Epidemic - Style Information Dissemination - is due to be presented at the 27th Conference on Computer Communications ( INFOCOM ) in Arizona in April 2008 . ®

Ralph Nader declares himself eligible for the NFL Draft
Ralph Nader , the champion of consumer safety has decided to enter the NFL draft , and some of the top NFL prospects are none too pleased .
" It 's a damn shame man , " said Matt Ryan of Boston College , " he 's runing my chances of being drafted first , or even second . "
Not surpringly , Nader is not a household football name and , in fact , he has n't even touched a pigskin in 24 years .
But with a lot of grassroot support , football analysts speculate that he could go high in the first round .
What position would the lanky 6 ' 4 Nader play ?
According to ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski , Nader would fit in nicely on the defensive side of the ball .
" What I love about this guy is that he 's tenacious , a complete bulldog .
He 's a consumer safety advocate and that 's exactly where I see him causing the most damage , at the safety position . "
Nader catching a pass during warm-ups
NFL draft guru Mel Kiper , Jr. agrees .
" If he sees a running back with an obnoxiously high salary bust into the secondary , you better believe that Nader is gonna lay the smack down . "
Nader , who just recently competed at the NFL combine , impressed scouts and even won over some fans with his on - field antics .
During one particular tackling drill , Nader layed out a sophmore wide receiver from the University of Miami , proceeded to stand over him and shouted " BUCKLE - UP ! " in a gravely voice while actually mimeing the motion of putting on a seatbelt .
The 300 + crowd at the Superdome went nuts .
One would think that a 74 year old man entering the NFL would be the feel good story of the year , but some NFL prospects believe that Nader might end up costing them a spot on an NFL roster .
Chris Long , a projected top 2 pick from Virginia , did n't mince words at a press conference yesterday .
" Does anyone , including Ralph himself , actually think that he has a shot to get drafted ?
He 's just a distraction , a big joke . "
Darren McFadden , a top rated RB from Arkansas shared those same sentiments .
" Seriously , man ?
SERIOUSLY ?
This guy 's a clown , dawg .
If he was really interested in the NFL do n't you think he would have been doing something football related over the past year ?
This guy only comes out around Draft season , shows up at the combine looking lanky as hell and expects to jump right in . "
Nader , however , was true to form and remained completely un-apologetic .
" People are afraid that I might knock them down a notch or two in the draft , and if that 's the case , do n't blame me , blame yourself for not being in better shape you f'in pussy .
If I see you comin over the middle you better buckle up before you get buckled up . "
The NFL draft gets underway on April 26 .

Baker in front of Manhattan 's Marine Midland Bank Building , built by his firm in 1967 . *
Photo : Kevin Cooley * Seventy feet beneath the Las Vegas strip , in a construction pit that will become the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino , Bill Baker is looking for local talent .
Baker is the head structural engineer at Skidmore , Owings and Merrill , the famed building design firm responsible for the Sears Tower in Chicago , the Time Warner Center in New York , and scores of other colossal glass boxes across the globe .
This morning he 's wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest as he watches a Nevada construction crew at work .
He 'll likely draft some of them for his next big project , the multibillion - dollar Crown Las Vegas Resort and Casino .
At 1,888 ( lucky ) feet , it will feature what could be the world 's highest gaming room , 142 stories above the desert floor .
Provided , that is , the Federal Aviation Administration will let it scrape the skies so close to the airport .
Baker inspects welds with his fingertips and , not one to suffer waste ( even in Vegas ) , he looks appraisingly at the oversize columns .
Then he rests a dusty dress shoe on a pile of rebar and turns to Brian Calley , an engineer at Schuff Steel , with the question that got him up early this morning , a question that 's key to making the steel - framed Crown a reality : " So , what 's the biggest thing you 're working with ? "
The Crown will use around 72,000 tons of steel , and Baker needs to know that Schuff can handle that kind of metal .
At Calley 's answer ( 16 feet wide by 60 feet long ) , the bespectacled Baker enthusiastically sticks two thumbs up in the air .
The fewer pieces you have to pick up and connect , the faster the building rises .
And Baker knows that speed and efficiency will be just as important to getting the Crown off the sketch pad as the schematic itself .
" Erection is everything , " he explains .
The problem with most ambitious architectural endeavors is that " people do n't figure out the right way to build them when they design them . "
It 's this mind for efficiency that has made the practical Missourian the most important structural engineer in the world .
More than the notable projects he has already built — from skyscrapers like the 73 - story Tower Palace III in Seoul to the Frank Gehry designed bridge at Millennium Park in Chicago — Baker 's main contribution has been a completely novel way of constructing them .
Dubbed the buttressed core , it works like this :
Three structural " wings " extend out of a central hub .
The wings provide support for the building , and the core keeps the wings firmly anchored so they do n't twist in the wind .
The design allows Baker 's buildings to go up tall , fast , and with enough usable floor space to maximize his client 's chances of turning a profit .
" It 's not just that Bill is a brilliant engineer — which his buildings are demonstrating , " says Carol Willis , director of the Skyscraper Museum in New York City .
" He 's posing new structural approaches rather than reworking old ones , and that 's what it takes to build something unprecedented . "
Baker 's current slate of supertalls — towers that exceed 1,000 feet — is unmatched by any engineer in history .
It surpasses even SOM's own record from the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , when the firm built the 1,450 - foot - tall Sears Tower and the 1,127 - foot - tall John Hancock Center within a few years ( and 2 miles ) of each other .
There 's the Crown here in Las Vegas ; the 1,361 - foot Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago ; the 1,820 - foot Lotte Super Tower in Seoul , to be completed in 2012 ; and the queen of them all , the Burj Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates .
It 's a fantastic spike of a building — soon to be the most desirable address in the Middle East , already the tallest structure of any kind and still rising by a floor every three days to a top - secret height of at least 2,500 feet — more than double the size of the Empire State .
Baker 's ascension — and his buttressed core — comes at the beginning of the supertall era .
People , corporations , and even desert city - states with oversize checkbooks and matching egos are racing to conquer their skylines .
Most of them call Bill Baker .
Since its founding in 1936 , SOM has been the court architect of the global corporation , designing and engineering hundreds of glass - and - steel towers for business districts the world over .
For nearly 25 years , it held the crown for the tallest of the tall — until 1998 , when the Petronas Towers ( 1,483 feet ) in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , squeaked past the Sears by the height of its twin spires .
The '80s and '90s were lean years for supertalls , but Baker never stopped " thinking the problem , " to use his favorite phrase .
On weekdays , he 'd diligently execute his duties as an associate , crunching numbers and working on small aspects of larger projects for the senior engineers .
But he spent his Saturdays at the Illinois Institute of Technology — the MIT Media Lab of the tall - building world — studying with his mentor , Myron Goldsmith .
Goldsmith had helped develop some structural systems : the tubular , used in the World Trade Center and the John Hancock Center , and its successor , the bundled tube , used in the Sears Tower .
Together , Goldsmith and Baker studied old supertall schemes and hatched new ones to test their ideas .
Baker rose through the engineering ranks at SOM with a triple threat of skills — uncommon creativity , mathematical mastery , and a quiet salesperson 's flair .
He may wear the SOM uniform of a jet - black suit — crisp , elegant , unadorned — but his inner nerd is still easy to spot .
Looking like William Hurt with Coke - bottle glasses , Baker carries his paperback - sized HP 48gx graphing calculator everywhere , usually stacked on top of a beat - up Moleskine notebook filled with pencil drawings and formulas .
While his architect colleagues may get more of the media spotlight , Baker goes along to pitch clients — just to make sure everyone knows that SOM 's fancy skin comes with the best bones .
On a summer afternoon , sitting in a conference room overlooking a thicket of downtown Manhattan towers , Baker lays out " the tall - building problem " : Stay small , and structure is cheap .
But go tall , and a major percentage of your cost goes to a larger and larger framework , just to make sure the thing does n't topple over .
" And sometimes , " Baker says , " that becomes a hurdle you can't get over . "
Photo : Getty ImagesPunching buttons on his calculator , Baker runs the numbers .
" The cost per square foot goes up by somewhere between the square and the cube of the height , " he says glumly .
" Basically , if you keep the same footprint and make a building twice as tall , the cost of every square foot becomes somewhere between four and eight times as much . "
So while someday the height of a building will be limited by the eardrum - rupturing pressure changes in its fast - moving elevators , the current restrictions are the thousand and one ways a skyscraper bleeds money .
The first hit comes from the extra tons of steel and concrete necessary to keep it erect .
As you increase a building 's height , its bulk becomes a magnet for wind , which can send it toppling to the ground .
The second hit comes from the revenue lost during additional construction time .
The third hit is from the rentable floor area sacrificed to the extra structure .
And finally , when the giant tower is drywalled and ready to use , it 's inevitably too big — because no matter how hot the real estate boom , it 's never easy to hawk millions of square feet at one time .
Every developer knows that the Empire State Building sat empty throughout the Depression .
Baker likes to describe his favorite clients , the guys who come to him with visions of clouds passing by their windows , as " not normal . "
Like Donald Trump .
In early 2001 , Trump hired SOM to design the tallest building in the world — 2,000 feet , or about 160 stories .
The kickoff meeting was set for the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
Of course , that meeting never happened .
The project stalled and was later reworked to become the merely giant 92 - story Trump International that 's rising today where the Sun - Times building used to be in Chicago .
But Baker never stopped thinking the 2,000 - foot problem .
For a proposed 90 - story apartment building in Seoul called Tower Palace III , he and then SOM architect Adrian Smith worked up a Y - shaped plan that maximized the number of windows per apartment .
Neighbors fought the developers down to a more modest 73 stories , but not before Baker saw something special in that Y : It was really strong .
And shockingly light .
Each of the shape 's three " noses " acted as a brace for the other two , so unless the wind was coming from every direction at once , there was always an unstressed segment to anchor it .
But at supertall heights , the shape would twist — " like the dickens , " Baker says .
Though such motion poses little risk of causing what engineers call the overturning moment ( which is exactly what it sounds like ) , the same can't be said for stomachs .
High in the air in a gently twisting building , the horizon seesaws .
Nausea ensues .
Baker worried that this would be a problem — perhaps the problem — for the future of supertalls .
The capabilities of steel and concrete are one thing ; the constitution of the inner ear is another .
But he also saw a solution .
If you connected each of the noses to a strong central core , the shape would not torque .
Engineers — like astronomers and snowboarders — often get to name their discoveries .
Baker called this the buttressed core .
And of one thing he was certain : " If somebody really wanted to do the world 's tallest building , this would be the way to go . "
In spring 2003 , a pair of developers invited Baker and two of SOM 's managing partners to dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Manhattan skyline .
The developers worked for a company in Dubai called Emaar , and they wanted to construct the tallest building in the world .
Dubai was eager to make its mark , and because its ruler , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum ( known affectionately by locals as Sheikh Mo ) , supported the project , there would be no litigious neighbors or pesky air traffic controllers to muck things up .
" There are some places in the world that are like , Let 's do it , get it done , ' " Baker says .
" Dubai is one of those places . "
Emaar gave SOM two weeks to submit a proposal for a residential building , to be known as the Burj Dubai .
The Dubai Tower .
Using the apartment building in Seoul as a starting point , Smith sketched a structure that stepped back as it rose , like a spiral staircase .
He arranged the wings in a Y .
" I knew from Bill that that shape would work well for a supertall , " he says .
Smith then rubbed out the sharp edges , replacing them with curved petals , like the flowers of the Arabian Desert .
SOM got the job , and the buttressed core would have its day — the Burj would be the tallest building in the world .
The initial scheme was for a building of about 1,800 feet , 317 feet taller than the Petronas Towers .
Yet the clients made a request : Overengineer the foundation , just in case we change our minds .
Which the clients did .
Repeatedly .
On trip after trip to Dubai — even after a hole was dug and giant caissons were set 150 feet into the sand , even after the building began to rise , a floor every three days , into the desert haze — the SOM team kept getting the same request :
Can you make it taller ?
They worked the problem in the wind tunnel , adding fins around the perimeter ( like dimples on a golf ball ) to create surface turbulence and reduce the lateral forces on the building .
They worked the problem with concrete specialists , engineering a high - strength mix that could be pumped into the sky , like a giant drip - castle .
But one thing needed no tweaking : the buttressed core .
It seemed to permit limitless growth .
Most buildings are conceived with a set height , and the engineers work to that height — or whimper as the bankers slice it down .
But Baker and his team found themselves testing the Burj to see how much taller it could go .
" We did n't know , " Baker says .
" You get up as far as you think you can , and you see where you are , and you say , Oh .
We still have some gas left in the tank . '
But no one had ever been where we were . "
The final height of the Burj will remain secret until its completion in 2009 .
SOM 's managing partner George Efstathiou brags that it 'll be as high as the Sears Tower and the Hancock Center stacked on top of each other ( about 2,600 feet ) .
Others say it could be taller — more than 3,000 feet .
Baker thrills at the growing reality of it , but every once in a while he raps his knuckles on the table .
" Quite frankly , I often urged the client to , you know —
We can stop here , right ? ' "
Baker says with a chuckle .
" But they kept on pushing for taller and taller , and they were looking at me to see when I turned pale — so they'd know where to stop . "
Smith remembers it differently .
" Oh , we went beyond when Bill went pale , I can tell you that . "

FEATURE The Buttressed Core
Cruise became involved in Scientology in 1990
Cruise is shown discussing how he wants to spread the message of Scientology , saying : " You 're in the playing field or out of the arena " .
In the edited video , which features the Mission Impossible theme , he says a Scientologist driving past an accident is " the only one who can really help " .
A Scientology spokeswoman said the full video could be seen in its churches .
What appeared on the internet was a " pirated and edited " version of an acceptance speech Cruise had made in 2004 after receiving a " freedom medal " from the International Association of Scientologists , she said .
' Drug rehabilitation '
In the nine - minute edited version of the video , which has appeared on websites including video - sharing site YouTube , Cruise says : " Being a Scientologist , when you drive past an accident it 's not like anyone else .
It 's rough and tumble and it's wild and woolly and it's a blast
Tom Cruise on Scientology
" As you drive past , you know you have to do something about it because you know you 're the only one that can really help . "
He said of being a Scientologist : " It 's rough and tumble and it's wild and woolly and it's a blast .
" It 's a blast .
It really is fun because there is nothing better than going out there and fighting the fight and suddenly you see things are better . "
He added : " We are the authorities on getting people off drugs , we are the authorities on the mind , we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals ... we can bring peace and unite communities . "
' In or out '
Cruise said he wished " the world was a different place " and that he would " like to go on vacation and go and play " .
Let 's really get it done - let 's have enough love and compassion and toughness that we 're going to do it and do it right
Tom Cruise
" That 's what I want to be and there 's times I 'd like to do that but I can't because I know .
I know . "
He said Scientologists had no time for " spectatorism " but instead had " a responsibility to educate and create the new reality " .
" You are either in or you 're out , " he said .
He added : " We have that responsibility to say , ' Hey , this is the way it should be done because we do it this way and people are actually getting better and let 's get it done ' .
" Let 's really get it done - let 's have enough love and compassion and toughness that we 're going to do it and do it right . "
' Sick stuff '
The Church of Scientology International spokeswoman said Cruise 's speech had been made " before an audience of 5,000 church parishioners and their guests " .
Cruise had been " honoured for his efforts in championing world literacy " , the spokeswoman added .
Last week , Cruise 's lawyer branded a new biography of the actor " sick stuff " .
Bert Fields said Tom Cruise : An Unauthorised Biography by British author Andrew Morton - published in the US on Tuesday - was full of " tired old lies " .
They included the " nutty " claim that Cruise was second - in - command at the Church of Scientology , he added .
The book 's publisher has said it stands by the book and the author .
While publicly espousing the cause of democracy , Washington , London and others were happy to deal closely with " despots masquerading as democrats " , such as Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf , Russia 's Vladimir Putin and Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak , the group said .
HRW singled out the UK government as a concern for its policy of deporting terrorism suspects to countries with repressive regimes if assurances are given the detainees will not be tortured or otherwise mistreated .
This " handy device " had now been borrowed by the US to justify renditions , while Russia and other nations were also happily trying it out , the group said .
The report detailed abuses in more than 75 countries and territories , covering perennial rights pariahs such as North Korea , Burma and China as well as the US and EU .
It criticised Israel for blockading Gaza in response to rocket attacks , describing this as " collective punishment of Gaza 's civilian population in violation of international humanitarian law " .
But HRW 's primary target this year was what it views as the hypocrisy of western nations condemning democratic violations only when expedient .
" Rarely has democracy been so acclaimed yet so breached , so promoted yet so disrespected , so important yet so disappointing , " HRW 's executive director , Kenneth Roth , said in an introduction to the 569 - page document .
This " pseudo democracy " had seen leaders in countries such as Egypt , Nigeria and Ethiopia recognised abroad for their popular mandates despite elections plagued by fraud , intimidation or other flaws .
" It seems Washington and European governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " Roth said , calling the promotion of democracy " a softer and fuzzier alternative to defending human rights " .
President Bush had even praised Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , for placing Pakistan " on the road to democracy " , Roth noted .
Roth said the current violence in Kenya , prompted by the seemingly rigged election on December 27 which returned President Mwai Kibaki to power , could be traced back to overseas reluctance to challenge a similarly flawed poll in Nigeria 10 months earlier .
" Nigeria 's leader came to power in a violent and fraudulent vote , yet he 's been accepted on the international stage , " he said .
He said it led Kenya to believe fraud would be tolerated in the presidential election .

EARLIER this fall , many Catholics began to receive e-mail messages warning of the “ agenda ” behind a “ new Children ’s movie out in December called ‘ The Golden Compass . ’ ” The film , these e-mails claimed , was intended to serve as bait for the novel on which it is based , the first in a fantasy trilogy collectively titled “ His Dark Materials . ”
Kids intrigued by the film , the e-mails went on , would be tempted to read the trilogy and might thereby fall into the ideological clutches of its author , Philip Pullman , who seeks nothing less than “ to bash Christianity and promote atheism . ”
The messages had the breathless , marginally literate quality of rumors about spider eggs in bubble gum .
Perhaps that ’s why the controversy promptly earned itself a page at www.snopes.com, that venerable Internet clearing house for urban legends .
Snopes lists this particular rumor as “ true , ” presumably because the e-mails use a few genuine , if cherry - picked , quotations from Pullman ’s writings and press interviews .
But that does n’t keep the whole thing from being fundamentally ridiculous .
Most preposterous , of course , is the idea that anyone would make a $ 180 - million movie with the purpose of tricking children into reading a seditious book .
What self - respecting kid ever needed that much encouragement to ferret out whatever the adults are trying to hide ?
Also -- whoops ! -- no one ’s been hiding “ His Dark Materials . ”
To date , 15 million copies of Pullman ’s books have been sold worldwide .
“ The Golden Compass ” won not only the 1995 Carnegie Medal , a prize awarded by British children ’s librarians , but also the “ Carnegie of Carnegies , ” as the public ’s favorite book in the prize ’s 70 - year history .
The final novel in the trilogy , “ The Amber Spyglass , ” won the Whitbread Book of the Year award in 2001 , the first children ’s book ever to do so .
It ’s safe to say that copies of the trilogy reside in every decent children ’s library in the nation .
If there is indeed a “ deceitful stealth campaign ” afoot to lure children to Pullman ’s books -- as William Donohue , spokesman for the Catholic League , insists -- it ’s remarkably short on stealth .

What ’s really astonishing , and telling , is how long it ’s taken America ’s religious fear - mongers to notice Pullman .
He ’s never hidden his skepticism about God or his rejection of organized religion .
A quick Internet search turns up a 2004 essay he wrote deploring “ theocracies ” for a newspaper in his native Britain , and his own Web site states that he thinks it “ perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it . ”
“ His Dark Materials ” features a sympathetic character , an ex-nun , who describes Christianity as “ a very powerful and convincing mistake , ” while “ The Amber Spyglass ” concludes with the two child heroes participating in the dissolution of “ the Authority , ” a senile , pretender God who has falsely passed himself off as the creator of the universe .
Only with a movie attached , however , does an outfit like Focus on the Family deem the “ blasphemous and heretical ” content of Pullman ’s fiction worthy of their attention .
The Catholic League is calling for a boycott of the film and books ; evangelical Protestant organizations have settled for simply urging their constituencies to approach both with extreme caution .
Whether the controversy will harm the film or wrap it in the glamour of the forbidden remains to be seen .
As for the books , well , you have to wonder how much actual reading goes on in the sort of household that welcomes e-mails like the ones denouncing “ The Golden Compass , ” anyway .
Yes , it ’s true , as the e-mails virtually shriek , that Pullman once told an interviewer “ His Dark Materials ” is about “ killing God , ” and that he wrote an op - ed piece describing C.S. Lewis ’ “ The Chronicles of Narnia ” as “ ugly and poisonous . ”
It ’s also true that these statements have been taken out of context -- not just out of the context of a particular interview or newspaper editorial , but out of the context of an entire culture , a culture of conversation , debate and consideration , rather than paranoia , alarmism and extremism .

I first met Pullman in England , at an annual lecture sponsored by a trust dedicated to the furthering of religious education .
I buttonholed Simon Pettitt , an Anglican priest and the trust ’s chairman , to marvel at this ; his counterparts in the United States , I said , would never have invited a figure like Pullman to speak at a flagship public event .
And yet , Pettitt is no renegade .
Rowan Williams , the archbishop of Canterbury , has enthused about “ His Dark Materials ” and participated in an onstage discussion with Pullman when a stage version of “ His Dark Materials ” was produced by the National Theatre in London .
“ In America , ” I told Pettitt , “ religious groups gain political advantage and rally their followers by presenting themselves as embattled .
Actually listening to the other side is tantamount to admitting you ’re not really being persecuted . ”
With a look of mild pity , he replied , “ In order to come to views , you do n’t just listen to people you agree with .
Education is a good thing , and , therefore , so is openness to different views . ”
Although Pullman has some vehement detractors among Britain ’s Christians , the liberal clergy there have more often valued his books for tackling the great questions of existence : life , death , morality and humanity ’s role in the universe .
They regard his fiction as a springboard for discussion , the kind of discussion that does sometimes lead people to embrace God .
They recognize him not as an enemy but as an ally in a society increasingly colonized by the vapid preoccupations of consumer culture .
Pullman also turned out to be no dogmatist .
His practice of tossing out provocative statements struck me as a habit acquired during his years as a middle - school teacher , intended not to shut out opposing ideas but to flush them from the underbrush of adolescent inertia .
He too is interested in what the other side has to say .
This curiosity is in keeping with an ideal he calls “ the democracy of reading , ” in which “ to - and - fro between reader and text ” leaves each “ free to engage honestly with the other . ”
Advertisement
It ’s also -- let ’s face it -- the only sensible attitude for a writer of fiction to adopt .
Stories are wayward and so are readers , as the millions of kids who have loved Lewis ’ Narnia books without succumbing to their Christian symbolism can testify .
Donna Freitas , a liberal American Catholic theologian and coauthor ( with Jason King ) of a book about Pullman ’s trilogy , “ Killing the Impostor God , ” hails “ His Dark Materials ” as a “ religious classic , ” in which the old patriarchal model of God is “ killed ” to make way for a new divinity , “ fit for our age . ”
She calls Pullman a “ reluctant theologian , ” and the author has praised her book as among the best yet written about his work .
Pullman ’s response to Freitas , and Freitas ’ response to Pullman , are fundamentally literary , rooted in the understanding that to read a great story -- at any age -- is not to passively absorb a doctrine , but to begin an imaginative collaboration .
It is that freedom , a reader ’s freedom , that the boycott promoters find so frightening .
As Pullman himself has written , “ Thou shalt not is soon forgotten , but Once upon a time lasts forever . ”
If you are trying to do pixel - perfect cross - browser CSS layout , then you have probably ran into problems with IE .
I am going to highlight the top 7 CSS hacks that we often use to have pixel perfect design .
The box model hack is used to fix a rendering problem in pre-IE 6 browsers , where the border and padding are included in the width of an element , as opposed to added on
padding : 4em ; border : 1 em solid red ; width : 30em ; width/**/:/**/ 25em ;
2 ) Conditional Comments
These conditional comments are for IE - only and they ’re not supported by any other browser .
For other browsers they are just an ordinary comments and therefor , they are safe to use .
The typical usage is as follows :
<!--[ if IE ] > Some CssCode<![ endif ]-->
The above code applies to all versions of Internet Explorer , i.e. 5.01 , 5.5 and 6.0 , but now we want to apply it to versions of Internet Explorer , i.e. 5.01 , 5.5 and 6.0 , so we will apply the following condition :
<!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > Some Css Code<![ endif ]-->
After we finish testing , we remove all hacks to separate file (s ) , so the main CSS is clean and tidy .
This separate file is then called in the header section of a file within conditional comments .
<!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " ie_hacks.css " /><![ endif ] -->
Condition is one of the following :
IE ( Any version of IE )
lt IE version ( Versions less than version )
lte IE version ( Versions less than or equal to version )
IE version ( Only version )
gte IE version ( Versions greater than or equal to version )
gt IE version ( Versions greater than version )
Version is the version of Internet Explorer , typically 5 , 5.5 , 6 , or 7 , you can read more info about this at Quirksmode .
3 ) Min-width and Max - width of an element
IE does n’t understand this command , so we ’ll need a new way of making this work in this browser .
Let ’s take a quick example , we need to apply this to a div with id =" wrapper " :
< wrapper > < div id =" nav " >
Next we create our CSS commands , so as to create a minimum width of 750px :
# wrapper{min - width : 750px;width:expression(document.body.clientWidth < 750 ? " 750 px " : " auto " );}
You might also want to combine this minimum width of 750 px with a maximum width 1220px :
# wrapper{min - width : 750 px ; max - width : 1220 px;width:expression(document.body.clientWidth < 750 ? " 750 px " : document.body.clientWidth > 1220 ? " 1220 px " : " auto " ) ; }
Another Alternative for for min-height without javascript is to use Dustin Diaz ’ nice hack : :
#id{ min-height : 100 px ; height : auto ! important ; height :100 px ; }
4 ) Easy Selectors
Most in -CSS hacks deal with selector bugs .
Below is a list of different IE versions and the beginnings of selectors that are known to select elements in them .
All of these selectors use valid CSS .
IE 6 and below * html {}
IE 7 and below *: first - child + html {} * html {}
IE 7 only *:first-child+html {}
IE 7 and modern browsers only html > body {}
Modern browsers only ( not IE 7 ) html>/**/body {}
Recent Opera versions 9 and below html : first- child {}
5 ) Whatever : hover
The : hover selector enables you to have cool effect for html elements like and in tables .
Most browsers have no problem with this , except IE which look at the stylesheets and each individual rule with javascript .
If : hover rules can be tracked , and .htc can be used to change an elements behavior , then it should be possible to create a behavior that enables : hover for any element .
You can read more about this here
6 ) Transparent PNGs
IE dos n’t handle transparent PNG too well .
You ’ll get an ugly grayish type background wherever it ’s supposed to be transparent .
And we can n’t just use GIFs because are n’t good for higher resolution images .
So we need a CSS hack to fix this .
Follow the following steps and you will be set :
A HTC script and a transparent GIF will be used to solve this issue .
You can download both files here
Now just upload these 2 files to wherever you store your IE.css file .
Add one simple line of CSS code to your ie.css file : img.pngfix { behavior : url( pngHack.htc ) ; }
Another solution can be found at Komodomedia
Stylegala ’s method is to detect browser version and serve different CSS rules to different user agents , without using hacks or conditional comments .
At the same time the end user or validator will never see the CSS rules specified for other browsers than the one they are using .
He used some simple PHP code to detect browser type exactly as any CSS hack .

Ms Sampallo discovered her true identity in 2001
Maria Eugenia Sampallo Barragan , born in a clandestine torture camp 30 years ago , is the first " Dirty War " child to bring such a case before the courts .
Her lawyers said they would seek the maximum 25 - year term for the couple , who begin their defence later in March .
It is believed some 200 children were given to families with military links .
Ms Sampallo has accused Osvaldo Rivas and Maria Cristina Gomez Pinto of kidnapping her and falsifying documents to conceal her identity .
A former army captain , Enrique Berthier , is also a defendant in the hearing which began in February and is expected to conclude in a few weeks ' time .
He is accused of taking the infant Ms Sampallo from her mother and giving her to the couple , who registered her as their own daughter .
DNA tests
" The charges against them are very serious .
All deserve the maximum allowed by law - 25 years , " Ms Sampallo 's lawyer , Tomas Ojea Quintana , said outside the court on Tuesday .
Ms Sampallo said she believed her decision to sue was important " for all of society and for the rest of the children in my situation . "
In 2001 , as a result of DNA tests , she learned that she was the daughter of missing political prisoners Mirta Mabel Barrgan and Leonardo Ruben Sampallo .
The defendants have not commented publicly on the case , the Associated Press reports .
Between 10,000 and 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during military rule from 1976 to 1983 .
During this period , Argentina 's military rulers carried out illegal detentions , torture and executions of alleged left - wing opponents .
Many of the bodies have never been recovered .
NEW YORK –
The 50 - foot - high faces that flash and twitch on a massive LED screen 48 stories above Times Square are all different .
Some smile .
Some scowl .
Some try to look sexy .
Some look like they 're ready to brawl .
Unlike all the other faces in the advertising - saturated sky above midtown Manhattan , the ones in Raul Vincent Enriquez 's latest art installation , which launches Thursday , are n't trying to sell anything .
The only concept Enriquez says he is trying to convey with his new piece , I in the Sky , is the importance of eye contact .
" We just need more eye contact ; it 's what makes us human , " the Brooklyn - based artist says .
" I think it 's really fascinating .
It can be the invitation to a fight or a sign that you 're understanding somebody . "
I in the Sky 's giant color close - ups mix the sci- fi creepiness of Big Brother 's omnipresent eye with twitchy and amusing personal moments , depending on the subjects ' facial expressions and animators ' tweaks .
Although the project 's scope is big , with plans for more than 10,000 people to have their faces shown on the 2,500 - square - foot Lumacom screen over the next seven weeks , Enriquez says the focus remains small – on the eyes .
In fact , the eyes are actually what make the whole process technologically possible .
Each video portrait used in I in the Sky is the result of a subject sitting in a specially designed photo booth at the nearby chashama gallery .
Participants stare at a camera for 30 seconds , and 30 photographs are produced .
A computer program lines up the eyeballs in each of the pictures , and animators enhance certain facial movements to create a vibrant video portrait with a flip - book feel .
" You get to pick up on people 's little tics and twitches , because they are sitting in front of the camera for 30 seconds , " Enriquez says .
" Some of their personality comes out in this very curious way .
People [ who 've seen the portraits ] have said they feel very voyeuristic , like they 're looking at somebody who 's looking at themselves in the mirror alone .
They kind of feel like they 're violating that person 's privacy because you get to see this moment that they 're having with the camera . "
Anita Durst , chashama 's artistic director , says that when she learned the $ 200,000 - a- month LED billboard above the Durst Organization 's building at 4 Times Square was available for a public art project , she thought Enriquez 's animated portraits would be an excellent fit .
" It lets ordinary people be famous for a minute , " Durst says .
" It reshapes the way we think about the skyline . "
Video courtesy chashama
I in the Sky adds a bit of human warmth to the Manhattan skyline , and Enriquez wanted that warmth to be reflected in the photo booth that serves as the interface between the public and the massive sign .
Artist - designer Michael Casselli says that the booth was inspired by Federal - style architecture , H.G. Wells '
The Time Machine and bits of the industrial revolution : all juxtapositions with the high - tech processes that would go on inside .
" If it 's too slick and cold , " Casselli says , " it would n't be as inviting . "
For Enriquez , the invitation is important , since public involvement will help make the installation a success .
" It 's important to take these little mundane moments and make them grand , " he says .
" There 's an absurdity to it , but that 's what makes it fun and engaging . "
- - -
The I in the Sky project runs through April 26 .
Participants can have their portraits taken free for the installation at the chashama gallery , 112 W. 44th St. , Manhattan , on Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays from noon to 8 p.m .
The videos will be shown on the LED billboard and be available for download at the project website .
Smarter Learning
Slick
Net is about smarter learning .
Learning for personal development should be fun and effortless .
Learning to get a qualification should be quick and efficient .
There are paths and tools available to achieve the right learning process for you .
Learning in the Real World
The world seems to be contained in a small bubble when you are at school or college and really into your studies .
Students are often oblivious to events outside the education system .
Your world might consists of maths problem sets , assignments , deadlines and end - of - week activities .
While you immerse yourself in an equation or a great work of fiction , people are being born , growing , working , pondering , fighting , debating , being inspired and making love across the globe .
It is important that learning extends beyond the academic .
Unless you are going to be a teacher , you will enter the non-classroom world after you graduate .
Developing all - round skills will help you not just cope , but thrive in whatever endeavors you commit to .
Ways to support real - world learning include learning activities for kids , student travel tours , outdoor adventures and hobbies , and science fiction entertainment .
As long as your mind is stimulated , engaged , and challenged , you are learning .
Online Learning
Online learning can be fun but usually is done with a specific objective in mind .
It is now the most efficient way to earn a qualification .
You can study from the convenience of home and you can do it whenever you have time .
Benefits
Online learning is a great way to earn a qualification at any age .
For mature students , you do n’t need to give up your current job in order to pursue an education .
The benefits of distance learning often outweigh the disadvantages .
However , it is not for everyone .
Earning an online degree is undoubtedly a rewarding and enjoyable experience .
It offers you the independence and freedom to study at your own pace .
While this is good for some people , for others the lack of discipline or unwanted distractions could leave them wishing they had attended a traditional classroom instead .
Motivation
The number one factor that determines whether online learning is for you is self - motivation .
To be successful you need to have plenty of motivation and set your own goals .
Therefore , give this considerable thought before you decide to study online .
Distance learners motivate themselves and do not require teachers to keep them motivated .
Another important aspect is your attitude towards accomplishing tasks .
If you are a procrastinator then distance learning is not for you .
The moment you put off completing assignments or wait until the last minute to do so , your chances of success begin to diminish .
Online learning allows you to study in your own way but that does n’t mean you can keep delaying submission of your assignments .
Along with the freedom to study at your own pace you also have the privilege of completing a program faster , which is what most distance learners take advantage of .
Comprehension
It is essential to be able to comprehend well since you are expected to go through most of the material on your own .
Most programs require you to go through a large amount of material that is written text although there are video recordings and audio clips included in the course material .
With good comprehension skills , you will be able to succeed through distance learning .
Another important issue is the ability to resist constant distractions .
Added domestic responsibilities , the pressure of kids , or the allure of the television set can seriously hamper anyone ’s efforts at securing an online degree in a reasonable time .
Therefore , make sure you will not succumb to such distractions and are able to set time aside to study without any interruptions or else you may want to consider attending traditional classroom lectures .
Organization
It is important to be organized when it comes to distance learning .
Setting aside time for study and assignments is essential even though you have the flexibility .
In addition , you need to make sure you are n’t too shy about asking questions .
With distance learning you need to be able to speak out even though it is via email , phone , or in a virtual classroom .
You would also want to sharpen your research skills since online learning requires you to do plenty of research on your own and good at expressing the written word as well .
By no means is online learning the easy way out .
You need to work just as hard if not harder than you would if you attended traditional classes .
Continuous Learning
Online learning has evolved over the years with a more practical approach to education .
Web - based learning tools have become more powerful to enable students to experience a more interactive , convenient , and productive learning method .
Although parents and adults wanting to pursue a degree are often apprehensive about online learning , the trend is slowly changing in favor of online learning .
Recent studies according to the US Department of Education indicate better performance by students undergoing online education as compared to traditional classrooms .
Online learning requires a great deal of disciple especially when you have the flexibility to study at your own pace .
For the most part , online learning simplifies education and makes it a more interactive experience .
This type of education is n’t restricted to high school students or recent high school graduates .
In fact , a large number of people in the workforce who have n’t had the chance to complete their education are fulfilling their dreams through online learning .
Many of them seek to advance their career and find a job that is more rewarding .
Employers also encourage their employees to pursue their education online so that they perform better .
Some employers offer a partial tuition reimbursement to employees that wish to pursue a higher education online .
Popular Study Fields
Online learning courses are available for a variety of fields .
Business and education are the most sought after degrees .
Teachers seeking to enhance their career prospects can earn a master ’s or a doctorate degree in education .
This includes a number of education that desire to specialize in different educational fields including Special Education and Assessment Evaluation .
Work and financial constraints are no longer deterrents when it comes to pursuing an online degree in education .
Among the popular business online degree programs is the MBA or Master in Business Administration and a Bachelor degree in Business Management , to name a few .
The options for those wishing to pursue a business degree online are endless .
This includes the most modern methods of business that keeps pace with technology .
As technology evolves at an exponential pace so does the business world .
A company with qualified employees does not lag behind , which is why many encourage their employees to complete their degrees and increase their overall performance .
Online degree programs are for the most part affordable and with flexible timings , you never need to sacrifice work or study time .
Accreditation
Online universities offer fully fledged online programs after acquiring the necessary accreditation .
It is essential for online learning universities to be accredited , which gives them the mandate to work in the required jurisdiction .
Therefore , it is important to choose the right type of institution with the requisite accreditation .
You have tremendous choice available .
For example , a high proportion of Australia ’s public universities are also online universities .
Methods
Some online learning programs use videoconferencing , direct broadcasting , podcasts or live streaming to create a traditional classroom environment .
In addition , students have the option to access material at their own time and schedule .
When work and other commitments or constraints do not permit you to attend regular classes and procure a degree , online learning universities are a viable option .
Benefits of Work - Based Learning
Full time classes are not for everyone .
The long hours of learning abstract ideas , theories and broad concepts that one cannot relate make full time study seem tough .
Work - based learning remains the best way of advancing knowledge and skills in the current competitive job market .
The learning process is quite engaging and often focuses on the key skills necessary in the workplace .
Besides , the courses are usually short , manageable and tailored to the student needs .
Normally , learning takes place in the workplaces , classrooms or online hence keeping it flexible to accommodate people working in diverse settings .
If you wish to advance your knowledge and skills , here are more reasons to go for work - based learning .
Easy and fast learning
Work - based learning enhances your understanding .
You have an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you gain almost immediately in the office or other workplace .
Additionally , some concepts that you have come across as you work make it easier to grasp advanced ideas that you need to study .
Unlike in on - campus learning , you may have a chance to apply or practice what you learn a few days after .
Besides , you are likely to enjoy the benefits of learning new skills easily since if you acquire new skills , chances are high that you will receive promotion straight away .
Readily available job
While a student taking on - campus studies finish the cause first to start searching for employment , you will not struggle securing an opportunity to utilize your skills .
In addition , studying while working ensures you undertake the course that has available opportunities .
Therefore , the opportunity is already waiting for you unlike when undertakes full - time course only to search for a job later .
Moreover , most of the courses available for people already working focus on applicable concepts and skills that are important to you and your boss ( BMA ) .
Flexible and affordable study
Work - based learning is often flexible , affordable and thus more convenient than the conventional full - time studies .
Since the tutors will only take a shorter engaging time with the students , the work - based learning is usually cheaper .
You will end up paying less than those undertaking full - time on - campus courses while you continue earning more even as you study .
By contrast , the on - campus study requires you to forego the salary and pay high tuition fee to acquire the same skills .
With the less burden of learning costs , you can still have sufficient amount of money to support your family .
More importantly , the work - based learning suits your work schedule in every way unlike the structured on - campus studies .
The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington looks at the reaction in the US to the news that 4,000 US soldiers have now died in Iraq since 2003 .
Asked to comment on news that another grim milestone had been reached in Iraq , US Vice - President Dick Cheney admitted that it " never gets any easier " to put young American men and women in harm 's way .
Iraq seems to be not the everyday preoccupation for Americans now White House spokeswoman Dana Perino , meanwhile , said President George W Bush " believes that every life is precious , and he spends time every day thinking about those who 've lost their lives on the battlefield " .
But it seems that America itself is spending less time thinking about such things .
News that 4,000 American soldiers have now died in Iraq has not been splashed across the front pages of the nation 's newspapers .
The New York Times mentioned the landmark , but in the context of a report that 13 Iraqis had been killed by rockets fired at Baghdad 's Green Zone .
The Washington Post had Iraq on its front page , but this was a piece about Falluja 's new police chief .
The Los Angeles Times , almost alone among the country 's big circulation papers , led with the military death toll .
Slump in interest
It may have been that the news broke too late on Easter Sunday for papers to respond differently , but recent research shows that Iraq is not the everyday preoccupation for Americans that it once was .
The US casualty numbers have dropped in recent months
It 's more of a dull ache than a sharp pain .
The Pew Research Centre , earlier this month , reported that public awareness of the number of US military fatalities in Iraq had declined sharply since last August , with only about a quarter of Americans knowing roughly how many of their own soldiers had died .
The slump in interest seems directly linked to the success of the US troop " surge " in slowing the rate of US casualties .
With the economy now the number one concern , the poll found that more Americans knew the name of the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke , and the current level of the Dow Jones industrial average .
Pew linked the poll findings to the fact that press attention to the war has waned over the same period , with Iraq occupying 3 % of the " news hole " ( the amount of print space or air time available to report news ) in February , compared with 15 % last July .
For Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , this is unwelcome news .
The war in Iraq , which they both oppose and have pledged to end , once threatened to dominate this year 's election campaign .
It has now been shoved aside by the economy .
How much longer are we going to ask our families and our communities to bear the cost of this war
Barack Obama
Democratic presidential hopeful
For the presumptive Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , better news from Iraq in recent months has contributed to an improvement in his political fortunes , appearing to vindicate his strong support for the Bush administration 's surge strategy .
How long this lasts remains to be seen .
The latest figures released by the Pentagon show that while the level of daily attacks by insurgents fell significantly until November , the figure then remained static until January .
Recent weeks have seen an increase in attacks .
The Democrats , meanwhile , have retooled their anti-war strategy , working hard to link Iraq with the US economy .
Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House of Representatives , said on Monday that Americans understood that the war " continues to take us deeper into debt " .
In a major campaign speech last week in West Virginia , Mr Obama hammered home the same message , linking the war with the price of petrol and the absence of National Guard units to deal with domestic emergencies .
" How much longer are we going to ask our families and our communities to bear the cost of this war ? " he asked .

Lord Goldsmith wants a British national day by 2012
Citizenship ceremony
Report author , ex-attorney general Lord Goldsmith , says it would give teenagers a sense of belonging .
Council tax and student fee rebates are suggested for people who volunteer - as well as a " Britishness " public holiday .
The PM 's spokesman said he welcomed the " interesting " review , adding that it had sparked " quite a lively debate " .
However , John Dunford from the Association of School and College leaders said the citizenship ceremony was " a half - baked idea " .
Graduation ceremonies
A Scottish Government spokesman said it did not support the plan and did not believe it would find favour with parents or school pupils .
Welsh Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said : " I do n't think that 's appropriate myself . "
And Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said : " I think this is a serious mistake - I think it 's puerile and I think it 's rather silly .
CITIZENSHIP - KEY POINTS

At -a- glance : Citizenship plans
" The symbols of a healthy democracy are not to be found in empty gestures and I 'm afraid I see this as an empty gesture . "
Lord Goldsmith , who quit government in June , believes that citizenship ceremonies for teenagers would help improve their sense of what it means to be a British citizen .
" Certainly there is n't a crisis of national identity , but the research does tend to show there 's been a diminution in national pride , in this sense of belonging , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" The citizenship ceremonies , which are just one of the many things I have suggested , are a way of marking that passage of being a student of citizenship to a citizen in practice .
" It does make sense to promote a sense of shared belonging , a sense that you are part of a community with a common venture , to integrate better newcomers to our society and be clearer about what the rights and responsibilities are . "
Lord Goldsmith said that while he favours an oath of allegiance to the Queen , the statement could be a pledge of commitment to the country or a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are .
What do teeenagers think ?

He also stressed that he could not see why Republicans would not want to swear an oath , even though they may not believe in the present system of government .
However , Graham Smith of the group Republic , which campaigns for the abolition of the monarchy , questioned whether children who refuse to take part will be told " they are somehow less British or less loyal or less patriotic " .
Shadow justice secretary Nick Herbert said people would see straight through " synthetic patriotism " and that it was " profoundly un - British " to make them swear oaths of allegiance .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said taking an active role in society was a better way of creating a sense of belonging for teenagers than asking people to swear allegiance .
Bank holiday
Citizenship ceremonies already exist for immigrants and the report suggests holding them in schools , where youngsters who are about to leave the school and move on to work or further education could participate .
HAVE YOUR SAY
What about swearing allegiance to the country instead of the Queen ?
JP , London
Lord Goldsmith says a new British national day should be established by 2012 to coincide with the Olympics and what will be the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee .
It could operate in the same way as Australia Day , which is a public holiday on 26 January and is used to celebrate what it means to be an Australian .
And young people who volunteer could receive a reduction in tuition fees , while others who work in the community could be given a small council tax rebate .
A new " Deliberation Day " would be held before each General Election to encourage political debate and other events .
The peer also proposed that ministers should consider withdrawing Commonwealth and Irish citizens ' right to vote in UK elections .
Is it really un-British to celebrate Britishness ?

But campaign group Unlock Democracy described this as a " gross insult to expect soldiers to die for this country while removing their right to have a say " .
Lord Goldsmith has called for Britain 's old treason laws to be scrapped or reformed .
At the moment they include sleeping with the wife of the heir to the throne , which is punishable by life in prison .
The peer has also hinted at updating the national anthem by removing verses which are rarely performed .

Opinion
Rory Kennedy :
Two fine choices , one clear decision - Obama
Last Monday , I was very moved to see my uncle , Sen. Edward Kennedy , and my cousin , Caroline Kennedy , publicly endorse Sen. Barack Obama .
I thought their statements of support were brave , intelligent and responsible .
Given the importance of this election , and the remarkable strength of our candidates , it 's not an easy decision for anyone looking to cast a vote for a new direction in this country .
Sen . Hillary Clinton is a truly remarkable leader .
She has given an enormous amount to our country as a public servant and to my family as a friend .
Not only does she stand ready to be president , but she would be the first woman to hold the highest office in the land .
All that makes her very appealing .
As a woman , a mother , and feminist , I can fully appreciate the symbolic power of a woman in the Oval Office .
I have dedicated my life to making documentaries , many of which focus on women 's issues .
I would love to have my daughters see a female president in our lifetimes .
And still , that is not enough of a reason for me to vote for Senator Clinton .
I empathize with Senator Clinton .
In her run for president , she has been forced to walk a difficult line .
She is scrutinized not only for her political positions , but also for her clothing , hair and make - up .
When she is tough , she is called cold , when she is emotional , she is labeled weak .
It ca n't be easy .
I have an enormous amount of respect for the way she has handled this near - impossible balancing act .
And still , that is not enough of a reason for me to vote for her .
I am concerned about women getting equal pay for equal work and breaking through the glass ceiling .
I care about policies regarding health and education , issues that affect me personally .
I have no doubt of Senator Clinton 's commitment to these issues .
And still , that is not enough of a reason for me to vote for her .
Times are far too dark , the price of failure too steep and the road ahead too perilous for us to vote on identity politics .
I would love to see a woman be president .
I would love to see an African American be president .
But right now , what I would love most is to elect the best person for the job .
I believe that person is Sen. Barack Obama .
As a leader , he has inspired generations of Americans to look beyond reductive categories like gender or race .
Instead , he calls on us to think past our own individual interests , to envision a world that is better for every person in it .
Like Senator Clinton , I have no doubt of Senator Obama 's commitment to the issues I care about .
But , his unique ability to unify this country and transcend partisan gridlock means that we can finally get something done .
In my years making documentaries , I have traveled to remote regions , from small villages in South America , to townships in South Africa , to the hollows of Appalachia .
Every trip , every film , I meet people who still keep photographs of my family on their walls .
They cry when they meet me , simply because they were touched by my father , Robert Kennedy .
In part , this is because my father supported policies and legislation that helped the disenfranchised .
But it is also , and perhaps more importantly , because they felt that my father understood their pain .
Senator Obama has that quality too .
He has an open heart and an energizing spirit .
Recently , my mother , Ethel Kennedy , said of Obama : " I think he feels it .
He feels it just like Bobby did .
He has the passion in his heart .
He 's not selling you .
It 's just him . "
I agree .
Obama is a genuine leader .
We Americans - women included - desperately need that kind of leader now .
Not a president of a particular gender or a specific race , but a president with a different vision , one who inspires a sense of hope .
To elect Barack Obama is to choose a new direction , set a new course - to steer America toward a better place , better for women as well as men , better for us all .

Despite the name of the game , when John Conway developed the system he called Life he was n't aiming to simulate life at all .
All the same , the game 's lifelike nature , with its endless complexities and unpredictabilities , has captured imaginations all over the world .
Conway 's original aim was entirely mathematical - he was trying to find a so - called universal system , that is , a system capable of carrying out arbitrary computations - a sort of infinitely programmable computer .
In the 1950 's von Neumann , a pioneer in the field of cellular automata , succeeded in inventing a universal system .
His system involved cellular automata on a two - dimensional plane , with the state of each cell at time t+1 depending only on the state of its neighbours at time t. Von Neumann 's system was incredibly complicated - requiring 29 states - as a consequence of how he had derived the system .
Conway describes the process von Neumann used to develop this complicated system thus : " If he wanted a certain ability , like the ability to transmit messages , he added a few more states and gave himself that ability .
And if he wanted something else , he added a few more and so he got to 29 states .
And the appendix to his paper is a big long list of transition tables ... it 's a real mess ! "
By contrast , Conway 's aim was to find a " spectacularly simple " universal system .
Rather than explicitly forcing his system to behave in desired ways - the approach of von Neumann - he believed that the best approach was to pick a system with suitable - looking behaviour , live with it and , over time , learn how to program it to do arbitrary computations .
Is it Universal ?
" For instance , take a whole lot of bits of electronics and connect them together at random in a warehouse .
Then probably you have got a universal computing machine , " Conway says .
It 's just a matter of living with the system and learning how it works .
" You might press a button here and you notice that a little red light comes on , and then you try and understand how these buttons correspond to these things and discover a way of adding two numbers .
You press this button 5 times and then you do something else , and then you press it 8 times , and detect that the answer is 13 .
And , if the warehouse is big enough , and if the behaviour is interesting enough , you gradually learn how to use little bits of it to do whatever you like .
So that 's the dream .
And the question now is how small can you make the warehouse , how simple can you make the connections ? "
Rules to live by ...
Life is played on a grid of squares where each cell is either alive ( occupied ) or dead ( empty ) .
You start with an initial configuration of live cells , and the game progresses through generations as the life and death rules are applied .
A live cell survives to the next generation if it has two or three neighbours .
A live cell dies if it has four or more neighbours ( overcrowding ) or if it has only one neighbour or none ( isolation ) .
A dead cell becomes a live cell in the next generation if it has exactly three neighbours ( birth ) .
Life is not as simple as Conway had hoped , but is , he says , " a sort of pleasant failure " .
In one way von Neumann 's system was simpler , as the state of a cell only depended on itself and its four crosswise neighbours , whereas Life involves all eight neighbours .
Ideally , Conway was looking for a system that was " astonishingly simple " , one that only involved one dimension - cellular automata in a line rather than in a plane .
With a two - dimensional system " you have to hold the state of position ( x , y ) at time t .
It would be much better if we could reduce the complexity of the space we are operating in " , he says .
The hardest step turned out to be finding a suitable two - dimensional system to study .
Although such systems operate on an infinite plane , studying them involves observing some limited finite section of the plane .
Conway 's research group used
Go boards to develop Life , and in order to be able to study a system it was necessary that populations did not tend to explode and race off the board .
This meant they had to impose some sort of death rule on the system .
And of course a system would have to have sufficiently interesting behaviour in order to have any chance of being a universal system , so it was equally important that populations did not usually die out ; hence , the birth rule .
" We played with all sorts of rules , studying their effects , and seeing what happened " Conway says .
" Either things tended to explode in population tremendously , or else they tended to die off .
So it became this question , how can you adjust the relative strengths of the birth and death rules so [ that for a typical population ] there is a fair probability that they wo n't die off , and that it does n't grow linearly either . "
The real difficulty in finding a suitable system was finding the right relative strengths of these rules in order for the system to be both interesting enough to study and stable enough to live with .
Gliders walking across the plane
Over two years of tea and coffee breaks Conway and a group of graduate students and colleagues experimented with the life and death rules .
And when they arrived at the set of rules that became Life , they quickly stopped tinkering .
Living with this system soon revealed the presence of configurations they decided to call " gliders " - configurations that " walked " across the plane - which was an early sign of success , because , in order to prove universality and show a system is capable of arbitrary computations , it is necessary to have some way to transmit information across the plane from one configuration to another .
" When this system turned up , we totally stopped experimenting with any other rules because it was clear that this should work .
It behaved in exactly the sort of way that we wanted , and we started trying to prove that it worked " Conway says .
In a matter of weeks the group had built nearly all the necessary configurations for arbitrary computations : AND gates , OR gates , and so on , just like the components of an ordinary computer .
However , the one thing still missing was an initial source of gliders , which they called a " glider gun " .
At this point " I sort of advertised for it " , says Conway .
He wrote to Martin Gardner suggesting Life for his Mathematical Games column in the Scientific American and a prize of $ 50 was offered for a configuration whose population tended towards infinity .
The column sparked the public 's imagination and very quickly a glider gun was discovered by a group at MIT led by R.W. Gosper .
Within two weeks of the discovery of the glider gun , both Conway 's group and the group at MIT showed that the system was universal , and " it was a great success story " .
Life has stimulated a huge amount of public interest ever since it was first publicised in Gardner 's column .
The US military at one point estimated that millions of dollars worth of computing time had been " wasted " looking at the Life game , and it still continues to be played today .
Conway is pleased that Life interests the public .
" I 'm always trying to sell mathematics to the general public , to turn them on " he says .
And perhaps it was lucky that Conway developed a two - dimensional system rather than a linear one , as it is watching Life playing out in the plane that people relate to .
It is the lifelike nature of the game that captures people 's attention , and although imitating life was n't really the goal , in a way , finding artificial life was .
" I believe that if you have a large enough configuration you will see evolution in the plane , " says Conway .
" What would happen is every now and then there would be a creature capable of reproducing itself and then they would start to populate the plane .
Except the plane is still filled with random junk which might kill some of them .
So some of them will be better equipped to survive than others and every now and then they will run into something that hurts and might start a change .
Most of these changes will probably be for the worse but every now and then one of these might be for the better and then you know the story .
You will probably get evolution happening and you would get creatures that really deserve the name living . "
He can even imagine that if Life was left to play for a very long time , these creatures might eventually achieve consciousness .
Although the rules are reminiscent of those found in real life , Conway 's intention was not to mimic life as we know it .
" Many people have produced things of this kind that are closer to real life , such as one with DNA strings in the model .
That 's counter to my philosophy as it copies the reproductive mechanism that we have .
My philosophy is to start with nothing and see if it has its own reproductive mechanism .
" Because I am really not interested in a way in what makes us tick .
I have always had this idea that it 's rather parochial to be too interested in us .
What happens when we meet the Martians , by that I mean somebody out there , another form of intelligent life ?
There is no obvious reason why they are going to use DNA for their method of storing information , reproducing and so on .
They probably have a totally different system .
" I feel that the abstract mathematical things that I am interested in are probably closer to the ones the Martians are interested in .
The non-mathematical things that I am interested in , I am very interested in the English language , well , the Martians are n't going to know anything about the English language .
And I have been interested in girls ( laughs ) , well , they 're not going to be interested in girls , well , in my type of girls !
But I think we probably do have some common interests - the common interests are the mathematical ones " .
The universal language of mathematics
Although Conway believes that the Martians will also be interested in physics , as we share the same physical universe , the advantage of mathematics is that it does not require expensive equipment to make discoveries .
The mind alone is all that is required to study mathematics , and as Conway says , he can " interrogate the abstract universe from an armchair , bath or bed ! "
And , more than this , the mathematical universe is not just parochial to him .
" Though I can sit alone and interrogate that abstract universe , it is not just my universe .
It is my colleagues ' universe as well .
There is a certain stability about it , and I actually believe it is the Martians ' abstract universe as well .
" I have always been interested in the abstract world .
And the reason is that I do n't understand why it 's there .
I do n't understand why theorems do n't change .
We can still prove Pythagoras 's theorem , it 's still there 2,000 years after it was found . "
Conway does n't take even the concept of logic for granted .
Although he works with logic and proofs every day as a mathematician , he questions whether our axioms of logic are fundamental .
" I will be very interested to know what the Martians think , " he says .
" Do they actually think in the same way as we do ?
Will their logic be the same ? "
The achievement Conway is proudest of is his discovery of a new kind of numbers , the surreal numbers , and it gives him pleasure to think that they will remain in this abstract universe for millennia , just like the theorems of Pythagoras ( Donald Knuth wrote an excellent introduction to surreal numbers in the form of a short story - Surreal Numbers : How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness ) .
He discovered the surreal numbers after watching the British Go champion playing in the mathematics department at Cambridge .
" I noticed that in Go , near the end of a game it tended to break up as a sum [ of games ] .
That 's why I thought I might understand Go a bit better if I developed that theory . "
Conway went away and did just that and " discovered that some positions behaved like numbers .
And then I discovered even more , that if you were playing infinite games , some positions behaved like a new kind of number !
And that 's how I discovered the surreal numbers . "
Playing Go. Picture used courtesy of http://gobase.org/
In a way , Conway 's discovery of the surreals parallels the development of Life .
He was studying a random system , and as he lived with it he discovered a surprising world .
" It has always been a bit of a miracle to me .
I started off with the game of Go , and ended up with the surreal numbers , which is a hugely infinite world .
" I think that the Martians have also discovered the surreal numbers somewhere , perhaps not in this galaxy ...
In that case we would have achieved some sort of intellectual connection .
[ The alien mathematician would be ] the Martian John Conway ! " he says .
Such a connection would add real value to the abstract mathematical universe by proving it existed independently from humans .
Then again , Conway understands that his whole concept of the shared abstract universe might be wrong .
The whole question of mathematical existence , he says " drives me nuts !
Maybe the Martians do n't have the same notion of mathematical existence as we do , but whatever it is , it will be very interesting ! "

BROOKLIN , Canada , Mar 11 , 2008 ( IPS )
A coalition of environmental groups sued the George W. Bush administration Monday for delaying a decision to protect polar bears threatened with extinction due to the melting ice in its Arctic habitat .
Polar bears could be the first species officially threatened by climate change .
The huge loss of summer sea ice in 2007 has caused many scientists to project that the Arctic could be ice - free in summer by as soon as 2012 .
Although excellent swimmers , polar bears are not very good at catching seals in the water .
Seals comprise the main diet for these giant bears , which are far larger than their grizzly bear cousins .
While legally required to make a decision Jan. 9 , US Fish and Wildlife ( U.S. FWS ) officials have been silent .
Meanwhile on Feb. 6 , 2.6 billion dollars in oil and gas leases were auctioned off to energy companies on nearly 30 million acres of prime polar bear habitat in the Alaska ’s Chukchi Sea .
This independent environmental journalism depends on public support .

“ Coincidence ?
I doubt it , but I do n’t have the smoking gun to prove it , ” said Kassie Siegel of the Centre for Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , an environmental non-governmental organisation based in Joshua Tree , California .
The CBD , along with Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defence Council , filed the suit for missing the legal deadline for issuing a final decision on whether to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act due to global warming .
“ There was absolutely no urgency to hold that lease sale and plenty of public opposition to it as well , ” Siegel told IPS .
Had U.S. FWS listed polar bears as threatened on Jan. 9 , then the Chukchi Sea lease sale could not have gone ahead without some studies to assess the potential impacts on polar bears , she said .
Should the polar bears be listed as threatened in the near future then the U.S. government has an obligation to protect their habitat and that might mean having to buy back the Chukchi leases from the energy companies , and at a premium price .
The Centre for Biological Diversity has also filed a lawsuit over the lease sale but that could still mean U.S. taxpayers would have to pay the energy companies for those leases , says Siegel .
These lawsuits , which first commenced in 2005 , have much more to do with climate change than protecting polar bears , the environmental groups acknowledge .
It ’s a roundabout way of getting the U.S. government to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
If polar bears are threatened by climate change , then U.S. federal agencies are obligated under the Endangered Species Act to reduce their emissions of the climate altering gases .
“ It ’s no substitute for a federal cap on emissions , but it ’s something , ” Siegel said .
“ We ’re not going to magically reduce our emissions with a snap of our fingers .
We need many solutions . ”
Although the Arctic region is being transformed by climate change that will only worsen , there is intense opposition to listing polar bears as threatened in Alaska by many native peoples in Canada .
U.S. trophy hunting of polar bears is a 2 - million - dollar a year business for the Arctic region of Nunavut in northwest Canada .
Canada is home to 60 percent of the world ’s estimated 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears .
Nearly hunted to extinction in the 1970s , polar bear populations have rebounded thanks to strict hunting quotas .
However , recent studies of some polar bear groups over the vast Arctic region show poor survival rates for cubs and adults that are much lighter in weight than in the past .
That ’s not the case for the bears in parts of Nunavut , according to Government of Nunavut ’s wildlife officials .
Davis Strait , one of their southern - most roaming grounds , is “ crawling with polar bears ” , Mitchell Taylor , director of wildlife research , told the Nunatsiaq News last fall .
By Taylor ’s estimates , there may be 1,500 more bears in the region than previous counts .
However , the greatest Arctic ice losses have been mostly confined to the western Arctic , not the southern region as commonly supposed .
And that ’s the area where the bears have been hit hardest – the Beaufort Sea and the Western Hudson Bay populations , according to Andrew Derocher of the University of Alberta , and head of the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Polar Bear Specialist Group .
Monitoring a few thousand white bears on white snow and ice over an area twice the size of the continental U.S. is challenging to say the least .
Derocher has told IPS in previous interviews that experts do not have good data on some of the bear populations .
However , what satellite pictures make very clear is that the ice in the region is deteriorating and very quickly , he said .
That loss of ice will affect the bears , and whether they can adapt to the fast changing conditions by finding different food sources is an open question .
It could be argued that opening up their territory to oil and gas drilling may be a more direct and immediate threat than climate change .
According to environmentalists , the U.S. government has received approximately 670,000 comments in support of protecting the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act , including letters from eminent polar bear experts , climate scientists , and more than 60 members of Congress .
“ If the federal government is really serious about protecting the polar bear , then its next steps will be to cancel lease sales in the Chukchi Sea and immediately implement a plan for deep cuts in U.S. global warming pollution , ” said Kert Davies , research director at Greenpeace USA , in a statement .

Definition rotonym [ ro - tuh - nim ] noun a word , that when all letters are rotated by half of the language 's alphabet , becomes another word in its language .
Origin : 2007 ; rot- rot- + - ōnym - -onym
What are ' rotonyms ' ?
While playing with the weak cipher known as ROT13 , I decided to check whether any words would ROT13 into other words .
I wrote a simple script to cipher a dictionary file , then compared it against itself to look for matches .
To my delight , I had found some solid results .
Some of the resultant pairs even relate to each other in other ways .
I decided this effect was worth naming , and coined ' rotonym ' to describe them .
What is ROT13 ?
ROT13 is the process of rotating all the letters in a given text by 13 letters , exactly half of the english language alphabet .
It is a simple letter substituion cipher which is an example of a Ceasar cipher , originally developed in ancient Rome .
ROT13 is its own inverse , that is , when this process is repeated the original text is restored .
Below is a list of letters , with their ROT13 counterparts .

Could Rupert Murdoch be Yahoo Inc.'s white knight ?
Despite the media mogul ’s claims that he is n’t interested in the Internet company , Murdoch ’s News Corp. is working on a deal to merge MySpace and the rest of its Web business with Yahoo , according to people familiar with the talks .
Yahoo is furiously seeking alternatives to Microsoft Corp .'s unsolicited takeover offer .
As part of the deal being discussed , Yahoo would give News Corp. a 20 % stake in exchange for its Internet properties and a cash infusion that values Yahoo at about $ 50 billion , well above its $ 42 - billion market valuation Wednesday .
The two companies declined to comment .

Wall Street is n’t giving much credence to this or other alternatives explored by Yahoo ’s board , such as a merger with Time Warner Inc . 's AOL .
Among other problems , analysts said , was that such deals would fail to help Yahoo catch up to Google Inc. in Web search or alleviate investor frustration with Yahoo ’s management .
Analysts said Yahoo was courting interest from other suitors in large part to force Microsoft to sweeten its Jan. 31 offer , which was worth $ 44.6 billion but has since fallen with Microsoft ’s stock price .
Yahoo ’s board of directors met Wednesday to discuss its options , a person close to management said .
The Sunnyvale , Calif . - based company then released a letter to shareholders explaining why it had rejected Microsoft ’s bid on Monday , reiterating that the deal “ substantially undervalues ” the company .
“ We remain committed to pursuing initiatives that maximize value for all our stockholders , ” Chief Executive Jerry Yang wrote .

A Microsoft spokesman said the Redmond , Wash .- based company had made a “ full and fair ” offer .
Microsoft has said it would “ pursue all necessary steps ” to clinch a deal , including taking the bid directly to shareholders .
The News Corp. talks began shortly after Microsoft announced its bid .
Under the plan being discussed , Yang and President Sue Decker would run the combined company , which would include Yahoo , MySpace and other Web properties owned by News Corp . 's Fox Interactive Media , a person familiar with the discussions said .
Yahoo also would receive a cash infusion from an unidentified private equity fund to pay a one - time dividend to shareholders .
One likely candidate is Providence Equity Partners , the private equity firm that invested in News Corp. and NBC Universal ’s online video joint venture , Hulu .
A representative for Providence could not be reached for comment .
The deal would help News Corp. and Yahoo battle Google ’s growing dominance -- and deprive Microsoft of its best shot at catching up .

A News Corp. alliance is favored by Yahoo ’s senior executives , including Yang , who wants the company to remain independent , according to people close to him .
The combined company would have a major presence on the Internet and be a force in display advertising .
In addition to MySpace , Fox Interactive Media runs IGN Entertainment for video game players , FoxSports.com , Rotten Tomatoes , a website for movie buffs , and AmericanIdol.com .
Yahoo and MySpace together would reach 122.3 million Internet users , or 75 % of people online , according to Nielsen Online .
That would surpass Google , which attracted 117.8 million people in January .
“ The Microsoft - Yahoo acquisition will , if integrated correctly , result in an audience , search and advertising powerhouse that is capable of giving Google a run for its money , ” said Dan Cohen , a former Yahoo executive who is now CEO of Pageflakes .

Analysts say a Microsoft buyout still holds more appeal for shareholders .
They expect Microsoft to raise its $ 31 - a- share bid to the mid-30s .
“ I would n’t doubt they are having discussions , but I am not sure it amounts to an alternative that ’s as attractive to Yahoo shareholders as even the existing Microsoft bid , and certainly not a sweetened bid , ” Stanford Group analyst Clayton Moran said .
Moran also said MySpace ’s advertising partnership with Google would be a “ complicating ” factor to such a deal .
News Corp. had talked with Yahoo last summer about swapping MySpace , the top social - networking site , for a one - quarter stake in the combined company .
Talks fell apart over the valuation of MySpace , which News Corp. is now pushing to be valued at $ 6 billion to $ 10 billion , one person said .

During a Feb. 4 conference call with analysts to discuss News Corp. earnings , Murdoch characterized the talks as loose discussions that ended with the resignation of former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel .
He also dismissed the possibility of getting into a fight with Microsoft , saying New York - based News Corp. was “ definitely not going to make a bid for Yahoo . ”
In fact , a News Corp. team had been working furiously on a rival proposal since the day before the conference call , on Super Bowl Sunday , according to a media - industry executive familiar with the matter .
“ They actually all missed the Super Bowl , ” the executive said .
“ They were all called back from their homes to the office to prepare for a Monday meeting with Rupert . ”

Yahoo gained 31 cents to $ 29.88 , Microsoft rose 62 cents to $ 28.96 and News Corp. fell 10 cents to $ 19.93 .
News Corp .'s discussions with Yahoo were first reported this week by blogs , including Silicon Alley Insider and TechCrunch .
One of Yahoo’s other options , an alliance with Mountain View , Calif . - based Google in Web search , seems to be a fading possibility .
Such a deal probably would get tough scrutiny from antitrust regulators .
A Google spokesman declined to comment .

Guynn reported from San Francisco and Chmielewski from Costa Mesa .
Washington
DEMOCRATS made earmark reform a campaign issue in 2006 — and a reality in 2007 — because earmarks were at the heart of corruption scandals in Washington .
Democrats never promised to eliminate earmarks .
We promised to reform them .
Putting all earmarks in the same boat , as critics often do , distorts the debate and does a disservice to the public .
Not all earmarks are equal .
For six years , some members of Congress provided secret earmarks for lobbyists in exchange for campaign contributions , foreign trips and , in some cases , outright bribes .
The core of the problem was that the earmarks were hidden from the press and the public .
There was no opportunity to review either their sponsorship or their merit before their passage .
The new Democratic Congress now requires that each earmark be fully described and its sponsor identified .
Members of Congress who sponsor earmarks must certify that they have no personal financial interest in them .
Any private entity that might benefit must be clearly reported .
Each of these reforms is now mandatory , in stark contrast to previous practices .
In addition , we cut the amount of spending on earmarks in half .
In 1994 , Congress approved 4,126 earmarks ; by 2005 , the number increased to 15,877 .
SPIEGEL Interview with Chinese Artist Ai WeiWei ' The Olympics Are a Propaganda Show '
SPIEGEL speaks with Beijing - based artist and Olympics critic Ai Weiwei , 50 , about the attempts by the Chinese leadership to exploit the Olympics for their own purposes .
One of the Big Four labels is apparently unhappy with its return on investment when it comes to funding industry trade groups such as the IFPI and RIAA .
British label EMI , which was recently purchased by a private equity fund , is reportedly considering a significant cut to the amount of money it provides the trade groups on an annual basis .
According to figures seen by Reuters , each of the Big Four contributes approximately $ 132.3 million to fund the operations of the IFPI , RIAA , and other national recording industry trade groups .
That money is used in part to fund the industry 's antipiracy efforts — including the close to 30,000 file - sharing lawsuits filed by the record labels in the US alone .
The IFPI confirmed to Reuters that it was working through its annual budget - setting process , and " as one would expect in this market , there is a focus on efficiencies and savings . "
The IFPI would n't provide any details beyond that to Reuters , and neither it nor the RIAA has responded to Ars Technica 's requests for comment .
With music revenues dropping with no end in sight , despite the increased popularity of online sales , all of the Big Four labels are being faced with tough budget choices .
The industry has been quick to lay the blame for its tough economic times squarely at the feet of pirates , but there are other factors at work too .
The industry 's glacial adaptation to changing consumer expectations around how and where they listen to music has done a lot to hurt the labels , and consumers are less willing to buy CDs now that they can cherry pick their favorite tracks from the iTunes Store .
Even retailers are crying out for an end to DRM .
Giving the music industry credit where credit is due , the labels have made some progress in the past year , especially when it comes to realizing how much consumers detest DRM .
But one of the chief activities of the RIAA is coordinating the Big Four labels ' legal campaign , and those thousands of lawsuits have done nothing but generate ill will from record fans , while costing the labels millions of dollars and doing little ( if anything ) to actually reduce the amount of file - sharing going on .
In fact , the RIAA freely admits that the legal campaign is a real money pit , and EMI 's new ownership may be very leery of continuing to pour money down that particular rat hole .
Should the other labels follow suit — and there 's no indication that they will — it would , at the very least , force the RIAA to reexamine its commitment to its legal strategy .
This wordthink originally appeared in the Escapist .
It ’s an exercise in tackling the graphics vs narrative argument , which perhaps occasionally lapses into cliche .
As you ’ll see as you read through , I do n’t necessarily agree with all my arguments – it was written in an attempt to create a thesis which would generate opposing antitheses .
Together , we can reach synthesis .
Discuss .
A Word Is Worth A Thousand Pictures
“ It is a curious characteristic of our modern civilization that , whereas we are prepared to devote untold physical and mental resources to reaching out into the furthest reaches of the galaxy , or to delve into the most delicate mysteries of the atom … one of the greatest and most important mysteries is lying so close beneath our noses that we scarcely even recognize it to be a mystery at all .
At any given moment … hundreds of millions of people will be engaged [ in ] one of those strange sequences of mental images which we call a story . ” – Christopher Booker , The Seven Basic Plots
Narrative is our link to the universe .
Visceral immediacy is sold to us as a reminder that we are “ alive . ”
It is stimulation , a release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla , increasing heart rate , dilating pupils , elevating blood sugar levels .
It ’s a deception – a brief , drug - induced elevation above the norm .
Story is the narration of our truth .
Visit a videogame developer while they ’re working on a project , and you can be certain to hear about one thing – graphics .
“ We ’re implementing the very latest four - dimensional bloom lighting techniques so every light bulb in the game will glow over 47 % more , in the past , and the future ! ”
“ With the state - of - the - art bump - map particle physics engine we ’ve spent 95 % of our budget on , our characters are able to have 10,010 polygons , trouncing the mere 10,000 in our previous game ! ”
“ Look !
Look at the shiny objects !
See how they glint and turn !
Looooook .
Loooooooook at the shiiiiiiiiny .
Stare deeeeeeeep into the pretty lights … ”
This ridiculous race for incremental steps toward photo - realism is a self - perpetuating tail - chasing exercise .
Publishers will not support a project that does n’t implement the latest technology , developers live in abject fear of not including the decorative features of their rivals and gamers all too eagerly buy into the whole charade .
We have sold ourselves the lie that graphics matter , and it ’s looking increasingly unlikely that we ’ll ever manage to untangle ourselves from it .
This is n’t denial .
The opening levels of Far Cry were a thing of wonder , as my PC was suddenly generating pictures that were , as daft as this sounds , prettier than real life .
I called friends over to my house to see it .
We stared in awe .
It was beautiful .
Of course , once the game shifted to indoor locations , and the wonderful island vistas became rarer , my interest wandered .
Far Cry did n’t have anything to say .
Christopher Booker , in his seminal tome , The Seven Basic Plots , dedicated 30 years to studying the structure of Story , its key proponents and , ultimately , its power .
“ The more familiar we become with the nature of [ the ] shaping forms and forces lying beneath the surface of stories , pushing them into patterns and directions which are beyond the storyteller ’s conscious control , the more we find that we are entering a realm to which recognition of the plots themselves proves only to have been the gateway .
We are in fact uncovering nothing less than a kind of hidden , universal language . ”
Our visual fixations deny this truth , and prevent our recognition of the significance of games that pass through this gateway .
Jim Rossignol wrote in an essay describing the philosopher Rorty ’s interpretation of this consciousness .
“ He argues that human beings deal with the world through a ‘ final vocabulary . ’
This , like a box of tools , is the set of methods we have appropriated for interpreting and reinterpreting the world around us .
Our public final vocabulary is the set of ideas and sentences that we use to deal with people and their own ideas . ”
I contend that the power of a vocabulary , in the context of a game ’s narrative , is so great , it overwhelms graphics .
We connect by hearing others ’ “ final vocabularies ” and incorporating them into our own – increasing and developing our perceptions , building upon our interpretive vocabulary .
Graphics provide spectacle , they can draw us in and they can certainly be the means by which a narrative is delivered .
But they are only the messenger .
There has to be a message .
The question I have is whether the messenger is ultimately all that important .
To demonstrate , an anecdote :
A few years back I was reviewing the point and click adventure game , Ankh , for a U.K. magazine .
In many ways , it was traditional , clearly inspired by the adventure ’s heyday in the 1990s .
While playing , I began to notice a number of similarities with the classic LucasArts adventure , The Secret of Monkey Island , and decided to go back and play to see if my 15 - year - old memories were accurate .
Running through SCUMMVM , I was able to whirr up an ancient copy of the game on my super - fly modern PC , capable of all those mapped bumps and blooming lights , and it blinked into bleeping , chunky existence .
The tiniest palette and the fewest pixels painted crude backdrops and even cruder characters , barely animated as they slid sideways about the 2 - D world .
Compare and contrast with Ankh , a sweet game of no great import , that managed to keep the common sense of point and click in line with the modernity of a third dimension , animated in tens of thousands of shades and polygons into convincing , cartoon existence .
There was no contest .
And so it was , until I spent the better part of an hour trying to find the jail cell in Ankh ’s ancient Egyptian streets .
I knew what it looked like , the shape of the room – I would go down the stairs at the right , give the object I ’d just found to the prisoner and he ’d help me .
I just could n’t find it , no matter how hard I searched .
The moment of realization was first embarrassing , but then apocalyptic .
The truth was revealed .
I saw the light .
And it was n’t bump mapped .
My mental image of Monkey Island ’s jail was every bit as sophisticated as the textured surfaces before me .
In fact , it had to be about ten minutes into playing Monkey Island that I ’d stopped noticing the graphics at all .
Even now , two months later , as I write I still picture the cell in the same way .
I went back there in Monkey Island and saw its reality , but it was n’t enough to replace the elaborated version my own engine developed .
Imagine the person who sits and reads a book , looks up in horror , and shouts , “ This word ‘ tree ’ looks nothing like a tree !
It looks like some letters on a piece of paper ! ” and throws the book at the wall , disgusted .
He ’s either a fool or reading a Dan Brown novel .
We simply do n’t work that way .
The semiotic power of a word is enough for our beautiful minds to conjure the very best tree imaginable .
Literally .
We have excellent brains that will always be capable of better graphics than the most exceptional technology ( until The Future , obviously , when we ’ll plug our brains into the machines and then just spend the whole time playing Space Minesweeper in Extra- Realism Graphics 5.6 ) .
What powers these mental chips is narrative .
Graphics are hugely significant to many people – that ca n’t be ignored .
Find the review of a crappy game that does n’t give it a good kick in the pixels .
Bad graphics do tend to be a sign of a lack of care in production .
But I challenge you to find the review that says , “ This game would be excellent and worth your time , if only the graphics were better .
But since they ’re so poor , do n’t bother . ”
It does n’t happen .
If every other factor of a “ good ” game is present , the poverty of the pictures will be forgiven , although perhaps mentioned .
We do n’t need them – we ’ve already got them fixed upstairs .
But do n’t believe my witterings .
What about games as mindless action ?
Why would narrative be of any importance if all I wanted to do was run into a room filled with monsters and pummel them with bullets ?
To this I say , take on the Old Graphics Challenge .
Dig out a favorite single player shooter of five or so years ago that specifically did n’t use a strong narrative .
So no , you ca n’t have Half - Life .
And indeed , you ’re a thousand miles from being allowed to reinstall Deus Ex .
Put it on , and see how long you stay playing .
Now find yourself a favorite five - year - old RPG .
Heck , go mad , go back ten years and play Baldur ’s Gate .
You ’ll wander around Candlekeep for a bit , frustrated by the 640×480 resolution and your inability to zoom in and out .
But you ’ll chat with everyone , you ’ll complete those first few tasks and then it will be time to be off with Gorion .
But oh no !
He ’s been killed by those bastards !
What ’s this ?
Imoen wants to join you .
It ’s just the two of you , now , and the world to explore , villages to visit , people to talk to , quests to complete …
And you stopped noticing the graphics somewhere back in Candlekeep .
Oh , come on , ten years is nothing .
Go for fifteen !
Install Sam & Max , Day of the Tentacle , seventeen to boot up Monkey Island .
Wait , I ’ll raise you :
Twenty years !
Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders .
Sixteen colors and one of them ’s magenta .
Start a timer to see how long you care – it wo n’t do any good , because you ’ll forget to look at it as much as you ’ll forget you ’re not dressed from head to foot in a virtual reality outfit , walking among the space aliens .
And now , do the same with an twenty - year - old , story - less shooter .
( Ok , they do n’t exist , fair enough ) .
There ’s a mistake above , and I ’ll recognize it .
This is an argument riddled with holes , and I ’m happy with that – I believe there ’s a core truth that needs to be heard .
I rather pathetically put in “ single player shooter . ”
Multiplayer defeats me .
If you want a five - plus - year - old game entirely free from narrative , you ’ve got Quake III : Arena and others beside .
They are every bit as joyful to play today .
Curse them , because my point remains important – despite these exceptions , the most important aspect is still missing from the majority of our games .
Perhaps it is all our fault .
Perhaps we , en masse , really are so addled that our attention spans are genuinely transitory , only interested in that adrenal high for so long as it lasts , then ready to chase the next fix .
Perhaps the three hours of interest Far Cry offers is all we desire and all we deserve .
But this can not be true .
Look at the MMO , a peculiar pile - up of meta- narrative and micro-narrative , sewn together by no narrative at all .
You have to spend hundreds of hours to get anywhere , and millions of people are doing so worldwide .
There ’s a hunger out there for more than graphics – people are looking for that narrative , looking for a shared , cooperative vocabulary .
Story has always focused on the Hero , from Beowulf onward .
Gaming taps into this understanding , and lets us be that Hero .
But , once you remove the Story , the Hero withers and fades .
Booker ’s weighty work concludes in a similar mind .
“ The hero or heroine is he or she who is born to inherit ; who is worthy to succeed ; who must grow up as fit to take on the torch of life from those who went before .
Such is the essence of the task laid on each of us as we come into this world .
That is what stories are trying to tell us . ”
We ’re willing to code images of the furthest reaches of the galaxy , or delve into the most delicate mysteries of the atom ( thank goodness for Will Wright , allowing this bit to work with Spore ) , but I fear the greatest and most important mystery , the power of the narrative , is being grossly ignored .
ED #83 : Installing DirectX 9 Can & Will Kill DirectX 10
Recently , I reinstalled the software on our testbed for another long run of benchmarks .
Amongst those software were some DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 games .
After installing them , I realized that one of the games , BioShock did not work .
Whenever I tried loading BioShock , it would just hang with a black screen .
At first , I thought it was the new version 1.1 patch because the other DirectX 10 games I installed worked .
So I reinstalled BioShock without applying the patch .
Still no go .
It still hung when I ran it .
Once again , I did an intense search online that did n't really reveal much .
Take - Two Interactive 's support site claimed it was the driver , so I tried a different driver .
No success there either .
The Solution !
Then I discovered that they suggested reinstallating DirectX if the game crashed at a black screen after selecting the difficulty level .
Granted , my case was a little different since I did n't even manage to get to the game menu , much less select any difficulty level !
In any case , it was worth a shot .
I downloaded the DirectX 10 redistributable package ( November 2007 Build ) and gave it a whirl .
Well , well , well , what do you know ?
That did the trick !
BioShock and the upgraded BioShock 1.1 ran like a charm .
After analyzing what happened , I came to the conclusion that the recent installation of some DirectX 9 games was the cause .
Those games would install DirectX 9.0c as part of their installation process , just to ensure your PC would have the latest DirectX version installed .
By right , the reinstallation of DirectX 9.0 c should not affect DirectX 10 at all .
However , it appears that the reinstallation of DirectX 9.0 c by those games have somehow corrupted DirectX 10 in Windows Vista .
The solution was simple - reinstall DirectX 10 , but this should not have been necessary .
Microsoft should look into why installing DirectX 9.0 c corrupts DirectX 10 .
If you face the same problem , try reinstalling DirectX 10 .
You can download the latest version here .
This redistributable package does not require WGA validation to download .
Problem & Solution Confirmed !
I installed F.E.A.R. yesterday .
Coincidentally , F.E.A.R. automatically installs the included DirectX 9 redistributable during its installation process .
There was n't even the option to skip installing DirectX 9 .
So I thought , what the heck ... let 's give it a try and see if we can reproduce the problem .
Right after installing it , I gave BioShock a try and it hung at a black screen .
Fortunately , I had the solution this time .
I re-installed the DirectX 10 redistributable package and voilà !
BioShock loaded up normally .
So , there you have it - a direct cause - and - effect reproduction of the problem .
Obviously , something is wrong with the DirectX 9 redistributable package .
However , I do n't think Microsoft can do anything about this since the DirectX 9 redistributable is everywhere and has been in use for ages .
We just want to warn you about this problem so you wo n't need to scratch your head if your DirectX 10 game does not work .
It could be because you just installed a DirectX 9 game .
Try reinstalling the DirectX 10 redistributable .
Oops , We Did It Again !
We recently tried running the Cryostasis Tech Demo benchmark for the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 graphics card review but it kept crashing .
Reinstalling the benchmark and graphics driver did n't do the trick either .
We thought it might have been the hardware physics support in the game , so we turned that off too .
Unfortunately , it kept crashing .
In the end , we decided to check if DirectX 10 might perhaps be corrupt .
We no longer use F.E.A.R. as our benchmark , but we still use Supreme Commander as a RTS ( real - time strategy ) game benchmark .
As you know , Supreme Commander is a DirectX 9 game , and like all DirectX 9 games , it will re-install DirectX 9 during its installation .
This time , Microsoft has an updated DirectX 10 redistributable package ( November 2008 build ) .
We re-installed DirectX 10 and retried the Cryostasis Tech Demo .
It finally worked !
So , we have yet again confirmed that installing DirectX 9 can and will kill DirectX 10 .
If you ever have a problem playing any DirectX 10 game , do n't forget to check if you had earlier installed a DirectX 9 game .
If you did , that could be the problem .
Try reinstalling DirectX 10 .

Paypal is a safe online payment option if you know who the recipient is .
Everything is possible to manipulate in our computer world though , and we can do so with paypal as well .
A fake paypal account can be opened in a couple of hours and verified with fake documents later on .
Therefore you should not base your thrust on the fact a seller is using paypal .
A step by step method on how to open a stealth paypal account will of course not be discussed here .
This is a fraud prevention , not fraud creation website .
However , some basic information will be given out so that you know what is possible and how you can protect yourself .
A stealth paypal account without a real name and other proper personal information is not necessarily created with the sole intention of defrauding people .
Such a fake paypal account will be opened by two kinds of people :
People who are in search of loopholes , because they ca n’t use paypal for a number of different reasons .
Scammers whose sole intention is to defraud buyers .
Why Would You Need A Stealth Paypal Account ?
If you are a freelancer who is legitimately making money online or you are a buyer , one mandatory thing you need is a payment method .
One of the most popular payment methods is PayPal .
But what if you do not have access to PayPal because it is n’t available in your country or only have limited access ?
With PayPal being such a popular payment method , businesses as well as individuals , almost must have this payment option in order to exist online .
This is where , although with good intentions , one may want to search for ways on creating a fake stealth paypal account .
But the other majority of people are using fake paypal accounts to steal from people and do money laundering .
The Paypal system needs a few things from you to be able to register with them :
eMail
Personal information
Identity Confirmation
Utility Bills
Telephone Number
Bank Account or a Credit Card
Opening The Account
A fake stealth account can have any name , address or country listed as real personal information .
That is because false identities can be verified with counterfeit documents .
For those of you who already have a paypal account know how the identity procedure looks like .
First you enter a person ’s name and his corresponding address .
Then all you need to do is add a bank or a credit card .
You then wait for the expuse number which appears on the statement and enter it into paypal .
This concludes the basic verification and you can use paypal up to a certain degree .
A bank account can be opened online easily .
Some banks require only a scan of your ID to open an account with them .
These documents are quite easily obtainable on the internet .
Furthermore , you can get a fake utility bill or bank statement .
And you can use these either for opening a bank a bank account or a paypal account .
Next step is a credit or debit card .
How do you get a credit card that will verify a false identity ?
Easy and cheap !
It wo n’t cost you more than a couple bucks !
Meet virtual credit cards .
These cards can be neutral and work on any name .
Scammers took advantage of this and used cards like these to verify their false identities on paypal and many other online companies .
Sometimes you need a phone number to verify your account .
Paypal may even call their customers to verify them .
So if you would have provided a false number and be unreachable they will most likely limit your account .
A VOIP phone number can be obtained easily for any country in the world .
A VOIP takes care of that aspect of verification as well .
Et voilà !
This shows you how easy it is for scammers to open up a false verified paypal account .
And you can send and withdraw money with it as you please .
We had already some times ago Russian mafia tomb stones from Yekaterinburg , Russia .
Today the tomb stones from Dnepropetrovsk .
This city is 2000 miles away from Yekaterinburg , and actually it ’s not even in Russia , but in Ukraine .
As you can see mobsters share the same culture , and even most of the scripts are made in Russia language , without Ukrainian adaptation .
Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
It was to be the year of change , of new ideas , a new politics .
Yet , as of today , it appears the Republican Party will be led into the future by a Beltway favorite of the media and Washington insider who has spent the last quarter of a century on Capitol Hill .
And the Democratic Party appears about to build a bridge to the past by nominating the spouse of the last Democratic president who has herself been a Washington insider for almost 20 years .
With two - thirds of the nation saying the country is on the wrong course , the two parties are offering candidates both of whom played major roles in setting that course .
And neither probable nominee has advanced ideas to deal with the crises America faces , nor even shown any great awareness that the country is in crisis .
The first crisis is fiscal , with the Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid costs about to break the bank as the baby boomers reach early retirement .
Add the other entitlement programs , defense and interest on the debt , and this consumes perhaps 90 percent of the budget .
No one is proposing cuts in any major component of the budget .
Indeed , Mrs. Clinton is promising universal health care and McCain is promising an expansion of the military .
Both favor a stimulus package of roughly $ 150 billion .
As our savings rate is about zero , where are we going to borrow the money for all this ?
( Column continues below )
A second crisis is financial .
With the economy in danger of seizing up , the Fed has cut interest rates from 4.25 percent to 3 percent in two weeks .
This has sent the dollar plunging again .
A sinking dollar means surging prices for oil and all those foreign manufactures to which we are now addicted .
As the dollars pour out , nations have started to spend their dollar hoards to buy up this country at the fire - sale prices being offered in the global marketplace .
A third crisis is strategic .
With an army of half a million and a Marine Corps a third that size , we are ending our fifth year of war in Iraq and entering the seventh year in Afghanistan .
With the Taliban and al - Qaida now re-established and threatening Pakistan , what will it require in blood and treasure to prevent a strategic disaster there ?
Mrs. Clinton is committed to a withdrawal from Iraq , but McCain says we will stay 100 years if necessary and warns , “ There ’s going to be other wars . ”
But wars against whom ?
Iran ?
Pakistan ?
Russia ?
North Korea ?
With the U.S. military stretched to the breaking point and the quality of army recruits falling , who will fight these wars ?
Then there is the immigration crisis .
It is estimated that there are 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the United States today , with many hundreds of thousands being added each year .
McCain and Hillary both voted for the amnesty bill , neither is committed to sending back the illegals , and both give only grudging support to the idea of a border fence .
How do they propose stopping the scores or hundreds of millions from Latin America , Asia , Africa and the Middle East from breaking into the United States in coming decades ?
Does anyone see in either Clinton or McCain the resolve to deal with what Americans are coming to believe is a crisis of national identity and national survival ?
Then there is the crisis of the American middle class .
As economist Robert Reich writes , the real wages of working men have not risen in 30 years .
Families maintained their standard of living three ways .
Wives went to work .
The men began to work longer hours than in almost any other developed nation .
The family ’s equity in its home was then borrowed to sustain consumption .
Now , with the middle class tapped out , the home equity used up or declining , and mortgage , auto and credit card debt turning rotten , the U.S. government is going abroad to borrow 1 percent of GDP to hand out in checks in May to get consumers buying again to prevent a recession .
What kind of long - term solution is this ?
How can a government as deep in debt as this one , going deeper every day , with the Social Security - Medicare crisis looming , continue to borrow to fight wars , finance foreign aid and defend nations that refuse to make the sacrifices to defend themselves ?
America today faces both a fiscal crisis and a currency crisis .
Our dependence on foreign loans , foreign oil and foreign manufacturers is unprecedented .
We are being invaded from the south and seemingly lack the moral fiber to defend our home and throw out the intruders .
We have neither the men nor the weapons to honor all the treaty commitments and war guarantees we have given out to nations all over the world – and McCain plans to add several more .
Yet , we are consumed with the issue of whether Bill Clinton , by comparing Barack Obama to Jesse Jackson , was playing “ the race card . ”
We are an unserious people in a serious time .
Boston ( TGW ) – Researchers at MIT are working on a prototype of a lightweight , stackable , foldable , electric car .
The City Car would solve many problems at once : congestion , pollution , and energy use , is about the size of a golf car , and would be shared by many users .
Hundreds could be stacked around a city and " you would just go and swipe your ( credit ) card and take the first one available and drive away , " said Franco Vairani , designer of the vehicle 's foldable frame .
Team leader Bill Mitchell predicted that the car would hit the production line within four years .

To find out if danger makes people experience time in slow motion , David Eagleman and colleagues sent volunteers tumbling down on a free - fall from great heights :
To see if danger makes people experience time in slow motion , scientists at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston tried scaring volunteers .
However , roller coasters and other frightening amusement park rides did not cause enough fear to make time warp .
Instead , the researchers dropped volunteers from great heights .
Scientists had volunteers dive backward with no ropes attached , into a special net that helped break their fall .
They reached 70 mph during the roughly three - second , 150 - foot drop .
" It 's the scariest thing I have ever done , " said researcher David Eagleman , a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine .
" I knew it was perfectly safe , and I also knew that it would be the perfect way to make people feel as though an event took much longer than it actually did . "
Indeed , volunteers estimated their own fall lasted about a third longer than dives they saw other volunteers take .
Sure enough , people perceived time to slow down , but it was n't because they became hyper aware .
Rather , it was an illusion of memory :
When a person is scared , a brain area called the amygdala becomes more active , laying down an extra set of memories that go along with those normally taken care of by other parts of the brain .
" In this way , frightening events are associated with richer and denser memories , " Eagleman explained .
" And the more memory you have of an event , the longer you believe it took . "
Eagleman added this illusion " is related to the phenomenon that time seems to speed up as you grow older .
When you 're a child , you lay down rich memories for all your experiences ; when you 're older , you 've seen it all before and lay down fewer memories .
Therefore , when a child looks back at the end of a summer , it seems to have lasted forever ; adults think it zoomed by . "

You post it on your website only to find various blogs have “ borrowed ” or flat - out stolen the content for their website .
Nine times out of ten , there is no link back to your site and you get no credit for the content at all .
Then , to add insult to injury , thanks to your content , these sites rank higher in the search engines than you do .
Content Issues
The stolen content problem is tremendous in the online world .
Articles , sales pages and the like are quickly becoming the power behind the internet and success with websites , but to have your hard work stolen is more than frustrating – it ’s infuriating .
When your content is stolen , you have limited options .
You can have your lawyer send a cease and desist letter .
This only works inside the United States however , which may not be enough for the many sites which copy content who happen to be located overseas .
You can contact the search engines and submit a complaint or letter letting the company know of the problem , but you may not see any results .
You can also contact the company directly letting them know the terms of use for your content .
Perhaps you would n’t mind them using it if they included a link to your site or your byline .
Get Link Juice
Which brings us nicely stolen content ’s possible silver lining .
If two blogs are running the same articles , but one is ranked above you , the search engines must feel their blog is more substantial and worthy of higher ranks .
Now , in 2008 , websites will be able to “ steal ” link juice from theft sites by posting links back to your own website in the comments and summaries of each article .
Then , should your article be stolen , you ’ll at least benefit from the back links the thief has generated .
If the site stealing content is a puny little thing , you wo n’t be getting any increases in traffic or in PR , but if your content containing links is picked up by a blog or website more powerful than your own , you ’re looking at some free traffic and hopefully a great deal of free link power .
The Wrong Kind of Links
While you hope that nobody ever steals your content , the chances of content theft increase as your site becomes more popular and more highly ranked .
A major concern for many anxious to start putting links in their blog feed or summaries back to their own website is the likelihood that Google , or one of the other search engines , will punish your site for tricking other sites into giving you links .
Thus far it does n’t appear as though this will be the case .
You may run into trouble if you use highly targeted keywords to link to your site , but if you just use the name of the site itself to generate the link back , there should n’t be any trouble .
Do n’t get greedy , although the temptation to one up the sites that steal is very strong .
While it ’s tempting to squeeze every drop of link juice out of content theft sites , do n’t .
Not only can your site be penalized by Google for iffy links , you could also damage your reputation .
And in the online world , reputation is everything .
During my last move I took great pleasure in purging my home of items that were doing nothing but taking up space .
There is something very liberating about a style that is minimalist and compact — which is why this Matroshka living concept is so interesting .
Taking a page from the Casuo apartment in a box , the Matroshka packs a whole lot into a small space .
In fact , you can fit an L - shaped sofa , double bed , dinner table , four stools , total seating for 12 , a home office workspace , wardrobe and storage in only a 43 square foot area .

As mentioned , the Matroshka is only a concept at the moment , but the designers are working hard to make their dream into a reality .
If it does ever see the light of day , it could be a big hit with people who live in cramped city apartments .

WASHINGTON 
For more than four years , Frances Fragos Townsend , President Bush ’s departing chief terrorism adviser , has worked at the center of contentious antiterrorism programs , but unlike other battle - scarred West Wing colleagues , she is leaving with barely a scratch .
That is partly because she kept such a low political profile .
“ I could have been out there , ” Ms. Townsend said in a recent interview .
“ But the president did n’t want me to .
He made it clear that he did n’t want me involved in partisan politics .
It was less that I avoided it than I just was n’t pulled into it .
I was just not viewed as a political voice . ”
Ms. Townsend , 45 , a national security lawyer who once worked as a mob and narcotics prosecutor in New York , is stepping down on Jan .
4 . She did not know Mr. Bush until she began working at the White House in 2003 as an aide to Condoleezza Rice , then the national security adviser .
Promoted to domestic security adviser in 2004 , she became a loyalist and said she was leaving wearied by the acrimony that hangs over Mr. Bush ’s last year in office .
“ Poisonous Venom May Be Just What Doctor Ordered ” , Says Octogenarian
By Tom Wells , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PUNTA GORDA , Fla . — Bill Haast slid back the top to the large metal box and up popped a cobra .
The snake spread its hood , weaved back and forth , side to side , then hissed .
Haast placed his hand about six inches from its menacing fangs .
A few drops of the snake ’s venom could kill an ordinary human .
Or , Haast believes , perhaps save someone .
Bill Haast is not an ordinary human .
The snake lunged four times .
Each time , Haast pulled back his hand , just out of range , just in time .
His timing has not always been perfect .
At 85 , he has been bitten 162 times — the latest , by a cobra , three months ago — by snakes with venom poisonous enough to kill an elephant .
Twice , Haast almost died .
But Haast has been injecting himself with snake venom since 1948 .
He has built up such powerful antibodies in his system that his blood has been used as a snakebite antidote .
He began with tiny amounts of rattlesnake venom and built up the dosage over the years .
He injects himself once a week with venom from 32 species .
He says he is now immune from snakebites .
He also believes the snake venom has kept him healthy and holds the potential to help people with multiple sclerosis and other diseases .
Except for rare snakebites , he says , “ I ’ve never been sick a day in my life .
I ’ve never been to a doctor .
I ’ve never had the flu , not even a cold . ”
Neither , he says , has he had arthritis , bursitis or any communicable disease .
He has never taken medicine , not even aspirin .
He looks like a man in his 60s .
He walks with a spring in his step and his back ramrod straight .
He spends hours each day at his serpentarium in southwest Florida pulling weeds and planting shrubs in a two - acre plot where he hopes to breed snakes .
He puts his hands on the 4 - foot wall and vaults over .
Is snake venom the secret to health and long life ?
“ Come back in 15 years when I ’m 100 , and if I still look like I do today , then I would say `yes , ’ ” Haast says .
He believes venom can be useful against arthritis and other diseases .
He produced a drug in the late 1970s that a Miami doctor used at a clinic to treat multiple - sclerosis patients .
But the Food and Drug Administration closed down the clinic .
The new serpentarium Haast is working on will be his second snake - raising operation in Florida .
Just after World War II he opened a serpentarium and tourist attraction south of Miami and ran it for nearly 40 years .
Then he lost heart .
Already disappointed by the FDA ’s rejection of what he saw as groundbreaking work in finding a medical use for snake venom , he became disturbed and distraught by the death of a child who fell into a crocodile pit and was attacked .
He sold out in 1984 and moved to Utah .
In Utah , Haast continued extracting venom for snakebite antitoxin and for research .
He found he missed Florida ’s climate and landscape and returned six years ago .
His new serpentarium is along a crushed - rock road not far from Punta Gorda ( Wide Spot , in Spanish ) in rural southwestern Florida .
He no longer does shows for tourists .
He has about 400 snakes , extracts their venom daily and sells it to laboratories .
A gram of venom from an African tree snake goes for $ 6,000 ; sea snake venom $ 3,000 ; cottonmouth venom $ 60 .
“ We do n’t need to do this , but there is nothing else to do and I want to make sure researchers get what they need , ” Haast says .
The garage behind the new home he and his wife Nancy are building shelters a red Cornice II Rolls - Royce convertible ( hers ) and a white 1956 Lincoln Continental ( his ) in showroom condition .
Haast was born in 1910 in Paterson , N.J. , and caught his first snake when he was 7 .
When he was 12 a copperhead bite put him in the hospital .
He had grabbed the snake by the tail and learned a lesson : wrong end .
He came to South Florida in the late 1920s and worked with a man who had a traveling roadside snake show for tourists .
The Depression dried up business , so he took to making moonshine out in the Everglades .
That gave him an opportunity to catch snakes .
During World War II he had a chance to buy more exotic poisonous snakes when he flew with Pan Am
crews that delivered food and medicine to Africa and Asia .
“ While the rest of the crew was hitting the bars I would be buying snakes , ” he recalls .
After the war , Haast was so consumed with his serpentarium project , he says , that it destroyed his first marriage .
His son stayed with him to help clear the land .
The two lived in a shack , ate from cans and bathed in barrels .
Haast opened the serpentarium in 1948 , performing with snakes for tourists and selling venom from about 36,000 extractions annually .
He was confident that cobra venom held the secret to curing or maybe even preventing disease .
His built - up immunity to snake venom certainly saved his own life .
In 1954 he was bitten by a blue krait , a snake that comes from Asia .
Drop for drop , the krait ’s venom is
many times more poisonous than a cobra’s .
“ I had never heard of a krait bite victim ever surviving , ” Haast says .
“ I felt like the skin had been stripped from my body , like every nerve in my teeth was exposed , like my hair was being ripped out of my head . ”
Haast survived , barely .
The snake died 10 days later .
The remarkable thing about Haast ’s encounter with the krait was that , despite his agony , he insisted on
making notes .
He scribbled that he had a sore throat , sore jaw muscles , blurred vision , chest and stomach spasms .
When , three hours after the bite , he could no longer write , he dictated , noting his belief that the venom could not affect every nerve in his body and not have some use in medicine .
Indeed , his own blood has such a use .
In 1969 , he answered an emergency summons from Bob Elgin , director of the Des Moines Zoo in Iowa , who had been bitten by a snake .
Blood transfusions from Haast saved him .
Haast keeps a letter from Elgin : “ Each morning when the sun comes up , I think of you . ”
Haast ’s chance to test his theory , however , resulted in his run-in with the FDA .
An FDA document provides details :
In the late 1970s , A Miami physician named Ben Sheppard ( now dead ) , suffered from rheumatoid arthritis .
Sheppard took PROven , the medication produced by Haast .
The doctor was so pleased with the results that he started giving injections to patients with a variety of diseases .
Sheppard ’s clinic became famous , and was featured on the CBS - TV show “ 60 Minutes . ”
Haast recalls :
“ Sheppard eventually was treating six or seven thousand patients .
Most of them had MS .
People came from all over the United States and even from other countries .
The drug really helped them , but the FDA was upset because we had n’t done clinical studies first . ”
Just so .
The FDA shut down the clinic and banned the drug .
It ruled that the drug had not been properly tested or licensed for human use .
The Multiple Sclerosis Society still gets so many inquiries about PROven that it felt compelled to publish something on the drug last year .
The article notes the drug has been suggested as a treatment for arthritis , lupus , herpes simplex , herpes zoster , muscular dystrophy , Parkinson ’s disease , myasthenia gravis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .
Although PROven has been banned by the FDA , a similar mixture known as Horvi MS9 is sold legally in drugstores in Germany , the MS Society said .
Time will judge whether Haast was prophetic in his belief that snake venom can be beneficial to mankind .
One of Haast ’s favorite authors is Jules Verne , the 19th - century science - fiction writer ridiculed for his novels about men going to the moon and traveling in submarines .
Of his own theories , Haast says , “ We ’ll see . ”
John Klein ’s note : I have recently written a page with more info on the controversial treatment of MS with snake venom .
Neither of the two giant planets is a likely abode for life as we know it .
But , Dr. Gaudi said , warm rocky planets  suitable for life  could exist undetected in the inner parts of the system .
“ This could be a true solar system analogue , ” he said .
Sara Seager , a theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not part of the team , said that “ right now in exoplanets we are on an inexorable path to finding other Earths . ”
Dr. Seager praised the discovery as “ a big step in finding out if our planetary system is alone . ”
Since 1995 , around 250 planets outside the solar system , or exoplanets , have been discovered .
But few of them are in systems that even faintly resemble our own .
In many cases , giant Jupiter - like planets are whizzing around in orbits smaller than that of Mercury .
But are these typical of the universe ?
Almost all of those planets were discovered by the so - called wobble method , in which astronomers measure the gravitational tug of planets on their parent star as they whir around it .
This technique is most sensitive to massive planets close to their stars .
The new discovery was made by a different technique that favors planets more distant from their star .
It is based on a trick of Einsteinian gravity called microlensing .
If , in the ceaseless shifting of the stars , two of them should become almost perfectly aligned with Earth , the gravity of the nearer star can bend and magnify the light from the more distant one , causing it to get much brighter for a few days .

The French philosopher Michel Foucault notes that in all societies discourse is controlled - imperceptibly constrained , perhaps , but constrained nonetheless .
We are not free to say exactly what we like .
The norms set by institutions , convention and our need to keep within the boundaries of accepted behaviour and thought limit what may be touched upon .
The Archbishop of Canterbury experienced the backlash from stepping outside these conventions when he spoke about aspects of Islamic law that might be imported into British life .
Once , a man was held to be mad if he strayed from this discourse - even if his utterings were credited with revealing some hidden truth .
Today , he is called " naive " , or accused of having gone " native " .
Recently , the Royal United Services Institute ( Rusi ) marshalled former senior military and intelligence experts in order to assert such limits to expression by warning us that " deference " to multiculturalism was undermining the fight against Islamic " extremism " and threatening security .
Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger , in a recent interview with a German magazine , embellished Rusi 's complaints of naivety and " flabby thinking " .
Radical Islam wo n't stop , he warned , and the " virus " would only become more virulent if the US were to withdraw from Iraq .
The charge of naivety is not limited to failing to understand the concealed and duplicitous nature of Hamas and Hizbullah , Iran and Syria ; it extends to not grasping the true nature of the wider " enemy " the west is facing .
" I do n't like the term ' war on terror ' because terror is a method , not a political movement ; we are in a war against radical Islam , " says Kissinger .
But who or what is radical Islam ?
It is those who are not " moderates " , he explains .
Certainly , a small minority of Muslims believe that only by " burning the system " can a fresh stab at a just society be made .
But Kissinger 's definition of " moderate " Islam sounds no more than a projection of the Christian narrative after Westphalia , by which Christianity became a private matter of conscience , rather than an organisational principle for society .
If radical Islam , with which these experts tell us we should be at war , encompasses all those who are not enamoured of secular society , and who espouse a vision of their societies grounded in the values of Islam , then these experts are advocating a war with Islam - because Islam is the vision for their future favoured by many Muslims .
Mainstream Islamists are indeed challenging western secular and materialist values , and many do believe that western thinking is flawed - that the desires and appetites of man have been reified into representing man himself .
It is time to re-establish values that go beyond " desires and wants " , they argue .
Many Islamists also reject the western narrative of history and its projection of inevitable " progress " towards a secular modernity ; they reject the western view of power - relationships within societies and between societies ; they reject individualism as the litmus of progress in society ; and , above all , they reject the west 's assumption that its empirical approach lends unassailability and objective rationality to its thinking - and universality to its social models .
People may , or may not , agree , but the point is that this is a dispute about ideas , about the nature of society , and about equity in an emerging global order .
If western discourse cannot step beyond the enemy that it has created , these ideas cannot be heard - or addressed .
This is the argument that Jonathan Powell made last week when he argued that Britain should understand the lessons of Northern Ireland : we should talk to Islamist movements , including al - Qaida .
It has to be done , because the west needs to break through the fears and constraints of an over - imagined " enemy " .
Camouflaged behind a language dwelling exclusively on " their " violence and " their " disdain for rationality , these " realists " propose not a war on terror , nor a war to preserve " our values " - for we are not about to be culturally overwhelmed .
No Islamist seriously expects that a " defeated " west would hasten to adopt the spirit of the Islamic revolution .
No , the west 's war is a military response to ideas that question western supremacy and power .
The nature of this war on " extremism " became evident when five former chiefs of defence staff of Nato states gathered at a think - tank in Washington earlier this year .
Their aim was not to query the realism of a war on ideas , but to empower Nato for an " uncertain world " .
" We can not survive ... confronted with people who do not share our values , who unfortunately are in the majority in terms of numbers , and who are extremely hungry for success , " Germany 's former chief of defence staff warned .
Their conclusion was that the security of the west rests on a " restoration of its certainties " , and on a new form of deterrence in which enemies will find there is not , and never will be , a place in which they feel safe .
The generals concluded that Nato should adopt an asymmetrical and relentless pursuit of its targets regardless of others ' sovereignty ; to surprise ; to seize the initiative ; and to use all means , including the nuclear option , against its enemies .
In Foucault 's discourse , he identified a further group of rules serving to control language : none may enter into discourse on a specific subject unless he or she is deemed qualified to do so .
Those , like the archbishop , who penetrate this forbidden territory - reserved to security expertise - to ask that we see the west for what it has become in the eyes of others , are liable to be labelled as naively weakening " our certainties " and undermining national resolve .
But do we , who are brushed out of this discourse by the blackmail of presumed expertise , really believe them ?
Do we really believe , after so much failure , that Islamist alternative ideas will be suppressed by a Nato plunged into an asymmetrical warfare of assassinations and killings ?
The west 's vision for society holds power only so long as people believe it holds power .
Do we really think that if force has not succeeded , that only more and greater force can restore belief in the western vision ?
If that is the limit to western thinking , then it is these " realists " , these armchair warriors fighting a delusional war against a majority who " do not share our values " , who are truly naive .

A top Republican Senator is demanding an inquiry into why the National Football League destroyed tapes related to the New England Patriots ’ spying scandal :
The ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee wants N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell to explain why the league destroyed evidence related to spying by the New England Patriots .
In the stretch of 12 days , from Sept. 9 to Sept. 20 , the Patriots were caught filming the Jets ’ defensive signals in violation of N.F.L. rules , ordered to hand over all tapes of illegal filming to the league office , fined $ 750,000 and made to forfeit a first - round draft pick .
Then the N.F.L. announced it had destroyed the evidence .
In a telephone interview Thursday morning , Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania and ranking member of the committee , said that Goodell would eventually be called before the committee to address two issues : the league ’s antitrust exemption in relation to its television contract and the destruction of the tapes that revealed spying by the Patriots .
“ That requires an explanation , ” Specter said .
“ The N.F.L. has a very preferred status in our country with their antitrust exemption .
The American people are entitled to be sure about the integrity of the game .
It ’s analogous to the C.I.A. destruction of tapes .
Or any time you have records destroyed . ”
Representatives of the governments of the world , good morning to all of you .
First of all , I would like to invite you , very respectfully , to those who have not read this book , to read it .
Noam Chomsky , one of the most prestigious American and world intellectuals , Noam Chomsky , and this is one of his most recent books , ' Hegemony or Survival : The Imperialist Strategy of the United States . ' "
[ Holds up book , waves it in front of General Assembly . ]
" It 's an excellent book to help us understand what has been happening in the world throughout the 20th century , and what 's happening now , and the greatest threat looming over our planet .
The hegemonic pretensions of the American empire are placing at risk the very survival of the human species .
We continue to warn you about this danger and we appeal to the people of the United States and the world to halt this threat , which is like a sword hanging over our heads .
I had considered reading from this book , but , for the sake of time , " [ flips through the pages , which are numerous ]
" I will just leave it as a recommendation .
It reads easily , it is a very good book , I 'm sure Madame [ President ] you are familiar with it .
It appears in English , in Russian , in Arabic , in German .
I think that the first people who should read this book are our brothers and sisters in the United States , because their threat is right in their own house .
The devil is right at home .
The devil , the devil himself , is right in the house .
" And the devil came here yesterday .
Yesterday the devil came here .
Right here . " [ crosses himself ]
" And it smells of sulfur still today .
Yesterday , ladies and gentlemen , from this rostrum , the president of the United States , the gentleman to whom I refer as the devil , came here , talking as if he owned the world .
Truly .
As the owner of the world .
I think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterday 's statement made by the president of the United States .
As the spokesman of imperialism , he came to share his nostrums , to try to preserve the current pattern of domination , exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world .
An Alfred Hitchcock movie could use it as a scenario .
I would even propose a title : " The Devil 's Recipe . "
As Chomsky says here , clearly and in depth , the American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its system of domination .
And we can not allow them to do that .
We cannot allow world dictatorship to be consolidated .
The world parent 's statement -- cynical , hypocritical , full of this imperial hypocrisy from the need they have to control everything .
They say they want to impose a democratic model .
But that 's their democratic model .
It 's the false democracy of elites , and , I would say , a very original democracy that 's imposed by weapons and bombs and firing weapons .
What a strange democracy .
Aristotle might not recognize it or others who are at the root of democracy .
What type of democracy do you impose with marines and bombs ?
The president of the United States , yesterday , said to us , right here , in this room , and I 'm quoting , " Anywhere you look , you hear extremists telling you can escape from poverty and recover your dignity through violence , terror and martyrdom . "
Wherever he looks , he sees extremists .
And you , my brother -- he looks at your color , and he says , oh , there 's an extremist .
Evo Morales , the worthy president of Bolivia , looks like an extremist to him .
The imperialists see extremists everywhere .
It 's not that we are extremists .
It 's that the world is waking up .
It 's waking up all over .
And people are standing up .
I have the feeling , dear world dictator , that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are standing up , all those who are rising up against American imperialism , who are shouting for equality , for respect , for the sovereignty of nations .
Yes , you can call us extremists , but we are rising up against the empire , against the model of domination .
The president then -- and this he said himself , he said : " I have come to speak directly to the populations in the Middle East , to tell them that my country wants peace . "
That 's true .
If we walk in the streets of the Bronx , if we walk around New York , Washington , San Diego , in any city , San Antonio , San Francisco , and we ask individuals , the citizens of the United States , what does this country want ?
Does it want peace ?
They 'll say yes .
But the government does n't want peace .
The government of the United States does n't want peace .
It wants to exploit its system of exploitation , of pillage , of hegemony through war .
It wants peace .
But what 's happening in Iraq ?
What happened in Lebanon ?
In Palestine ?
What 's happening ?
What 's happened over the last 100 years in Latin America and in the world ?
And now threatening Venezuela -- new threats against Venezuela , against Iran ?
He spoke to the people of Lebanon .
Many of you , he said , have seen how your homes and communities were caught in the crossfire .
How cynical can you get ?
What a capacity to lie shamefacedly .
The bombs in Beirut with millimetric precision ?
This is crossfire ?
He 's thinking of a western , when people would shoot from the hip and somebody would be caught in the crossfire .
This is imperialist , fascist , assassin , genocidal , the empire and Israel firing on the people of Palestine and Lebanon .
That is what happened .
And now we hear , " We 're suffering because we see homes destroyed . '
The president of the United States came to talk to the peoples -- to the peoples of the world .
He came to say -- I brought some documents with me , because this morning I was reading some statements , and I see that he talked to the people of Afghanistan , the people of Lebanon , the people of Iran .
And he addressed all these peoples directly .
And you can wonder , just as the president of the United States addresses those peoples of the world , what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor ?
What would they have to say ?
And I think I have some inkling of what the peoples of the south , the oppressed people think .
They would say , " Yankee imperialist , go home . "
I think that is what those people would say if they were given the microphone and if they could speak with one voice to the American imperialists .
And that is why , Madam President , my colleagues , my friends , last year we came here to this same hall as we have been doing for the past eight years , and we said something that has now been confirmed -- fully , fully confirmed .
I do n't think anybody in this room could defend the system .
Let 's accept -- let 's be honest .
The U.N. system , born after the Second World War , collapsed .
It 's worthless .
Oh , yes , it 's good to bring us together once a year , see each other , make statements and prepare all kinds of long documents , and listen to good speeches , like Abel 's yesterday , or President Mullah 's .
Yes , it 's good for that .
And there are a lot of speeches , and we 've heard lots from the president of Sri Lanka , for instance , and the president of Chile .
But we , the assembly , have been turned into a merely deliberative organ .
We have no power , no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world .
And that is why Venezuela once again proposes , here , today , 20 September , that we re-establish the United Nations .
Last year , Madam , we made four modest proposals that we felt to be crucially important .
We have to assume the responsibility our heads of state , our ambassadors , our representatives , and we have to discuss it .
The first is expansion , and Mullah talked about this yesterday right here .
The Security Council , both as it has permanent and non-permanent categories , ( inaudible ) developing countries and LDCs must be given access as new permanent members .
That 's step one .
Second , effective methods to address and resolve world conflicts , transparent decisions .
Point three , the immediate suppression -- and that is something everyone 's calling for -- of the anti-democratic mechanism known as the veto , the veto on decisions of the Security Council .
Let me give you a recent example .
The immoral veto of the United States allowed the Israelis , with impunity , to destroy Lebanon .
Right in front of all of us as we stood there watching , a resolution in the council was prevented .
Fourthly , we have to strengthen , as we 've always said , the role and the powers of the secretary general of the United Nations .
Yesterday , the secretary general practically gave us his speech of farewell .
And he recognized that over the last 10 years , things have just gotten more complicated ; hunger , poverty , violence , human rights violations have just worsened .
That is the tremendous consequence of the collapse of the United Nations system and American hegemonistic pretensions .
Madam , Venezuela a few years ago decided to wage this battle within the United Nations by recognizing the United Nations , as members of it that we are , and lending it our voice , our thinking .
Our voice is an independent voice to represent the dignity and the search for peace and the reformulation of the international system ; to denounce persecution and aggression of hegemonistic forces on the planet .
This is how Venezuela has presented itself .
Bolivar 's home has sought a nonpermanent seat on the Security Council .
Let 's see .
Well , there 's been an open attack by the U.S. government , an immoral attack , to try and prevent Venezuela from being freely elected to a post in the Security Council .
The imperium is afraid of truth , is afraid of independent voices .
It calls us extremists , but they are the extremists .
And I would like to thank all the countries that have kindly announced their support for Venezuela , even though the ballot is a secret one and there 's no need to announce things .
But since the imperium has attacked , openly , they strengthened the convictions of many countries .
And their support strengthens us .
Mercosur , as a bloc , has expressed its support , our brothers in Mercosur .
Venezuela , with Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay , Uruguay , is a full member of Mercosur .
And many other Latin American countries , CARICOM , Bolivia have expressed their support for Venezuela .
The Arab League , the full Arab League has voiced its support .
And I am immensely grateful to the Arab world , to our Arab brothers , our Caribbean brothers , the African Union .
Almost all of Africa has expressed its support for Venezuela and countries such as Russia or China and many others .
I thank you all warmly on behalf of Venezuela , on behalf of our people , and on behalf of the truth , because Venezuela , with a seat on the Security Council , will be expressing not only Venezuela 's thoughts , but it will also be the voice of all the peoples of the world , and we will defend dignity and truth .
Over and above all of this , Madam President , I think there are reasons to be optimistic .
A poet would have said " helplessly optimistic , " because over and above the wars and the bombs and the aggressive and the preventive war and the destruction of entire peoples , one can see that a new era is dawning .
As Silvio Rodriguez says , the era is giving birth to a heart .
There are alternative ways of thinking .
There are young people who think differently .
And this has already been seen within the space of a mere decade .
It was shown that the end of history was a totally false assumption , and the same was shown about Pax Americana and the establishment of the capitalist neo-liberal world .
It has been shown , this system , to generate mere poverty .
Who believes in it now ?
What we now have to do is define the future of the world .
Dawn is breaking out all over .
You can see it in Africa and Europe and Latin America and Oceanea .
I want to emphasize that optimistic vision .
We have to strengthen ourselves , our will to do battle , our awareness .
We have to build a new and better world .
Venezuela joins that struggle , and that 's why we are threatened .
The U.S. has already planned , financed and set in motion a coup in Venezuela , and it continues to support coup attempts in Venezuela and elsewhere .
President Michelle Bachelet reminded us just a moment ago of the horrendous assassination of the former foreign minister , Orlando Letelier .
And I would just add one thing :
Those who perpetrated this crime are free .
And that other event where an American citizen also died were American themselves .
They were CIA killers , terrorists .
And we must recall in this room that in just a few days there will be another anniversary .
Thirty years will have passed from this other horrendous terrorist attack on the Cuban plane , where 73 innocents died , a Cubana de Aviacion airliner .
And where is the biggest terrorist of this continent who took the responsibility for blowing up the plane ?
He spent a few years in jail in Venezuela .
Thanks to CIA and then government officials , he was allowed to escape , and he lives here in this country , protected by the government .
And he was convicted .
He has confessed to his crime .
But the U.S. government has double standards .
It protects terrorism when it wants to .
And this is to say that Venezuela is fully committed to combating terrorism and violence .
And we are one of the people who are fighting for peace .
Luis Posada Carriles is the name of that terrorist who is protected here .
And other tremendously corrupt people who escaped from Venezuela are also living here under protection : a group that bombed various embassies , that assassinated people during the coup .
They kidnapped me and they were going to kill me , but I think God reached down and our people came out into the streets and the army was too , and so I 'm here today .
But these people who led that coup are here today in this country protected by the American government .
And I accuse the American government of protecting terrorists and of having a completely cynical discourse .
We mentioned Cuba .
Yes , we were just there a few days ago .
We just came from there happily .
And there you see another era born .
The Summit of the 15 , the Summit of the Nonaligned , adopted a historic resolution .
This is the outcome document .
Do n't worry , I 'm not going to read it .
But you have a whole set of resolutions here that were adopted after open debate in a transparent matter -- more than 50 heads of state .
Havana was the capital of the south for a few weeks , and we have now launched , once again , the group of the nonaligned with new momentum .
And if there is anything I could ask all of you here , my companions , my brothers and sisters , it is to please lend your good will to lend momentum to the Nonaligned Movement for the birth of the new era , to prevent hegemony and prevent further advances of imperialism .
And as you know , Fidel Castro is the president of the nonaligned for the next three years , and we can trust him to lead the charge very efficiently .
Unfortunately they thought , " Oh , Fidel was going to die . "
But they 're going to be disappointed because he did n't .
And he's not only alive , he 's back in his green fatigues , and he 's now presiding the nonaligned .
So , my dear colleagues , Madam President , a new , strong movement has been born , a movement of the south .
We are men and women of the south .
With this document , with these ideas , with these criticisms , I 'm now closing my file .
I 'm taking the book with me .
And , do n't forget , I 'm recommending it very warmly and very humbly to all of you .
We want ideas to save our planet , to save the planet from the imperialist threat .
And hopefully in this very century , in not too long a time , we will see this , we will see this new era , and for our children and our grandchildren a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of the United Nations , but a renewed United Nations .
And maybe we have to change location .
Maybe we have to put the United Nations somewhere else ; maybe a city of the south .
We 've proposed Venezuela .
You know that my personal doctor had to stay in the plane .
The chief of security had to be left in a locked plane .
Neither of these gentlemen was allowed to arrive and attend the U.N. meeting .
This is another abuse and another abuse of power on the part of the Devil .
It smells of sulfur here , but God is with us and I embrace you all .
May God bless us all .
Good day to you .
In my memory , there has not been such a dizzying array of characters competing for the presidency .
However , it seems that only the Obamalites have the highest rate of satisfaction in their candidate .
Hillary still has her high percentage of those who view her as unfavorable .
Instead of being an insider to the Democratic Party , she is now the recipient of their aggressive disdain .
Just witness the maneuverings of Move.on.org , the Daily Kos , and Arianna Huffington .
She made a deal with these devils and now she is paying her dues for the support she had hoped to maintain .
Instead , these organizations have betrayed her in favor of the orator , Barack Obama and his ambiguous methods to bring about change .
Now that the records of her White House days are public , we find that she had very little involvement in setting any kind of policy .
She had far too many political and social gatherings to avail herself of to have time for creating and sustaining policy .
However , far from being disappointed with her , we should be glad that she maintained her public posturings and left decisions to the one we actually elected in the first place , namely , her husband , Bill .
And let ’s face it , those were n’t bad days .
Overall , his presidency was a success , excluding that rumor about an intern in the Oval Office .
Hillary has been working hard to place herself in a favorable light with not only the Democrats but with the independents .
Of course , that ’s what all candidates do .
But Hilary can’t have it both ways .
Her attempts to convince voters that she was against the Iraq policy all the time , or her votes or statements have been taken out of context , is preempted by her votes in the Senate regarding that war ; also , her comments in the first years of the war also portray her as supporting the war and her reasons for supporting its initiation .
But the winds of change caress everyone ’s hair .
With an unpopular war and our economy in distress , Hillary has tried to smooth out the conflicts in her campaigning regarding the war .
She now qualifies her votes and statements to portend a more liberal approach to the war in Iraq .
And maybe she really has changed her position on the war .
But I do n’t think so .
I do n’t believe that she will precipitously withdraw our troops from Iraq .
I think if we knew what she planned to do with our troops , we would find that she ’s a lot closer to George Bush than Barack Obama .
That ’s not to say she will give an open - ended commitment to the government of Iraq .
I do n’t think she will do that .
I believe she will try to fashion the country of Iraq into a state of quasi-stability by leaving our troops in Iraq for the length of time necessary to train the Iraqi forces into an effective battle force and hopefully , end the threat , or at least further diminish , the role of Al Qaeda in Iraq .
This is really not an untenable position to take on the war .
A unilateral withdrawal in Iraq would create a vacuum of power in a state that has served admirably as a counterpoint to Iran .
And as much as this is anathema to most Democrats , we need to make sure that Iraq is stable enough to properly produce and supply the world with their great deposits of oil .
Without this , the price of oil would be astronomically high .
There are those who say the war was all about oil in the first place .
I ’m not sure that is correct .
I think it was probably one of the reasons to engage Saddam but not the only one .
Regardless of denials by Hillary , she did believe that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction – as a matter of fact , most Democrats agreed with that assumption , as did the true believers , the Republicans .
However , the question is no longer pertinent .
It no longer matters why we prosecuted the war .
We ’re there and we have to finish it , and as quickly as possible .
Yes , we have to get Iraq stable and more amenable to cooperation with the various ethnic groups , but the cost of the war has become a huge drain on our resources .
We have to stop that and soon .
Our economy and weak dollar will no longer support an open - ended commitment to Iraq .
By no means should we publish a withdrawal schedule , we have to vigorously defeat Al Qaeda – but we must be aware that our failing economy is being significantly altered by the cost of the war .
In this , Ron Paul was right .
We ca n’t afford this war .
But to keep it from being a total disaster we have to finish the job and make no long - term commitment to Iraq .
In the end , Hillary should embrace her votes on the Iraq war because they were founded on what everyone thought were legitimate reasons to disarm Iraq .
This will not hurt her in her quest for the independent vote and it would probably not hurt her standings with her supporters right now .
I think she would get a vote for being honest .
The failure of our intelligence is regrettable , very regrettable , but we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater .

Parodies of Hillary Clinton's " red phone " have been blanketing the Internet .
On Thursday , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert added one of his own .
Demanding Congress renew The Protect America Act , which would allow President Bush 's eavesdropping program to continue and grant immunity for telecommunications firms the participated in the plan , Colbert proposed one of his own .
Colbert intercut clips of When A Stranger Calls , Silence of the Lambs , Scream , , The Ring , Nightmare on Elm Street and concluded with Clinton 's " 3 am " ad : " I 'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message . "
" If the phone companies really want immunity , here 's how they need to scare us , " Colbert added .
" Make one of those robo calls where celebrity gives away personalized promotional phone message .
in this case , the message is fear .
and the celebrity is Osama bin laden . "
Bin Laden is shown wearing a telemarketer 's headset .
" Hello , Stephen .
I hope you are enjoying your job in media and entertainment .
If the Protect America Act is not renewed , i will blow up your suburban house , your Buick LeSabre and your Sea - Doo jet ski .
Allah is better than Jesus .
Death to America .
Good - bye . "
" Nation , call your congressman and tell them you want America to be protected , " Colbert concluded .
" In fact , call anyone .
The right people will be listening . "

Dark energy a furphy , says new paper
' Dark energy ' , which researchers have spent years trying to fathom , is n't necessary to explain our universe after all , according to a new solution to Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
This challenges the notion that dark energy makes up 76 % of our universe , as many cosmologists believe .
Research by Dr David Wiltshire , from New Zealand 's University of Canterbury , accounts for recent observations of the distribution of matter in the universe , observations that had n't been made in Einstein 's time .
Wiltshire 's paper , published this week in the journal Physical Review Letters , focuses on the lumpy distribution of matter in the universe as it evolved , rather than a smooth distribution that Einstein assumed .
Once this uneven distribution is taken into account , he says , we do n't need dark energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe .
" Dark energy , this mysterious stuff in the vacuum of space which makes the universe want to accelerate , is the basis for standard cosmology today because it explains much of what we see , " says Wiltshire .
Galaxies do appear to be moving away from each other and at an ever increasing rate , he says .
But he says this acceleration is apparent , and whether you see it or not depends where in the universe you are taking measurements from , a void or a galaxy .
The matter with matter
When cosmologists first solved Einstein 's equations 80 - 90 years ago , they did n't know how matter was distributed or what the universe really looked like .
" The early solutions , which standard cosmology still uses , assumed a very simple structure where the universe is uniformly smooth and featureless , evolving the same way in all directions , " says Wiltshire .
But he says through observational projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2 Degree Field survey , we now have a much better picture of the large - scale structure of the universe and we know that galaxies are not uniformly distributed .
" Rather , they are in clusters sprinkled thinly in filaments and ' bubble walls ' surrounding huge voids hundreds of millions of light - years across , " he says .
This complicates a standard view of the universe .
" Space curves around a massive object , just as a rubber sheet on a trampoline will stretch around a heavy cannon ball , and time slows down , " says Wiltshire .
But he says this only represents bound systems like galaxies .
" The flat edge of the rubber sheet is the reference point for our clocks .
It is only the space beyond this flat edge that is expanding .
Clock rates and the curvature of space can both vary gradually as you move across an expanding void . "
And , since mass slows down time , the clocks of observers in voids , where most of the empty space in the universe is , will appear to be ticking faster than the clocks of observers in galaxies .
It is this last feature , he says , that explains why dark energy is unnecessary .
" What we see as cosmic acceleration is an apparent effect , which begins when voids open up .
When the universe was very young all the clocks were synchronised but because of the way voids have evolved , the clock rate is variable today , " Wiltshire says .
Age is relative too
The age of the universe also depends on where you 're standing , as Wiltshire discovered in calculations published in the New Journal of Physics .
The universe is 14.7 billion years old , a billion years older than the currently accepted age , from our galactic observation point .
But it is more than 18 billion years old from an average location in a void .
In a third paper , published this week in Astrophysical Journal Letters , Wiltshire and colleagues examine independent observational tests that confirm these ages .
Although the research completely changes our view of the universe , it does n't alter standard physics .
" Einstein 's revolution is still continuing , " says Wiltshire .
" This is a radically conservative solution to how the universe works . "
One thing about Jerry Yang that I always have admired is that he cares .
He cares about his employees .
He cares about his products .
He cares about his shareholders .
Most of all he cares about building a world class company that can be great at what it does .
If you look at Yahoo singularly , it is a great company .
For he and David Filo to build a company with more than 6B in sales and more than 25B in market cap is an astounding feat .
Unfortunately for Yahoo , it has had to weather both the Internet Bubble Bursting and the emergence of Google as a force in search and online advertising .
These are both issues because Wall Street has made them issues .
The bubble speaks for itself .
Google is a Wall Street issue for Yahoo because Wall Street wants Yahoo to keep up with the Googles .
That ’s a problem for Jerry .
Building a world class
Yahoo to be the best company it possibly can be using the management skills that Jerry and company have is a far different challenge than optimizing the stock price .
Particularly when Google is your stock comp .
Which is exactly why Jerry and David should sell to MSFT .
If there is one thing Microsoft does well , its ignore Wall Street and invest in its corporate strategies .
It has so many huge lines of business , that Wall Street has learned to just let those that need to germinate do so .
XBox .
MSN .
Online .
Microsoft gets more leash from Wall Street to develop businesses than any company on the planet .
So the question is n’t whether Yahoo should sell .
It should .
The only question is what the structure of the deal should look like so that Jerry and David can achieve many of the goals they set out to accomplish on the net under the MSFT umbrella .
Jerry definitely is about customers first .
This is his chance to show it .
This deal accelerates his opportunity to get customers where he wants to take them if he negotiates it right .
Something I dint think would be that hard .
There is too much upside for Microsoft to nitpick the non financial deal points .
What about Google ?
Google also is a company that wants to put its strategic goals ahead of what Wall Street wants .
When the stock is trending up , that ’s easy to do .
If we are in the middle of a market correction of any severity at all , then Google could get hit with its own Wall Street “ double whammy ” .
First the downward pressure on its stock price .
After several days of seeing the stock down 50 bucks during the trading day , Google is feeling exactly what Yahoo felt when the bubble burst .
That queasy sense of fear around the company .
The questioning of what could possibly happen to the stock , the impact on employee options and the inevitable questioning of Google traditions .
10 to 20 pct of your time on other projects ?
Not when the stock price is down 200 dollars in the past 3 months .
Again .
The 2ND whammy would happen if Yahoo was no longer a stand alone stock .
Even if the Google stock price suffered , there was always the comfort of “ outperforming Yahoo ” .
Wall Street , employees , small stock owners always had the Yahoo stock comp to give it confidence .
If its not there , all the eyes are staring right at Google evaluating and questioning every number and corporate action .
Its a level of scrutiny and pressure that can and will change the corporate culture of any company going through a maturation phase .
So Yahoo should say yes .
Its less about the money than about finally achieving the corporate goals set out more than a decade ago .
One time Jerry told me that Yahoo stood for You Always Have Other Options .
This time Yahoo does n’t , but their customers options could improve exponentially if Yahoo says yes .

The Article : A 1994 Atlantic article by Robert Kaplan entitled The Coming Anarchy .
Weaving together elements of a world facing new demons , including environmental scarcity , renewed ethnic and tribal divisions , and the failures of the modern nation state , Kaplan writes a prosaic yet troubling outlook on the post Cold War political atlas .
Many of his predictions have borne fruit , including his insights on the destabilization of Pakistan and the rise and entrenchment of the Islamic movement .
A revistation of the Coming Anarchy provides one with relevant and timely perspectives on a world increasingly dominated by the stark divisions between the have ’s and have not ’s and the battle over scarce resources .
The Text : The Minister ’s eyes were like egg yolks , an aftereffect of some of the many illnesses , malaria especially , endemic in his country .
There was also an irrefutable sadness in his eyes .
He spoke in a slow and creaking voice , the voice of hope about to expire .
Flame trees , coconut palms , and a ballpoint - blue Atlantic composed the background .
None of it seemed beautiful , though .
“ In forty - five years I have never seen things so bad .
We did not manage ourselves well after the British departed .
But what we have now is something worse — the revenge of the poor , of the social failures , of the people least able to bring up children in a modern society . ”
Then he referred to the recent coup in the West African country Sierra Leone .
“ The boys who took power in Sierra Leone come from houses like this . ”
The Minister jabbed his finger at a corrugated metal shack teeming with children .
“ In three months these boys confiscated all the official Mercedes , Volvos , and BMWs and willfully wrecked them on the road . ”
The Minister mentioned one of the coup ’s leaders , Solomon Anthony Joseph Musa , who shot the people who had paid for his schooling , “ in order to erase the humiliation and mitigate the power his middle - class sponsors held over him . ”
Tyranny is nothing new in Sierra Leone or in the rest of West Africa .
But it is now part and parcel of an increasing lawlessness that is far more significant than any coup , rebel incursion , or episodic experiment in democracy .
Crime was what my friend — a top- ranking African official whose life would be threatened were I to identify him more precisely — really wanted to talk about .
Crime is what makes
West Africa a natural point of departure for my report on what the political character of our planet is likely to be in the twenty - first century .
The cities of West Africa at night are some of the unsafest places in the world .
Streets are unlit ; the police often lack gasoline for their vehicles ; armed burglars , carjackers , and muggers proliferate .
“ The government in Sierra Leone has no writ after dark , ” says a foreign resident , shrugging .
When I was in the capital , Freetown , last September , eight men armed with AK - 47s broke into the house of an American man .
They tied him up and stole everything of value .
Forget Miami : direct flights between the United States and the Murtala Muhammed Airport , in neighboring Nigeria ’s largest city , Lagos , have been suspended by order of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation because of ineffective security at the terminal and its environs .
A State Department report cited the airport for “ extortion by law - enforcement and immigration officials . ”
This is one of the few times that the U.S. government has embargoed a foreign airport for reasons that are linked purely to crime .
In Abidjan , effectively the capital of the Cote d’Ivoire , or Ivory Coast , restaurants have stick - and gun-wielding guards who walk you the fifteen feet or so between your car and the entrance , giving you an eerie taste of what American cities might be like in the future .
An Italian ambassador was killed by gunfire when robbers invaded an Abidjan restaurant .
The family of the Nigerian ambassador was tied up and robbed at gunpoint in the ambassador ’s residence .
After university students in the Ivory Coast caught bandits who had been plaguing their dorms , they executed them by hanging tires around their necks and setting the tires on fire .
In one instance Ivorian policemen stood by and watched the “ necklacings , ” afraid to intervene .
Each time I went to the Abidjan bus terminal , groups of young men with restless , scanning eyes surrounded my taxi , putting their hands all over the windows , demanding “ tips ” for carrying my luggage even though I had only a rucksack .
In cities in six West African countries I saw similar young men everywhere — hordes of them .
They were like loose molecules in a very unstable social fluid , a fluid that was clearly on the verge of igniting .
“ You see , ” my friend the Minister told me , “ in the villages of Africa it is perfectly natural to feed at any table and lodge in any hut .
But in the cities this communal existence no longer holds .
You must pay for lodging and be invited for food .
When young men find out that their relations cannot put them up , they become lost .
They join other migrants and slip gradually into the criminal process . ”
“ In the poor quarters of Arab North Africa , ” he continued , “ there is much less crime , because Islam provides a social anchor : of education and indoctrination .
Here in West Africa we have a lot of superficial Islam and superficial Christianity .
Western religion is undermined by animist beliefs not suitable to a moral society , because they are based on irrational spirit power .
Here spirits are used to wreak vengeance by one person against another , or one group against another . ”
Many of the atrocities in the Liberian civil war have been tied to belief in juju spirits , and the BBC has reported , in its magazine Focus on Africa , that in the civil fighting in adjacent Sierra Leone , rebels were said to have “ a young woman with them who would go to the front naked , always walking backwards and looking in a mirror to see where she was going .
This made her invisible , so that she could cross to the army ’s positions and there bury charms . . . to improve the rebels ’ chances of success . ”
Finally my friend the Minister mentioned polygamy .
Designed for a pastoral way of life , polygamy continues to thrive in sub-Saharan Africa even though it is increasingly uncommon in Arab North Africa .
Most youths I met on the road in West Africa told me that they were from “ extended ” families , with a mother in one place and a father in another .
Translated to an urban environment , loose family structures are largely responsible for the world ’s highest birth rates and the explosion of the HIV virus on the continent .
Like the communalism and animism , they provide a weak shield against the corrosive social effects of life in cities .
In those cities African culture is being redefined while desertification and deforestation — also tied to overpopulation — drive more and more African peasants out of the countryside .
A Premonition of the Future
West Africa is becoming the symbol of worldwide demographic , environmental , and societal stress , in which criminal anarchy emerges as the real “ strategic ” danger .
Disease , overpopulation , unprovoked crime , scarcity of resources , refugee migrations , the increasing erosion of nation - states and international borders , and the empowerment of private armies , security firms , and international drug cartels are now most tellingly demonstrated through a West African prism .
West Africa provides an appropriate introduction to the issues , often extremely unpleasant to discuss , that will soon confront our civilization .
To remap the political earth the way it will be a few decades hence — as I intend to do in this article — I find I must begin with West Africa .
There is no other place on the planet where political maps are so deceptive — where , in fact , they tell such lies — as in West Africa .
Start with Sierra Leone .
According to the map , it is a nation - state of defined borders , with a government in control of its territory .
In truth the Sierra Leonian government , run by a twenty - seven - year - old army captain , Valentine Strasser , controls Freetown by day and by day also controls part of the rural interior .
In the government ’s territory the national army is an unruly rabble threatening drivers and passengers at most checkpoints .
In the other part of the country units of two separate armies from the war in Liberia have taken up residence , as has an army of Sierra Leonian rebels .
The government force fighting the rebels is full of renegade commanders who have aligned themselves with disaffected village chiefs .
A pre-modern formlessness governs the battlefield , evoking the wars in medieval Europe prior to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia , which ushered in the era of organized nation - states .
As a consequence , roughly 400,000 Sierra Leonians are internally displaced , 280,000 more have fled to neighboring Guinea , and another 100,000 have fled to Liberia , even as 400,000 Liberians have fled to Sierra Leone .
The third largest city in Sierra Leone , Gondama , is a displaced - persons camp .
With an additional 600,000 Liberians in Guinea and 250,000 in the Ivory Coast , the borders dividing these four countries have become largely meaningless .
Even in quiet zones none of the governments except the Ivory Coast ’s maintains the schools , bridges , roads , and police forces in a manner necessary for functional sovereignty .
The Koranko ethnic group in northeastern Sierra Leone does all its trading in Guinea .
Sierra Leonian diamonds are more likely to be sold in Liberia than in Freetown .
In the eastern provinces of Sierra Leone you can buy Liberian beer but not the local brand .
In Sierra Leone , as in Guinea , as in the Ivory Coast , as in Ghana , most of the primary rain forest and the secondary bush is being destroyed at an alarming rate .
I saw convoys of trucks bearing majestic hardwood trunks to coastal ports .
When Sierra Leone achieved its independence , in 1961 , as much as 60 percent of the country was primary rain forest .
Now six percent is .
In the Ivory Coast the proportion has fallen from 38 percent to eight percent .
The deforestation has led to soil erosion , which has led to more flooding and more mosquitoes .
Virtually everyone in the West African interior has some form of malaria .
Sierra Leone is a microcosm of what is occurring , albeit in a more tempered and gradual manner , throughout West Africa and much of the underdeveloped world : the withering away of central governments , the rise of tribal and regional domains , the unchecked spread of disease , and the growing pervasiveness of war .
West Africa is reverting to the Africa of the Victorian atlas .
It consists now of a series of coastal trading posts , such as Freetown and Conakry , and an interior that , owing to violence , volatility , and disease , is again becoming , as Graham Greene once observed , “ blank ” and “ unexplored . ”
However , whereas Greene ’s vision implies a certain romance , as in the somnolent and charmingly seedy Freetown of his celebrated novel The Heart of the Matter , it is Thomas Malthus , the philosopher of demographic doomsday , who is now the prophet of West Africa ’s future .
And West Africa ’s future , eventually , will also be that of most of the rest of the world .
Consider “ Chicago . ” I refer not to Chicago , Illinois , but to a slum district of Abidjan , which the young toughs in the area have named after the American city .
( “ Washington ” is another poor section of Abidjan . )
Although Sierra Leone is widely regarded as beyond salvage , the Ivory Coast has been considered an African success story , and Abidjan has been called “ the Paris of West Africa . ”
Success , however , was built on two artificial factors : the high price of cocoa , of which the Ivory Coast is the world ’s leading producer , and the talents of a French expatriate community , whose members have helped run the government and the private sector .
The expanding cocoa economy made the Ivory Coast a magnet for migrant workers from all over West Africa : between a third and a half of the country ’s population is now non-Ivorian , and the figure could be as high as 75 percent in Abidjan .
During the 1980s cocoa prices fell and the French began to leave .
The skyscrapers of the Paris of West Africa are a facade .
Perhaps 15 percent of Abidjan ’s population of three million people live in shantytowns like Chicago and Washington , and the vast majority live in places that are not much better .
Not all of these places appear on any of the readily available maps .
This is another indication of how political maps are the products of tired conventional wisdom and , in the Ivory Coast ’s case , of an elite that will ultimately be forced to relinquish power .
Chicago , like more and more of Abidjan , is a slum in the bush : a checkerwork of corrugated zinc roofs and walls made of cardboard and black plastic wrap .
It is located in a gully teeming with coconut palms and oil palms , and is ravaged by flooding .
Few residents have easy access to electricity , a sewage system , or a clean water supply .
The crumbly red laterite earth crawls with foot - long lizards both inside and outside the shacks .
Children defecate in a stream filled with garbage and pigs , droning with malarial mosquitoes .
In this stream women do the washing .
Young unemployed men spend their time drinking beer , palm wine , and gin while gambling on pinball games constructed out of rotting wood and rusty nails .
These are the same youths who rob houses in more prosperous Ivorian neighborhoods at night .
One man I met , Damba Tesele , came to Chicago from Burkina Faso in 1963 .
A cook by profession , he has four wives and thirty - two children , not one of whom has made it to high school .
He has seen his shanty community destroyed by municipal authorities seven times since coming to the area .
Each time he and his neighbors rebuild .
Chicago is the latest incarnation .
Fifty - five percent of the Ivory Coast ’s population is urban , and the proportion is expected to reach 62 percent by 2000 .
The yearly net population growth is 3.6 percent .
This means that the Ivory Coast ’s 13.5 million people will become 39 million by 2025 , when much of the population will consist of urbanized peasants like those of Chicago .
But do n’t count on the Ivory Coast ’s still existing then .
Chicago , which is more indicative of Africa ’s and the Third World ’s demographic present — and even more of the future — than any idyllic junglescape of women balancing earthen jugs on their heads , illustrates why the Ivory Coast , once a model of Third World success , is becoming a case study in Third World catastrophe .
President Felix Houphouet - Boigny , who died last December at the age of about ninety , left behind a weak cluster of political parties and a leaden bureaucracy that discourages foreign investment .
Because the military is small and the non-Ivorian population large , there is neither an obvious force to maintain order nor a sense of nationhood that would lessen the need for such enforcement .
The economy has been shrinking since the mid-1980s .
Though the French are working assiduously to preserve stability , the Ivory Coast faces a possibility worse than a coup : an anarchic implosion of criminal violence — an urbanized version of what has already happened in Somalia .
Or it may become an African Yugoslavia , but one without mini-states to replace the whole .
Because the demographic reality of West Africa is a countryside draining into dense slums by the coast , ultimately the region ’s rulers will come to reflect the values of these shanty - towns .
There are signs of this already in Sierra Leone — and in Togo , where the dictator Etienne Eyadema , in power since 1967 , was nearly toppled in 1991 , not by democrats but by thousands of youths whom the London - based magazine West Africa described as “ Soweto - like stone - throwing adolescents . ”
Their behavior may herald a regime more brutal than Eyadema ’s repressive one .
The fragility of these West African “ countries ” impressed itself on me when I took a series of bush taxis along the Gulf of Guinea , from the Togolese capital of Lome , across Ghana , to Abidjan .
The 400 - mile journey required two full days of driving , because of stops at two border crossings and an additional eleven customs stations , at each of which my fellow passengers had their bags searched .
I had to change money twice and repeatedly fill in currency - declaration forms .
I had to bribe a Togolese immigration official with the equivalent of eighteen dollars before he would agree to put an exit stamp on my passport .
Nevertheless , smuggling across these borders is rampant .
The London Observer has reported that in 1992 the equivalent of $ 856 million left West Africa for Europe in the form of “ hot cash ” assumed to be laundered drug money .
International cartels have discovered the utility of weak , financially strapped West African regimes .
The more fictitious the actual sovereignty , the more severe border authorities seem to be in trying to prove otherwise .
Getting visas for these states can be as hard as crossing their borders .
The Washington embassies of Sierra Leone and Guinea — the two poorest nations on earth , according to a 1993 United Nations report on “ human development ” — asked for letters from my bank ( in lieu of prepaid round - trip tickets ) and also personal references , in order to prove that I had sufficient means to sustain myself during my visits .
I was reminded of my visa and currency hassles while traveling to the communist states of Eastern Europe , particularly East Germany and Czechoslovakia , before those states collapsed .
Ali A. Mazrui , the director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at the State University of New York at Binghamton , predicts that West Africa — indeed , the whole continent — is on the verge of large - scale border upheaval .
Mazrui writes ,
“ In the 21st century France will be withdrawing from West Africa as she gets increasingly involved in the affairs [ of Europe ] .
France ’s West African sphere of influence will be filled by Nigeria — a more natural hegemonic power .
. . .
It will be under those circumstances that Nigeria ’s own boundaries are likely to expand to incorporate the Republic of Niger ( the Hausa link ) , the Republic of Benin ( the Yoruba link ) and conceivably Cameroon . ”
The future could be more tumultuous , and bloodier , than Mazrui dares to say .
France will withdraw from former colonies like Benin , Togo , Niger , and the Ivory Coast , where it has been propping up local currencies .
It will do so not only because its attention will be diverted to new challenges in Europe and Russia but also because younger French officials lack the older generation ’s emotional ties to the ex-colonies .
However , even as Nigeria attempts to expand , it , too , is likely to split into several pieces .
The State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research recently made the following points in an analysis of Nigeria : “ Prospects for a transition to civilian rule and democratization are slim .
. . .
The repressive apparatus of the state security service . . . will be difficult for any future civilian government to control .
. . .
The country is becoming increasingly ungovernable .
. . .
Ethnic and regional splits are deepening , a situation made worse by an increase in the number of states from 19 to 30 and a doubling in the number of local governing authorities ; religious cleavages are more serious ; Muslim fundamentalism and evangelical Christian militancy are on the rise ; and northern Muslim anxiety over southern [ Christian ] control of the economy is intense . . . the will to keep Nigeria together is now very weak . ”
Given that oil - rich Nigeria is a bellwether for the region — its population of roughly 90 million equals the populations of all the other West African states combined — it is apparent that Africa faces cataclysms that could make the Ethiopian and Somalian famines pale in comparison .
This is especially so because Nigeria ’s population , including that of its largest city , Lagos , whose crime , pollution , and overcrowding make it the cliche par excellence of Third World urban dysfunction , is set to double during the next twenty - five years , while the country continues to deplete its natural resources .
Part of West Africa ’s quandary is that although its population belts are horizontal , with habitation densities increasing as one travels south away from the Sahara and toward the tropical abundance of the Atlantic littoral , the borders erected by European colonialists are vertical , and therefore at cross-purposes with demography and topography .
Satellite photos depict the same reality I experienced in the bush taxi : the Lome - Abidjan coastal corridor — indeed , the entire stretch of coast from Abidjan eastward to Lagos — is one burgeoning megalopolis that by any rational economic and geographical standard should constitute a single sovereignty , rather than the five ( the Ivory Coast , Ghana , Togo , Benin , and Nigeria ) into which it is currently divided .
As many internal African borders begin to crumble , a more impenetrable boundary is being erected that threatens to isolate the continent as a whole : the wall of disease .
Merely to visit West Africa in some degree of safety , I spent about $ 500 for a hepatitis B vaccination series and other disease prophylaxis .
Africa may today be more dangerous in this regard than it was in 1862 , before antibiotics , when the explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton described the health situation on the continent as “ deadly , a Golgotha , a Jehannum . ”
Of the approximately 12 million people worldwide whose blood is HIV - positive , 8 million are in Africa .
In the capital of the Ivory Coast , whose modern road system only helps to spread the disease , 10 percent of the population is HIV - positive .
And war and refugee movements help the virus break through to more - remote areas of Africa .
Alan Greenberg , M.D. , a representative of the Centers for Disease Control in Abidjan , explains that in Africa the HIV virus and tuberculosis are now “ fast - forwarding each other . ”
Of the approximately 4,000 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients in Abidjan , 45 percent were also found to be HIV - positive .
As African birth rates soar and slums proliferate , some experts worry that viral mutations and hybridizations might , just conceivably , result in a form of the AIDS virus that is easier to catch than the present strain .
It is malaria that is most responsible for the disease wall that threatens to separate Africa and other parts of the Third World from more - developed regions of the planet in the twenty - first century .
Carried by mosquitoes , malaria , unlike AIDS , is easy to catch .
Most people in sub-Saharan Africa have recurring bouts of the disease throughout their entire lives , and it is mutating into increasingly deadly forms .
“ The great gift of Malaria is utter apathy , ” wrote Sir Richard Burton , accurately portraying the situation in much of the Third World today .
Visitors to malaria - afflicted parts of the planet are protected by a new drug , mefloquine , a side effect of which is vivid , even violent , dreams .
But a strain of cerebral malaria resistant to mefloquine is now on the offensive .
Consequently , defending oneself against malaria in Africa is becoming more and more like defending oneself against violent crime .
You engage in “ behavior modification ” : not going out at dusk , wearing mosquito repellent all the time .
And the cities keep growing .
I got a general sense of the future while driving from the airport to downtown Conakry , the capital of Guinea .
The forty - five - minute journey in heavy traffic was through one never - ending shantytown : a nightmarish Dickensian spectacle to which Dickens himself would never have given credence .
The corrugated metal shacks and scabrous walls were coated with black slime .
Stores were built out of rusted shipping containers , junked cars , and jumbles of wire mesh .
The streets were one long puddle of floating garbage .
Mosquitoes and flies were everywhere .
Children , many of whom had protruding bellies , seemed as numerous as ants .
When the tide went out , dead rats and the skeletons of cars were exposed on the mucky beach .
In twenty - eight years Guinea ’s population will double if growth goes on at current rates .
Hardwood logging continues at a madcap speed , and people flee the Guinean countryside for Conakry .
It seemed to me that here , as elsewhere in Africa and the Third World , man is challenging nature far beyond its limits , and nature is now beginning to take its revenge .
Africa may be as relevant to the future character of world politics as the Balkans were a hundred years ago , prior to the two Balkan wars and the First World War .
Then the threat was the collapse of empires and the birth of nations based solely on tribe .
Now the threat is more elemental : nature unchecked .
Africa ’s immediate future could be very bad .
The coming upheaval , in which foreign embassies are shut down , states collapse , and contact with the outside world takes place through dangerous , disease - ridden coastal trading posts , will loom large in the century we are entering .
( Nine of twenty - one U.S. foreign - aid missions to be closed over the next three years are in Africa — a prologue to a consolidation of U.S. embassies themselves . )
Precisely because much of Africa is set to go over the edge at a time when the Cold War has ended , when environmental and demographic stress in other parts of the globe is becoming critical , and when the post - First World War system of nation - states — not just in the Balkans but perhaps also in the Middle East — is about to be toppled , Africa suggests what war , borders , and ethnic politics will be like a few decades hence .
To understand the events of the next fifty years , then , one must understand environmental scarcity , cultural and racial clash , geographic destiny , and the transformation of war .
The order in which I have named these is not accidental .
Each concept except the first relies partly on the one or ones before it , meaning that the last two — new approaches to mapmaking and to warfare — are the most important .
They are also the least understood .
I will now look at each idea , drawing upon the work of specialists and also my own travel experiences in various parts of the globe besides Africa , in order to fill in the blanks of a new political atlas .
The Environment as a Hostile Power
For a while the media will continue to ascribe riots and other violent upheavals abroad mainly to ethnic and religious conflict .
But as these conflicts multiply , it will become apparent that something else is afoot , making more and more places like Nigeria , India , and Brazil ungovernable .
Mention The Environment or “ diminishing natural resources ” in foreign - policy circles and you meet a brick wall of skepticism or boredom .
To conservatives especially , the very terms seem flaky .
Public - policy foundations have contributed to the lack of interest , by funding narrowly focused environmental studies replete with technical jargon which foreign - affairs experts just let pile up on their desks .
It is time to understand The Environment for what it is : the national - security issue of the early twenty - first century .
The political and strategic impact of surging populations , spreading disease , deforestation and soil erosion , water depletion , air pollution , and , possibly , rising sea levels in critical , overcrowded regions like the Nile Delta and Bangladesh — developments that will prompt mass migrations and , in turn , incite group conflicts — will be the core foreign - policy challenge from which most others will ultimately emanate , arousing the public and uniting assorted interests left over from the Cold War .
In the twenty - first century water will be in dangerously short supply in such diverse locales as Saudi Arabia , Central Asia , and the southwestern United States .
A war could erupt between Egypt and Ethiopia over Nile River water .
Even in Europe tensions have arisen between Hungary and Slovakia over the damming of the Danube , a classic case of how environmental disputes fuse with ethnic and historical ones .
The political scientist and erstwhile Clinton adviser Michael Mandelbaum has said , “ We have a foreign policy today in the shape of a doughnut — lots of peripheral interests but nothing at the center . ”
The environment , I will argue , is part of a terrifying array of problems that will define a new threat to our security , filling the hole in Mandelbaum ’s doughnut and allowing a post - Cold War foreign policy to emerge inexorably by need rather than by design .
Our Cold War foreign policy truly began with George F. Kennan ’s famous article , signed “ X , ” published in Foreign Affairs in July of 1947 , in which Kennan argued for a “ firm and vigilant containment ” of a Soviet Union that was imperially , rather than ideologically , motivated .
It may be that our post - Cold War foreign policy will one day be seen to have had its beginnings in an even bolder and more detailed piece of written analysis : one that appeared in the journal International Security .
The article , published in the fall of 1991 by Thomas Fraser Homer - Dixon , who is the head of the Peace and Conflict Studies Program at the University of Toronto , was titled “ On the Threshold : Environmental Changes as Causes of Acute Conflict . ”
Homer - Dixon has , more successfully than other analysts , integrated two hitherto separate fields — military - conflict studies and the study of the physical environment .
In Homer - Dixon ’s view , future wars and civil violence will often arise from scarcities of resources such as water , cropland , forests , and fish .
Just as there will be environmentally driven wars and refugee flows , there will be environmentally induced praetorian regimes — or , as he puts it , “ hard regimes . ”
Countries with the highest probability of acquiring hard regimes , according to Homer - Dixon , are those that are threatened by a declining resource base yet also have “ a history of state [ read ‘ military ’ ] strength . ”
Candidates include Indonesia , Brazil , and , of course , Nigeria .
Though each of these nations has exhibited democratizing tendencies of late , Homer - Dixon argues that such tendencies are likely to be superficial “ epiphenomena ” having nothing to do with long - term processes that include soaring populations and shrinking raw materials .
Democracy is problematic ; scarcity is more certain .
Indeed , the Saddam Husseins of the future will have more , not fewer , opportunities .
In addition to engendering tribal strife , scarcer resources will place a great strain on many peoples who never had much of a democratic or institutional tradition to begin with .
Over the next fifty years the earth ’s population will soar from 5.5 billion to more than nine billion .
Though optimists have hopes for new resource technologies and free - market development in the global village , they fail to note that , as the National Academy of Sciences has pointed out , 95 percent of the population increase will be in the poorest regions of the world , where governments now — just look at Africa — show little ability to function , let alone to implement even marginal improvements .
Homer - Dixon writes , ominously , “ Neo -Malthusians may underestimate human adaptability in today ’s environmental - social system , but as time passes their analysis may become ever more compelling . ”
While a minority of the human population will be , as Francis Fukuyama would put it , sufficiently sheltered so as to enter a “ post - historical ” realm , living in cities and suburbs in which the environment has been mastered and ethnic animosities have been quelled by bourgeois prosperity , an increasingly large number of people will be stuck in history , living in shantytowns where attempts to rise above poverty , cultural dysfunction , and ethnic strife will be doomed by a lack of water to drink , soil to till , and space to survive in .
In the developing world environmental stress will present people with a choice that is increasingly among totalitarianism ( as in Iraq ) , fascist - tending mini-states ( as in Serb - held Bosnia ) , and road - warrior cultures ( as in Somalia ) .
Homer - Dixon concludes that “ as environmental degradation proceeds , the size of the potential social disruption will increase . ”
Tad Homer - Dixon is an unlikely Jeremiah .
Today a boyish thirty - seven , he grew up amid the sylvan majesty of Vancouver Island , attending private day schools .
His speech is calm , perfectly even , and crisply enunciated .
There is nothing in his background or manner that would indicate a bent toward pessimism .
A Canadian Anglican who spends his summers canoeing on the lakes of northern Ontario , and who talks about the benign mountains , black bears , and Douglas firs of his youth , he is the opposite of the intellectually severe neoconservative , the kind at home with conflict scenarios .
Nor is he an environmentalist who opposes development .
“ My father was a logger who thought about ecologically safe forestry before others , ” he says .
“ He logged , planted , logged , and planted .
He got out of the business just as the issue was being polarized by environmentalists .
They hate changed ecosystems .
But human beings , just by carrying seeds around , change the natural world . ”
As an only child whose playground was a virtually untouched wilderness and seacoast , Homer - Dixon has a familiarity with the natural world that permits him to see a reality that most policy analysts — children of suburbia and city streets — are blind to .
“ We need to bring nature back in , ” he argues .
“ We have to stop separating politics from the physical world — the climate , public health , and the environment . ”
Quoting Daniel Deudney , another pioneering expert on the security aspects of the environment , Homer - Dixon says that “ for too long we ’ve been prisoners of ‘ social - social ’ theory , which assumes there are only social causes for social and political changes , rather than natural causes , too .
This social - social mentality emerged with the Industrial Revolution , which separated us from nature .
But nature is coming back with a vengeance , tied to population growth .
It will have incredible security implications .
“ Think of a stretch limo in the potholed streets of New York City , where homeless beggars live .
Inside the limo are the air - conditioned post - industrial regions of North America , Europe , the emerging Pacific Rim , and a few other isolated places , with their trade summitry and computer - information highways .
Outside is the rest of mankind , going in a completely different direction . ”
We are entering a bifurcated world .
Part of the globe is inhabited by Hegel ’s and Fukuyama ’s Last Man , healthy , well fed , and pampered by technology .
The other , larger , part is inhabited by Hobbes ’s First Man , condemned to a life that is “ poor , nasty , brutish , and short . ”
Although both parts will be threatened by environmental stress , the Last Man will be able to master it ; the First Man will not .
The Last Man will adjust to the loss of underground water tables in the western United States .
He will build dikes to save Cape Hatteras and the Chesapeake beaches from rising sea levels , even as the Maldive Islands , off the coast of India , sink into oblivion , and the shorelines of Egypt , Bangladesh , and Southeast Asia recede , driving tens of millions of people inland where there is no room for them , and thus sharpening ethnic divisions .
Homer - Dixon points to a world map of soil degradation in his Toronto office .
“ The darker the map color , the worse the degradation , ” he explains .
The West African coast , the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent , China , and Central America have the darkest shades , signifying all manner of degradation , related to winds , chemicals , and water problems .
“ The worst degradation is generally where the population is highest .
The population is generally highest where the soil is the best .
So we ’re degrading earth ’s best soil . ”
China , in Homer - Dixon ’s view , is the quintessential example of environmental degradation .
Its current economic “ success ” masks deeper problems .
“ China ’s fourteen percent growth rate does not mean it ’s going to be a world power .
It means that coastal China , where the economic growth is taking place , is joining the rest of the Pacific Rim .
The disparity with inland China is intensifying . ”
Referring to the environmental research of his colleague , the Czech - born ecologist Vaclav Smil , Homer - Dixon explains how the per capita availability of arable land in interior China has rapidly declined at the same time that the quality of that land has been destroyed by deforestation , loss of topsoil , and salinization .
He mentions the loss and contamination of water supplies , the exhaustion of wells , the plugging of irrigation systems and reservoirs with eroded silt , and a population of 1.54 billion by the year 2025 : it is a misconception that China has gotten its population under control .
Large - scale population movements are under way , from inland China to coastal China and from villages to cities , leading to a crime surge like the one in Africa and to growing regional disparities and conflicts in a land with a strong tradition of warlordism and a weak tradition of central government — again as in Africa .
“ We will probably see the center challenged and fractured , and China will not remain the same on the map , ” Homer - Dixon says .
Environmental scarcity will inflame existing hatreds and affect power relationships , at which we now look .
Skinhead Cossacks , Juju Warriors
In the summer , 1993 , issue of Foreign Affairs , Samuel P. Huntington , of Harvard ’s Olin Institute for Strategic Studies , published a thought - provoking article called “ The Clash of Civilizations ? ”
The world , he argues , has been moving during the course of this century from nation - state conflict to ideological conflict to , finally , cultural conflict .
I would add that as refugee flows increase and as peasants continue migrating to cities around the world — turning them into sprawling villages — national borders will mean less , even as more power will fall into the hands of less educated , less sophisticated groups .
In the eyes of these uneducated but newly empowered millions , the real borders are the most tangible and intractable ones : those of culture and tribe .
Huntington writes , “ First , differences among civilizations are not only real ; they are basic , ” involving , among other things , history , language , and religion .
“ Second . . . interactions between peoples of different civilizations are increasing ; these increasing interactions intensify civilization consciousness . ”
Economic modernization is not necessarily a panacea , since it fuels individual and group ambitions while weakening traditional loyalties to the state .
It is worth noting , for example , that it is precisely the wealthiest and fastest - developing city in India , Bombay , that has seen the worst intercommunal violence between Hindus and Muslims .
Consider that Indian cities , like African and Chinese ones , are ecological time bombs — Delhi and Calcutta , and also Beijing , suffer the worst air quality of any cities in the world — and it is apparent how surging populations , environmental degradation , and ethnic conflict are deeply related .
Huntington points to interlocking conflicts among Hindu , Muslim , Slavic Orthodox , Western , Japanese , Confucian , Latin American , and possibly African civilizations : for instance , Hindus clashing with Muslims in India , Turkic Muslims clashing with Slavic Orthodox Russians in Central Asian cities , the West clashing with Asia .
( Even in the United States , African - Americans find themselves besieged by an influx of competing Latinos . )
Whatever the laws , refugees find a way to crash official borders , bringing their passions with them , meaning that Europe and the United States will be weakened by cultural disputes .
Because Huntington ’s brush is broad , his specifics are vulnerable to attack .
In a rebuttal of Huntington ’s argument the Johns Hopkins professor Fouad Ajami , a Lebanese - born Shi’ite who certainly knows the world beyond suburbia , writes in the September - October , 1993 , issue of Foreign Affairs , “ The world of Islam divides and subdivides .
The battle lines in the Caucasus . . . are not coextensive with civilizational fault lines .
The lines follow the interests of states .
Where Huntington sees a civilizational duel between Armenia and Azerbaijan , the Iranian state has cast religious zeal . . . to the wind . . . in that battle the Iranians have tilted toward Christian Armenia . ”
True , Huntington ’s hypothesized war between Islam and Orthodox Christianity is not borne out by the alliance network in the Caucasus .
But that is only because he has misidentified which cultural war is occurring there .
A recent visit to Azerbaijan made clear to me that Azeri Turks , the world ’s most secular Shi’ite Muslims , see their cultural identity in terms not of religion but of their Turkic race .
The Armenians , likewise , fight the Azeris not because the latter are Muslims but because they are Turks , related to the same Turks who massacred Armenians in 1915 .
Turkic culture ( secular and based on languages employing a Latin script ) is battling Iranian culture ( religiously militant as defined by Tehran , and wedded to an Arabic script ) across the whole swath of Central Asia and the Caucasus .
The Armenians are , therefore , natural allies of their fellow Indo - Europeans the Iranians .
Huntington is correct that the Caucasus is a flashpoint of cultural and racial war .
But , as Ajami observes , Huntington ’s plate tectonics are too simple .
Two months of recent travel throughout Turkey revealed to me that although the Turks are developing a deep distrust , bordering on hatred , of fellow - Muslim Iran , they are also , especially in the shantytowns that are coming to dominate Turkish public opinion , revising their group identity , increasingly seeing themselves as Muslims being deserted by a West that does little to help besieged Muslims in Bosnia and that attacks Turkish Muslims in the streets of Germany .
In other words , the Balkans , a powder keg for nation - state war at the beginning of the twentieth century , could be a powder keg for cultural war at the turn of the twenty - first : between Orthodox Christianity ( represented by the Serbs and a classic Byzantine configuration of Greeks , Russians , and Romanians ) and the House of Islam .
Yet in the Caucasus that House of Islam is falling into a clash between Turkic and Iranian civilizations .
Ajami asserts that this very subdivision , not to mention all the divisions within the Arab world , indicates that the West , including the United States , is not threatened by Huntington ’s scenario .
As the Gulf War demonstrated , the West has proved capable of playing one part of the House of Islam against another .
True .
However , whether he is aware of it or not , Ajami is describing a world even more dangerous than the one Huntington envisions , especially when one takes into account Homer - Dixon ’s research on environmental scarcity .
Outside the stretch limo would be a rundown , crowded planet of skinhead Cossacks and juju warriors , influenced by the worst refuse of Western pop culture and ancient tribal hatreds , and battling over scraps of overused earth in guerrilla conflicts that ripple across continents and intersect in no discernible pattern — meaning there ’s no easy - to - define threat .
Kennan ’s world of one adversary seems as distant as the world of Herodotus .
Most people believe that the political earth since 1989 has undergone immense change .
But it is minor compared with what is yet to come .
The breaking apart and remaking of the atlas is only now beginning .
The crack - up of the Soviet empire and the coming end of Arab - Israeli military confrontation are merely prologues to the really big changes that lie ahead .
Michael Vlahos , a long - range thinker for the U.S. Navy , warns , “ We are not in charge of the environment and the world is not following us .
It is going in many directions .
Do not assume that democratic capitalism is the last word in human social evolution . ”
Before addressing the questions of maps and of warfare , I want to take a closer look at the interaction of religion , culture , demographic shifts , and the distribution of natural resources in a specific area of the world : the Middle East .
The Past is Dead
Built on steep , muddy hills , the shantytowns of Ankara , the Turkish capital , exude visual drama .
Altindag , or “ Golden Mountain , ” is a pyramid of dreams , fashioned from cinder blocks and corrugated iron , rising as though each shack were built on top of another , all reaching awkwardly and painfully toward heaven — the heaven of wealthier Turks who live elsewhere in the city .
Nowhere else on the planet have I found such a poignant architectural symbol of man ’s striving , with gaps in house walls plugged with rusted cans , and leeks and onions growing on verandas assembled from planks of rotting wood .
For reasons that I will explain , the Turkish shacktown is a psychological universe away from the African one .
To see the twenty - first century truly , one ’s eyes must learn a different set of aesthetics .
One must reject the overly stylized images of travel magazines , with their inviting photographs of exotic villages and glamorous downtowns .
There are far too many millions whose dreams are more vulgar , more real — whose raw energies and desires will overwhelm the visions of the elites , remaking the future into something frighteningly new .
But in Turkey I learned that shantytowns are not all bad .
Slum quarters in Abidjan terrify and repel the outsider .
In Turkey it is the opposite .
The closer I got to Golden Mountain the better it looked , and the safer I felt .
I had $ 1,500 worth of Turkish lira in one pocket and $ 1,000 in traveler ’s checks in the other , yet I felt no fear .
Golden Mountain was a real neighborhood .
The inside of one house told the story :
The architectural bedlam of cinder block and sheet metal and cardboard walls was deceiving .
Inside was a home — order , that is , bespeaking dignity .
I saw a working refrigerator , a television , a wall cabinet with a few books and lots of family pictures , a few plants by a window , and a stove .
Though the streets become rivers of mud when it rains , the floors inside this house were spotless .
Other houses were like this too .
Schoolchildren ran along with briefcases strapped to their backs , trucks delivered cooking gas , a few men sat inside a cafe sipping tea .
One man sipped beer .
Alcohol is easy to obtain in Turkey , a secular state where 99 percent of the population is Muslim .
Yet there is little problem of alcoholism .
Crime against persons is infinitesimal .
Poverty and illiteracy are watered - down versions of what obtains in Algeria and Egypt ( to say nothing of West Africa ) , making it that much harder for religious extremists to gain a foothold .
My point in bringing up a rather wholesome , crime - free slum is this : its existence demonstrates how formidable is the fabric of which Turkish Muslim culture is made .
A culture this strong has the potential to dominate the Middle East once again .
Slums are litmus tests for innate cultural strengths and weaknesses .
Those peoples whose cultures can harbor extensive slum life without decomposing will be , relatively speaking , the future ’s winners .
Those whose cultures cannot will be the future ’s victims .
Slums — in the sociological sense — do not exist in Turkish cities .
The mortar between people and family groups is stronger here than in Africa .
Resurgent Islam and Turkic cultural identity have produced a civilization with natural muscle tone .
Turks , history ’s perennial nomads , take disruption in stride .
The future of the Middle East is quietly being written inside the heads of Golden Mountain ’s inhabitants .
Think of an Ottoman military encampment on the eve of the destruction of Greek Constantinople in 1453 .
That is Golden Mountain .
“ We brought the village here .
But in the village we worked harder — in the field , all day .
So we could n’t fast during [ the holy month of ] Ramadan .
Here we fast .
Here we are more religious . ”
Aishe Tanrikulu , along with half a dozen other women , was stuffing rice into vine leaves from a crude plastic bowl .
She asked me to join her under the shade of a piece of sheet metal .
Each of these women had her hair covered by a kerchief .
In the city they were encountering television for the first time .
“ We are traditional , religious people .
The programs offend us , ” Aishe said .
Another woman complained about the schools .
Though her children had educational options unavailable in the village , they had to compete with wealthier , secular Turks .
“ The kids from rich families with connections — they get all the places . ”
More opportunities , more tensions , in other words .
My guidebook to Golden Mountain was an untypical one : Tales From the Garbage Hills , a brutally realistic novel by a Turkish writer , Latife Tekin , about life in the shantytowns , which in Turkey are called gecekondus ( “ built in a night ” ) .
“ He listened to the earth and wept unceasingly for water , for work and for the cure of the illnesses spread by the garbage and the factory waste , ” Tekin writes .
In the most revealing passage of Tales From the Garbage Hills the squatters are told “ about a certain ‘ Ottoman Empire ’ . . . that where they now lived there had once been an empire of this name . ”
This history “ confounded ” the squatters .
It was the first they had heard of it .
Though one of them knew “ that his grandfather and his dog died fighting the Greeks , ” nationalism and an encompassing sense of Turkish history are the province of the Turkish middle and upper classes , and of foreigners like me who feel required to have a notion of “ Turkey . ”
But what did the Golden Mountain squatters know about the armies of Turkish migrants that had come before their own — namely , Seljuks and Ottomans ?
For these recently urbanized peasants , and their counterparts in Africa , the Arab world , India , and so many other places , the world is new , to adapt V. S. Naipaul ’s phrase .
As Naipaul wrote of urban refugees in India : A Wounded Civilization , “ They saw themselves at the beginning of things : unaccommodated men making a claim on their land for the first time , and out of chaos evolving their own philosophy of community and self - help .
For them the past was dead ; they had left it behind in the villages . ”
Everywhere in the developing world at the turn of the twenty - first century these new men and women , rushing into the cities , are remaking civilizations and redefining their identities in terms of religion and tribal ethnicity which do not coincide with the borders of existing states .
In Turkey several things are happening at once .
In 1980 , 44 percent of Turks lived in cities ; in 1990 it was 61 percent .
By the year 2000 the figure is expected to be 67 percent .
Villages are emptying out as concentric rings of gecekondu developments grow around Turkish cities .
This is the real political and demographic revolution in Turkey and elsewhere , and foreign correspondents usually do n’t write about it .
Whereas rural poverty is age - old and almost a “ normal ” part of the social fabric , urban poverty is socially destabilizing .
As Iran has shown , Islamic extremism is the psychological defense mechanism of many urbanized peasants threatened with the loss of traditions in pseudo - modern cities where their values are under attack , where basic services like water and electricity are unavailable , and where they are assaulted by a physically unhealthy environment .
The American ethnologist and orientalist Carleton Stevens Coon wrote in 1951 that Islam “ has made possible the optimum survival and happiness of millions of human beings in an increasingly impoverished environment over a fourteen - hundred - year period . ”
Beyond its stark , clearly articulated message , Islam ’s very militancy makes it attractive to the downtrodden .
It is the one religion that is prepared to fight .
A political era driven by environmental stress , increased cultural sensitivity , unregulated urbanization , and refugee migrations is an era divinely created for the spread and intensification of Islam , already the world ’s fastest - growing religion .
( Though Islam is spreading in West Africa , it is being hobbled by syncretization with animism : this makes new converts less apt to become anti-Western extremists , but it also makes for a weakened version of the faith , which is less effective as an antidote to crime . )
In Turkey , however , Islam is painfully and awkwardly forging a consensus with modernization , a trend that is less apparent in the Arab and Persian worlds ( and virtually invisible in Africa ) .
In Iran the oil boom — because it put development and urbanization on a fast track , making the culture shock more intense — fueled the 1978 Islamic Revolution .
But Turkey , unlike Iran and the Arab world , has little oil .
Therefore its development and urbanization have been more gradual .
Islamists have been integrated into the parliamentary system for decades .
The tensions I noticed in Golden Mountain are natural , creative ones : the kind immigrants face the world over .
While the world has focused on religious perversity in Algeria , a nation rich in natural gas , and in Egypt , parts of whose capital city , Cairo , evince worse crowding than I have seen even in Calcutta , Turkey has been living through the Muslim equivalent of the Protestant Reformation .
Resource distribution is strengthening Turks in another way vis-a - vis Arabs and Persians .
Turks may have little oil , but their Anatolian heartland has lots of water — the most important fluid of the twenty - first century .
Turkey ’s Southeast Anatolia Project , involving twenty - two major dams and irrigation systems , is impounding the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers .
Much of the water that Arabs and perhaps Israelis will need to drink in the future is controlled by Turks .
The project ’s centerpiece is the mile - wide , sixteen - story Ataturk Dam , upon which are emblazoned the words of modern Turkey ’s founder : “ Ne Mutlu Turkum Diyene ” ( “ Lucky is the one who is a Turk ” ) .
Unlike Egypt ’s Aswan High Dam , on the Nile , and Syria ’s Revolution Dam , on the Euphrates , both of which were built largely by Russians , the Ataturk Dam is a predominantly Turkish affair , with Turkish engineers and companies in charge .
On a recent visit my eyes took in the immaculate offices and their gardens , the high - voltage electric grids and phone switching stations , the dizzying sweep of giant humming transformers , the poured - concrete spillways , and the prim unfolding suburbia , complete with schools , for dam employees .
The emerging power of the Turks was palpable .
Erduhan Bayindir , the site manager at the dam , told me that “ while oil can be shipped abroad to enrich only elites , water has to be spread more evenly within the society .
. . .
It is true , we can stop the flow of water into Syria and Iraq for up to eight months without the same water overflowing our dams , in order to regulate their political behavior . ”
Power is certainly moving north in the Middle East , from the oil fields of Dhahran , on the Persian Gulf , to the water plain of Harran , in southern Anatolia — near the site of the Ataturk Dam .
But will the nation - state of Turkey , as presently constituted , be the inheritor of this wealth ?
I very much doubt it .
The Lies of Mapmakers
Whereas West Africa represents the least stable part of political reality outside Homer - Dixon ’s stretch limo , Turkey , an organic outgrowth of two Turkish empires that ruled Anatolia for 850 years , has been among the most stable .
Turkey ’s borders were established not by colonial powers but in a war of independence , in the early 1920s .
Kemal Ataturk provided Turkey with a secular nation - building myth that most Arab and African states , burdened by artificially drawn borders , lack .
That lack will leave many Arab states defenseless against a wave of Islam that will eat away at their legitimacy and frontiers in coming years .
Yet even as regards Turkey , maps deceive .
It is not only African shantytowns that do n’t appear on urban maps .
Many shantytowns in Turkey and elsewhere are also missing — as are the considerable territories controlled by guerrilla armies and urban mafias .
Traveling with Eritrean guerrillas in what , according to the map , was northern Ethiopia , traveling in “ northern Iraq ” with Kurdish guerrillas , and staying in a hotel in the Caucasus controlled by a local mafia — to say nothing of my experiences in West Africa — led me to develop a healthy skepticism toward maps , which , I began to realize , create a conceptual barrier that prevents us from comprehending the political crack - up just beginning to occur worldwide .
Consider the map of the world , with its 190 or so countries , each signified by a bold and uniform color : this map , with which all of us have grown up , is generally an invention of modernism , specifically of European colonialism .
Modernism , in the sense of which I speak , began with the rise of nation - states in Europe and was confirmed by the death of feudalism at the end of the Thirty Years ’
War — an event that was interposed between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , which together gave birth to modern science .
People were suddenly flush with an enthusiasm to categorize , to define .
The map , based on scientific techniques of measurement , offered a way to classify new national organisms , making a jigsaw puzzle of neat pieces without transition zones between them .
Frontier is itself a modern concept that did n’t exist in the feudal mind .
And as European nations carved out far - flung domains at the same time that print technology was making the reproduction of maps cheaper , cartography came into its own as a way of creating facts by ordering the way we look at the world .
In his book Imagined Communities : Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism , Benedict Anderson , of Cornell University , demonstrates that the map enabled colonialists to think about their holdings in terms of a “ totalizing classificatory grid .
. . .
It was bounded , determinate , and therefore — in principle — countable . ”
To the colonialist , country maps were the equivalent of an accountant ’s ledger books .
Maps , Anderson explains , “ shaped the grammar ” that would make possible such questionable concepts as Iraq , Indonesia , Sierra Leone , and Nigeria .
The state , recall , is a purely Western notion , one that until the twentieth century applied to countries covering only three percent of the earth ’s land area .
Nor is the evidence compelling that the state , as a governing ideal , can be successfully transported to areas outside the industrialized world .
Even the United States of America , in the words of one of our best living poets , Gary Snyder , consists of “ arbitrary and inaccurate impositions on what is really here . ”
Yet this inflexible , artificial reality staggers on , not only in the United Nations but in various geographic and travel publications ( themselves by - products of an age of elite touring which colonialism made possible ) that still report on and photograph the world according to “ country . ”
Newspapers , this magazine , and this writer are not innocent of the tendency .
According to the map , the great hydropower complex emblemized by the Ataturk Dam is situated in Turkey .
Forget the map .
This southeastern region of Turkey is populated almost completely by Kurds .
About half of the world ’s 20 million Kurds live in “ Turkey . ”
The Kurds are predominant in an ellipse of territory that overlaps not only with Turkey but also with Iraq , Iran , Syria , and the former Soviet Union .
The Western - enforced Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq , a consequence of the 1991 Gulf War , has already exposed the fictitious nature of that supposed nation - state .
On a recent visit to the Turkish - Iranian border , it occurred to me what a risky idea the nation - state is .
Here I was on the legal fault line between two clashing civilizations , Turkic and Iranian .
Yet the reality was more subtle : as in West Africa , the border was porous and smuggling abounded , but here the people doing the smuggling , on both sides of the border , were Kurds .
In such a moonscape , over which peoples have migrated and settled in patterns that obliterate borders , the end of the Cold War will bring on a cruel process of natural selection among existing states .
No longer will these states be so firmly propped up by the West or the Soviet Union .
Because the Kurds overlap with nearly everybody in the Middle East , on account of their being cheated out of a state in the post - First World War peace treaties , they are emerging , in effect , as the natural selector — the ultimate reality check .
They have destabilized Iraq and may continue to disrupt states that do not offer them adequate breathing space , while strengthening states that do .
Because the Turks , owing to their water resources , their growing economy , and the social cohesion evinced by the most crime - free slums I have encountered , are on the verge of big - power status , and because the 10 million Kurds within Turkey threaten that status , the outcome of the Turkish - Kurdish dispute will be more critical to the future of the Middle East than the eventual outcome of the recent Israeli - Palestinian agreement .
America ’s fascination with the Israeli - Palestinian issue , coupled with its lack of interest in the Turkish - Kurdish one , is a function of its own domestic and ethnic obsessions , not of the cartographic reality that is about to transform the Middle East .
The diplomatic process involving Israelis and Palestinians will , I believe , have little effect on the early - and mid-twenty - first - century map of the region .
Israel , with a 6.6 percent economic growth rate based increasingly on high - tech exports , is about to enter Homer - Dixon ’s stretch limo , fortified by a well - defined political community that is an organic outgrowth of history and ethnicity .
Like prosperous and peaceful Japan on the one hand , and war - torn and poverty - wracked Armenia on the other , Israel is a classic national - ethnic organism .
Much of the Arab world , however , will undergo alteration , as Islam spreads across artificial frontiers , fueled by mass migrations into the cities and a soaring birth rate of more than 3.2 percent .
Seventy percent of the Arab population has been born since 1970 — youths with little historical memory of anticolonial independence struggles , postcolonial attempts at nation - building , or any of the Arab - Israeli wars .
The most distant recollection of these youths will be the West ’s humiliation of colonially invented Iraq in 1991 .
Today seventeen out of twenty - two Arab states have a declining gross national product ; in the next twenty years , at current growth rates , the population of many Arab countries will double .
These states , like most African ones , will be ungovernable through conventional secular ideologies .
The Middle East analyst Christine M. Helms explains , “ Declaring Arab nationalism “ bankrupt , ” the political “ disinherited ” are not rationalizing the failure of Arabism . . . or reformulating it .
Alternative solutions are not contemplated .
They have simply opted for the political paradigm at the other end of the political spectrum with which they are familiar — Islam . ”
Like the borders of West Africa , the colonial borders of Syria , Iraq , Jordan , Algeria , and other Arab states are often contrary to cultural and political reality .
As state control mechanisms wither in the face of environmental and demographic stress , “ hard ” Islamic city - states or shantytown - states are likely to emerge .
The fiction that the impoverished city of Algiers , on the Mediterranean , controls Tamanrasset , deep in the Algerian Sahara , cannot obtain forever .
Whatever the outcome of the peace process , Israel is destined to be a Jewish ethnic fortress amid a vast and volatile realm of Islam .
In that realm , the violent youth culture of the Gaza shantytowns may be indicative of the coming era .
The destiny of Turks and Kurds is far less certain , but far more relevant to the kind of map that will explain our future world .
The Kurds suggest a geographic reality that cannot be shown in two - dimensional space .
The issue in Turkey is not simply a matter of giving autonomy or even independence to Kurds in the southeast .
This is n’t the Balkans or the Caucasus , where regions are merely subdividing into smaller units , Abkhazia breaking off from Georgia , and so on .
Federalism is not the answer .
Kurds are found everywhere in Turkey , including the shanty districts of Istanbul and Ankara .
Turkey ’s problem is that its Anatolian land mass is the home of two cultures and languages , Turkish and Kurdish .
Identity in Turkey , as in India , Africa , and elsewhere , is more complex and subtle than conventional cartography can display .
A New Kind of War
To appreciate fully the political and cartographic implications of postmodernism — an epoch of themeless juxtapositions , in which the classificatory grid of nation - states is going to be replaced by a jagged - glass pattern of city - states , shanty - states , nebulous and anarchic regionalisms — it is necessary to consider , finally , the whole question of war .
“ Oh , what a relief to fight , to fight enemies who defend themselves , enemies who are awake ! ” Andre Malraux wrote in Man ’s Fate .
I cannot think of a more suitable battle cry for many combatants in the early decades of the twenty - first century .
The intense savagery of the fighting in such diverse cultural settings as Liberia , Bosnia , the Caucasus , and Sri Lanka — to say nothing of what obtains in American inner cities — indicates something very troubling that those of us inside the stretch limo , concerned with issues like middle - class entitlements and the future of interactive cable television , lack the stomach to contemplate .
It is this : a large number of people on this planet , to whom the comfort and stability of a middle - class life is utterly unknown , find war and a barracks existence a step up rather than a step down .
“ Just as it makes no sense to ask ‘ why people eat ’ or ‘ what they sleep for , ' ” writes Martin van Creveld , a military historian at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , in The Transformation of War , “ so fighting in many ways is not a means but an end .
Throughout history , for every person who has expressed his horror of war there is another who found in it the most marvelous of all the experiences that are vouchsafed to man , even to the point that he later spent a lifetime boring his descendants by recounting his exploits . ”
When I asked Pentagon officials about the nature of war in the twenty - first century , the answer I frequently got was “ Read Van Creveld . ”
The top brass are enamored of this historian not because his writings justify their existence but , rather , the opposite : Van Creveld warns them that huge state military machines like the Pentagon ’s are dinosaurs about to go extinct , and that something far more terrible awaits us .
The degree to which Van Creveld ’s Transformation of War complements Homer - Dixon ’s work on the environment , Huntington ’s thoughts on cultural clash , my own realizations in traveling by foot , bus , and bush taxi in more than sixty countries , and America ’s sobering comeuppances in intractable - culture zones like Haiti and Somalia is startling .
The book begins by demolishing the notion that men do n’t like to fight .
“ By compelling the senses to focus themselves on the here and now , ” Van Creveld writes , war “ can cause a man to take his leave of them . ”
As anybody who has had experience with Chetniks in Serbia , “ technicals ” in Somalia , Tontons Macoutes in Haiti , or soldiers in Sierra Leone can tell you , in places where the Western Enlightenment has not penetrated and where there has always been mass poverty , people find liberation in violence .
In Afghanistan and elsewhere , I vicariously experienced this phenomenon : worrying about mines and ambushes frees you from worrying about mundane details of daily existence .
If my own experience is too subjective , there is a wealth of data showing the sheer frequency of war , especially in the developing world since the Second World War .
Physical aggression is a part of being human .
Only when people attain a certain economic , educational , and cultural standard is this trait tranquilized .
In light of the fact that 95 percent of the earth ’s population growth will be in the poorest areas of the globe , the question is not whether there will be war ( there will be a lot of it ) but what kind of war .
And who will fight whom ?
Debunking the great military strategist Carl von Clausewitz , Van Creveld , who may be the most original thinker on war since that early - nineteenth - century Prussian , writes , “ Clausewitz ’s ideas . . . were wholly rooted in the fact that , ever since 1648 , war had been waged overwhelmingly by states . ”
But , as Van Creveld explains , the period of nation - states and , therefore , of state conflict is now ending , and with it the clear “ threefold division into government , army , and people ” which state - directed wars enforce .
Thus , to see the future , the first step is to look back to the past immediately prior to the birth of modernism — the wars in medieval Europe which began during the Reformation and reached their culmination in the Thirty Years ’
War .
Van Creveld writes ,
“ In all these struggles political , social , economic , and religious motives were hopelessly entangled .
Since this was an age when armies consisted of mercenaries , all were also attended by swarms of military entrepreneurs .
. . .
Many of them paid little but lip service to the organizations for whom they had contracted to fight .
Instead , they robbed the countryside on their own behalf .
. . . ”
“ Given such conditions , any fine distinctions . . . between armies on the one hand and peoples on the other were bound to break down .
Engulfed by war , civilians suffered terrible atrocities . ”
Back then , in other words , there was no Politics as we have come to understand the term , just as there is less and less Politics today in Liberia , Sierra Leone , Somalia , Sri Lanka , the Balkans , and the Caucasus , among other places .
Because , as Van Creveld notes , the radius of trust within tribal societies is narrowed to one ’s immediate family and guerrilla comrades , truces arranged with one Bosnian commander , say , may be broken immediately by another Bosnian commander .
The plethora of short - lived ceasefires in the Balkans and the Caucasus constitute proof that we are no longer in a world where the old rules of state warfare apply .
More evidence is provided by the destruction of medieval monuments in the Croatian port of Dubrovnik : when cultures , rather than states , fight , then cultural and religious monuments are weapons of war , making them fair game .
Also , war - making entities will no longer be restricted to a specific territory .
Loose and shadowy organisms such as Islamic terrorist organizations suggest why borders will mean increasingly little and sedimentary layers of tribalistic identity and control will mean more .
“ From the vantage point of the present , there appears every prospect that religious . . . fanaticisms will play a larger role in the motivation of armed conflict ” in the West than at any time “ for the last 300 years , ” Van Creveld writes .
This is why analysts like Michael Vlahos are closely monitoring religious cults .
Vlahos says , “ An ideology that challenges us may not take familiar form , like the old Nazis or Commies .
It may not even engage us initially in ways that fit old threat markings . ”
Van Creveld concludes , “ Armed conflict will be waged by men on earth , not robots in space .
It will have more in common with the struggles of primitive tribes than with large - scale conventional war . ”
While another military historian , John Keegan , in his new book A History of Warfare , draws a more benign portrait of primitive man , it is important to point out that what Van Creveld really means is re-primitivized man : warrior societies operating at a time of unprecedented resource scarcity and planetary overcrowding .
Van Creveld ’s pre-Westphalian vision of worldwide low - intensity conflict is not a superficial “ back to the future ” scenario .
First of all , technology will be used toward primitive ends .
In Liberia the guerrilla leader Prince Johnson did n’t just cut off the ears of President Samuel Doe before Doe was tortured to death in 1990 — Johnson made a video of it , which has circulated throughout West Africa .
In December of 1992 , when plotters of a failed coup against the Strasser regime in Sierra Leone had their ears cut off at Freetown ’s Hamilton Beach prior to being killed , it was seen by many to be a copycat execution .
Considering , as I ’ve explained earlier , that the Strasser regime is not really a government and that Sierra Leone is not really a nation - state , listen closely to Van Creveld : “ Once the legal monopoly of armed force , long claimed by the state , is wrested out of its hands , existing distinctions between war and crime will break down much as is already the case today in . . .
Lebanon , Sri Lanka , El Salvador , Peru , or Colombia . ”
If crime and war become indistinguishable , then “ national defense ” may in the future be viewed as a local concept .
As crime continues to grow in our cities and the ability of state governments and criminal - justice systems to protect their citizens diminishes , urban crime may , according to Van Creveld , “ develop into low - intensity conflict by coalescing along racial , religious , social , and political lines . ”
As small - scale violence multiplies at home and abroad , state armies will continue to shrink , being gradually replaced by a booming private security business , as in West Africa , and by urban mafias , especially in the former communist world , who may be better equipped than municipal police forces to grant physical protection to local inhabitants .
Future wars will be those of communal survival , aggravated or , in many cases , caused by environmental scarcity .
These wars will be subnational , meaning that it will be hard for states and local governments to protect their own citizens physically .
This is how many states will ultimately die .
As state power fades — and with it the state ’s ability to help weaker groups within society , not to mention other states — peoples and cultures around the world will be thrown back upon their own strengths and weaknesses , with fewer equalizing mechanisms to protect them .
Whereas the distant future will probably see the emergence of a racially hybrid , globalized man , the coming decades will see us more aware of our differences than of our similarities .
To the average person , political values will mean less , personal security more .
The belief that we are all equal is liable to be replaced by the overriding obsession of the ancient Greek travelers :
Why the differences between peoples ?
The Last Map
In Geography and the Human Spirit , Anne Buttimer , a professor at University College , Dublin , recalls the work of an early - nineteenth - century German geographer , Carl Ritter , whose work implied “ a divine plan for humanity ” based on regionalism and a constant , living flow of forms .
The map of the future , to the extent that a map is even possible , will represent a perverse twisting of Ritter ’s vision .
Imagine cartography in three dimensions , as if in a hologram .
In this hologram would be the overlapping sediments of group and other identities atop the merely two - dimensional color markings of city - states and the remaining nations , themselves confused in places by shadowy tentacles , hovering overhead , indicating the power of drug cartels , mafias , and private security agencies .
Instead of borders , there would be moving “ centers ” of power , as in the Middle Ages .
Many of these layers would be in motion .
Replacing fixed and abrupt lines on a flat space would be a shifting pattern of buffer entities , like the Kurdish and Azeri buffer entities between Turkey and Iran , the Turkic Uighur buffer entity between Central Asia and Inner China ( itself distinct from coastal China ) , and the Latino buffer entity replacing a precise U.S. - Mexican border .
To this protean cartographic hologram one must add other factors , such as migrations of populations , explosions of birth rates , vectors of disease .
Henceforward the map of the world will never be static .
This future map — in a sense , the “ Last Map ” — will be an ever - mutating representation of chaos .
The Indian subcontinent offers examples of what is happening .
For different reasons , both India and Pakistan are increasingly dysfunctional .
The argument over democracy in these places is less and less relevant to the larger issue of governability .
In India ’s case the question arises , Is one unwieldy bureaucracy in New Delhi the best available mechanism for promoting the lives of 866 million people of diverse languages , religions , and ethnic groups ?
In 1950 , when the Indian population was much less than half as large and nation - building idealism was still strong , the argument for democracy was more impressive than it is now .
Given that in 2025 India ’s population could be close to 1.5 billion , that much of its economy rests on a shrinking natural - resource base , including dramatically declining water levels , and that communal violence and urbanization are spiraling upward , it is difficult to imagine that the Indian state will survive the next century .
India ’s oft - trumpeted Green Revolution has been achieved by overworking its croplands and depleting its watershed .
Norman Myers , a British development consultant , worries that Indians have “ been feeding themselves today by borrowing against their children ’s food sources . ”
Pakistan ’s problem is more basic still : like much of Africa , the country makes no geographic or demographic sense .
It was founded as a homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent , yet there are more subcontinental Muslims outside Pakistan than within it .
Like Yugoslavia , Pakistan is a patchwork of ethnic groups , increasingly in violent conflict with one another .
While the Western media gushes over the fact that the country has a woman Prime Minister , Benazir Bhutto , Karachi is becoming a subcontinental version of Lagos .
In eight visits to Pakistan , I have never gotten a sense of a cohesive national identity .
With as much as 65 percent of its land dependent on intensive irrigation , with wide - scale deforestation , and with a yearly population growth of 2.7 percent ( which ensures that the amount of cultivated land per rural inhabitant will plummet ) , Pakistan is becoming a more and more desperate place .
As irrigation in the Indus River basin intensifies to serve two growing populations , Muslim - Hindu strife over falling water tables may be unavoidable .
“ India and Pakistan will probably fall apart , ” Homer - Dixon predicts .
“ Their secular governments have less and less legitimacy as well as less management ability over people and resources . ”
Rather than one bold line dividing the subcontinent into two parts , the future will likely see a lot of thinner lines and smaller parts , with the ethnic entities of Pakhtunistan and Punjab gradually replacing Pakistan in the space between the Central Asian plateau and the heart of the subcontinent .
None of this even takes into account climatic change , which , if it occurs in the next century , will further erode the capacity of existing states to cope .
India , for instance , receives 70 percent of its precipitation from the monsoon cycle , which planetary warming could disrupt .
Not only will the three - dimensional aspects of the Last Map be in constant motion , but its two - dimensional base may change too .
The National Academy of Sciences reports that “ as many as one billion people , or 20 per cent of the world ’s population , live on lands likely to be inundated or dramatically changed by rising waters .
. . .
Low - lying countries in the developing world such as Egypt and Bangladesh , where rivers are large and the deltas extensive and densely populated , will be hardest hit .
. . .
Where the rivers are dammed , as in the case of the Nile , the effects . . . will be especially severe . ”
Egypt could be where climatic upheaval — to say nothing of the more immediate threat of increasing population — will incite religious upheaval in truly biblical fashion .
Natural catastrophes , such as the October , 1992 , Cairo earthquake , in which the government failed to deliver relief aid and slum residents were in many instances helped by their local mosques , can only strengthen the position of Islamic factions .
In a statement about greenhouse warming which could refer to any of a variety of natural catastrophes , the environmental expert Jessica Tuchman Matthews warns that many of us underestimate the extent to which political systems , in affluent societies as well as in places like Egypt , “ depend on the underpinning of natural systems . ”
She adds , “ The fact that one can move with ease from Vermont to Miami has nothing to say about the consequences of Vermont acquiring Miami ’s climate . ”
Indeed , it is not clear that the United States will survive the next century in exactly its present form .
Because America is a multi-ethnic society , the nation - state has always been more fragile here than it is in more homogeneous societies like Germany and Japan .
James Kurth , in an article published in The National Interest in 1992 , explains that whereas nation - state societies tend to be built around a mass - conscription army and a standardized public school system , “ multicultural regimes ” feature a high - tech , all - volunteer army ( and , I would add , private schools that teach competing values ) , operating in a culture in which the international media and entertainment industry has more influence than the “ national political class . ”
In other words , a nation - state is a place where everyone has been educated along similar lines , where people take their cue from national leaders , and where everyone ( every male , at least ) has gone through the crucible of military service , making patriotism a simpler issue .
Writing about his immigrant family in turn - of - the - century Chicago , Saul Bellow states , “ The country took us over .
It was a country then , not a collection of ‘ cultures . ' ”
During the Second World War and the decade following it , the United States reached its apogee as a classic nation - state .
During the 1960s , as is now clear , America began a slow but unmistakable process of transformation .
The signs hardly need belaboring : racial polarity , educational dysfunction , social fragmentation of many and various kinds .
William Irwin Thompson , in Passages About Earth : An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture , writes , “ The educational system that had worked on the Jews or the Irish could no longer work on the blacks ; and when Jewish teachers in New York tried to take black children away from their parents exactly in the way they had been taken from theirs , they were shocked to encounter a violent affirmation of negritude . ”
Issues like West Africa could yet emerge as a new kind of foreign - policy issue , further eroding America ’s domestic peace .
The spectacle of several West African nations collapsing at once could reinforce the worst racial stereotypes here at home .
That is another reason why Africa matters .
We must not kid ourselves : the sensitivity factor is higher than ever .
The Washington , D.C. , public school system is already experimenting with an Afrocentric curriculum .
Summits between African leaders and prominent African - Americans are becoming frequent , as are Pollyanna - ish prognostications about multiparty elections in Africa that do not factor in crime , surging birth rates , and resource depletion .
The Congressional Black Caucus was among those urging U.S. involvement in Somalia and in Haiti .
At the Los Angeles Times minority staffers have protested against , among other things , what they allege to be the racist tone of the newspaper ’s Africa coverage , allegations that the editor of the “ World Report ” section , Dan Fisher , denies , saying essentially that Africa should be viewed through the same rigorous analytical lens as other parts of the world .
Africa may be marginal in terms of conventional late - twentieth - century conceptions of strategy , but in an age of cultural and racial clash , when national defense is increasingly local , Africa ’s distress will exert a destabilizing influence on the United States .
This and many other factors will make the United States less of a nation than it is today , even as it gains territory following the peaceful dissolution of Canada .
Quebec , based on the bedrock of Roman Catholicism and Francophone ethnicity , could yet turn out to be North America ’s most cohesive and crime - free nation - state .
( It may be a smaller Quebec , though , since aboriginal peoples may lop off northern parts of the province . )
“ Patriotism ” will become increasingly regional as people in Alberta and Montana discover that they have far more in common with each other than they do with Ottawa or Washington , and Spanish - speakers in the Southwest discover a greater commonality with Mexico City .
( The Nine Nations of North America , by Joel Garreau , a book about the continent ’s regionalization , is more relevant now than when it was published , in 1981 . )
As Washington ’s influence wanes , and with it the traditional symbols of American patriotism , North Americans will take psychological refuge in their insulated communities and cultures .
Returning from West Africa last fall was an illuminating ordeal .
After leaving Abidjan , my Air Afrique flight landed in Dakar , Senegal , where all passengers had to disembark in order to go through another security check , this one demanded by U.S. authorities before they would permit the flight to set out for New York .
Once we were in New York , despite the midnight hour , immigration officials at Kennedy Airport held up disembarkation by conducting quick interrogations of the aircraft ’s passengers — this was in addition to all the normal immigration and customs procedures .
It was apparent that drug smuggling , disease , and other factors had contributed to the toughest security procedures I have ever encountered when returning from overseas .
Then , for the first time in over a month , I spotted businesspeople with attache cases and laptop computers .
When I had left New York for Abidjan , all the businesspeople were boarding planes for Seoul and Tokyo , which departed from gates near Air Afrique’s .
The only non-Africans off to West Africa had been relief workers in T - shirts and khakis .
Although the borders within West Africa are increasingly unreal , those separating West Africa from the outside world are in various ways becoming more impenetrable .
But Afrocentrists are right in one respect : we ignore this dying region at our own risk .
When the Berlin Wall was falling , in November of 1989 , I happened to be in Kosovo , covering a riot between Serbs and Albanians .
The future was in Kosovo , I told myself that night , not in Berlin .
The same day that Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat clasped hands on the White House lawn , my Air Afrique plane was approaching Bamako , Mali , revealing corrugated - zinc shacks at the edge of an expanding desert .
The real news was n’t at the White House , I realized .
It was right below .
Strong laptop sales boosted the PC market in 2007
According to research firm Gartner , HP took an 18.2 % market share last year , while Dell 's share slipped to 14.3 % .
A total of 271.2 million computers were shipped in 2007 , up 13 % , Gartner said .
Dell is going through a major business reorganisation and , according to Gartner , there were signs of turn around at the end of last year .
Hewlett - Packard recorded a 30 % increase in personal computers sold last year , eclipsing Dell which shipped 1.7 % more PCs .
Gartner 's figures showed the two firm 's having an almost identical global market share in 2006 .
In the US market , Apple had the strongest sales growth .
It recorded a 28 % jump , which boosted Apple 's share of the market to 6.1 % .
The report showed the Asia - Pacific region overtaking the US as the world 's second - largest market .
Booming sales in India and Vietnam helped drive growth in the Asia Pacific region where sales soared 18.7 % .
The region called Europe , the Middle East and Africa , was still in the lead .
While typical news - aggregation sites do a good job of clustering news stories according to topic , they leave the reader without information about which stories figure prominently in political discourse .
BLEWS uses political blogs to categorize news stories according to their reception in the conservative and liberal blogospheres .
It visualizes information about which stories are linked to from conservative and liberal blogs , and it indicates the level of emotional charge in the discussion of the news story or topic at hand in both political camps .
BLEWS also offers a “ see the view from the other side ” functionality , enabling a reader to compare different views on the same story from different sides of the political spectrum .
BLEWS achieves this goal by digesting and analyzing a real - time feed of political - blog posts provided by the Live Labs Social Media platform , adding both link analysis and text analysis of the blog posts .
The Blews Visualization
Our current visualization shows the count of liberal inlinks to a news article as a blue “ wing ” on the left , and the number of conservative inlinks as a red “ wing ” on the right .
The emotional charge of the discussion around the news link is shown as a “ heat indicator ” on the outside of the wings .
Emotional charge ranges from a single orange square to four white - hot squares .
Clicking on the wings produces a dropdown of the individual blog posts linking to the news article .
In the dropdown , emotionally charged posts have a fuzzy border , while emotionally neutral posts have a solid border .
More Details
The data we mine in the Blews system is provided by the LiveLabs Social Media Platform .
We consume the blog feed from that platform and first identify political ( liberal / independent / conservative ) blog posts .
From those posts , we extract links to news articles and the text in the posts that surround the news links .
We apply a classifier to that text , determining the emotional charge .
The data is then imported into our database , and the news articles are crawled .
We also apply a duplicate detection algorithm to the news articles , in order to detect stories that contain the same syndicated content or are linked to through diffent URLs .
Finally , the content of the database is aggegated and visualized .
Most desktop systems sold today come with only a single display port , usually VGA or DVI .
In the past , if you had one of these desktop computers and wanted your system to use multiple displays , you would probably need to install a new video card .
And if you had a laptop and wanted to connect more than one monitor , you were basically out of luck .
But a company called DisplayLink is changing all that with their DVI display adapter and connecting multiple displays is now easier than ever .
DisplayLink has developed a technology that allows displays to connect to computers through a USB 2.0 connection .
I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use the DisplayLink USB to DVI adapter .
After installing the setup software , I plugged the dvi display adapter into one of the USB ports on my PC .
Then I plugged a second monitor into the adapter , and that was it .
In Windows XP , a small icon of a monitor appeared in the system tray in the lower - right corner .
Right - clicking on the icon allowed me to choose settings for my second monitor .
I could select to either mirror the same view on both monitors or extend my desktop to the other monitor so I could drag windows from one screen to the other .
( In Windows Vista there was no icon in the system tray , so I had to do this from the display properties menu of the control panel . )
In both operating systems , performance was good and screen resolutions went up to 1600 x 1200 ( except for viewing DVDs , which required setting the second monitor at a lower resolution ) .
For now the DisplayLink USB to DVI display adapter only works on PCs running Windows XP and Vista .
I was , however , able to get mirror mode to work on Windows XP running using Parallels on a MacBook Pro .
It ’s still early for this technology , and there are plenty of possibilities .
Because most desktop computers have 4 - 6 USB ports , this makes it possible for 3 or more monitors to be plugged into a single computer .
Unfortunately , I only had a single DisplayLink adapter to test so I was not able to test using multiple USB adapters .
This is an area that would really be exciting for people who want to connect even more monitors .
( Just make sure that all your monitors use the DVI plug , and not the older VGA plug as this is n’t a DVI VGA display adapter . )
Overall , I was impressed by the ease of use and display quality of the DisplayLink DVI to USB adapter .
I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy way to set up multiple monitors .
Thank you so much Cosmic Volunteers !
I had the time of my life in Ghana , both fun and rewarding .
All of the people there were wonderful , and my host parents became like a second family to me .
It ’s always been my dream to travel and volunteer , and this program was a step above anything I had expected or hoped for .
Thanks again for an amazing experience !
The Pretrip Guide
The pre-trip guide was very helpful , it does include a lot about the local culture and prepares you for life in a foreign country .
Perhaps you can also ask volunteers what they would like to see added to the pre-trip briefing
Program Duties the same as on website ?
Yes they were generally the same , though I think a lot of it is country - dependant .
Ghana is a very laid back culture , so you can expect a very laid back working atmosphere .
it was very unscheduled and never on time , but that is charachteristic of the culture there .
I think this is important to keep in mind when you are planning on volunteering somewhere .
Where I was though it was good because there was a lot of flexibility .
if you wanted to switch positions or locations while you were there , you were free
to do so .
Local Coordinator
Yes , my coordinator was great , he was a good friend and was easily accessable if you needed anything , and really took time to introduce you to life and culture in Ghana .
Host Family
They were amazing , I will definitely keep in touch with them .
It was very hard to leave , they became like a second family to me .
Sightseeing
I was able to do some , we went to the canopy walk ( i forget the name of it ) which was nice .
also to some of the old castles in cape coast .
The beach is also lovely to spend time at .
Do you believe the experience of volunteering abroad changed you in any way ?
Would you volunteer again ?
I think volunteering opens your eyes to the realities of a foreign culture .
I will most likely be volunteering through cosmic again soon .

Moloney sees a chance in congressional race
Perennial contender hopes to shift his party
Moloney sees a chance in congressional race : Perennial contender hopes to shift his party
By Will Oremus , San Mateo Daily News
This is the fifth in the Daily News ’ five - part series profiling each of the candidates to replace the late Tom Lantos in Congress .
The two Democrats , two Republicans and one Green will compete in an open primary on April 8 .
Republican Mike Moloney believes it will be an embarrassment to his party if he wins election to Congress – and he ’s proud of that .
“ The Republican Party is bankrupt morally , spiritually and emotionally , ” Moloney said .
“ It ’s been hijacked by the nuts on the religious right . ”
A perennial contender for the 12th District seat long held by the late Tom Lantos , the boisterous Moloney aims to be the Libertarian thorn in the Republican Party ’s side .
Though he calls himself “ an Eisenhower Republican , ” he admits he only switched to the party several years ago to get more visibility for his incendiary views .
“ I ’m a maverick , ” he said .
“ Their job is to head me off at the pass . ”
From his youth in an Irish neighborhood of Brooklyn , Moloney , 67 , carries a thick accent and a belief that everyone deserves a fighting chance at success .
But he ’s no welfare - state liberal .
To those who get knocked down , as he did when his local liquor store chain went bankrupt , Moloney says , “ those are the breaks . ”
Perhaps that ’s why he never pulls punches .
In Moloney ’s idiom , Democratic favorite Jackie Speier is “ little Jackie , the princess . ”
Moderate conservative Greg Conlon is “ a country club Republican . ”
The Bush administration ’s foreign policy is “ so absurd that when I actually articulate it , I ca n’t believe it . ”
His well - placed jabs and self - deprecating jokes bring levity to the campaign trail , but Moloney is dead serious about his opposition to the war in Iraq .
He sees recent U.S. policy in the Middle East as the product of a dastardly alliance between the oil - hungry Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , Israel - allied neoconservatives led by Paul Wolfowitz , and Christian extremists who want a holy war with Islam .
He ’s convinced that if someone does n’t stand up to the Bush administration soon , Iran will be next .
Who could that someone be ?
Moloney quickly rules out the Democrats .
“ The Democrat leaders are all part of it .
Bush and Cheney could never have accomplished the war without the Democrats . ”
That leaves the man himself .
“ If I win this special election , I go back to Washington to fill Lantos ’ term , ” Moloney said .
“ My first act , I demand ( House Speaker ) Nancy Pelosi puts impeachment of Bush and Cheney back on the table , and I demand it loud and clear . ”
While he relishes the role of underdog , Moloney resents the attention that ’s been lavished on Speier ’s campaign from its beginning , when a phalanx of big - time officials turned out to her press conference in Foster City .
“ Jesus Christ , I thought it was Mother Teresa up there , ” he said .
Earlier this month , Moloney put out a sarcastic press release suggesting that his fellow candidates call off the April 8 special election and concede the seat to Speier , saving money for the taxpayers .
In less agitated moments , however , Moloney admits he ’s having a great time .
He ’s taken to wearing a Serra High School baseball cap around town , not because he has any connection to the school , but because it starts conversations with fellow Padres fans .
And despite his lack of mainstream backing – he recently lost an election for local Republican Party chairman 20 - 2 – Moloney believes he ’ll have a shot against Speier if he can get past Conlon in the primary .
“ It ’ll be Hearns vs. Hagler , Ali vs. Frazier , ” he said , shadowboxing to demonstrate his point .
“ I do n’t remember who won Hearns vs. Hagler , but it was a great fight . ”

if we compare the incomes of the top and bottom fifths , we see a ratio of 15 to 1 .
If we turn to consumption , the gap declines to around 4 to 1 ....
Let ’s take the adjustments one step further .
Richer households are larger — an average of 3.1 people in the top fifth , compared with 2.5 people in the middle fifth and 1.7 in the bottom fifth .
If we look at consumption per person , the difference between the richest and poorest households falls to just 2.1 to 1 .

The use of laser speed estimation devices , sometimes referred to as LIDAR , has been accompanied by a lot of heavy breathing and claims of infallibility on the part of law enforcement agencies .
“ Pinpoint accuracy , undetectable , ” and “ tremendous range ” are common refrains .
Setting the flim - flam and propaganda aside , there are some things every motorist confronted with a laser ticket should know .
The number one selling point for laser guns is their advertised capability to selectively clock the speed of one vehicle that is traveling amongst other vehicles in moderate to heavy traffic .
( Radar cannot reliably be used when there are multiple vehicles in its all encompassing beam . )
Its ability to determine a target ’s speed in a fraction of a second is another popular feature .
Probably , laser ’s greatest drawback is that it cannot legitimately be used in a moving mode .
So what ’s the real story on laser speed guns ?
They work ; they work if they are properly adjusted , properly used , and used within their limitations .
A quick primer on how laser guns work :
The laser gun has a “ sight ” where the officer can see the target vehicle and aim the device .
When the trigger is pulled a thin beam of invisible infra-red light is emitted in distinct pulses .
The beam gradually increases in size and at 1000 feet it is three to four feet in diameter .
When the light beam hits a relatively perpendicular , reflective surface it bounces back toward the laser gun .
When the returning pulses of light are captured by the laser gun the electronics go to work and they have this kind of conversation :
OK , that first pulse took .0015 seconds to get out there and back , that means the target is 1000 feet away .
The second pulse took .0014 seconds to get out there and back so now our target is 950 feet away .
The third pulse went out and came back at .0013 seconds putting the target 900 feet from the laser gun .
It took us one third second to gather these three measurements and that means the vehicle went 100 feet in one third second .
Therefore the vehicle is going 49 miles per hour .
In actual practice the laser gun sends out far more than three pulses and measures the targets movements in much smaller increments , but this should give you some sense of the calculating processes the laser device employs .
From this elementary description of how a laser gun works you can begin to understand certain of the critical issues confronting a laser gun operator .
First , this is a fairly complicated electronic instrument and it cannot be used to pound nails if a hammer is n’t available .
Laser guns are more delicate than radar guns .
And , because the aiming function is critical , the adjustment of the sighting mechanism is critical .
An honest and competent laser gun operator is going to take the following steps before he or she begins to use the device for enforcement purposes :
Check the instruments internal testing and calibration systems .
Check the sight alignment by picking an object at a reasonable distance ( where the beam is still relatively narrow ) like a utility pole , and then “ sweep the gun past the object in both a vertical and then a horizontal position , with the trigger engaged , to make sure the laser gun records a distance reading at the same time the sight is on the testing target .
This assures that the laser beam and the laser sight are coordinated .
The routine external test is to shoot the laser at an object at a known distance and confirm that the laser distance reading is accurate .
If it is n’t the gun needs to be repaired .
However , this does not mean the gun is accurately estimating speeds .
A simple test to check speed accuracy is to drive the patrol car at a fixed speed and then fire the laser at a fixed object , like the flat side of a building .
The laser reading should be the same as the vehicle ’s speedometer reading .
Another option is to shoot a vehicle traveling at a known speed , such as another patrol car .
With a properly aligned sight and properly confirmed instrument operation the officer can use the laser gun with relative confidence that it will yield accurate speed readings , PROVIDED it is used properly and respecting its limitations .
Proper use means a steady rest , no sweeping or other movement of the gun when taking readings , not shooting through glass or in the midst of a rain storm or snow fall .
While it ’s possible to clock a target that is 2000 to 3000 feet away the speed reading is of dubious accuracy and highly prone to error .
On a clear day with no other traffic in sight a good laser operator can obtain reasonably accurate readings out to 1200 , perhaps 1500 feet .
However , if there are other vehicles present those distances should be halved .
Remember , at distances in excess of 700 - 800 feet the laser beam is easily large enough to not only be reflecting off of different parts of the target vehicle ( which are simultaneously different distances from the laser gun ) , but also off of other vehicles , some traveling at different speeds .
At distances in excess of 800 feet , the laser operator has no way of knowing what vehicle surfaces or entire vehicles are responsible for the laser speed readings , especially if other vehicles fall within the scope of the laser beam .
Most laser operators prefer to aim at the license plate because it offers a very perpendicular and highly reflective surface .
A vehicle without a front license plate and a low sloping hood , think Corvette , has to be much closer before a good laser reading can be made .
However , at distances in excess of 800-900 feet the license plate is indistinguishable from the car as a whole and the laser beam is washing over the entire vehicle .
To put this in another context ; think about the challenge of hitting a target the size of a license plate three football fields distant , with a handgun .
In an honest courtroom , any laser reading in excess of 800 feet would not be accepted for evidentiary purposes .
The State of New Jersey has set the limit at 1000 feet , which is a step in the right direction .
The rest of the country is oblivious to the limitations of this technology , with judges and legislators believing the propaganda , instead of exercising the caution and judgment we have entrusted them to exercise on our behalf .
Feel free to copy this blog and send it to a judge or legislator (s ) of your choice .
But the tide may be turning , thanks in part to a best - selling book by Robert I. Sutton , a management professor and co-director of the Center for Work , Technology and Organization at Stanford .
Among other things , the book argues that workplace bullies are bad for business , because they lead to absenteeism and turnover .
The New York State Legislature is considering an antibullying bill , and in several other states , including New Jersey and Connecticut , lawmakers have introduced such measures — without success so far .
A measure was withdrawn in Connecticut last week after business groups opposed it , although the bill is expected to be resubmitted .
Business groups often argue that existing laws are adequate to protect workers .
But bullying generally does not involve race , age or sex , which have protected status in the courts .
Instead , most workplace hostility occurs just because someone does n’t like someone else .
“ Many of these situations fall between the cracks of existing state and federal employment law , ” said David C. Yamada , a professor at the Suffolk University Law School in Boston , who has drafted antibullying legislation .
“ There is a real gap in the law that someone could be tormented and subjected to humiliation and really be suffering because of it , but the courts are saying it ’s not severe enough for us to allow the lawsuit to go forward . ”

The antibullying bills are often referred to as “ healthy workplace ” legislation .
The name is more palatable to businesses , but they also acknowledge the serious health toll bullying can have .
Some victims become physically ill from the stress , with depression , anxiety and even symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Surveys also suggest that victims of office bullies call in sick more often — although it ’s not clear whether they really are sick or just avoiding the abusive environment at work .

Here for your enjoyment , the 40 celebrities who would look great in kilts :
This country crooner is way too handsome to leave off the list .
It ’s only fair that we get a peek at what Nicole Kidman ’s looking at .
He ’s a phenomenal actor and he ’s hot … uh … sorry , just daydreaming about seeing more of the fine Clive Owen .
The Felicity and Underworld star has the chiseled good looks that would look oh - so - fine with tartan clothing .

Oh my , Denzel is one Hollywood hottie who gets better ( and better ) with age .
Okay , we ’ve seen plenty of Eric Bana ’s legs in Troy and we liked it – this gorgeous Aussie is built for short skirts .
We put him together with the Lost doc with the smoldering good looks .
Naturally he ’d make our list .
He ’s shared the big screen with some of the sexiest leading ladies , but we think Aaron Eckhart needs a little more leg exposure .
Did you see him in 300 ?
Do we need to say more ?
We ’ve seen Dr. McSteamy in a towel and enjoyed every second – a kilt is n’t that much of a stretch .
Taylor ’s burning up the small screen in tight football pants every week on Friday Night Lights … a kilt would suit the sexy actor just fine .

Dr. McDreamy could take his dreaminess to the next level by showing us a little leg .
We ’re not sure how a kilt would fit into the “ Lost ” island mystique ( then again , it ’s not any stranger than other mysteries of the island ) — we just know Holloway would be hot .
Teen heartthrob meets Scottish tartan .
Zac Efron would definitely have girls drooling if he showed his hot legs .
Gyllenhaal showed us he has what it takes to wear a dress when he hosted Saturday Night Live ( remember that opening monologue a la Dreamgirls ? ) .
A kilt is the next step for this Hollywood hunk .
He ’s a U.N. Ambassador … how about a great kilt to make him the ambassador of hotness ?
Do we need a reason to see more of Johnny Depp ?
Get sexy Depp in a kilt … quick !
Never one to shy away from nudity ( and who can complain , really ? ) , it ’d be sweet to see Duchovny cover up in a kilt and leave a little something to the imagination .

We need to see more of Colbert !
Plus there ’s nothing like a Frenchman in a kilt .
FBI head :
Give telcos immunity even if they acted in bad faith Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 5 , 2008

At the heart of President Bush 's plea to give telecommunications companies legal immunity is the contention that these companies were merely being patriotic corporate citizens when they facilitated the warrantless wiretapping of Americans .
FBI Director Robert Mueller undercut that argument Wednesday , telling Congress that the ' good faith ' argument should have nothing to do with whether or not they are let off the hook in dozens of pending court cases .
" I would focus more on the downsides , substantial downsides , of not providing retroactive immunity as being the principal rational of the legislation , providing immunity , " Mueller told the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Mueller insisted that good faith of the companies was " important " but said he was unsure " where it fit into the calculus " behind trying to give companies legal immunity .
President Bush has previously said it was unfair the companies were being " sued for billions of dollars , " and Mueller 's testimony further clarifies the financial motive behind the companies ' push to be let off the hook .
He did not elaborate on the " substantial downsides " that would come from a judicial review of the companies actions .
It would n't be the first time the phone companies ' financial situation overlapped with US law enforcement and intelligence needs .
At least one foreign intelligence wiretap was disconnected by a telephone carrier when the FBI failed to pay its bills , as the Associated Press reported earlier this year .
Mueller acknowledged the FBI had discovered " a line going down for a matter of days " because of an unpaid bill , but he said the investigation of which that wiretap was a part was not adversely affected .
Wo n't rule out waterboarding American in ticking - bomb scenario Sen.
Sheldon
Whitehouse probed Mueller on whether there would be a scenario in which the FBI would use waterboarding during an interrogation .
The Rhode Island Democrat laid out a hypothetical situation in which the FBI had captured Timothy McVeigh just after the Oklahmoa City bombing and believed he had information on another bomb that was set to explode within an hour .
" Do you waterboard Timothy McVeigh ? "
Whitehouse asked .
Mueller demurred , saying he would " prefer not to answer hypotheticals , " although he acknowledged under further questioning that such a ticking time - bomb scenario could happen today .
" I would not know how I would respond , " Mueller said .
SEVERAL hundred protesters threw stones and flares at riot police protecting the US embassy in Belgrade today after Kosovo 's declaration of independence , witnesses said .
One policeman was injured during scuffles as riot police fought to keep the protesters , mainly hardline football fans , away from the embassy building , the witnesses said .
One embassy window was smashed .
The protesters marched through the middle of the capital towards the US embassy chanting " Kosovo is Serbia " and anti-American slogans .
They waved Serbian flags and vowed to protest " until Kosovo is returned to Serbia " .
After the scuffles , protesters dispersed in nearby streets , while the police remained around the embassy compound .
Mininova has evolved quite a bit since it has started three years ago .
Within a year it was one of the most visited torrent sites on the Internet , and the ever increasing number of users resulted in the 4 billionth torrent download recently .
Time to ask some questions .
The Mininova team has always been on top of the latest p2 p developments .
They recently launched a content distribution platform for independent publishers , a music streaming feature , and in the meanwhile they served billions of torrents .
In fact , Mininova celebrated the 4 billionth . torrent download earlier this week .
Contrary to the Pirate Bay guys , however , the people behind Mininova prefer to lay low , and do n’t speak out in public very often .
We had the chance to do a short Q&A with Niek , one of the co-founders and the CEO of Mininova ( yes , it ’s a company ) .
TorrentFreak : Recently you have started to focus more on legal content , that is . torrent files uploaded by approved publishers .
What are your plans with the Mininova publisher platform for the future , and will this affect the other . torrent files hosted on Mininova ?
Niek :
We focus on extending and improving our Content Distribution service .
Publishers will see more distribution options ( e.g. extensive statistics ) in the near future , and users will be able to find featured content easier .
Our plan is to offer the most sophisticated and scalable distribution service of the future .
Functionality of “ regular ” torrent files will of course be kept as it is now .
TorrentFreak : The Mininova CD launched in December 2007 , how many publishers are releasing their content on Mininova now ?
Niek :
Over 330 premium publishers are now actively using Mininova to share their content .
We receive functionality requests from time to time , but overall they ’re very pleased with the CD service .
TorrentFreak : Like any other BitTorrent site , Mininova has to deal with a huge number to DMCA takedown requests from copyright holders .
How is your relationship with the people who want you to remove . torrent files from your index ?
Niek : I would say that in general the relationship with copyright owners is very good .
Our copyright policy is being used by many companies and organizations when necessary .
Some copyright owners are so satisfied with our service that they send stuff like collectors editions of their products :)
TorrentFreak : Mininova never had it ’s own tracker .
Why is this ?
Do n’t you think you have a responsibility to help out the BitTorrent community here , especially now there are only a few reliable BitTorrent trackers out there ?
Niek :
We discussed this matter from the start .
We do run a tracker , but only for Content Distribution purposes .
Running an open tracker is not a trivial task , it requires major technical and financial backing .
Thus , running such a tracker is currently not an option for us .
TorrentFreak : Mininova is a registered company in the Netherlands .
Has 2007 been a good year for the company profit wise ?
Niek : I would say this was a pretty nice year .
We just bought a Palm Tree island in Dubai ( we chose the bottom right leaf , for those who ’re interested ) .
I also received my second Bugatti Veyron last week ( bonus for the increased Q4 numbers ) .
Oh , and do n’t forget to watch MTV Cribs next month to see all this stuff .
/ sarcasm
TorrentFreak :
About the future , where do you see Mininova in 10 years from now ?
do you think people will still download . torrent files by then ?
Niek : Predicting the future is probably one of the most dangerous things to do ( remember Bill gates and his 640K ? ) .
One thing is for sure : P2P wo n’t go away anytime soon .
We will probably share more files than ever in 10 years , either using an improved version of BitTorrent or a different P2P protocol .
We hope that Mininova will stay on top of developments .
TorrentFreak :
Thanks for taking the time to talk to TorrentFreak , even though you skipped some questions ;)
Is there anything you like to add ?
Niek :
Thanks to all our users !
Especially the 4 billion downloads would n’t never been possibly without your support and the great help of our moderating team .
TorrentFreak , thank you for your time .
Ganvie ( meaning : ' the collectivity of those who found peace at last ' ) is a lake village in Benin , lying in Lake Nokoué , near Cotonou .
The village has a population of around 20 - 30,000 , contains around 3,000 stilted buildings and is probably the largest lake village in Africa .
The village dates back to the sixteenth or seventeenth century [ source ] and was built to save people from slavery .
When the Dan -Homey kings armies were capturing people in the countryside to sell in the Portuguese slave trade , the people of Ganvie were saved from slavery by the Dan - Homey religious traditions ... they were forbidden to attack communities on the water .
Link
The people in this unique fishing village live exclusively from fishing ( along with a little tourism ) , use pirogues ( canoes ) and have a system of underwater plantings that form fences to trap and breed fish .
According to this site there are only ' one and a half bits ' of dry land in Ganvie .
The full bit of land is the site of the school and the half bit will be a cemetery once enough dry ground has been laid to start burying people in it .
The site has more information as well as photos .
Millions of Muslim faithful will make their pilgrimage to Mecca soon for the Hajj .
This year , they 'll have Wi-Fi :
Thanks to Aptilo Networks and Tropos Networks , after the estimated three million pilgrims walk seven times counter - clockwise around the Kaaba and kiss ( or simply point at ) the sacred Black Stone , they can then MapQuest directions to Muzdalifah and perhaps IM a friend or give them a call using VoWi - Fi , so they can meet up and gather the pebbles they will need to perform the ritual of Stoning the Devil at Mina .
Pilgrims can also access the streaming video at the official Ministry of Hajj web site , which sagely warns ( in English ) , " Be peaceful , orderly , and kind .
No crushing .

Incidentally , on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 's website for the Ministry of Hajj , there 's one page titled " How modern technology has been employed to facilitate the Hajj . "
Snip :
Despite years of refinement and the collective experience of millions of users , Windows remains as buggy , enigmatic , and failure - prone as ever .
Each new release of the operating system adds a little glitz and a handful of new features , but also just as many new headaches .
Sometimes Vista 's new features and improved functions seem to be more trouble than they 're worth , and older sibling XP certainly is n't getting any easier to live with as it ages .

Fortunately , you do n't have to spend hours researching the cures for Windows ' ills .
We 've distilled the most important fixes , and slick improvements , into steps that you can implement in mere minutes .
These tips will accelerate your startups and shutdowns , automate your system maintenance , and even get you browsing at full throttle .
Put Some Sizzle in Your Startups
Problem : Windows never seems to start fast enough
Fast Fix 1 : Your computer could be loading device drivers for hardware you no longer use .
To save on system resources , uninstall those drivers .
Since a careless choice can cause your machine to lose an important function , however , create a restore point in System Restore before proceeding .
By default , Device Manager does n't show devices that are n't currently connected to your system .
To make them visible , press Windows - R to open the Run box , type cmd , and press Enter .
At the command prompt , type set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 and press Enter .
Leave the command - prompt window open .
Now press Windows - R again , type devmgmt.msc , and press Enter .
In the Device Manager window , choose View , Show Hidden Devices .
Click the plus sign (+ ) next to each of the branches to examine all of the drivers on your system .
Devices that are not currently connected appear with a pale version of the icon .
If you come across a device that you 're sure you no longer use , right - click it and choose Uninstall .
Then follow the prompts shown on screen to complete the process .
When you 're done , close the command - prompt window to re-hide your unconnected devices .
Fast Fix 2 : Once you have mapped a network drive to a letter on your computer , Windows will automatically restore that connection by default whenever you log on .
Since resuming network connections takes time , you can speed your startups by dropping the connections you are n't using .
Press Windows - E to launch Windows Explorer , and type Alt - T , D to open the Disconnect Network Drives dialog box .

The number of Internet users in China soared past 200 million in 2007 , a new report from the country 's quasi - government Internet overseer said Thursday .
China 's Internet population stood at 210 million at the end of last year , up 53 percent from the same time in 2006 when there were 137 million , the China Internet Network Information Centre said in its semi-annual report on Internet use here .
That figure puts China just 5 million users away from becoming the world 's largest wired nation and with only about 16 percent of the population online .
At its current growth rate , China will become the world 's top Internet market sometime in the next few months .
The greatest growth came from users under 18 and over 30 , CNNIC said .
One of the most surprising statistics from the new report indicates that about 40 percent of users added over the last year , over 29 million , came from rural areas .
Even in the January 2007 report , the vast majority of Chinese Netizens were based in major urban areas such as Beijing and Shanghai .
Also surprising among the new results is that China 's most popular Internet application is online music , used by 86.6 percent of those surveyed , followed by instant messaging with 81 percent .
E-mail placed only fifth , with 56.5 percent using it .
CNNIC 's survey provides the most reliable information about Internet use in China , although its methodology is translucent at best .
It does not reveal its sample size , nor does it reveal what consists of an Internet user except that the person used the Internet at least once in the month prior to when the survey was taken .
While the new statistics may seem impressive , it highlights how Internet usage in the country still lags behind mobile phone use , and how even greater usage could be spurred by more access through wireless devices .
" China 's admittedly impressive user statistics hide an important fact : only a fraction of those users have regular access to a PC , " said David Wolf , CEO of Wolf Group Asia , a Beijing - based technology consultancy .
Despite limited PC access for some users , Chinese Internet users have embraced the Internet as a means of expression .
" In addition to an increase in overall numbers , you also see a rise in the number of Netizens creating content on BBS and blogs , making Chinese Netizens some of the most active participants in the Web 2.0 phenomena in the world , " said Sam Flemming , founder and CEO of CIC , an Internet word of mouth monitoring firm based in Shanghai .

Insp Neil Munro had served with Dorset Police for 20 years
Police said the body of Insp Neil Munro , 43 , was found along Panorama Road , nicknamed " Millionaire 's Row " , in Sandbanks , at about 0830 GMT .
A gardener is reported to have found the body under a jetty belonging to a multi-million pound seafront mansion .
Brittany Ferries confirmed a foot passenger of the same name had boarded one of their ferries on Wednesday .
The whole of the force has been deeply shocked by today 's news
Chief Constable Martin Baker
Dorset Police
It is understood officers were alerted by the owners of the house , which was then sealed off .
Police have not confirmed whether the death is suspicious .
Insp Munro , who was married with a young son , was found fully - clothed .
His death is being treated as " unexplained " and a post - mortem examination was being carried out .
A Dorset Police spokesman said : " At this stage , the circumstances of Inspector Munro 's death , understood to have taken place while he was off duty , are unexplained and an investigation is under way . "
Stephen Tuckwell , a spokesman for Brittany Ferries , said a foot passenger of the same name boarded the 2345 GMT Barfleur ferry sailing from Poole to Cherbourg on Wednesday .
Dorset police had contacted them asking to conduct an examination of Barfleur when it returns , he said .
Huge impact
He added no one had reported seeing anyone fall off the ferry .
Chief Constable Martin Baker , of Dorset Police , paid tribute to Insp Munro .
" The whole of the force has been deeply shocked by today 's news and our thoughts are very much with Neil 's family at this time , " he said .
" Neil had served with Dorset Police for 20 years .
He had a huge impact on policing here in Bournemouth and across the force .
" He had been section inspector in charge of north Bournemouth for the past two - and - a - half years and previously worked at Poole , Ferndown , Gravel Hill and in the air support unit at Dorset Police headquarters in Winfrith . "

CNN crunched the exit poll data from yesterday ’s New Hampshire primary and found that “ among the 34 percent [ of Republican primary voters ] who said they disapproved of the war , McCain had a wide advantage over the GOP field â€ ” even over Texas Rep.
Ron Paul , the sole advocate of a U.S. withdrawal in the Republican field . ” ( hat tip to Think Progress ) .
Perhaps such voters did not realize the temporal difference between exiting IraqÂ “ now ” ( in Ron Paul ’s case ) versus 10,000 years from now ( in McCain ’s case , according to his comment on CBS ’s Face the Nation last week ) .
McCain has rarely missed a chance to grovel at Bush ’s feet to support the Iraq war .
Why were so many voters who claimed to oppose the warÂ so ignorant ?

Highly available and highly scalable .
Targeted at applications that can tolerate high internet latencies .
Primarily read - mostly data sets " storing data that is naturally partitionable into disjoint data sets requiring little or no cross-correlations . "
Pricing is n't yet available .
No announced SLA , though you will be notified of downtime .
Access is via REST or SOAP .
Data is redundantly stored and backed up .
Geo-redundant data copies are maintained .
Data is stored in large storage clusters in various Microsoft data centers located across North America .
Plan to expand to more areas later .
The data model is flexible .
No schemas required .
" Simply add new attributes to your data set when needed , and the system will automatically store , index , and query your data accordingly . "
String , numeric , datetime , and boolean data type are supported .
All attributes are indexed .
The data model is : Customer { SSDS account ( 1..N ) { Authority ( 1..N ) { Container ( 0..N ) { Entity ( 0..N )
- Authorities give billing entities a way to organize their usage for accounting , security and co-location purposes .
All containers under a single authority are provisioned within the same data center .
As such authorities are the unit of geo-scale and geo-location .
For example : Seattle or San Francisco .
- Containers create contexts and scope for entity storage and query .
For example , within its authorities , operations could choose to assign each member their own container , intended to contain a set of personal data for that member .
Containers are the unit of consistency in the Microsoft SSDS service .
For example : Autos for Sale , Services Offered .
- Entities are the fundamental unit of storage in the system .
Entities are a bag of scalars with no enforced type .
For example , an individual member‟s jobs , educational institutions , contacts , recommendations , etc. could all be modeled as entities .
Data manipulation operations include :
- Creation and deletion of containers .
There are no updatable container properties .
- Creation , replacement , and deletion of entities .
- Retrieval of a single container in a serialized format .
- Retrieval of a single entity in a serialized format .
A text based query language is supported that follow the LINQ pattern for C# .
Only complete entities are returned .
For example :
To query addressed to a container to retrieve all entities in that container having a “ City ” property equal to “ Seattle ” and a “ State ” property equal to “ WA ” would be written as follows :
from e in entities
where e[ “ City ” ] == “ Seattle ” && e [“ State ” ] == “ WA ”
select e
Resource queries are supported .
This URI returns all the entities in that container : http://mydomain.ssds.microsoft.com/ChildrensBooksContainer1
Customers will be able to associate entities with blobs which could be accessed as URL addressable resources .
SSDS is not just a hosted version of SQL Server .
It 's SQL Server deconstructed , running on blade servers with SATA drives .
A local on - premise version of SSDS will also be available to " allow users to better synchronize between the enterprise and the cloud , especially when handling reporting , analytics and business - intelligence tasks . "
Not sure if you can do a full text search on a string property .
Not sure how large attributes can be .
Should I store my 25 MB documents as a string field so it can be searched ?
Or is that too expensive ?
Or is it even supported ?
Where Microsoft is behind Amazon is that they do n't have EC2 and S3 .
Microsoft is having you traverse the internet for each database access .
Now let ''s say you have chunks of large storage stored off in a storage cloud .
That 's a lot of overhead .
A major benefit of AWS is the free bandwidth and higher performance within the AWS cloud .
If your application is completely hosted within the cloud the only slow part is from the server to the user 's browser .
All - in - all SSDS seems very comparable to and competitive with SimpleDB .
Hard to say without solid pricing information .
But it will be interesting to see how Microsoft 's cloud strategy evolves and how we can all benefit from the competition .

Canada 's opposition parties have come together to seek the release of Toronto detainee Omar Khadr and condemn the U.S. policies that have kept him in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years .
MPs from the Liberals , NDP and Bloc Québécois will hold a joint press conference this morning to urge Prime Minister Stephen Harper to intervene in the case and denounce Guantanamo 's military commission where Khadr is being tried for war crimes .
" To begin with , for five years , he has been languishing with no trial in Guantanamo , he has been subjected to treatment at best degrading and abusive , and at worst , amounting to torture , " Liberal human rights critic Irwin Cotler said in an interview with the Star .
" I think he should be brought back here , and the ideal would be for him to enter into a framework of social and physical rehabilitation as befits what should be done for child soldiers , where he could have a religious and cultural support system . "
The Khadr case has begun to receive attention both in Canada and internationally in the last few months with critics of Guantanamo drawing attention to Khadr 's age .
The Toronto - born detainee was 15 when he was captured in July 2002 in Afghanistan , following a firefight with U.S. Special Forces .
The Pentagon alleges that Khadr threw a grenade that killed Delta Force soldier Christopher Speer before being shot himself and captured .
Now 21 , Khadr is charged with " murder in violation of the laws of war " in Speer 's death in addition to attempted murder , conspiracy , spying and providing material support to terrorism .
His lawyers argued this month that the Military Commissions Act , signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2006 , did n't intend to try teenagers under the age of 18 for war crimes .
Khadr 's military lawyer , U.S. Navy Lt. - Cmdr .
Bill Kuebler , argued that Khadr should be considered a " child soldier , " and benefit from the protections of international law that focus on rehabilitating youths in armed conflict .
Pentagon spokesperson Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon dismissed the argument that Khadr 's age should be a factor in his prosecution .
" Canadian law and U.S. law both provide that a person of Khadr 's age , alleged to have committed such offences , can be tried as an adult .
Age is not a determining factor in detention , nor is it relevant to military commission jurisdiction .
If Khadr is found guilty , however , age may be relevant at sentencing . "
Cotler , who will issue a written statement today , was the Liberal 's justice minister during much of Khadr 's incarceration .
He said he wrote about the issue in law journals to try to draw attention to the case , but admits the Liberals also did not ask for Khadr 's return .
" I do n't think much was being done , to be frank , because the issue lacked salience here in Canada .
I wrote about it in 2002 and I did n't get any response whatsoever . "

Since coming to power in 2006 , Harper 's government has steadfastly maintained that Canada will not interfere in the military commissions .
" They do n't seem to want to move at all , " said Bloc MP Vivian Barbot ( Papineau ) .
" We 're trying to call attention more and more because we can't be advocating for help for child soldiers on one side and not recognizing on the other side when it happens to one of Canada 's citizens , " said Barbot , who will appear at the press conference today with the NDP's Joe Comartin , Liberal justice critic Dominic Leblanc and Khadr 's U.S. military lawyers .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Iraqi military push into the southern city of Basra is not going as well as American officials had hoped , despite President Bush 's high praise for the operation , several U.S. officials said Friday .
A burned Iraqi army tank is seen on a street in the southern city of Basra on Friday .
A closely held U.S. military intelligence analysis of the fighting in Basra shows that Iraqi security forces control less than a quarter of the city , according to officials in both the United States and Iraq , and Basra 's police units are deeply infiltrated by members of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army .
" This is going to go on for a while , " one U.S. military official said .
Iraqi forces launched their offensive in Basra this week .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki was personally overseeing operations in the southern city against what government officials called " rogue " or " outlaw " militia elements , most loyal to al - Sadr .
During a joint news conference Friday with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , Bush called the operation " a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq , " saying the government is fighting criminals there .
Watch more of Bush 's comments »
" It was just a matter of time before the government was going to have to deal with it , " he said .
The president also hailed the operation as a sign of progress , emphasizing that the decision to mount the offensive was al - Maliki's .
" It was his military planning ; it was his causing the troops to go from point A to point B , " Bush said .
" And it 's exactly what a lot of folks here in America were wondering whether or not Iraq would even be able to do it in the first place .
And it 's happening . "
But since the beginning of the government offensive four days ago , violence also has picked up in a wide area of southern Iraq , including in Baghdad 's International Zone -- also known as the Green Zone -- which has been targeted by rocket and mortar attacks .
Coalition bombers have joined in the fight , hitting targets in Basra and Baghdad .
The Basra analysis also shows that militia forces control a wide swath of cities in Iraq 's southeast , including areas near the airport , where British forces are located , the officials said .
More than 100 Iraqis have been killed in the fighting , including at least 14 in Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood .

The fighting has sparked fears that a seven - month cease - fire by al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army , regarded as a key factor in a dramatic drop in attacks in recent months , could collapse or that the U.S. military will have to bail out the Iraqis .
On Thursday , the Interior Ministry imposed a curfew through the weekend in Baghdad , Hilla , Kut , Diwaniya , Simawa and Basra .

Officials banned pedestrian , motorcycle and vehicular traffic through 5 a.m. Sunday ( 10 p.m. ET Saturday ) .

All About Nuri al - Maliki • Muqtada al - Sadr • Basra
In November 1994 , a Lodi man named Pete Rose  not the famous baseball player  was arrested for the kidnap and rape of a 13 - year - old girl .
Rose told a judge he did n’t need a lawyer , since he was n’t guilty , but he nevertheless accepted San Joaquin County ’s appointment of attorney Harry E. Hudson Jr. to defend him at trial .
It did n’t help .
A jury convicted Rose , who was sentenced to prison for 27 years .
Nearly a decade later , students at Golden Gate University School of Law ’s Innocence Project began investigating the case and obtained a semen sample from the rape victim ’s clothing ; a DNA test proved that Rose was not the assailant .
After he was released , the victim read about him in the newspaper and  according to a law review article on Rose ’s case by former Golden Gate Innocence Project Director Susan Rutberg  told the reporter :
“ I was never sure .
The police pressured me to name someone .
I only went along with them because I thought they had other evidence lined up against Rose . ”
In 2005 Rose , now released , was formally exonerated and found factually innocent  a rarity in criminal justice proceedings , well beyond a simple acquittal  of the charges against him .
He had spent 10 years at Mule Creek State Prison , where he was incorrectly considered a child rapist .
Rutberg argues in her article that Hudson , the defense lawyer , “ failed utterly to mount a persuasive defense . ”
The police interview with the victim had been taped , and in it she could be heard telling the police that she did n’t see the man ’s face and could n’t identify him .
Hudson did n’t use that tape to impeach the victim ’s trial testimony that Rose was the assailant , nor did he file a motion to suppress the victim ’s in - court identification of Rose as the result of a coercive police interrogation .
In her article , Rutberg details instances of what she labels prosecutorial misconduct as well as ineffective assistance of counsel .
But there is another frustrating chapter to Rose ’s story .
The wrongly convicted man , finally exonerated and released , without employment for 10 years , with four children to support and badly in need of money , sued his lawyer for malpractice .
But he could n’t get the case to trial , since the statute of limitations for legal malpractice had expired .
The time begins running when the client finds out , or should have found out , that his lawyer ’s work had fallen below the acceptable standard .
Rose showed he believed his lawyer committed malpractice as early as 1996 , when he filed an appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel .
One other , and bigger , problem :
In order for a client charged with a crime to prove his lawyer committed malpractice , the client must show he was factually innocent .
Makes sense ; the malpractice ca n’t be all that bad unless the lawyer represented an innocent man so poorly that he was convicted .
But wait ; you have to sue before the limitations period runs , but your suit ca n’t go forward unless you can show you were factually innocent .
The poorly represented and wrongly convicted criminal defendant is practically locked out of any relief against a negligent lawyer .
The only way out of the Catch - 22 is for the wrongly convicted person to sue , while still in prison , and ask the court to stay the suit while the inmate pursues appeals and other post - convictions remedies .
A panel studying California ’s criminal justice system has a better way .
The California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice on Friday called for the malpractice statute of limitations to start running after the “ granting of post conviction relief ” ; in Rose ’s case , that would be the final ruling finding him innocent .
It ’s just one of many recommendations aimed at erasing some ironic and agonizing quirks of law that work against wrongfully convicted Californians .
For example , a paroled felon gets assistance from the state to ease the transition .
Parolees get help finding housing and jobs .
They get counseling to deal with personal and family problems inherent in moving from incarceration back to freedom .
But you have to be on parole to get that help , and if you ’re exonerated , you ’re not on parole .
People like Rose can apply for $ 100 in compensation for every day they were wrongfully imprisoned  if they have the foresight to ask for it within six months of their release or pardon  but despite any psychological damage they may have suffered from being wrongly convicted and locked up , they do n’t get any of the services parolees get .
The commission is calling for legislation that for the first time would require the judge at the exoneration proceeding to advise the wrongfully convicted person of the right to apply for compensation .
The applicant would have two years to act instead of just six months .
Services made available to parolees also would be provided to the innocent ex-prisoners .
Assemblyman Jose Solorio , ( D - Anaheim ) , plans to introduce a bill on some of the commission ’s recommendations .
But many of the panel ’s findings call for money .
The commission called for compensation to at least match the $ 50,000 a year paid for false federal imprisonment , or $ 100,000 for every year an innocent person wrongly spends on death row .
More fundamentally , California already has cut its budget for providing counsel to assist prisoners in their innocence claims .
The various law - school - based innocence projects , which have helped exonerate 11 people in the state , may be forced by lack of funding to cut back their work .
That means state legal agencies would have to pick up the slack  but in this disastrous budget year , their resources too are threatened .
The report , while vital , is just a fraction of the work the commission is doing pursuant to direction by the California State Senate .
Last year , legislation recommended by the panel to correct problems that least to false confessions and bad suspect identifications passed both the Senate and the Assembly , only to be vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Lawmakers will try again this year .
The most controversial , and most anticipated , report is expected later this spring after the panel concludes hearings on the administration of California ’s death penalty .
Commission members are grappling with recommendations to reduce the backlog of post - conviction death penalty proceedings , including a call by Chief Justice Ronald George to allow the intermediate Court of Appeal to handle much of the review currently vested in the state Supreme Court .
Any change must go to the voters in the form of a constitutional amendment .
The commission is headed by former state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .
It was originally to disband at the end of last year , but the Senate extended its powers to June 30 , 2008 .
Robert Greene is a member of The Times ’ editorial board .
At least once a year during the 1980s Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld vanished .
Cheney was working diligently on Capitol Hill , as a congressman rising through the ranks of the Republican leadership .
Rumsfeld , who had served as Gerald Ford 's Secretary of Defense , was a hard - driving business executive in the Chicago area -- where , as the head of G. D. Searle & Co. , he dedicated time and energy to the success of such commercial products as Nutra - Sweet , Equal , and Metamucil .
Yet for periods of three or four days at a time no one in Congress knew where Cheney was , nor could anyone at Searle locate Rumsfeld .
Even their wives were in the dark ; they were handed only a mysterious Washington phone number to use in case of emergency .
After leaving their day jobs Cheney and Rumsfeld usually made their way to Andrews Air Force Base , outside Washington .
From there , in the middle of the night , each man -- joined by a team of forty to sixty federal officials and one member of Ronald Reagan 's Cabinet -- slipped away to some remote location in the United States , such as a disused military base or an underground bunker .
A convoy of lead - lined trucks carrying sophisticated communications equipment and other gear would head to each of the locations .
Rumsfeld and Cheney were principal actors in one of the most highly classified programs of the Reagan Administration .
Under it U.S. officials furtively carried out detailed planning exercises for keeping the federal government running during and after a nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
The program called for setting aside the legal rules for presidential succession in some circumstances , in favor of a secret procedure for putting in place a new " President " and his staff .
The idea was to concentrate on speed , to preserve " continuity of government , " and to avoid cumbersome procedures ; the speaker of the House , the president pro tempore of the Senate , and the rest of Congress would play a greatly diminished role .
The inspiration for this program came from within the Administration itself , not from Cheney or Rumsfeld ; except for a brief stint Rumsfeld served as Middle East envoy , neither of them ever held office in the Reagan Administration .
Nevertheless , they were leading figures in the program .
A few details about the effort have come to light over the years , but nothing about the way it worked or the central roles played by Cheney and Rumsfeld .
The program is of particular interest today because it helps to explain the thinking and behavior of the second Bush Administration in the hours , days , and months after the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .
Vice President Cheney urged President Bush to stay out of Washington for the rest of that day ; Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld ordered his deputy Paul Wolfowitz to get out of town ;
Cheney himself began to move from Washington to a series of " undisclosed locations " ; and other federal officials were later sent to work outside the capital , to ensure the continuity of government in case of further attacks .
All these actions had their roots in the Reagan Administration 's clandestine planning exercises .
The U.S. government considered the possibility of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union more seriously during the early Reagan years than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .
Reagan had spoken in his 1980 campaign about the need for civil - defense programs to help the United States survive a nuclear exchange , and once in office he not only moved to boost civil defense but also approved a new defense - policy document that included plans for waging a protracted nuclear war against the Soviet Union .
The exercises in which Cheney and Rumsfeld participated were a hidden component of these more public efforts to prepare for nuclear war .
The premise of the secret exercises was that in case of a nuclear attack on Washington , the United States needed to act swiftly to avoid " decapitation " -- that is , a break in civilian leadership .
A core element of the Reagan Administration 's strategy for fighting a nuclear war would be to decapitate the Soviet leadership by striking at top political and military officials and their communications lines ; the Administration wanted to make sure that the Soviets could n't do to America what U.S. nuclear strategists were planning to do to the Soviet Union .
Under the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations the U.S. government had built large underground installations at Mount Weather , in Virginia 's Blue Ridge Mountains , and near Camp David , along the Pennsylvania - Maryland border , each of which could serve as a military command post for the President in time of war .
Yet a crucial problem remained : what might happen if the President could n't make it to one of those bunkers in time .
The Constitution makes the Vice President the successor if the President dies or is incapacitated , but it establishes no order of succession beyond that .
Federal law , most recently the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 , establishes further details .
If the Vice President dies or cannot serve , then the speaker of the House of Representatives becomes President .
After him in the line of succession come the president pro tempore of the Senate ( typically the longest - serving member of the majority party ) and then the members of the Cabinet , in the order in which their posts were created -- starting with the Secretary of State and moving to the Secretary of the Treasury , the Secretary of Defense , and so on .
The Reagan Administration , however , worried that this procedure might not meet the split - second needs of an all - out war with the Soviet Union .
What if a nuclear attack killed both the President and the Vice President , and maybe the speaker of the House , too ?
Who would run the country if it was too hard to track down the next living person in line under the Succession Act ?
What civilian leader could immediately give U.S. military commanders the orders to respond to an attack , and how would that leader communicate with the military ?
In a continuing nuclear exchange , who would have the authority to reach an agreement with the Soviet leadership to bring the war to an end ?
The outline of the plan was simple .
Once the United States was ( or believed itself about to be ) under nuclear attack , three teams would be sent from Washington to three different locations around the United States .
Each team would be prepared to assume leadership of the country , and would include a Cabinet member who was prepared to become President .
If the Soviet Union were somehow to locate one of the teams and hit it with a nuclear weapon , the second team or , if necessary , the third could take over .
This was not some abstract textbook plan ; it was practiced in concrete and elaborate detail .
Each team was named for a color - - " red " or " blue , " for example -- and each had an experienced executive who could operate as a new White House chief of staff .
The obvious candidates were people who had served at high levels in the executive branch , preferably with the national - security apparatus .
Cheney and Rumsfeld had each served as White House chief of staff in the Ford Administration .
Other team leaders over the years included James Woolsey , later the director of the CIA , and Kenneth Duberstein , who served for a time as Reagan 's actual White House chief of staff .
As for the Cabinet members on each team , some had little experience in national security ; at various times , for example , participants in the secret exercises included John Block , Reagan 's first Secretary of Agriculture , and Malcolm Baldrige , the Secretary of Commerce .
What counted was not experience in foreign policy but , rather , that the Cabinet member was available .
It seems fair to conclude that some of these " Presidents " would have been mere figureheads for a more experienced chief of staff , such as Cheney or Rumsfeld .
Still , the Cabinet members were the ones who would issue orders , or in whose name the orders would be issued .
One of the questions studied in these exercises was what concrete steps a team might take to establish its credibility .
What might be done to demonstrate to the American public , to U.S. allies , and to the Soviet leadership that " President " John Block or " President " Malcolm Baldrige was now running the country , and that he should be treated as the legitimate leader of the United States ?
One option was to have the new " President " order an American submarine up from the depths to the surface of the ocean -- since the power to surface a submarine would be a clear sign that he was now in full control of U.S. military forces .
This standard -- control of the military -- is one of the tests the U.S. government uses in deciding whether to deal with a foreign leader after a coup d'état .

" One of the awkward questions we faced , " one participant in the planning of the program explains , " was whether to reconstitute Congress after a nuclear attack .
It was decided that no , it would be easier to operate without them . "
For one thing , it was felt that reconvening Congress , and replacing members who had been killed , would take too long .
Moreover , if Congress did reconvene , it might elect a new speaker of the House , whose claim to the presidency might have greater legitimacy than that of a Secretary of Agriculture or Commerce who had been set up as President under Reagan 's secret program .
The election of a new House speaker would not only take time but also create the potential for confusion .
The Reagan Administration 's primary goal was to set up a chain of command that could respond to the urgent minute - by - minute demands of a nuclear war , when there might be no time to swear in a new President under the regular process of succession , and when a new President would not have the time to appoint a new staff .
The Administration , however , chose to establish this process without going to Congress for the legislation that would have given it constitutional legitimacy .
Ronald Reagan established the continuity - of - government program with a secret executive order .
According to Robert McFarlane , who served for a time as Reagan 's National Security Adviser , the President himself made the final decision about who would head each of the three teams .
Within Reagan 's National Security Council the " action officer " for the secret program was Oliver North , later the central figure in the Iran - contra scandal .
Vice President George H.W. Bush was given the authority to supervise some of these efforts , which were run by a new government agency with a bland name : the National Program Office .
It had its own building in the Washington area , run by a two - star general , and a secret budget adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
Much of this money was spent on advanced communications equipment that would enable the teams to have secure conversations with U.S. military commanders .
In fact , the few details that have previously come to light about the secret program , primarily from a 1991 CNN investigative report , stemmed from allegations of waste and abuses in awarding contracts to private companies , and claims that this equipment malfunctioned .
The exercises were usually scheduled during a congressional recess , so that Cheney would miss as little work on Capitol Hill as possible .
Although Cheney , Rumsfeld , and one other team leader took part in each exercise , the Cabinet members changed depending on who was available at a particular time .
( Once , Attorney General Ed Meese participated in an exercise that departed from Andrews in the pre-dawn hours of June 18 , 1986 -- the day after Chief Justice Warren Burger resigned .
One official remembers looking at Meese and thinking , " First a Supreme Court resignation , and now America 's in a nuclear war .
You 're having a bad day . " )
In addition to the designated White House chief of staff and his President , each team included representatives from the Departments of State and Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency , and also from various domestic - policy agencies .
The idea was to practice running the entire federal government with a skeletal crew during a nuclear war .
At one point there was talk of bringing in the governors of Virginia and Maryland and the mayor of the District of Columbia , but the idea was discarded because they did n't have the necessary security clearance .
The exercises were designed to be stressful .
Participants gathered in haste , moved and worked in the early - morning hours , lived in Army - base conditions , and dined on early , particularly unappetizing versions of the military 's dry , mass - produced MREs ( meals ready to eat ) .
An entire exercise lasted close to two weeks , but each team took part for only three or four days .
One team would leave Washington , run through its drills , and then -- as if it were on the verge of being " nuked " -- hand off to the next team .
The plans were carried out with elaborate deception , designed to prevent Soviet reconnaissance satellites from detecting where in the United States the teams were going .
Thus the teams were sent out in the middle of the night , and changed locations from one exercise to the next .
Decoy convoys were sometimes dispatched along with the genuine convoys carrying the communications gear .
The underlying logic was that the Soviets could not possibly target all the makeshift locations around the United States where the Reagan teams might operate .
The capstone to all these efforts to stay mobile was a special airplane , the National Emergency Airborne Command Post , a modified Boeing 747 based at Andrews and specially outfitted with a conference room and advanced communications gear .
In it a President could remain in the air and run the country during a nuclear showdown .
In one exercise a team of officials stayed aloft in this plane for three days straight , cruising up and down the coasts and back and forth across the country , refueling in the air .
When George H.W. Bush was elected President , in 1988 , members of the secret Reagan program rejoiced ; having been closely involved with the effort from the start , Bush would n't need to be initiated into its intricacies and probably would n't re-evaluate it .
In fact , despite dramatically improved relations with Moscow , Bush did continue the exercises , with some minor modifications .
Cheney was appointed Secretary of Defense and dropped out as a team leader .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse , the rationale for the exercises changed .
A Soviet nuclear attack was obviously no longer plausible -- but what if terrorists carrying nuclear weapons attacked the United States and killed the President and the Vice President ?
Finally , during the early Clinton years , it was decided that this scenario was farfetched and outdated , a mere legacy of the Cold War .
It seemed that no enemy in the world was still capable of decapitating America 's leadership , and the program was abandoned .
There things stood until September 11 , 2001 , when Cheney and Rumsfeld suddenly began to act out parts of a script they had rehearsed years before .
Operating from the underground shelter beneath the White House , called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center , Cheney told Bush to delay a planned flight back from Florida to Washington .
At the Pentagon , Rumsfeld instructed a reluctant Wolfowitz to get out of town to the safety of one of the underground bunkers , which had been built to survive nuclear attack .
Cheney also ordered House Speaker Dennis Hastert , other congressional leaders , and several Cabinet members ( including Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman and Interior Secretary Gale Norton ) evacuated to one of these secure facilities away from the capital .
Explaining these actions a few days later , Cheney vaguely told NBC's Tim Russert , " We did a lot of planning during the Cold War with respect to the possibility of a nuclear incident . "
He did not mention the Reagan Administration program or the secret drills in which he and Rumsfeld had regularly practiced running the country .
Their participation in the extra-constitutional continuity - of - government exercises , remarkable in its own right , also demonstrates a broad , underlying truth about these two men .
For three decades , from the Ford Administration onward , even when they were out of the executive branch of government , they were never far away .
They stayed in touch with defense , military , and intelligence officials , who regularly called upon them .
They were , in a sense , a part of the permanent hidden national - security apparatus of the United States -- inhabitants of a world in which Presidents come and go , but America keeps on fighting .

McCain : I would have started Iraq war regardless of WMD David Edwards and Katie Baker
Published : Sunday January 6 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This According to presidential candidate John McCain , only the handling of the Iraq war was a mistake -- not the war itself .
" It 's not American presence that bothers the American people , it 's American causalities , " said McCain in an interview with Tim Russert on NBC's " Meet The Press " on Sunday .
The validity of this conjecture is questionable , as fifty - nine percent of Americans say the U.S. should stick to a withdrawal timetable . "
But McCain said in a recent New Hampshire debate -- and reasserted as much on Sunday -- that as long as Americans are n't dying , he sees nothing wrong with US troops staying as many as 100 years in Iraq .
" What I believe we can achieve is a reduction in casualties to the point where the Iraqis are doing the fighting and dying [ and ] we 're supporting them , " McCain said .
He said it would be " hard to say " how many U.S. troops would need to stay in Iraq , but assured that they would be " out of harm 's way . "
When Russert asked him if , like Bush , McCain would have supported the Iraq war even if no weapons of mass destruction were believed present in Iraq , McCain seemed to dismiss the question as irrelevant .
" If frogs had wings ... we can talk about lots of hypotheticals , " he said .
" The point is if we had done it right , you and I would n't even be discussing it now . "
This video is from NBC's Meet the Press , broadcast January 6 , 2008 .
Excerpts from transcript : # MR. RUSSERT : Looking back at the beginning of the war back in March of 2003 -- SEN .
McCAIN : Yes .
MR .
RUSSERT : If you had known then , if the intelligence came out and said , " We know that Saddam Hussein does not have biological or chemical or a nuclear program , " would you still have voted to authorize the war ?
SEN .
McCAIN : Well , obviously , given information that we have changes your decision - making process .
But Saddam Hussein was still a threat .
The sanctions were breaking down .
There was a multibillion dollar Oil for Food scandal in the United Nations .
Every day , American airplanes were being shot at .
Saddam Hussein had used and required weapons of mass destruction in the past , and there was no doubt there was going to be in the future .
The problem in Iraq , my friend , was not whether we went in or not , it 's the way it was mishandled after the initial invasion .
MR .
RUSSERT : But , Senator , it 's an important question -- President Bush has said , " Even if I knew he did not have biological , chemical , or a nuclear program , I still would go into Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein . "
Would you have ?
SEN .
McCAIN : Yes , but the point is , that if we had done it right , it 's been well chronicled in many books , you and I would n't even be discussing that now -- the mishandling after the war .
Look , I met with a high - ranking former al Qaeda operative in Iraq recently , and I asked him , " How did you succeed ? "
He said , " The lawlessness after the initial invasion and Abu Ghraib , " and so they were able to recruit people because of the disorder and the mishandling .
So you would not be asking me if it had been mishandled .
You would have said because we succeeded and established the stable Iraq , you 'd have said , " Are n't you glad we went in because Saddam Hussein , one of the most brutal , most terrible dictators in history who fought in several wars , used weapons of mass destruction , invaded this neighbor , is now gone from the world scene . "
That 's what you'd be saying .
MR .
RUSSERT : I think there would be a debate amongst the American people if we were told he did not have biological , chemical , or nuclear weapons .
SEN .
McCAIN : If frogs had wings -- look , Tim , we can talk about lots of hypotheticals .
Would we have stopped Saddam Hussein from going into Kuwait back in '91 when he went in ?
Would we have said that the Chinese are n't going to cross -- if we had known that the Chinese were going to cross the Yalu in the Korean War , would we have done it differently ?
I 'd love to get into thousands of historical hypotheticals -- inaudible -- but what we knew at the time , and the information we had at the time , then every single intelligence agency in the world believed he had weapons of mass destruction .
MR .
RUSSERT : So , bottom line , the war was not a mistake .
SEN .
McCAIN : The war , " the invasion " was not a mistake .
The handling of the war was a terrible mistake . #

The gods have many temples in their name Pic : Vivek Raj
Judge Sunil Kumar
Singh in the eastern state of Jharkhand has issued adverts in newspapers asking the gods to " appear before the court personally " .
The gods have been asked to appear before the court on Tuesday , after the judge said that letters addressed to them had gone unanswered .
Ram and Hanuman are among the most popular Indian Hindu gods .
Judge Singh presides in a " fast track " court - designed to resolve disputes quickly - in the city of Dhanbad .
The dispute is now 20 years old and revolves around the ownership of a 1.4 acre plot of land housing two temples .
You failed to appear in the court despite notices sent by a peon and post
Judge Sunil Kumar Singh in letter to Lord Ram and Hanuman
The deities of Ram and Hanuman , the monkey god , are worshipped at the two temples on the land .
Temple priest Manmohan Pathak claims the land belongs to him .
Locals say it belongs to the two deities .
The two sides first went to court in 1987 .
A few years ago , the dispute was settled in favour of the locals .
Then Mr Pathak challenged the verdict in a fast track court .
Gift
Judge Singh sent out two notices to the deities , but they were returned as the addresses were found to be " incomplete " .
Local say the temple belongs to the gods Pic : Mahadeo Sen
" You failed to appear in court despite notices sent by a peon and later through registered post .
You are herby directed to appear before the court personally " , Judge Singh 's notice said .
The two Hindu gods have been summoned as the defence claimed that they were owners of the disputed land .
" Since the land has been donated to the gods , it is necessary to make them a party to the case , " local lawyer Bijan Rawani said .
Mr Pathak said the land was given to his grandfather by a former local king .
A LARGE but long - in - the - tooth technology company hoping to become a bigger force in online advertising buys a small start - up in a sector that everybody agrees is the next big thing .
A decade ago , this was Microsoft buying Hotmail — the firm that established web - based e-mail as a must - have service for internet users , and promised to drive up page views , and thus advertising inventory , on the software giant 's websites .
This month it was AOL , a struggling web portal that is part of Time Warner , an old - media giant , buying Bebo , a small but up - and - coming online social network , for $ 850 m .
Both deals , in their respective decades , illustrate a great paradox of the internet in that the premise underlying them is precisely half right and half wrong .
The correct half is that a next big thing — web - mail then , social networking now — can indeed quickly become something that consumers expect from their favourite web portal .
The non sequitur is to assume that the new service will be a revenue - generating business in its own right .
Web - mail has certainly not become a business .
Admittedly , Google , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , AOL and other providers of web - mail accounts do place advertisements on their web - mail offerings , but this is small beer .
They offer e-mail — and volumes of free archival storage unimaginable a decade ago — because the service , including its associated address book , calendar , and other features , is cheap to deliver and keeps consumers engaged with their brands and websites , making users more likely to visit affiliated pages where advertising is more effective .
Social networking appears to be similar in this regard .
The big internet and media companies have bid up the implicit valuations of MySpace , Facebook and others .
But that does not mean there is a working revenue model .
Sergey Brin , Google 's co-founder , recently admitted that Google 's “ social networking inventory as a whole ” was proving problematic and that the “ monetisation work we were doing there did n't pan out as well as we had hoped . ”
Google has a contractual agreement with News Corp to place advertisements on its network , MySpace , and also owns its own network , Orkut .
Clearly , Google is not making money from either .
Facebook , now allied to Microsoft , has fared worse .
Its grand attempt to redefine the advertising industry by pioneering a new approach to social marketing , called Beacon , failed completely .
Facebook 's idea was to inform a user 's friends whenever he bought something at certain online retailers , by running a small announcement inside the friends ' “ news feeds ” .
In theory , this was to become a new recommendation economy , an algorithmic form of word of mouth .
In practice , users rebelled and privacy watchdogs cried foul .
Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook 's founder , admitted in December that “ we simply did a bad job with this release ” and apologised .
So it is entirely conceivable that social networking , like web - mail , will never make oodles of money .
That , however , in no way detracts from its enormous utility .
Social networking has made explicit the connections between people , so that a thriving ecosystem of small programs can exploit this “ social graph ” to enable friends to interact via games , greetings , video clips and so on .
Coming up for air
But should users really have to visit a specific website to do this sort of thing ?
“ We will look back to 2008 and think it archaic and quaint that we had to go to a destination like Facebook or Linked In to be social , ” says Charlene Li at Forrester Research , a consultancy .
Future social networks , she thinks , “ will be like air .
They will be anywhere and everywhere we need and want them to be . ”
No more logging on to Facebook just to see the “ news feed ” of updates from your friends ; instead it will come straight to your e-mail inbox , RSS reader or instant messenger .
No need to upload photos to Facebook to show them to friends , since those with privacy permissions in your electronic address book can automatically get them .
The problem with today 's social networks is that they are often closed to the outside web .
The big networks have decided to be “ open ” toward independent programmers , to encourage them to write fun new software for them .
But they are reluctant to become equally open towards their users , because the networks ' lofty valuations depend on maximising their page views — so they maintain a tight grip on their users ' information , to ensure that they keep coming back .
As a result , avid internet users often maintain separate accounts on several social networks , instant - messaging services , photo - sharing and blogging sites , and usually cannot even send simple messages from one to the other .
They must invite the same friends to each service separately .
It is a drag .
Historically , online media tend to start this way .
The early services , such as CompuServe , Prodigy or AOL , began as “ walled gardens ” before they opened up to become websites .
The early e-mail services could send messages only within their own walls ( rather as Facebook 's messaging does today ) .
Instant - messaging , too , started closed , but is gradually opening up .
In social networking , this evolution is just beginning .
Parts of the industry are collaborating in a “ data portability workgroup ” to let people move their friend lists and other information around the web .
Others are pushing OpenID , a plan to create a single , federated sign - on system that people can use across many sites .
The opening of social networks may now accelerate thanks to that older next big thing , web -mail .
As a technology , mail has come to seem rather old - fashioned .
But Google , Yahoo ! , Microsoft and other firms are now discovering that they may already have the ideal infrastructure for social networking in the form of the address books , in - boxes and calendars of their users .
“ E - mail in the wider sense is the most important social network , ” says David Ascher , who manages Thunderbird , a cutting - edge open - source e-mail application , for the Mozilla Foundation , which also oversees the popular Firefox web browser .
That is because the extended in - box contains invaluable and dynamically updated information about human connections .
On Facebook , a social graph notoriously deteriorates after the initial thrill of finding old friends from school wears off .
By contrast , an e-mail account has access to the entire address book and can infer information from the frequency and intensity of contact as it occurs .
Joe gets e-mails from Jack and Jane , but opens only Jane 's ; Joe has Jane in his calendar tomorrow , and is instant - messaging with her right now ; Joe tagged Jack “ work only ” in his address book .
Perhaps
Joe 's party photos should be visible to Jane , but not Jack .
This kind of social intelligence can be applied across many services on the open web .
Better yet , if there is no pressure to make a business out of it , it can remain intimate and discreet .
Facebook has an economic incentive to publish ever more data about its users , says Mr Ascher , whereas Thunderbird , which is an open - source project , can let users minimise what they share .
Social networking may end up being everywhere , and yet nowhere .
Sean Young Voluntarily Enters Rehab on Monday
Following an embarrassing outburst on Saturday night at the Director 's Guild Awards , 48 , voluntarily checked into a rehabilitation center for treatment of alcohol addiction on Monday .
Her representative indicated that the actress has struggled with alcohol issues for years .
Young heckled the director of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , Julian Schnabel , while he was speaking on stage and continued to make a scene during the showing of a George Clooney film clip .
Her latest body of work has included episodes of One Tree Hill , CSI and ER .
She broke into films in the late 1980's , with roles in movies which include Ace Ventura : Pet Detective and Cousins .

There 's real variety :
In a genre badly abandoned by an entire industry recently — long before Napster , in fact — DG has put up a serious catalog .
And in a big change , instead of publishing a subset of their current catalog , they 've actually re-released " out - of - print " albums .
Lest you think I 'm shilling for UMG , they 've released a couple of my personal faves I only had access to on vinyl , and made contemporary music far more accessible .
The terms and conditions are kind of a mess here .
On the one hand , the terms say ( i ) that this is a purchase , not a mere license , so the file becomes your property and ( iii ) that you 're basically only expected to obey copyright law , not a bunch of made - up rules that Universal has imposed on you as a condition of selling you the music .
But on the other hand , you " agree " ( iii , iv ) that this is only for personal use without any right to redistribute ( sell , loan , give away ) the files , which are all rights that you get under copyright .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 20  Who says the Senate can not act quickly ?
It conducted a full day ’s business in less than 30 seconds on Tuesday .
Of course , there was no real business to conduct .
But fearing that President Bush would again use a Congressional recess to install disputed executive branch appointees without Senate confirmation , Democrats convened the Senate for the first of four microsessions to be held during the holiday break , precisely to thwart such an end run .
“ I am glad to see the leadership stepped up here , ” said Jim Webb , the junior senator from Virginia , called upon by the majority to open the Senate with a skeleton staff for the express purpose of immediately closing it down .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , chose to schedule the so - called pro forma sessions because Mr. Bush took advantage of past recesses to install nominees including John R. Bolton , as ambassador to the United Nations , and , most recently , Sam Fox , a donor to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , as ambassador to Belgium .
This time , Democrats were particularly suspicious of plans to appoint as surgeon general a nominee they oppose .
TOKYO ( AP )  A Russian Air Force bomber briefly violated Japanese airspace on Saturday over an uninhabited island south of Tokyo , prompting Japan to scramble 22 fighter jets and issue a protest with Moscow , the Foreign Ministry here said .
The Russian Air Force denied the intrusion .
The Russian Tupolev 95 left Japanese airspace within three minutes of warnings by Japanese Air Force jets over Sofugan in the Izu island chain , 400 miles south of Tokyo , a Foreign Ministry official said .
The ministry immediately protested to the Russian Embassy in Tokyo and demanded an explanation , said the official , Kotaro Otsuki .
A switchboard operator at the embassy said no one there was available for comment .
ITAR - Tass news agency quoted the director of the Russian Air Force information service , Alexander Drobyshevsky , as denying the intrusion , saying the plane flew over neutral waters .
Despite Microsoft 's claims that hacking simply does n't occur on Xbox Live , recently a hacker broke into the account of a Halo 3 player and made off with his coveted " Recon Armor . "
The in - game armor set is only available as a gift given out by Microsoft or Halo 3 creator Bungie .
Since the virtual break - in ( and two similar incidents in the past ) , the victim claims he has attempted to contact Microsoft who transferred his call throughout their customer service center before hanging up on him .
This whole sordid tale plays out across the player 's clan forum where , amidst the consolations of his virtual pals , the hacker shows up to taunt the player .
In a demonstration of pure hubris , the hacker reveals his methods saying " it wasnt anything serious , i got his account in 1 call about 15 minutes . "
This , of course , comes after he spews your typical hyper - racist sentiments to rile the crowd .
Then , in typical forum fashion , both the hacker and the forum members engage in a 13 - page - long thread of insulting one another 's parentage , weight , height , race , religion and sexual proclivities .
While it 's unsurprising that virtual theft exists within Xbox Live – after all , this sort of thing is present in any virtual setting with enough members – it provides some hilarious / depressing drama , depending on your personal feelings on the subject .
It 's a shame that the gamer 's precious armor was taken , but if it ( and the press it has received ) convinces Microsoft to shore up their security efforts , it 's well worth the hassle .

This is where things got crazy .
I do n't know if you slipped , or thought I was taking you home to kill you , or if your 're just plain crazy and had a change of heart , but all of a sudden you let go of me MID - TURN and went flying into the bushes at about 10 - 15 mph near the park by my house .
I was so freaked out !!!
when I looked back to see you fumbling in the bushes I could only PRAY TO GOD that you did n't hit the asphalt or something worse .
I really thought you must have been hurt at least a bit , but as I turned around to come check on you , you took off into the unlit park running full speed with my helmet and jacket still on !
I parked my bike and looked for you for over 2 hours calling your name until I was so cold I had to go home or risk freezing to death .
WTFIm sorry for what happened and I really hope your 're ok , really I do , but seriously WTF .
Running into a forested park in the middle of the night like that .... I really can't begin to guess what you were thinking , and you were n't that drunk , but i suppose my " crazy - bitch o' meter " was n't working at the bar that night , and from the speed you took off I can only surmise that your 're not that hurt .
I would like my expensive bike gear back though , I hope it kept you warm during your psychotic episode , but it IS mine and I kinda need it to get around in the winter .
If you could return it to the bar for me , check in with your shrink , and promise to never come near me again that would be great , cause you scared the #*$ % outta me and are costing me alot of money .
Sincerely , Very cold / poor motorcycle rider who will never let women near his bike again .

As Tuesday ’s California presidential primary approaches , voters who have n’t yet made up their minds are weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates -- and evaluating their own ideas of what they want in a president .
For many undecided Democrats , the question is not simply which candidate they like best , but which has the best chance of winning in November .
A Times Poll last week indicated that the vast majority of California voters had made up their minds , but that a substantial number were wavering -- 27 % of Clinton ’s supporters and 34 % of Obama’s .
Election officials expect a high turnout , and Democratic leaders say voters are enthusiastic about their choices .

A record number of new voters -- almost 151,000 -- registered as Democrats in the final 45 days of eligibility for Tuesday ’s election , party officials say .
“ We have not seen this level of enthusiasm in a presidential primary in decades , ” said California Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres .
Independent voters , who make up nearly 20 % of the electorate , also can vote in the Democratic primary if they request a ballot .
The race has been hotly contested , particularly in the Bay Area , the state ’s most heavily Democratic region .
Obama ’s campaign staked it out first , running television ads here ahead of Clinton .
Both candidates and their biggest surrogates have visited the area repeatedly .
At the San Francisco Ferry Building , a restored landmark with restaurants , specialty shops and throngs of people , interviews with dozens of voters suggested that Obama supporters remained firm in their views while Clinton supporters were less certain .

Ellen Chapin , who works at a Ferry Building flower shop , said she initially favored Clinton but now did n’t know who would get her vote .
She worries that if Clinton becomes the nominee , it will galvanize Republican voters who love to hate the Clintons .
“ Basically , I want a Democrat , ” Chapin said .
“ I want the Republicans out .
I will pick who I really think can win . ”
Chapin said she began reconsidering her support for Clinton after her daughter pushed her to vote for the Illinois senator .
Then came endorsements for Obama from Sen. Edward Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy , which Chapin said “ kind of stopped me in my tracks . ”
“ I would love to see a woman be president , but I do n’t want it to be the only factor , ” she said .
“ Hillary is more unifying for the Republicans .
It ’s scary that people dislike the Clintons so much . ”

Democrats Susan McMane , 59 , and Mac Jernigan , 65 , both of San Francisco , have been having similar thoughts .
Clinton would be a strong candidate and would run a formidable campaign , they say .
But as Arizona Sen .
John McCain consolidates his position as the GOP front - runner , it suddenly looks as though the Republicans have a candidate who could beat her , they say .
Now , they are taking a closer look at Obama .
“ I have a lot of soul - searching to do , ” McMane said .
Mary Kapp of San Francisco had planned to vote for former Sen. John Edwards .
But even after he dropped out last week , the English language instructor still finds herself with two appealing alternatives .
“ You have two rather unique things happening , ” she said .
“ You have a woman with a viable chance of becoming president and an African American who has a viable chance . ”

She wonders if the country is ready for either , but says she is leaning toward Obama because he seems more visionary and less likely to get caught up in political games .
“ It ’s really exciting , ” she said .
“ Finally an election has come along where you feel you have some choices . ”
Smith , the San Francisco investment banker , said she was leaning toward Obama because she was worried that Clinton could seem too forceful .
“ I ’ve been going back and forth , ” she said .
“ I like Hillary a lot .
But Hillary is a bit frightening in ways .
She ’s a very strong and powerful woman , but she also has some of the less positive attributes of a woman . ”

Stephanie Hansen , also a San Francisco investment banker , says she is still researching the candidates but is leaning toward Clinton .
“ At this point I do n’t think there are any policy differences between them , ” she said .
“ I like the fact of having a woman . ”
She suspects Clinton would fare better against McCain than Obama would .
“ I would say Hillary has more experience in running a campaign , ” she said .
“ Obama is more nontraditional . ”

Elice Acosta , who recently became unemployed , said she felt as though she could trust Clinton more because she is a woman , but saw Obama being able to reach out to a broader sector of the public .
“ I feel like if I knew her I would probably like her , ” the Sausalito resident said .
“ For women , she ’s a great role model .
But I see more support going to Obama and I see him being able to bridge the gap with Republicans . ”
Lynn , the mushroom store clerk who is voting in her first election , said Obama was her first choice .
But after spending a month in Arizona recently and hearing the negative reaction Obama was getting , she is now leaning toward Hillary .
“ Even though I ’m not racist , I do n’t think our country is ready to vote for an African American , sad to say , ” said the 19 - year - old San Franciscan , who is registered as an independent .
“ I do n’t want to vote for the losing team . ”

Still , Clinton has n’t completely won her over .
“ The only reason I ’m undecided , ” Lynn said , “ is that I ’m not sure if what Hillary says is to please everybody , or if she really means it . ”

Geopolitics The Real Iranian Threat : Undermining Dollar Hegemony By Ryan McGreal
Published July 16 , 2007
With the US the US current accounts deficit approaching $ 800 billion for 2007 and the dollar continuing to fall against other currencies ( for example , a Canadian dollar is worth $ 0.951 US dollars at this writing ) , the US cannot afford for international demand for the dollar to fall .
One guaranteed source of demand for dollar demoninated assets is the petrodollar system , under which anyone buying oil from an OPEC member must buy it using US dollars .
This creates a guaranteed market for dollars and allows the US to run current accounts deficits ( i.e. to import more than it exports every year ) .
In fact , rising oil prices allow the US to run larger deficits , since oil importing countries must spend more on the oil they buy .
Into this milieu , Iran is escalating its dollar counter - hegemony by reducing its dollar reserves and asking Japanese buyers to start paying for its oil in yen instead of dollars .
The yen rose on speculation for an increase in demand for the currency , the result of Japan 's annual 1.24 trillion yen ( $ 10.1 billion ) of oil imports from Iran .
Central bankers in Venezuela , Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will invest less of their reserves in dollar assets because of the weakening currency .
This continues a global trend of countries acting to insulate themselves from the steadily weakening dollar :
Iran is n't alone in wanting to drop the dollar for pricing oil .
Russia has been examining plans to price the Urals oil export blend in rubles to curb currency risks .
The nation plans to open the Energy Stock Exchange in St. Petersburg in the first half of next year to trade oil in rubles , UBS AG reported June 14 .
Venezuela , another " hostile " country whose president the US likes to threaten , has also gone off the petrodollar system .
Last Chance to Bomb , Bomb Iran
As a result , we should not be surprised at all to learn that the Bush Administration is eager to initiate military action against Iran before President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney leave office .
This culminates an internal rift between the hawks and doves in the White House , pitting Condoleeza Rice against Dick Cheney .
The Guardian reports :
The Washington source said Mr Bush and Mr Cheney did not trust any potential successors in the White House , Republican or Democratic , to deal with Iran decisively .
They are also reluctant for Israel to carry out any strikes because the US would get the blame in the region anyway .
Naturally , the ostensible reason for military strikes against Iran is its effort to develop nuclear energy , which is legal under the Non-Proliferation Treaty but which the US insists constitutes a covert effort on Iran 's part to acquire nuclear weapons capability .
This ongoing US campaign against Iran represents the apex of neoconservative political strategy , which favours bellicose diplomacy and military action over the slower path of compromise and mutual respect ; and which favours secrecy , propaganda and Plato 's Noble Lie over democracy and the rule of law .
Undermining US Hegemony
The real issue in Iran is its open opposition to US hegemony .
The same people who , in 1992 , drafted a Defense Policy Guidance in which they warned , " we must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role " are today trying to prevent Iran from aspiring to a larger regional or global role .
In the Cold War era , this would have been called a non-aligned foreign policy .
In other words , Iran refuses to kowtow to US interests .
Undermining dollar hegemony is only one aspect of this process .
In a larger framework , Iran is building strategic alliances with Venezuela , China , Russia , and ( to a lesser extent ) India in a loose partnership that would engage the US not as a series of dependents but as a bloc with mutual interests and enough power to be taken seriously .

Barack Obama ’s spectacular win in Wisconsin has the GOP frightened .
The Democratic turnout was much , much better than the Republican .
The Democrats and independents are energized .
Senator John McCain could not get the independents out in Wisconsin , and the Republican turnout was lackluster .
In politics , failure always produces bluster .
McCain spoke after his primary victory in Wisconsin last night , casting himself as a voice of experience in foreign policy .
He said things like this :
‘ I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change that promises no more than a holiday from history . . .
Today , political change in Pakistan is occurring that might affect our relationship with a nuclear armed nation that is indispensable to our success in combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and elsewhere .
. .
Will the next President have the experience , the judgment experience informs , and the strength of purpose to respond to each of these developments in ways that strengthen our security and advance the global progress of our ideals ?
Or will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate who once suggested invading our ally , Pakistan , and sitting down without pre-conditions or clear purpose with enemies who support terrorists and are intent on destabilizing the world by acquiring nuclear weapons ? ’
These remarks were aimed at Barack Obama , and they are lies .
McCain has repeatedly made this false charge , warning against sending troops to Waziristan .
But Obama never advocated invading Pakistan with US ground troops .
He said that the US should strike at al - Qaeda if it had actionable intelligence about its whereabouts in Pakistan , even if the Pakistani authorities refused to give permission .
This stance is US policy .
In fact , George W. Bush implemented it with a Predator attack on an al - Qaeda leader in Pakistan just a couple of weeks ago , an attack that the Pakistani government declined to authorize .
( Kevin Hayden concurs ) .
Actually , one of our overly deferential journalists should please get some backbone and just ask McCain what he would do if he had intelligence on Bin Laden ’s whereabouts in Pakistan and could not get authorization from Islamabad to strike at him .
I personally think that Obama was unwise to make the statement he did , because there are some things better left unsaid .
But aside from pure pacifists , what American would not pull the trigger on that old monster Usamah if he or she had the chance ?
I mind McCain pulling a Rove and making hay with a policy stance of his opponent that he actually agrees with .
And I think there is good reason to ask whether McCain helped create al - Qaeda and the mess in Pakistan to begin with .
It is time for someone to start holding the Cold Warriors who deployed a militant Muslim covert army against their leftist enemies accountable for the blow - back they created .
Moreover , does McCain really know much about how the world works ?
Does he really understand Middle Eastern history ?
McCain thinks when “ only ’ 4 US troops are wounded in a single day in Iraq , or when only 15 Iraqi police are killed in mortar strikes in a single day , that is a sign of ‘ calm ’ and that the ‘ surge is working ’ in Iraq , and it is all right for us to put up with these US casualties for the next 100 years and spend $ 9 billion a month on this boondoggle for his friends in Houston .
He is part of a successful propaganda campaign , as Tom Engelhardt points out that has made Iraq disappear as an issue even though people die there every day and the US is hemorrhaging blood and treasure for goals that remain , to say the least , murky .
McCain even manages to celebrate the defeat of al - Qaeda in Iraq at the same time as he insists the US has to stay in Iraq a hundred years to fight al - Qaeda !
Which is it ?
Either the surge has failed in its goals or it has succeeded .
If it has succeeded , why do we have to stay ?
If it has failed , when will it succeed ?
And , let ’s just consider the shaky dictator Pervez Musharraf , who just suffered a sharp rebuke from the Pakistani electorate , as I wrote about today in Salon.com .
McCain appears never to have met a rightwing dictator he did n’t like .
McCain defends the dictator .
Here is what McCain said about Musharraf late last December :
“ Prior to Musharraf , Pakistan was a failed state , ” McCain said .
“ They had corrupt governments and they would rotate back and forth and there was corruption , and Musharraf basically restored order .
So you ’re going to hear a lot of criticism about Musharraf that he has n’t done everything we wanted him to do , but he did agree to step down as head of the military and he did get the elections . ”
So in the building confrontation between democratic parties and the military dictator who trashed the rule of law , which would McCain support ?
What kind of relations will a president McCain have with the new prime minister of Pakistan if McCain is on record supporting the dictatorship that preceded ?
The potted history McCain offers is wrong , and it points to the deep problems of authoritarianism and admiration for dictatorship in McCain ’s political philosophy .
Pakistan was not a failed state before 1999 , and in fact most of its political problems derived from repeated military coups such as the one spearheaded by Musharraf , as well as from the US government giving the Pakistani military gobs of money and enormous stockpiles of weapons , and winking at its nuclear program .
In fact by “ US government ” above , we really could just substitute “ Senator John McCain . ”
Pakistan ’s constitution prescribes a parliamentary government .
When the military has allowed Pakistanis to go to the polls , they have elected moderate , centrist political parties such as the Pakistan People ’s Party and the Muslim League .
Those parties have longstanding grass roots , cadres , canvassers , and loyal constituencies .
Bhutto was elected in 1971 as head of the PPP .
The PPP was overthrown in 1977 by Gen. Zia ul - Haq , a fundamentalist general who had his boss , PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto hanged on trumped - up charges in 1979 and who kept promising new elections that never came .
Gen .
Zia sponsored the Muslim fundamentalist Mujahidin that Ronald Reagan called “ freedom fighters , ” and which included the early al - Qaeda .
He also put enormous resources into making an atomic bomb .
Nowadays a leader of that description would be part of Bush ’s axis of evil .
But Reagan cozied up to Zia like a cat to catnip .
And McCain went out to cozy up to the military dictator himself , in February of 1984 .
McCain supported the Reagan jihad , cynically deploying radical Muslim extremists like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar against leftist secularists in Afghanistan .
Here is what McCain was up to when the radical Muslim extremist Gen. Zia was in power in Pakistan , according to UPI , Feb. 17 , 1984 :
‘ Senator John Tower , R - Texas , and Rep. John McCain , R - Ariz . , arrived in the Pakistani capital Friday evening for the start of a three - day visit .
During their stay , the legislators will meet Pakistan ’s military president , General Mohammad Zia ul - Haq , and other top officials .
. .
While in Pakistan , they will also visit an Afghan refugee tent village on the outskirts of Peshawar , near the border with Soviet - occupied Afghanistan .
On arrival at Islamabad airport , they were received by U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton and Pakistani Defense Secretary Aftab Ahmad Khan . ’
Now McCain is the big expert on problem solving in Pakistan .
McCain is the Pied Piper of Hamelin ; he ’ll be glad to get rid of your rat problem , but at the price of making your children disappear .
So lest we take any holidays from history , I have some questions for John McCain .
Did you or did you not know about Gen .
Zia ’s nuclear weapons program ?
Did you wink at it ?
If so does n’t that make you a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction to a radical Muslim extremist regime ?
And what about this AP article from 1985 :
‘ Rep. Tom Loeffler , R - Tex. , presented the “ Freedom Fighter of the Year ” award to Afghan resistance leader Wali Khan on behalf of the U.S. Council for World Freedom on Oct.
3 . Loeffler called on Congress and the American people to “ broaden support ” for freedom fighters in Afghanistan , reminding listeners of America ’s own fight for freedom .
Congress has agreed to give $ 15 million in covert assistance to the Afghan cause , the first time the legislators have “ stepped forward ” with aid since the beginning of the conflict , according to Loeffler .
. .
Accepting the award on behalf of Khan was Pir Syed Ahmed Gailani , head of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan , for which Khan commands 20,000 resistance fighters .
Other congressmen who joined Loeffler included Rep. Eldon Rudd and Rep. John McCain , both Arizona Republicans . ‘
So how much support did John McCain give to the precursors of the Taliban in Afghanistan ?
To the budding al - Qaeda ?
Despite what McCain says about military rule bringing stability , the opposite is the case .
Never mind the dirty war in Afghanistan that led to the displacement abroad of 5 million Afghans , 3 million of them to Pakistan , and which helped destabilize Pakistan .
Never mind the filling of Pakistan with machine guns and drug smuggling to support McCain ’s al - Qaeda “ freedom fighters , ” which created a million heroin addicts in Pakistan .
Karachi spiralled into virtual civil war in the mid to late 1980s under Zia .
There were massive Shiite demonstrations against unfair Sunni fundamentalist policies of Zia .
A Movement for the Restoration of Democracy began mobilizing political parties .
Zia put Benazir Bhutto of the Pakistan People ’s Party under arbitrary house arrest .
Gen .
Zia finally exited the scene in a summer , 1988 , airplane crash .
But he left behind 16 martial law amendments , among them a provision for the president , who is not popularly elected , to arbitrarily dismiss parliament and the prime minister .
It would be as though Bush could fire Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and hold new elections whenever he liked , timing them so that the Republicans had an advantage .
That power of the president to just sack the prime minister was never legislated by any representative of the Pakistani people .
It is a martial law amendment .
It was legislated by Gen. Zia , friend of Muslim radicals .
So it was not the fault of the civilian political parties that the governments would “ rotate back and forth , ” in McCain ’s words .
Ghulam Ishaq Khan , who was never popularly elected president but rather got the post by a kind of default , kept dismissing the elected prime ministers .
As for there being corruption , la di da .
The Republican Party , home of Tom Delay and Jack Abramoff , should talk about corruption .
And as for that crack about civilian governments “ rotating back and forth , ” is n’t that a common thing in democracies ?
But the rotation was n’t anyway natural .
It was a product of high - handed , dictatorial presidents exercising martial law powers and sometimes being blackmailed into doing so by powerful covert intelligence officials .
The martial law amendment allowed presidents to dismiss three governments in a row .
And then the fourth civilian government , of Nawaz Sharif ’s second term , was overthrown .
The instrument was an illegal and extra-constitutional coup by Gen. Pervez Musharraf .
Musharraf was a hawk who backed the Taliban ( and very likely al - Qaeda ) in Afghanistan and who nearly provoked two wars with India .
Yes , a pillar of stability , as McCain says .
Quite right .
Among the reasons alleged for his coup against Sharif was that he feared Sharif would back off from supporting the Taliban under Clinton administration pressure , and that Sharif would make peace with India at Washington ’s insistence .
The very essence of stability .
Sharif had agreed to send in a special operations team to kill or capture Usama Bin Ladin in neighboring Afghanistan in 1999 .
When Musharraf made his coup , he reneged on the deal .
I.e. , Musharraf is indirectly implicated in the September 11 attacks insofar as he could have perhaps prevented them by taking out Bin Laden and he refused .
Yes , as McCain says , a great pillar of stability .
The Pakistani military had created the political instability with its earlier coups and martial law amendments and creation of arbitrary , dictatorial powers vested in the president , which lightly disregarded the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box .
And now in 1999 , the military got rid of the civilian government altogether for a while , until in 2002 the US State Department pressured Musharraf to allow elections .
Musharraf did not dare actually run for office against a real opponent .
He staged a “ referendum , ” in which he got less that 50 % of the vote , but since he had no opponent he could hardly lose .
He rigged the parliamentary elections of fall 2002 , ensuring that his Pakistan Muslim League - Q had a majority .
He interfered with the PPP and the Muslim League - N so much that he let the Muslim fundamentalist parties take over two provinces and get 17 % of seats in parliament .
Some of these members of the provincial parliament from the fundamentalist parties were actually Taliban .
Others had trained the Taliban or actively denied that al - Qaeda existed .
Far from “ bringing stability ” as McCain suggested , Musharraf has destabilized Pakistan in the past year , arbitrarily sacking the chief justice of the supreme court , provoking massive demonstrations , brutally invading the Red Mosque , and provoking a violent backlash in the northwest .
This is stability ?
And is this really the kind of government McCain supports ?
Are these judgments the fruit of his experience ?
Is this the kind of holiday from history he is going to take ?
Having backed the radical Muslim extremists in Afghanistan in the 1980s , having winked at Zia ’s dictatorship and nuclear program , having coddled Musharraf ’s authoritarianism , is McCain going to bring us more disasters like September 11 , done by his good friends , Reagan ’s Freedom Fighters ?
If so , by all means bring on the breath of fresh air instead .
Ten years ago , Adrian Owen , a young British neuroscientist , was working at a brain - imaging center at Addenbrooke ’s Hospital , at the University of Cambridge .
He had recently returned from the Montreal Neurological Institute , where he used advanced scanning technology to map areas of the brain , including those involved in recognizing human faces , and he was eager to continue his research .
The imaging center was next to the hospital ’s neurological intensive - care unit , and Owen heard about a patient there named Kate Bainbridge , a twenty - six - year - old schoolteacher who had become comatose after a flulike illness , and was eventually diagnosed as being in what neurologists call a vegetative state .
Owen decided to scan Bainbridge ’s brain .
“ We were looking for interesting patients to study , ” he told me .
“ She was the first vegetative patient I came across . ”
Brain scans showed one patient was able to imagine playing tennis .
BILL ARMSTRONG , “ APPARITION # 906 ” ( 2005 ) / CLAMP ART
For four months , Bainbridge had not spoken or responded to her family or her doctors , although her eyes were often open and roving .
( A person in a coma appears to be asleep and is unaware of even painful stimulation ; a person in a vegetative state has periods of wakefulness but shows no awareness of her environment and does not make purposeful movements . )
Owen placed Bainbridge in a PET scanner , a machine that records changes in metabolism and blood flow in the brain , and , on a screen in front of her , projected photographs of faces belonging to members of her family , as well as digitally distorted images , in which the faces were unrecognizable .
Whenever pictures of Bainbridge ’s family flashed on the screen , an area of her brain called the fusiform gyrus , which neuroscientists had identified as playing a central role in face recognition , lit up on the scan .
“ We were stunned , ” Owen told me .
“ The fusiform - gyrus activation in her brain was not simply similar to normal ; it was exactly the same as normal volunteers ’ . ”
Excited by this result , Owen resolved to try to conduct brain scans of other vegetative patients in the Cambridge area .
Since 1997 , he has studied several dozen people , though he decided to use speech sounds rather than photographs to stimulate their brains .
( Owen was concerned that showing images of faces might not be a reliable way to test recognition , since the eyes of vegetative patients often wander .
“ We shifted to auditory responses because you can always put a pair of headphones on the person and know that you are transmitting sound , ” he said . )
Three years ago , he began using a functional MRI ( fMRI ) scanner , which is faster than a PET scanner , capturing changes in blood flow in the brain almost as they occur .
The patients ’ brains were scanned while they listened to a recording of simple sentences interspersed with meaningless “ noise sounds . ”
The scans of some of the patients showed the same response to the sentences as scans of healthy volunteers , but Owen was n’t sure that the patients had understood the words .
“ So we went the next step up the cognitive ladder , to look at comprehension , ” he said .
Psycholinguists have shown that when we hear a noun at the beginning of a sentence we tend to associate the word with its most common meaning .
For example , Owen said , most people hearing a sentence that begins , “ The shell was . . . ” think of an object typically found at the beach .
But if the sentence is completed by the phrase “ fired at the tank , ” the listener quickly corrects himself , a process that is evident on a brain scan .
“ You can actually see it happening and image it on the scanner , ” Owen said .
“ The beautiful thing about the psychological task is that we just do it automatically .
When you play ambiguous sentences , areas in the inferior frontal lobe and in the posterior temporal lobe become activated , and these areas are very important for speech comprehension .
They show that you understand the meaning of the word : it ’s not just about perceiving speech ; it ’s about decoding .
Your brain somehow appreciates that there are two meanings to a word like ‘ shell . ’ ”
Owen eventually identified two vegetative patients whose brains showed the same activity in response to ambiguous sentences as the brains of healthy volunteers .
He also took brain scans of healthy physicians , who were presented with the ambiguous sentences while under general anesthesia .
Owen found that , as the effects of the anesthesia increased , the physicians showed less activity in the brain regions associated with comprehension .
“ That , of course , is in keeping with our personal experience of consciousness , which is that as you sort of drift into sleep you understand less and less of what is around you , ” he said .
( An article about this experiment appears this week in PNAS , the journal of the National Academy of Sciences . )
Owen ’s final experiment was the most ambitious : a test to determine whether vegetative patients who seemed able to comprehend speech could also perform a complex mental task on command .
He decided to ask them to imagine playing tennis .
( “ We chose sports , and tried to find one that involved a lot of upper - body movements and not too much running around , ” he said . )
First , he took brain scans of thirty - four healthy volunteers who were instructed to picture themselves playing the game for at least thirty seconds .
Their brains showed activity in a region of the cerebrum that would be stimulated in an actual match .
“ This was an extremely robust activation , and it was n’t difficult to tell whether somebody was imagining tennis or not , ” Owen said .
He then repeated the experiment using one of the vegetative patients , a woman who had been severely injured in a car accident .
The woman had to be able to hear and understand Owen ’s instructions , retrieve a memory of tennis — including a conception of forehand and backhand and how the ball and the racquet meet — and focus her attention for at least thirty seconds .
To Owen ’s astonishment , she passed the test .
“ Lo and behold , she produced a beautiful activation , indistinguishable from those of the group of normal volunteers , ” he said .
( Another vegetative patient , a man in his twenties , also passed the test , though Owen , having learned that the man was a soccer fan , asked him to imagine playing that sport instead of tennis . )
In September , 2006 , Owen , along with Martin Coleman , a neuroscientist at Addenbrooke ’s , and four other researchers , published an article about the tennis experiment in Science and ignited a vigorous debate .
In letters to the journal , some neurologists argued that the woman must have been misdiagnosed — a claim that Owen disputed .
“ She fulfilled all of the internationally agreed - upon criteria , and there was n’t anything that she did that would lead anybody to say she was n’t vegetative , ” he told me .
“ Now , naturally , in hindsight she was n’t vegetative ; she was actually conscious .
It ’s a very interesting issue , because it means that she was in fact misdiagnosed , but not misdiagnosed in the sense that somebody made an error .
Clearly , she is consciously aware of things around her .
So something is missing in the diagnostic criteria . ”
For decades , doctors assumed that patients who have been diagnosed as vegetative lack any capacity for conscious thought .
Most are previously healthy people who suffered a traumatic brain injury , or oxygen deprivation after a heart attack or stroke , and have been regarded more or less as zombies : patients whose bodies continue to function — sometimes for decades — but whose minds are incapable of willed activity .
( The term “ vegetative ” was proposed in 1972 , by Bryan Jennett , a neurosurgeon , and Fred Plum , a neurologist , who chose it based on a definition in the O.E.D : “ an organic body capable of growth and development but devoid of sensation and thought . ” )
In the occasional newspaper stories about someone who suddenly recovered consciousness after spending years in a vegetative state , the event was invariably described as a medically inexplicable “ miracle . ”
The Mohonk Report , a paper prepared by a group of experts in brain injury and presented to Congress last year , cited estimates suggesting that there are approximately thirty - five thousand Americans in a vegetative state and another two hundred and eighty thousand in a minimally conscious state — a less severe condition , in which patients show erratic evidence of deliberate behavior , such as responding to a simple command or focussing on a person or an object for a sustained period .
Because insurers typically wo n’t pay for rehabilitation , on the assumption that such patients are unlikely to improve , most are given little in the way of therapy .
“ These people with brain trauma are out of our view , ” Joseph Fins , an internist and medical ethicist at Weill Cornell Medical College , in Manhattan , and a member of the Mohonk group , told me .
“ We ignore them , and we sequester them in places where we ca n’t see them , usually in nursing homes . ”
According to several American and British studies completed in the late nineties , patients suffering from what is known as “ disorders of consciousness ” are misdiagnosed between fifteen and forty - three per cent of the time .
Physicians , who have traditionally relied on bedside evaluations to make diagnoses , sometimes misinterpret patients ’ behavior , mistaking smiling , grunting , grimacing , crying , or moaning as evidence of consciousness .
A neuroscientist showed me a video on the Internet of Terri Schiavo , the Florida woman who spent fifteen years in what most doctors agree was a vegetative state — tests revealed almost no activity in her cortex — and whose death , in 2005 , provoked fierce debate over the rights of severely brain - damaged patients .
( Schiavo died after the Supreme Court rejected her parents ’ appeal of a judge ’s decision approving her husband ’s request that her feeding tube be removed .
An autopsy showed extensive brain damage . )
In the video , a man ’s voice can be heard praising Schiavo for opening her eyes in response to his instructions , and the neuroscientist told me that he was impressed until he muted the sound .
“ With the sound off , it is clear that her movements are random , ” the neuroscientist said .
“ But , with the voice - over , it is easy to make a misdiagnosis . ”
( The prognosis for patients such as Schiavo , who suffered brain damage owing to oxygen deprivation following cardiac arrest , is much worse than for those who suffer brain damage as the result of a head injury . )
Doctors can also miss signs of consciousness in vegetative patients , according to the British and American studies .
Ten months after Owen and his colleagues completed the tennis experiment with the vegetative woman , she was brought back to the imaging center and placed in an MRI machine .
“ We were absolutely dismayed , because we scanned her and there was nothing , ” Owen recalled .
The team tested the woman again the next day .
This time , in response to a command to play tennis , her brain showed normal activity in the regions that mediate arm movements .
Owen now repeats scans for each patient , conducting them twice a day for three days .
Patients with brain injuries have “ seriously impaired attention capabilities and their levels of general arousal are likely to be shot , ” he said .
Recent research by Owen and other neuroscientists may eventually help make diagnoses more accurate , but it is not yet clear how the new brain - scan data will affect the medical understanding of consciousness .
As Owen put it , “ The thought of coma , vegetative state , and other disorders of consciousness troubles us all , because it awakens the old terror of being buried alive .
Can any of these patients think , feel , or understand those around them ?
And , if so , what does this tell us about the nature of consciousness itself ? ”
Owen ’s article in Science was accompanied by an editorial by Lionel Naccache , a neurologist at the Hôpital Pitié - Salpêtrière , in Paris , who called the results of the tennis experiment “ spectacular . ”
“ Despite the patient ’s very poor behavioral status , the fMRI findings indicate the existence of a rich mental life , including auditory language processing and the ability to perform mental imagery tasks , ” Naccache wrote .
Yet he cautioned against drawing general conclusions about vegetative patients from a single case , and asked , “ If this patient is actually conscious , why would n’t she be able to engage in intentional motor acts , given that she had not suffered functional or structural lesion of the motor pathways ? ”
Prompted by questions like this , Naccache and several of his colleagues are conducting brain - imaging experiments with the goal of identifying objective indicators of consciousness , and thus enabling doctors to better evaluate patients who are unable to communicate their awareness of themselves or their environment .
We assimilate information unconsciously all the time ; at any given moment , we process thousands of stimuli , of which we pay attention to only a few .
As you read this sentence , you may not be aware of the birds singing in the back yard , but your brain has analyzed the sound and concluded that it poses no threat to you .
In the past several decades , scientists have uncovered particularly dramatic examples of unconscious processing .
In the early seventies , researchers at M.I.T. studied four patients who had experienced trauma to an area of the brain involved in vision and had been found to have a condition that was later called “ blindsight . ”
These patients ’ eyes functioned normally , but they did not perceive much of what was in their field of vision .
When the researchers flashed a light at the patients and asked them to describe what they saw , the patients reported that they had seen nothing .
Yet the researchers noticed that their eyes often located the source of the light .
In a second experiment , a blindsight patient was shown pictures of faces displaying happiness , sadness , anger , and fear .
The patient said that he could not see the faces , yet he was frequently able to correctly identify the emotions .
The researchers concluded that , despite the patient ’s injuries , pathways in his brain had been preserved which allowed him to process at least some visual data , even though he was n’t consciously aware of doing so .
In the early nineteen - hundreds , the Austrian neurologist Hermann Zingerle described patients who , because of tumors or other abnormalities of the parietal lobe on the right side of the brain , ignored the left side of the body and objects in the left field of vision .
( The right side of the brain controls awareness of the left side of the body . )
For example , some of these patients would shave only the right side of their faces , since they were unaware of their left cheeks .
In the nineteen - eighties , researchers determined that patients who had the syndrome — now called “ neglect ” — could process some objects in the left field of vision .
In one experiment , a patient was shown two pictures of a house .
The images were identical except that , in one , flames were emerging from a window on the left side of the façade .
The patient said that she could n’t see any difference between the images , but , when she was asked which house she would want to occupy , she almost always chose the one that was not on fire .
“ This is more complex than blindsight , because it means that the patient was unconsciously able to interpret and understand the symbolic meaning of the pictures , ” Naccache said .
“ It is a powerful experiment to demonstrate that unconscious perception and unconscious cognition can reach upper levels of the brain . ”
Last Fall , many members of the Portland Office of Transportation and city administration were gracious enough to talk with me and show off some of the amazing features that make Portland , Oregon one of America 's most livable places to reside .

And with the incredible turn in leadership in the past months and the speed at which changes are coming , it gives me hope that NYC could one day become as livable as Portland !
This is our first video posting over 15 minutes so we 've tried to keep the file size as small as possible .
Thus , the quality is a smidgen lower .
Please send us feedback on how it looks and if your computer is able to play it .

Transportation is so closely tied to Portland ’s liveability .
In fact when people come here or businesses , it ’s always one of the things they talk about is how many choices they have with transportation .
And of course we encourage people to get out of their cars and ride public transportation , use some of our several hundred miles of bike lanes and our light rail and streetcars .
You know we have … we give people a lot of options .
I think it pays off in the long run because it not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but it just makes it a lot nicer getting around .

Portland has a long tradition of being a progressive community especially in the areas of transportation .
We ’re number one rated for bicycling , walking .
We work really hard to be a multi - model system that allows not only cars and buses and we brought streetcars back and light rail , but also human powered transportation like bikes and walking .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Chris Smith : </i > [ 01:12 ]
I think that a lot of that is a very deliberate result following from the Downtown plan of the 1970 ’s where we , unlike a lot of US cities , decided to really maintain the Downtown , not let it decay .
So we have a great environment here for pedestrians , for cyclists , for transit .
It ’s an easy place to get around without a car .

There ’s no better investment that the city has made than in bicycle infrastructure and promotion .
It has been an incredible bang for the buck , very cost effective , great for liveability , great for health of our citizens , great for air quality , great for congestion .

I myself am a bicycle commuter , started nine or ten years ago and I ’ve noticed it grow tremendously in popularity and it ’s really become a kind of a major transportation , social , cultural issue in Portland .
It ’s pretty fascinating to see .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Ellen Vanderslice :</i > [ 02:02 ]
I think one of the strengths of Portland is that it is really a very pedestrian friendly city , and that has to do not just with having good places to walk , but with the fact that we do have this great transit system that you can make linkages between all the different modes .
I like to say that walking ’s the glue that holds everything together , but I think Portland has really understood that in a way that a lot of have n’t quite tumbled to yet .

We ’ve seen the average vehicle miles travelled per person dropping from about 23 miles per person in the early ‘ 90 ’s to about 19 today .
That ’s totally in contradiction to the national trend , almost every other region in the country has had an increase in vehicle miles travelled , and so the roads are full of people driving farther and farther all the time .

If you look at our transit ridership we rank in our population 25 < sup > th < / sup > in the nation , and yet in terms of transit use we rank number 12 .
Many more of our citizens are utilising our transit as a way to get around .
We ’re one of the few places in the nation that has our transit use growing faster than auto use and faster than our population .

Today we have almost 12,000 daily cyclists going across four bridges into and out of Downtown .
In the early ‘ 90 ’s that number was just a few thousand so we ’ve more than quadrupled that number .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Rex Burkholder : </i > [ 03:21 ]
The average work commute trip has dropped from ten to seven miles now .
The average family spends only 15 % of their income on transportation , nationally it ’s around 19 % .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Diana Christensen : </i > [ 04:04 ]
I ’m Diana Christensen .
I teach physical education here at Sunnyside Environmental and we ’re all into biking and riding and getting to school in alternative methods .
A lot of kids bus .
We have ride and walk and bike to school Fridays .
Like Sarah , our youngest , definitely are kindergartners , we have several parents who ride to school , have their kids on the trailers on the bike , and then we have few first and second graders that will be ridden in escort with their parents .

We get really creative around here about how to get more than one kid at a time on your bike , cos when you have two kids and neither of them is riding their own bike yet , you ’ve got to figure out a way to haul everybody around .

We carry three kids .
Seter our son ’s five and Kyla is three and Solson ’s one , so we carry three and it works pretty well .
Kyla rides after we drop off Seter and the kids are happy .

Originally when we first got here there were n’t any bike racks beyond the lawn out there on the playground .
We had a set installed and kind of beginning to take a bend around the wall , you can see that they … already we ’ve spilled over to the railing here .
Need definitely more .
You can also see that the structure ’s covered .
We have a pretty active volunteer group and a lot of parents who help , so they came out and installed the covers .
Everybody brings their own locks , you know , and we certainly talk about the need to respect others property and how if it were your bike out here you would n’t want to come out here and find the lights on or somebody had taken something and that we just are going to be respectful of others property and recognising that that ’s somebody ’s transportation .

Our goal here is to actually bring the neighbourhood in and have the neighbourhood be a teacher to the kids as well as the kids being a teacher to the neighbourhood .
And we love what we see here at Sunnyside .
We love the relationships that we ’re having with the community and having people be able to bike to school is really an important part of that .
And we also teach a bike curriculum as part of the school .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Diana Christensen : </i > [ 06:05 ]
Fifth grader every year gets a ten hour instruction of Oregon traffic safety law around the use of their bicycle .
And over the course of the week from Monday through Friday , by Friday we ’re taking them on a trip around the city .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 06:20 ]
Portland is a liveable city , as a bikeable city , is an amazing place to live because we can get almost everywhere as a family on our bikes and there ’s nowhere else I ’d live where you can do that as efficiently , as relatively safely .
There ’s a lot more awareness here among drivers … of bicyclists as equal users of the streets than there is in other places .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 06:46 ]
There are two busy streets we have to cross to get here and we use crosswalks for both of those .
And in fact today , you know , I was kind of nosing the chariot out there , looking both ways to see if any cars were coming and on my left somebody stopped and then a big truck was coming on the right , kind of a little maybe over the speed limit and he totally put on his brakes and stopped and we crossed the street .
So that ’s what I mean by a community , people care about each other and care about the kids and … so I feel really safe .

Here ’s a really cool innovation that the City of Portland has done .
This intersection is right where you ’re coming off a major recreational trail and transportation corridor that goes along both sides of the river .
And then the cyclists that use it are going in two different directions , to North Portland and to North East Portland , so it ’s kind of a bicycle scramble call it where the lights are triggered by bicyclists pavement signal loop and this allows the bicyclist to stop all the traffic by parking the bicycle on a signal that ’s actually marked just like this on the ground , and then it stops traffic in all directions , so the bicyclist can leave from here and go in all directions , instead of having say if you want to go north you ’d have to cross one time and then cross again which creates a lot of hazards for people and especially if you ’re not a very experienced cyclist which we get a lot on the trail here .
They ’re less experienced and do n’t know quite how to deal with traffic as well .
So this is a major safety feature , convenience feature , it makes it easier and faster to get through if you ’re a cyclist .
And we have literally thousands of cyclists that use this facility everyday and so it helps to manage the traffic and makes it much safer .
Another sign of innovation is something that has been used in other places , but the fact that it has n’t swept the country until we started doing it here .
Go Portland .

This is South East Lincoln that we ’re standing on here and the South East Lincoln Bike Boulevard is … it ’s really cool because it ’s like a metaphor for all that we ’ve done in Portland .
In the ‘ 80 ’s South East Lincoln here was what we call a traffic collector , there was quite a bit of auto traffic on the street and it was a major thoroughfare .
And in the late ‘ 80 ’s and early ‘ 90 ’s the city , really with pressure from neighbourhoods and citizens , turned this street as well as a number of other streets into what we call bicycle boulevards where we did traffic calming elements to make this street more liveable and slower traffic , reduced traffic and much more friendly for bicyclists and pedestrians .
So let me tell you what we did to this street .
At a couple of key points on this street at South East 39 < sup > th < / sup > , two blocks this way , and South East 20 < sup > th < / sup > , which is about almost a mile that way , we put in what we call traffic diverters and so traffic has to turn .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Mark Lear : </i > [ 09:51 ]
One of the biggest challenges to developing a bike boulevard is you ca n’t make it easy for cars to get onto the bike boulevard off of a busy street .
If you fail to make those kinds of improvements , what will happen is you ’ll have a lot more cars on the bike boulevard and we do n’t want a lot of cars on our bike boulevards .
So what we do at this location is only allow cars to come out off the local service street onto 39 < sup > th < / sup > but we do n’t allow cars to come in from 39 < sup > th< / sup > onto Clinton .
In this case this project has worked really well .
It ’s made it so bicyclists can pass through easily , but it keeps cars off , it actually acts as a good treatment and diverts cars that would otherwise be on this facility .

We also put in things that slow traffic down which includes the traffic circle that you can see over there , and speed bumps along the street to slow traffic down so that the speed of cars is pretty similar to the speed of cyclists , which creates a more comfortable environment for everyone .
And then more recently we have put in signs and circles to identify the street as well as other bike boulevards as being part of this special bike boulevard network .

People were very concerned about diverting traffic off of a street , how are they going to get to their houses and it might cause traffic on other streets to go up .
So , and this was … that happened here , there was a lot of fight , it was a difficult project and what happened as a result is also very similar to what happens in many other cities and that it ’s so pleasant afterwards that property values go up , becomes a wonderful thoroughfare for people walking their dogs and jogging .
It ’s a very popular street for people bicycling , for people walking , for kids to be out and about and it ’s just become this wonderful community street .

I particularly spend as much of my time outside of City Hall as I can because , you know , this is where it happens .
This is where we ’re either going to succeed or fail around , you know , bridges and viaducts and bike paths like this and , you know , I work on a lot of policy , but the best way to learn if those policies are really working is to go out there and see it and do hands - on yourself .

Robert Puttnam who wrote the book , Bowling Alone , which sort of chronicles the decline of citizen engagement and sort of participation in the country , studied Portland and found that the trend was exactly the opposite .

Most of what I do in this job is actually getting people to do things that they would probably like to be able to do anyway .
So it ’s a lot about kind of identifying people ’s self interest and promoting positive incentives to voice what you ’d like to see in the city .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Ellen Vanderslice :</i > [ 12:46 ]
We ’re standing here on the Davis Festival Street .
It ’s one of two Festival Streets that we ’re building … building right now as a matter of fact as part of the old town Chinatown 3 < sup>rd</ sup > and 4 < sup >th</ sup >
Avenue streetscape project .
The whole streetscape project that redevelops all this area is something the community wanted for a long time .
And when they sat down and started working on what would actually be done , one of the things they identified was really a lack of public space .

In Portland we ’ve tried to get as much out of our streets as we possibly can , for example , developing streets that do more than just drive and park cars .
So what we ’ve tried to do is create a hybrid street that functions for cars , functions for parking , but at the same time can be conveniently closed off and function as a small piazza , a small plaza for festivals and functions that the local neighbourhood can engage in .
Some of the things that get in the way with a standard street are things like curbs , light poles , fire hydrants , all kinds of utilities .
And those kinds of things typically get in the way of a really clean pedestrian environment .
What you might also see here that you do n’t see on a typical intersection is a very flat open area .
What this does is provide a very pedestrian oriented kind of intersection for people who may have maybe wheelchair bound , they have an easy way to access this place .
And it also creates an even transition from the street into the inner plaza area .
Right over here these are large plinths and what these are going to be for are art installations .
They also function to direct traffic and control and slow down traffic as it enters this place .
The plantings are actually an extension of the Chinese garden .
Some years ago we opened our classical Chinese garden and what we ’ve tried to do is bring the plant material such as palm trees out into the street .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Ellen Vanderslice :</i > [ 14:51 ]
This is really an experiment for the Portland Office of Transportation and if it goes well I think there are a lot of people around this city that would like to see this implemented in other places .
I think that any time you make a space that does n’t say right off the bat first of all I ’m for cars , that you make a place that really says I ’m for people , that that in itself contributes to the liveability .
But I think there ’s something more that we ’re looking at here and that is that the making of this place is more than just about the concrete and the granite and the surfaces that we ’re putting here and the beautiful design that we have , it ’s really about finding a way to create community , the activity of managing these streets and the fact that the community has to form some kind of an entity to … to manage the Festival Streets , that is part of building this community .

Behind me is called a diagonal diverter and there ’s a busy street that direction , there ’s a busy street that direction in one block .
So if motor vehicles wanted to avoid being on those busy streets they might try to cut down by either this residential street behind me or that residential street .
But what happens is because this diagonal diverter is in place , they ’re forced as they turn off of those busy streets back onto the busy street .
And it keeps these residential streets behind it residential .
It keeps it so there ’s fewer cars , fewer people cutting through the neighbourhood , and it keeps it so that the cars are on the busier streets where we really want more cars to be because they ’re designed to handle heavier traffic .
This diagonal diverter was designed with pedestrians and bicyclists in mind .
It ’s really nice as a pedestrian to walk by it , but at the same time it ’s a cut - through on a bicycle boulevard that goes east and west through North East Portland .
And there ’s actually little pavement markings on the street that point bicyclists through it , to really let them know that yes , indeed , they should be using these cut - throughs through the diverter as they ’re travelling through the neighbourhood .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Mark Lear : </i > [ 17:02 ]
Where I ’m standing now is on a curb extension that actually is a green curb extension , it has a bioswale that treats soil and water that ’s running into this facility .
What ’s cool about this curb extension , not only does it treat storm water but it shortens the distance for pedestrians that are crossing 21 < sup>st </ sup > .
One of the other really great things about this project is that it incorporates speed bumps .
About three years ago citizens that lived on 21 < sup > st </ sup > came to the city and said that they wanted speed bumps and the city said no .
The reason for that was 21 < sup > st </ sup > carries just under 5,000 cars a day , and as a local service street our upper limits for where we would put speed bumps was 2,500 cars a day .
So the neighbours just kept coming back for about three years asking us if there was a special process that they could go through .
We worked hard to look at whether we could put the project in and not have diversion going into neighbourhoods , and we actually started a pilot programme .
And we ’ve had speed bumps in now for over a year and we have n’t had any complaints that I ’m aware of from the neighbourhood of the diversion .
It ’s an excellent example of one of those projects where you can do speed bumps on a higher volume street without problems , and if we did n’t have the speed bumps here , we ’d have 85 < sup > th < / sup > percentile speeds of 32 miles per hour , now we have speed down to about 25 miles an hour / 26 miles an hour , so it ’s really reduced speeds .

Two - thirds of our riders are on our bus system and our commitment is to be able to make that bus ride be every bit of quality that the light rail is .
You can call up at any one of our almost 8,000 bus stops throughout this whole region and find out not just the next schedule time , but the actual arrival time .
All of our buses have the ability to carry up to two bicycles on the front when people want to be able to use bus to make at least part of their trip .
Likewise on light rail , we have the ability to be able to have specially dedicated places where bicycles maybe hung so that people can make use of that system as well .

The streetcars actually a great story of partnerships here in Portland .
We wanted the streetcar to work with the whole transit system even though it ’s owned and operated by the City of Portland , not by our Regional Transit Agency .
The fare system is completely seamless , so if you buy a streetcar ticket it works in the bus , the bus ticket works in the streetcar .
You can see that this stop actually serves both buses and streetcars so if you happen to be on the street going in this direction , you can take the first vehicle that comes , whether it ’s a bus or a streetcar .

About 15 % of our streets are all in southwest which is an area about 35 square miles .
We have 15 % sidewalks .
43 % of our arterials have no sidewalks .
Result of all that is that were many places where it was really , really difficult for pedestrians to get from place to place and most of them did n’t know how to get around because there was no signage .
So we put together the network , then we began working on building connections .
And as soon as we got one network completed we put signs on it so people could find their way .
We ’ve probably got close to 500 of these around southwest .
And the arrow indicates the direction .
The walker indicates it ’s a pedestrian path .
The 6 is the number of the route and South West Trails is simply identifying as part of the South West trail network .
The other thing that we ’ve done is do up maps and the maps are pretty thorough .
Our trails group , this is our little logo here , and the Department of Transportation worked on these jointly .
It was our job to figure out the connections and it was PDOT ’s job to actually publish the maps .
This street is a trail the way we call it because it ’s point to point trail , so the trail comes here and we ’ve got about 1,000 feet of trail that is really in the woods and no cars on it , and then we got more streets and then they ’ll end up going through a park or a school ground or something like that .
So we end up with , you know , a combination of things where people want to walk but it is n’t necessarily trail as we would think of walking through the woods .
You know the majority of the routes , because we ’re trying to get pedestrians from place to place on a linear trail , we ’re using the streets where we can .
And then we went from that to figuring out where we wanted to have the most important routes and the criteria we used is walkable streets .
The other things we have on the map is features that you ’d want to know if you were walking , like where are the bathrooms , where are the water fountains , where are the parks , other major things of interest , where are the commercial areas .
We ’ve got the grocery stores noted so someone looking at this could say , oh there ’s a grocery store , I can walk to that .
The whole thing ’s focused on where people want to walk .

This is the bike parking that we put in for city employees .
Over the years as we ’ve been promoting getting more people on their bikes that we needed to add … last year we needed to add 40 more , and we added those and we ’re running out of bike space .
They ’re on every little post and every corner we can sort of sneak them in , so it ’s been pretty spectacular to grow this quickly .

This is an on - street bike parking facility where we converted one and a half automobile spaces into 13 bike racks , by placing these bike racks right on the asphalt and then provided a barrier with reflectors on it so it would be visible .
And we did it because the street that ’s behind me is Mississippi Avenue in North Portland .
There ’s a lot of bicycle traffic , there ’s a lot of pedestrians and what was happening was there was a lot of bicycles that were congregating on the street and on the sidewalks , and because the sidewalks were so narrow it was starting to create some issues .
After we put it in it was so successful that businesses two blocks away unanimously asked for another one .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Sharon White :</i> [ 23:08 ]
I coordinate the crosswalk enforcement actions as a partnership and the whole point of it is is to bring more awareness and education about what the Oregon crosswalk law is .
If I go ahead and find a location and where we ’ve received community complaints about cars not stopping for pedestrians , we also take into consideration locations that have had pedestrian collisions and also feedback that we get from Portland Police .
So once we decide on a location , we go ahead and scope it out and make sure it ’s appropriate , see which time period during the day would be best .
Usually for a two hour time period I ’m a pedestrian decoy and I cross back and forth in a crossing .
It ’s usually a marked crossing but sometimes we do signalise crossings as well .
There ’s one police spotter and he tells officers on either side of the street that are tucked away that a certain car or bicyclist or pedestrian has violated the law .
Then the police officer pulls over that individual .
If it ’s a clear violation they ’re given a citation .
If it was not 100 % clear , then they ’re given a warning .
Here in the City of Portland our citations for not … failure to yield to the pedestrian is a Class B violation and a $ 242 fine .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kirsty Hall : </i > [ 24:43 ]
This is a programme we just started running in the past week and it ’s a new programme especially designed for senior citizens .
Here we have five seniors who are going to be riding today with us from Elders in Action and we ’re going to be riding around Mallament Park here in South West Portland .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 24:58 ]
This bike project to me is another example of how Portland cares for its seniors , or is starting to care for its seniors .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Clarence Eckerson Jr.:</i> [ 25:08 ]
Are you looking forward to riding today ?</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 25:08 ]
Yes I am , I ’ve only done it once before and I had n’t been on a bike since I was 15 years old .
It ’s a lot of fun . </ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Clarence Eckerson Jr.:</i> [ 25:17 ]
How long ’s it been since you ’ve ridden the bike ?</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 25:22 ]
A good 50 years .
Loved to ride a bike when I was a kid and so now I think , you know , a bike would be great .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kirsty Hall : </i > [ 25:31 ]
Initially we ’re hoping the programme is just going to help seniors stay fit and healthy and active , and we ’re partnering with Oregon Health and Sciences University .
We have a PhD researcher there who ’s looking into seniors and how they can retain function as they age .
And so we ’re going to be using some valuable survey work and feedback from this programme .
But we do have another goal and that is also in the long run to hopefully have bikes at senior centres around Portland , and seniors can just hop on to a bike and hopefully if they need to go to pick up a prescription or if they ’d like to run to a friend ’s house nearby , just run some errands , get some exercise , they can also do that .
So those are some longer term goals .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 26:10 ]
It gets me out of the house and also it ’s good exercise .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 26:13 ]
And I had thought that maybe , you know , I could go to my condo down here , get a little older and I ’m not standing on my feet , you know , to walk , I ’d get my exercise this way .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kirsty Hall : </i > [ 26:25 ]
A big concern is safety and perception of safety .
A lot of seniors have told us that they feel very afraid of falling off a bike .
And this is why we have these three wheeled tricycles here , they ’re much more stable for seniors to ride , and that was a very conscious decision that the Office of Transportation took when we purchased these bikes .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 26:55 ]
I just like to do stuff that would improve the quality of senior life and for myself also of course .
And I ’ve always wanted one of these bikes .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kirsty Hall : </i > [ 27:07 ]
They love it .
Everybody was a little apprehensive when they turn up .
You can see the fear in their faces sometimes cos they have n’t ridden in such a long time .
As soon as they get on the bike and we get everything adjusted for them , they just take off and it ’s like a duck to water , they ’re just so happy to be riding again .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kirsty Hall : </i > [ 27:28 ]
I had n’t ridden a bike in three years and I remember when I hopped on again it just felt like … it was just …
I felt like I was a child again and I definitely get that impression from the seniors that are riding on this programme .
It makes them feel young again and it makes them feel healthy again .

I love being in Portland , it ’s a great place .
My car died last year in August and I was like , whoa , what am I going to do ?
So I said , well I guess I ’m going to ride my bike to school tomorrow , and then I rode it the next day , and then I rode it the next day and now I ’m a commuter and I dig that Portland allows me to do that safely .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 28:13 ]
The major thing that everybody ’s going to tell you about Portland is what a great outdoor lifestyle it is here .
You know you ’re close to the ocean , you ’re close to the mountains , rivers , wilderness and the city itself is a wonderful place to get around .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 28:28 ]
Everyone on a bike is glad to see someone else on a bike .
You ring your bell , you wave , you smile , it ’s a great sense of community .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Greg Raisman : </i > [ 28:34 ]
I really feel like I ’m in a place where we can showcase our people getting to know each other and working together can really make a difference in making a place that really works for people .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i > Fred Hansen : </i > [ 28:44 ]
Portland is my home .
I was born and raised here and although I ’ve certainly lived in a lot of other parts of the country over the years , it ’s liveability , it ’s walkability , it ’s the fact that we ’re weird .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 28:57 ]
I ’m always glad to come back to Portland because as far as I ’m concerned Portland is the place to be .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 29:03 ]
Between the bus and walking I hardly ever drive anymore .
It ’s great .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 29:07 ]
We like to come out and visit the West Coast .
The main thing I ’d say is this is easily the most liveable city in the United States that I ’ve been to so far .
</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 29:15 ]
It ’s great for walking around , people actually stop at crosswalks for you .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Mia Birk : </i > [ 29:19 ]
If you stood out here all night you would see that every … almost every other minute all night long there ’s a cyclist coming through .
And it ’s so pleasant .
I sit on my front porch and I wave at the people and have a glass of wine and I listen to jingling of bells and the swishing of wheels and the chattering of people back and forth .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Speaker : </i > [ 29:37 ]
It ’s got the dynamism of a big city but it ’s got the… it ’s got the community orientation of a smaller city .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Mark Lear : </i > [ 29:44 ]
When we take speed bumps off a street when we ’re doing maintenance , we get a flurry of phone calls where people are saying , what happened to my speed bumps ?
We ’re constantly getting people that are calling us and wanting bike lanes or sidewalk improvements , and when we make those improvements we get thank you letters and people send us chocolates .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Linda Ginenthal : </i > [ 30:02 ]
We get love letters on a regular basis for our programmes .
No kidding .
I mean just delightful , delightful notes that say we love Portland because of the work that you do and you know you can ’t ... you ca n’t buy that .

Friday 's White House Press Briefing included two economic advisers to discuss the volatile economic situation here in the US , though they were careful to not paint to dire a picture .
Obviously , with crude oil trading at record levels and OPEC releasing a statement blaming the price on the weakness of the American dollar , the media might be expected to ask a question or two .
However , White House Spokesperson Dana Perino was not having any of it .
Q I 'd like to follow up on their refusal to talk about the dollar , if I could .
I mean , we 're in a kind of a bad situation here , when OPEC says the reason for $ 105 or $ 106 a barrel of oil is the falling value of the dollar -- and you wo n't address that issue .
Where do we go to find out who is right ?
MS . PERINO : Well , as he just said , the Treasury Secretary is where you go to talk about the dollar .
It 's a longstanding policy that predates this administration , and I 'm not going to change it today .
But Treasury can talk about it .
Q I do n't expect you to change it , but I do expect you to be able to say whether OPEC is completely wrong about this , or whether there is at least something to their claim that the dollar is responsible for the high price of oil right now .
MS . PERINO : Wendell , I 'm under strict instructions , and have been from the beginning , to not talk about the dollar , and I 'm not going to get fired to satisfy your question .

Kaleidosketch is a kaleidoscope - inspired symmetry drawing program .
The idea is pretty simple .
You draw in the canvas , and Kaleidosketch creates symmetry by rotating and reflecting your drawing in real time .
You have control over virtually every aspect of the process .
You can change the number of rotations , whether your drawing is reflected , the center of rotation , the line width , color , and how that color changes as you draw .
Layers let you work on one aspect of your drawing without the risk of messing up another part .
For example , you can draw outlines on one layer , and then color them on a layer underneath .
The check boxes next to each layer let you hide and show them , and the radio buttons control which layer you draw on .
You can change their order by dragging their miniature previews up and down in the list .
If you click on any number box and drag your mouse to the left or right , the value in that box will change .
This lets you adjust your color or symmetry quickly , without ever letting go of the mouse .
Kaleidosketch relies on the HTML canvas element introduced in the HTML 5 specification .
This , unfortunately , means that browser support is limited .

Top Five Micro Wind Turbines
March 21st , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
They have been around for centuries , but they are quickly becoming the darlings of the eco-friendlies and clean energy nuts .
Windmills , or in this case , wind energy generators , come in all shapes and sizes .
But in actuality , how feasible and cost - effective would it be for you to integrate a small wind system at your home , cabin , or camp ?
It might be easier than you might think .
And if the small - wind tax credit somehow holds onto its tenuous place in the farm bill , it might just be cost - effective for you to invest one that can help defray , or even eliminate your monthly electricity bill .
The economics will be different for everyone , so I am not necessarily encouraging you all to run out and buy a micro wind turbine .
I will also warn you that interconnection laws vary by country , state , province , municipality , etc .
So , before spending ANY money on one of these gizmos , be certain that you have an adequate wind resource , and if you are planning on connecting to the grid , that you understand the interconnection standards that apply .
Please use this information with caution : you must not cloud your judgment with mental images of backward - spinning electric meters and negative utility bills .
While this is possible , you do n’t want to spend all of your hard - earned money on a micro turbine that your local HOA , planning board , or zoning commission never lets you put up .
>> See : Small Wind Front and Center at Obama Inauguration
I should also note that while vertical axis wind - turbines may be the wave of the future for small - wind ( especially in urban settings ) , there are lots of companies making big claims about their products right now , and I am not comfortable with my own knowledge of the products to include them in this listing .
1. Southwest Windpower Skystream 3.7
The Skystream 3.7 is the first fully - integrated , grid - tied wind energy system designed for residential use .
This “ plug and play ” turbine is an all - inclusive wind generator ( with controls and inverter built in ) designed to provide quiet , clean electricity in very low winds .
Unlike many other turbines , the Skystream 3.7 will turn downwind because it has no tail rudder to keep it facing into the wind .
Cost* : $ 5399 ( not including tower and installation materials )
Rated Capacity : 1.9 kW continuous output , 2.6 kW peak
Startup Windspeed : 8mph
Rotor : 12 feet ( 3.72 m ) ; 50-325 RPM
Interconnection : Utility connected or battery charging
Alternator : Gearless , permanent magnet brushless
Voltage Output : 240 VAC ( Optional 208 VAC )
Estimated Energy Production : 400 kWh/ month @ 12 MPH ( 5.4 m/s )

“ The soldiers were asking about the security situation and also making jokes and laughing , ” said the store owner , who refused to give his real name for fear of reprisals from local militias .
“ Some of them said , ‘ Be sure that we ’ll come back again in order to buy clothes from you before we leave on vacation . ’ ”
After the soldiers left the store , he said , he climbed up a ladder to a storeroom to retrieve his lunch and then heard a large explosion .
He scrambled back down , he said , to find the bodies of two of the soldiers he had just been chatting with lying in the doorway of the store .
Four of the soldiers died at the scene , and a fifth died later of his wounds .

Muhammad , a hamburger vendor whose stand is about 175 feet from the site of the bombing , said the same group of eight or nine American soldiers had been coming to the street for the last three days , getting out of their Humvees and walking around the shopping area , called the Rawad intersection after a popular ice cream parlor there .
“ Usually , we see the Americans come in Humvees and they do n’t stop , they just keep driving , ” said Muhammad , who was afraid to give his last name .
On Monday , he said , a soldier carrying a notebook walked into a currency exchange called The Ship .
The other soldiers gathered in a small group .
“ When the explosion happened we panicked and started running , and the gunner on one of the Humvees started shooting , ” he said .
“ Even the Iraqi soldiers and police started firing in the air , so we jumped into one of the narrow alleys and remained there hiding until the Iraqi soldiers ordered us to walk at least two blocks away from the spot . ”
He said that before the bombing , he had been surprised that the soldiers had allowed pedestrians to come up and talk to them , instead of keeping them at a distance as they normally do .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now argues that the North American Free Trade Agreement needs to be renegotiated , but newly released records showed on Wednesday she promoted its passage .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) addresses supporters during a campaign stop at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6669 in Huntington , West Virginia March 19 , 2008 .
REUTER / John Sommers II
The National Archives and the Clinton presidential library jointly released more than 11,000 pages of Clinton ’s daily schedule as first lady from 1993 to 2001 .
The release came in response to charges that she is overly secretive , and also allowed her campaign to promote her argument that she gained valuable White House experience during her years as first lady .
Clinton and Obama are battling to win Pennsylvania on April 22 , the next contest in a closely fought campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Republican John McCain in the November election .
The documents clearly indicated that Clinton had a powerful role at the White House , frequently meeting foreign leaders and presiding over meetings .
The NAFTA agreement , linking trade between the United States , Canada and Mexico , was considered a major accomplishment by President Bill Clinton in 1994 .
But now many Americans blame the agreement for the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs .
NAFTA has become such an issue on the Democratic presidential campaign trail that both Clinton and rival Barack Obama have vowed to renegotiate it .
The former first lady ’s records showed first lady Clinton worked on behalf of the accord .
Among the thousands of details of daily life for Clinton , there was a November 10 , 1993 , entry -- a “ NAFTA Briefing drop - by , ” in Room 450 of the executive office building next door to the White House , closed to the news media .
Approximately 120 people were expected to attend the briefing , and Clinton was to be introduced by White House aide Alexis Herman for brief remarks concluding the program .
LEWINSKY , RICH REMINDERS
The documents , while a mundane accounting of Clinton ’s daily movements , brought back some reminders of the Clintons ’
White House tenure .
On January 26 , 1998 , for example , the day Bill Clinton declared “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman , ” Monica Lewinsky , first lady Clinton had a busy day , including a round - table discussion with students from her alma mater , Wellesley College .
Later she went to New York for an education event , and spent the night at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel .
The weather forecast on that day ’s schedule said , “ Mostly cloudy .
High 37 .
Low 27 .
When Hillary Clinton appeared at a January 1999 event at the Kennedy Center , it was Beth Dozoretz who escorted her to her seat , according to the records .
Dozoretz two years later was reportedly linked to a last - minute drive that succeeded in persuading President Clinton to grant a pardon to fugitive financier Marc Rich , a decision that has haunted Clinton in his post - White House days .
The documents also showed the first lady got herself quickly immersed in what would be a failed attempt to revamp the U.S. health care system .
Clinton ’s first known meeting to discuss health care came just three days after President Clinton ’s January 20 , 1993 , inauguration , according to the records .

Colbert : ' Fox ca n't do it alone ' to make war with Iran inevitable Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Stephen Colbert commented Monday on Congressional passage of the Lieberman - Kyl Amendment which " calls on President Bush to declare Iran 's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization . "
" But not everyone supports our troops enough to give them the job security a war with Iran would provide , " Colbert continued .
" People like Senator Jim Webb , who voted against the amendment , calling it ' Dick Cheney 's fondest pipe dream . '
Well that is completely unfair .
Everyone knows Dick Cheney 's fondest pipe dream is driving a bulldozer into the New York Times while drinking crude oil out of Keith Olbermann 's skull . "
Colbert then played a clip of John Edwards saying , " You cannot give this president the authority , and you cannot even give him the first step of that authority . "
" First step ? " questioned Colbert .
" That implies there 's more than one step to war with Iran . ...
The last time I walked off a cliff , one step did it . "
Colbert stressed the necessity of making war with Iran seem inevitable and decried the failure of the media to perform this task as effectively as they did before the invasion of Iraq -- with the notable exception of Fox News .
" Last week , Sean Hannity outlined what a war with Iran might be like , " said Colbert , displaying a montage that segued from planes and missiles to the explosion of the Death Star and dancing Wookies .
Colbert then showed clips from another Fox segment , in which former Bush Iraq spokesman Dan Senor pressed claims of Iranian nuclear ambitions , genocidal impulses , and a possible role in September 11 .
" Iran scares me , right now , more than anything else I 've seen , " Senor told Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) .
" The scariest thing he 's ever seen !
And he 's looking at Joe Lieberman . " commented Colbert .
" But for Iran , Fox ca n't do it alone , and the American people have lost their stomach for war , " Colbert concluded .
" Our only hope is that when it comes to Iran , the president will do the one thing that 's still inevitable .
Whatever he wants . "

Considering how many used cell phones are piling up in places like the United States and Europe , I suspect they could join the cell phone craze for dirt cheap , as long as they do n't need to be sporting iPhones .
Then again , maybe to celebrate the moment , Steve Jobs could send a million free iPhones to Cuba to try to corner the market .

Tristan and I arrived at Peavey Plaza shortly before 4:30 pm .
There were a few people there setting up .
Of course , everyone just thought Tristan was the cutest thing and asked if he could be in the skit they were going to perform .
So , of course , I said yes .
As the protest got underway , We were all shouting " who ’s a terrorist ? "
" Bush is A Terrorist ! " … All sorts of catchy chants like that .
I ’d say about 150 to 200 showed .
Passersby , sort of just ignored us .
We did n’t get as many honks as usual .
Probably , because it was after all , the 5 year anniversary of 9/11 .
We actually got quite a few disapproving stares .
‘ How dare we protest on such a somber day ’ !
Of course , even though we were right next door to WCCO , no press what so ever .
The skit pretty much went like this :
It basically demonstrated how Bush is spending our tax money on unjust wars .
Tristan and one of the other protesters played civilians trying to rebuild after a bomb hits .
After the skit , they had a couple of speakers .
I ca n’t remember who .
Around 6:00 pm , the police came and informed one of the organizers the we were being ‘ too loud ’ .
The Antiwar Committee did not have a permit for the protest at Peavey Plaza .
I ’m sure that is why the cops came .
Other than that , things were uneventful .
I got quite a few flyers handed out and talked to some of the organizers about attending our event Oct. 5th .
I saw a couple of familiar faces from the Sept. 7th meeting .
Shortly , after the cops came …
We chanted a bit more and then started packing up to leave .
Buried deeply within Bloomberg ’s recap of November ’s various and sundry economic statistics , presented with the usual obfuscations and reassurances of stability in the face of unfolding financial catastrophe is one number that somehow manages to reflect what no other US government statistic does : reveals the truth .
Just to be certain it is n’t ever noticed , you ’ll find it nestled in the 23rd paragraph of the article , precisely when the reader ’s eyes have completely glazed over from statistics fatigue .
The number in question is the “ wholesale price index . ”
I wo n’t make you wait : it ’s 3.2 % .
For one month .
On an annualized basis , that is ( without compounding ) 38.4 % .
It is the highest increase in 34 years , and if you remember the inflation that we endured in the mid 1970s , you know that this does not bode well for next year ’s consumer prices .
What ’s unique about this double - digit inflation statistic is that every other government economic statistic has been reconfigured in recent years to reflect a sunnier picture than would have been revealed by the accurate statistics , as they had always been reported .
Unlike , say the unemployment statistics , which now do not consider those whose unemployment insurance has expired - and , God knows how many hundreds of thousands there are of those right now , even if Sec .
Chow insists we have only 4.6 % unemployment ( wanna buy a lovely bridge in Brooklyn ? )
So why is this number trustworthy ?
Well , unlike the Consumer Price Index , which supposedly tells us what the inflation rate is , it does n’t exclude the causal aspects of real - world inflation : food and energy .
The average American ’s monthly expenses are dramatically affected by those two expenses more than any other single regular expense .
The other excluded element is housing , which in rents is expressed by the published annual inflation rate itself ( in cities with rent control ) , but has become very significant with the preponderance of ARMs , but that , too goes un-included .
However , the wholesale price index must include the costs of fuel and food , because they fall within the manufacturer ’s costs .
So be prepared , because the wholesale price increases of November ( and , no doubt , December … ) will be coming to a store near you in 2008 .
And you never will have heard a word about it on the TV news .

Single women in their thirties are most likely to do unpaid overtime
They are more likely to work extra hours than mothers , fathers and men without children , according to the union organisation .
However , it is men with children who put in the highest number of unpaid hours - 8.3 hours per week on average .
The TUC says five million workers in the UK do unpaid overtime , saving employers almost £ 25bn in 2007 .
The report indicates that 24.2 % of women without children do unpaid overtime - the highest number of any other group .
But this declines to 17 % amongst women with children .
' Impossible choices '
The Fawcett Society , which campaigns for equal pay and conditions , said women were being presented with " impossible choices " .
TOP JOBS FOR UNPAID HOURS Average per week Teachers 11.2 hours Legal 8.6 hours Finance 8.4 hours Architects 6.8 hours Media 6.7 hours Source : TUC
" They are forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities in a workplace that measures performance by the number of hours put in , " the society 's Kat Banyard said .
The TUC 's general secretary , Brendan Barber , said this was preventing women getting the top jobs in their profession .
" It is hardly surprising that the senior levels of most organisations are male and that the gender pay gap stubbornly persists , " he said .
Fathers ' hours
Whereas women without children are more likely than men to work extra hours without pay , those men who do overtime do a higher number of hours unpaid .
And it is men with children who do the greatest number of unpaid hours , more than eight per week on average .
Hourly workers who put in long shifts get paid overtime and often welcome the extra money in their pay packets
CBI , the employers ' organisation
" On average , fathers who put in unpaid overtime are doing almost an extra day a week .
This can't be good for them , their children or wider society , " Mr Barber said .
Teachers do the most unpaid work , an average of 11.2 hours per week .
This is valued at more than £ 12,000 a year .
Workers in the legal , financial and media industries are also expected to work long hours without pay .
The TUC is urging employees to take proper breaks and says bosses should thank their staff by taking them to lunch .
The employers ' organisation the CBI said it could be necessary for staff to work longer hours .
" Professional staff tend to work the longest hours and this is reflected in the more generous salaries they earn , " a spokesperson said .
" Hourly workers who put in long shifts get paid overtime and often welcome the extra money in their pay packets , " he said .
The TUC 's research was carried out using official Office for National Statistics figures .
Dith Pran , a photojournalist for The New York Times whose gruesome ordeal in the killing fields of Cambodia was re-created in a 1984 movie that gave him an eminence he tenaciously used to press for his people ’s rights , died on Sunday at a hospital in New Brunswick , N.J. He was 65 and lived in Woodbridge , N.J .
The cause was pancreatic cancer , which had spread , said his friend Sydney H. Schanberg .
Mr. Dith saw his country descend into a living hell as he scraped and scrambled to survive the barbarous revolutionary regime of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979 , when as many as two million Cambodians  a third of the population  were killed , experts estimate .
Mr. Dith survived through nimbleness , guile and sheer desperation .
His credo :
Make no move unless there was a 50 - 50 chance of not being killed .
He had been a journalistic partner of Mr. Schanberg , a Times correspondent assigned to Southeast Asia .
He translated , took notes and pictures , and helped Mr. Schanberg maneuver in a fast - changing milieu .
With the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975 , Mr. Schanberg was forced from the country , and Mr. Dith became a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge , the Cambodian Communists .

Mr. Schanberg wrote about Mr. Dith in newspaper articles and in The New York Times Magazine , in a 1980 cover article titled “ The Death and Life of Dith Pran . ” ( A book by the same title appeared in 1985 . )
The story became the basis of the movie “ The Killing Fields . ”
Mr Tusk thinks
Poland should be rewarded for hosting the shield
President George W Bush made the promise during talks with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Washington .
Before the meeting , Mr Tusk said the US anti-missile system , which has angered Russia , would reduce Poland 's security .
Mr Bush says the shield will guard against possible attacks by " rogue states " , such as Iran or North Korea .
" There is a commitment to a system that respects Poland 's sovereignty and that will ensure that the people of Poland will not be subjected to any undue security risks , " said Mr Bush after the meeting .
" We just want to assure people that [ the missile defence shield ] is necessary and at the same time there will be this modernisation effort that will take place " , he added .
' Rogue state ' defence
The US opened negotiations last year with the previous Polish government of Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski , a strong backer of the US proposals .
But Mr Tusk 's government , which came to power in November , has argued that Poland should get some reward for allowing the US missiles to be based in the country .
It wants anti-aircraft missiles - such as the US Patriot , which was used to shoot down Iraqi Scud missiles in the 1991 Gulf War - in return .
The Americans know our expectations and their understanding of Polish expectations is slowly taking a very promising shape
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
Russia 's outgoing President Vladimir Putin has condemned the plans to include Poland and the neighbouring Czech Republic in its proposed missile shield .
An associated radar system could be based in the Czech Republic .
" The Americans know our expectations and their understanding of Polish expectations is slowly taking a very promising shape , " Mr Tusk told Polish news agency PAP before flying to the US .
The two leaders are also thought to have discussed further Nato involvement in military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Polish troops took part in the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and a multinational division in the south of the country is commanded by Polish forces - though the Poles intend to withdraw their troops by October .
Mr Tusk is also expected to meet UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday .
Whoa !
What a year this has been .
And what achievements we have had .
If I may quote Trotsky of all people , this Revolution is permanent .
It will not end at the Republican convention .
It will not end in November .
It will not end until we have won the great battle on which we have embarked .
Not because of me , but because of you .
Millions of Americans -- and friends in many other countries -- have dedicated themselves to the principles of liberty : to free enterprise , limited government , sound money , no income tax , and peace .
We will not falter so long as there is one restriction on our persons , our property , our civil liberties .
How much I owe you .
I can never possibly repay your generous donations , hard work , whole - hearted dedication and love of freedom .
How blessed I am to be associated with you .
Carol , of course , sends her love as well .
Let me tell you my thoughts .
With Romney gone , the chances of a brokered convention are nearly zero .
But that does not affect my determination to fight on , in every caucus and primary remaining , and at the convention for our ideas , with just as many delegates as I can get .
But with so many primaries and caucuses now over , we do not now need so big a national campaign staff , and so I am making it leaner and tighter .
Of course , I am committed to fighting for our ideas within the Republican party , so there will be no third party run .
I do not denigrate third parties -- just the opposite , and I have long worked to remove the ballot - access restrictions on them .
But I am a Republican , and I will remain a Republican .
I also have another priority .
I have constituents in my home district that I must serve .
I cannot and will not let them down .
And I have another battle I must face here as well .
If I were to lose the primary for my congressional seat , all our opponents would react with glee , and pretend it was a rejection of our ideas .
I cannot and will not let that happen .
In the presidential race and the congressional race , I need your support , as always .
And I have plans to continue fighting for our ideas in politics and education that I will share with you when I can , for I will need you at my side .
In the meantime , onward and upward !
The neocons , the warmongers , the socialists , the advocates of inflation will be hearing much from you and me .
Sincerely ,
Ron
Analysts say speculators are buying oil to hedge against the lower dollar
US light , sweet crude jumped to $ 103.95 a barrel , before giving back some gains to trade at $ 102.45 .
London Brent also climbed to a record , hitting $ 102 .
Analysts blamed the falling dollar , which makes oil an attractive investment to speculators .
It also looks increasingly unlikely that oil exporters ' cartel Opec will raise production to help ease prices .
Speculators
Analysts said that oil is likely to track movements in the currency markets .
" There is no top in sight yet for crude futures because hedge funds are looking at how far the US dollar will fall , " said Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago .
" They are buying commodities to hedge against inflation because hanging on to the dollar means they lose value , " he added .
Opec has blamed speculators for driving oil prices higher and is unlikely to raise production when it meets in Vienna this week .
" I do n't think Opec would consider increasing production because then we would be increasing to meet demand that does n't exist , " said Opec President Chakib Khelil .
Other commodities , including copper and gold have also been surging higher as the dollar has fallen .
US gold prices closed $ 9.20 higher at $ 984.20 an ounce .
At one stage in the session the price hit a record $ 992.00 an ounce .

The Supreme Court , in a sweeping rejection of claims of power in the presidency , ruled 6 - 3 on Tuesday that the President does not have the authority to order states to relax their criminal procedures to obey a ruling of the World Court .
The decision came in the case of Medellin v. Texas ( 06-984 ) .
Neither a World Court decision requiring U.S. states to provide new review of criminal cases involving foreign nationals , nor a memo by President Bush seeking to enforce the World Court ruling , preempts state law restrictions on challenges to convictions , the Court said in a ruling written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr .
The Court explicitly , and with emphasis , rejected a presidential argument that the nation ’s Chief Executive has power , on his own , to make an international treaty into binding law inside the U.S.
That can only be done by Congress , it stressed .
The decision , aside from its rebuff of presidential power , also treats the World Court ruling itself as not binding on U.S. states , when it contradicts those states ’ criminal procedure rules .
The international treaty at issue in this dispute — the Vienna Convention that gives foreign nationals accused of crime a right to meet with diplomats from their home country — is not enforceable as a matter of U.S. law , the Roberts opinion said .
And the World Court ruling seeking to implement that treaty inside the U.S. is also not binding , and does not gain added legal effect merely because the President sought to tell the states to abide by the decision , the Court added .
The ruling also is a defeat for 51 Mexican nationals who won a World Court decision in 2004 , finding that U.S. states had denied them their consular access rights and advising the U.S. government to take steps to enforce the ruling .
None of the 51 had been given access to a consular officer while their cases proceeded .
In the specific case , Mexican national Jose Ernesto Medellin , convicted in state courts of murder , had sought to rely on the Vienna Convention .
Texas courts ruled that he had defaulted on that right by failing to raise the issue at his trial .
He then pursued a habeas challenge , arguing that the World Court decision and the Bush memo overrode the state default rule .
The Bush Administration did not agree with the World Court ruling , and , in fact , withdrew from the international protocol that gave the World Court the authority to enforce the Vienna Convention against countries that had signed it .
Even so , Bush issued a memo in February 2005 agreeing that the U.S. would seek to obey the World Court , and he told the states involved to “ give effect ” to that tribunal ’s decision in the cases of the 51 Mexicans involved in the World Court case .
The U.S. government stepped into the case in Texas courts to assert the authority of the President to lay upon the states a duty follow his mandate to obey the World Court .
The case thus reached the Supreme Court as a major test of presidential authority , in seeking to enforce treaty obligations , to override contradictory state criminal procedure rules .
In that test , the presidency clearly lost .
The Chief Justice ’s opinion was supported in full by Justices Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , Anthony M. Kennedy , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
Justice John Paul Stevens supported the result only .
Stevens said that he found the issue to be a closer one than the Roberts opinion allowed , but said that he was persuaded “ in the end ” that the treaty did not authorize the Supreme Court to enforce the World Court ’s ruling .
Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented , joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter .
In rejecting the Mexican nationals ’ reliance on the World Court ’s decision , the Chief Justice wrote that the ruling did impose “ an international obligation on the part of the United States . ”
But that did not automatically give it legal effect “ such that the judgment of its own force applies in state and federal courts . ”
The Court said that the legal effect of a World Court decision is controlled by Article 94 of the United Nations Charter , which means , the Court went on , that the U.S. and other member countries that submitted to World Court jurisdiction on a given dispute assume “ a commitment …to take further action through their political branches to comply . ”
Thus , it added , Article 94 “ is not a directive to domestic courts .
It does not provide that the United States ‘ shall ’ or ‘ must ’ comply ” with such a ruling .
Enforcement depends , it said , upon a diplomatic , not a judicial , remedy — that is , a political , not a legal , enforcement mechanism .
The Court went on to say that this mechanism should not be turned over to state and federal courts in place of the political branches of the government .
“ Our Framers established a careful set of procedures that must be followed before federal law can be created under the Constitution — vesting that decision in the political branches , subject to checks and balances , ” Roberts wrote .
To turn over to the judiciary the task of deciding when a treaty becomes domestic law , the Chief Justice added , would be to give the courts “ the power not only to interpret but also to create the law . ”
Turning to the question of the President ’s authority to make the World Court decision binding domestically , the Court said that the Chief Executive ’s power to act , as with the exercise of any governmental power , must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself . ”
It found no such authorization , rejecting claims that the Vienna Convention itself gives the President authority to implement the World Court ruling finding a U.S. violation , that Congress has acquiesced in that authority , that the President on his own has power to resolve international disputes apart from treaty enforcement , and that presidential power of that kind at issue is given by the Constitution ’s allocation of power in the President to make sure that laws are “ faithfully executed . ”
Having found that the Vienna Convention is the kind of treaty that can only be executed in the U.S. if Congress expressly agrees to that , the Court said that the President may not do that on his own , or under some his interpretation of a treaty like the Vienna Convention .
There is no congressional legislation to turn that Convention into domestic law , the Court found .
If the President were to seek to unilaterally create domestic law , when a treaty ratified by the Senate was not a self - executing pact , that would contradict the Senate ’s action of ratifying the treaty with the understanding it was not being made into domestic law .
In that situation , the President ’s power would be “ at its lowest ebb , ” quoting the famous formula laid out by Justice Robert Jackson in the Steel Seizure case in 1952 ( Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer ) .
Quoting Founding Parent James Madison , saying that the President “ in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law , ” the Chief Justice commented that that would “ seem an apt description ” of President Bush ’s claim that he could unilaterally turn the Vienna Convention into domestic law .
Examining the government claim that Congress had , in fact , acquiesced in turning the World Court decision into domestic law , the Chief Justice found that none of the instances cited “ remotely involved transforming an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displacing state law . ”
The opinion stressed that the President could opt to comply with a treaty ’s obligation “ by some other means , so long as they are consistent with the Constitution . ”
Refuting the government claim that the President ’s February 2005 memorandum was a sufficient basis for implementing domestically the World Court ruling , the Chief Justice wrote : “ The government has not identified a single instance in which the President has attempted ( or Congress has acquiesced in ) a Presidential directive issued to state cours , much less one that reaches deep into he heart of the State ’s police powers and compels state courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws . ”

Phil Donahue was so enraged by coverage of the Iraq War that he came out of retirement .
But instead of heading back to a network studio , where he had spent more than 30 years building his name as a talk - show host , he followed the lead of some of the most talented storytellers in media :
He made an independent documentary .
Donahue 's Body of War , co-directed with Ellen Spiro , tells the harrowing story of an American soldier who , returning home from Iraq paralyzed , begins fighting the system that sent him there .
It 's one of a growing number of provocative , ambitious and impassioned indie docs born , in part , out of frustration with the perceived inadequacy of the mainstream press .
" I believe these documentaries fill the giant black hole left by corporate media , " Donahue said .
" These [ independent filmmakers ] do n't report to boardrooms .
They do n't fear making people angry . "
( Read the full interview with Donahue on Wired. com 's culture blog , Underwire . )
This weekend , three documentaries about President George W. Bush 's wars – No End in Sight , Taxi to the Dark Side and Operation Homecoming – will compete for the Best Documentary Feature statuette Sunday at the Academy Awards .
( Body of War made the Oscar short list of 15 films , but was not nominated . )
That may make this weekend 's Oscars ceremony a kind of coming - out party for the films and the emerging mode of long - form journalism they represent .
With the majority of Americans distrustful of mainstream media coverage of Iraq , the voices of independent , nonfiction filmmakers may become increasingly important elements in the national discourse .
In addition to this year 's Oscar films , aesthetically and journalistically sophisticated Iraq docs include Gunner Palace ; The War Tapes ; Iraq in Fragments ; and My Country , My Country ( the last two were nominated for best documentary at last year 's Oscars ) .
These are the tip of the spear in what Scott Foundas , LA Weekly 's head film critic , called a " boom moment " in nonfiction filmmaking .
" The mainstream reportage of Iraq either has blindly sided with the party line from Washington or has not asked the tough questions these filmmakers are willing to ask , " he said , adding that war docs relate stories " you are n't really seeing in your daily newspapers or evening news .
They are thinking outside of the box , coming at things from a different point of view . "
You could call it art - infused journalism – politically oriented , carefully researched films that also take aesthetic and formal risks .
Iraq in Fragments , for example , uses a fractured narrative that summons the everyday disorientation of Iraqis living under U.S. occupation .
The War Tapes – the Awesome ; I Fuckin ' Shot That ! of war movies – was filmed entirely by servicemen .
Unfortunately , aside from Michael Moore ( whose Sicko is also nominated for an Oscar ) , documentary filmmakers typically struggle to connect with substantial audiences .
Of the dozen or so Iraq and Afghanistan docs released to date , only No End in Sight and Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/11 have broken the $ 1 million mark , with several grossing less than $ 50,000 .
Despite a 100 rating at Rotten Tomatoes and some critics virtually begging audiences to see it ( The New York Times called it " essential " ) , Taxi to the Dark Side opened Jan. 18 to mostly empty theaters .
The film , which explores the death of an innocent Afghani taxi driver tortured to death by U.S. soldiers , may not even hit TV screens :
The Discovery Channel , which purchased the film 's broadcast rights , recently informed director Alex Gibney it had decided not to air it .
Gibney said he believes the cable station found it too incendiary .
The director of 2005 's Oscar - nominated Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room and the producer of No End in Sight , Gibney attributes documentaries ' box - office woes to a fragmented marketplace that 's still insecure due to the shifting digital landscape .
Still , he was excited by the " explosion of creative and investigative energy " going into documentaries .
" There are a few things you can do in the documentary form that you can't in journalism , and vice versa , " he said .
Among the things that Taxi does that CNN can't or wo n't : take the time ( 106 minutes in this case ) to explore multiple angles of a story ; express a strong point of view ( in this case , easily summed - up as the sensible thesis " torture is un- American " ) ; use material and information of a graphic nature ; and employ the kind of expressionistic footage that seeks to tap into deeper emotional truths .
Taxi combines the rigor of excellent journalism with the passion of a deeply personal work .
Could these indie docs be carving out more generous spaces for long - form journalism ?
Will more brand - name journalists and filmmakers , like Donahue , follow where these indie directors are leading ?
Foundas points to another Iraq doc , Standard Operating Procedure , an award winner earlier this month at the Berlin Film Festival that 's scheduled for an April release .
Many consider Errol Morris , its Oscar - winning director ( for Fog of War ) , to be America 's leading innovator in creative nonfiction .
" There are filmmakers out there who have that combination of a sharp political outlook and a highly developed filmmaking ability , " Foundas said .
" To know that Errol Morris – one of the most interesting filmmakers in America , period – is taking on Abu Ghraib , that 's as exciting to me as , say , a new Michael Mann crime thriller opening next week . "

On February 12th , the birthday of a prominent Illinois lawyer / politician , blueinks over at Daily Kos suggests a Barack Obama “ Money Bomb ” .
Previously , Congressman Ron Paul has benefited from two “ money bombs ” – or independently organized online fund raising days .
I propose that on February 12th ( Lincoln ’s Birthday ) we have a money bomb extravaganza of small donations of $ 5.01 for Senator Obama .
The reasons for this amount are easy to see : Small donations are powering Obama ’s campaign Lincoln is on the $ 5 bill and the penny .01 is also for us online progressives making a statement to the campaign that we are here and we ’ve got money .
That we are n’t the huge bundlers for campaigns .
We sacrifice parts of paychecks that mean more proportionally to those of us with smaller incomes .
We buy into Barack Obama because we do dream of a more hopeful future instead of cynicsm .
I would much rather be called a Hopemonger than a Warmonger .
So if you believe in the hope that small donors are powering the Obama campaign , please join me in showing that when Americans united with Hope can wield large influence with small donations !

Canada 's foreign ministry has put the United States and Israel on a watch list of countries where prisoners risk being tortured and also classifies some U.S. interrogation techniques as torture , according to a document obtained by Reuters on Thursday .
The revelation is likely to embarrass the minority Conservative government , which is a staunch ally of both the United States and Israel .
Both nations denied they allowed torture in their jails .
The document -- part of a training course on torture awareness given to diplomats -- mentions the U.S. jail at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba where a Canadian man is being held .
The man , Omar Khadr , is the only Canadian in Guantanamo .
His defenders said the document made a mockery of Ottawa 's claims that Khadr was not being mistreated .
Under " definition of torture " the document lists U.S. interrogation techniques such as forced nudity , isolation , sleep deprivation and blindfolding prisoners .
" The United States does not permit , tolerate , or condone torture under any circumstances , " said a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Ottawa .
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier tried to distance Ottawa from the document .
" The training manual is not a policy document and does not reflect the views or policies of this government , " he said .
The government mistakenly provided the document to Amnesty International Canada as part of a court case the rights organization has launched against Ottawa over the treatment of detainees in Afghanistan .
Amnesty Secretary - General Alex Neve told Reuters his group had very clear evidence of abuse in U.S. and Israeli jails .

" It 's therefore reassuring and refreshing to see that ... both of those countries have been listed and that foreign policy considerations did n't trump the human rights concern and keep them off the list , " he said .
Khadr has been in Guantanamo Bay for five years .
He is accused of killing a U.S. soldier during a clash in Afghanistan in 2002 , when he was 15 .
Rights groups say Khadr should be repatriated to Canada , an idea that Prime Minister Stephen Harper rejects on the grounds that the man faces serious charges .
" At some point in the course of Omar Khadr 's detention the Canadian government developed the suspicion he was being tortured , " said William Kuebler , Khadr 's U.S. lawyer .
" Yet it has not acted to obtain his release from Guantanamo Bay and protect his rights , unlike every other Western country that has had its nationals detained in Guantanamo Bay , " he told CTV television .
Other countries on the watch list include Syria , China , Iran , Afghanistan , Mexico and Saudi Arabia .
" If Israel is included in the list in question , the ambassador of Israel would expect its removal , " said Israeli embassy spokesman Michael Mendel .
The awareness course started after Ottawa was criticized for the way it handled the case of Canadian Maher Arar , who was deported from the United States to Syria in 2002 .
Arar says he was tortured repeatedly during the year he spent in Damascus prisons .
An inquiry into the case revealed that Canadian diplomats had not received any formal training into detecting whether detainees had been abused .

To have a peak productivity at working with command line most often you need multiple terminals open at a given time .
One where you have your text editor session open , one where you read documentation , the third where you test out program snippets , etc .
You might be pretty productive on a terminal emulator which can have multiple terminals open in a single window but what if you are connected to a distant server with a telnet / ssh client such as Putty ?
Would you run multiple Putty sessions to do what you have desired ?
What if your connection breaks loose ?
Would you reconnect and start all over again ?
Definitely not !
One of the solutions is to use an advanced terminal emulator such as screen .
What is screen ( from GNU screen manual ) ?
Screen is a full - screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes , typically interactive shells .
There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy - and - paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows .
When screen is called , it creates a single window with a shell in it ( or the specified command ) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would .
Then , at any time , you can create new ( full - screen ) windows with other programs in them ( including more shells ) , kill the current window , view a list of the active windows , turn output logging on and off , copy text between windows , view the scrollback history , switch between windows , etc .
All windows run their programs completely independent of each other .
Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal .
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and , in addition , several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 ( ISO 6429 ) and ISO 2022 standards ( e.g. , insert / delete line and support for multiple character sets ) .
When I first found screen , I did n't know many of its features .
I knew I could create new terminals by pressing the default CONTROL - a-c key sequence and switch between them using the CONTROL - a - a sequence , that it would " save " my windows if I got disconnected and I could get them back by typing " screen - r " after I connected back to the computer .
Not much else .
I clearly was n't as productive as I could have .
I set out to explore the whole screen program .
To do that I used my cheat - sheet approach .
As I have written before this approach is to have a printed cheat sheet in front of me as I learn new commands .
This way each time I look for a command I can scan over the other commands and I can remember them better subconsciously .
This cheat sheet summarizes all they default keyboard mappings , with screen 's commands to execute the mapping and a description of each mapping .
I had made this cheat sheet in the year 2001 and I had lost the file so I recreated it in LaTeX , made a PDF and converted it to .txt formats .
Actually I had n't used LaTeX much and had difficulties to get it right the first time .
I searched my documents collection and found The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX book .
Really nice reading .
I recommend it !
Here is an example screenshot of how I use screen effectively :

A Danish court ruled in favor of the IFPI , and ordered the Danish ISP " Tele2 " ( DMT2 - Tele2 ) to block all access to the popular BitTorrent tracker .
The Pirate Bay , currently ranked 28th in the list of most visited sites in Denmark , is working on countermeasures .
The court case was initiated by the IFPI – the infamous anti-piracy organization that represents the recording industry – and plans to force other ISPs to do the same .
However , The Pirate Bay is determined to fight back , as usual .
The Pirate Bay team has already asked other BitTorrent admins to stand up against the IFPI lobby , and arranged a meeting with Tele2 to discuss the current events .
Pirate Bay co-founder Brokep told TorrentFreak in a response : “ I hope the torrent community understands what this will do to Danish people .
It will also act as a very bad precedent for the European Union , and I hope everybody will fight this . ”
At the moment , The Pirate Bay team is registering new ( Danish ) domains , to make sure people can still download . torrent files from the Bay when the ban is activated later today tomorrow .
In addition the Pirate Bay will launch a campaign website , together with the Danish pro-piracy lobby “ Piratgruppen ” .
Sebastian Gjerding , spokesperson for Piratgruppen , a pro-piracy lobby whose goals are to reform current copyright law and protect consumers ’ rights , is not pleased with the news .
He told TorrentFreak : “ The verdict is absurd .
It will block access for danish users to the worlds largest distributor of culture and knowledge – copyrighted or not .
It ’s true that you can access copyrighted material through The Pirate Bay , as you can with Google or Rapidshare .
Should they be blocked as well ? ”
“ It ’s very frightening that IFPI can get through the courts with something like this .
In Turkey and China its the state that decides what information the people can access and what should be censored .
In Denmark its apparently the record industry , ” Sebastian adds .
This is not the first time a Danish ISP has been ordered to censor the Internet .
In December 2006 A Danish court ruled against Tele2 in a similar case , and ordered the ISP to block all access to Allofmp3.com .
According to the ruling , the ISP was willingly infringing copyright if their customers use AllofMP3 to download music .
IFPI has announced it will continue it ’s battle against BitTorrent sites in Europe .
Last month they tried to convince European lawmakers that ISPs should block access to websites such as The Pirate Bay , and block filesharing protocols , no matter what they ’re being used for .
Luckily , these proposals were rejected .
We will follow this campaign , and the response from Denmark closely .
Stay tuned for updates !
1. Equalizer High Frequency 2
All right , let 's start with an easy one : the new High Frequency 2 , the second Tokyoflash watch to use an Equalizer theme .
You 've got to be quick to read the time : the display pushes up the top row of lights , which then float back down like an equalizer graph to indicate the time for just 5 seconds .
Technically speaking , High Frequency 2 is actually a pretty advanced watch : it is an advanced LCD that uses just 1 LED to light the entire watch , so its power consumption is very low .
2. e35 JLr7 Look carefully , and you 'll find out why this watch , made by Eri & Eiichi or e35 , is named the JLr7 ( just look at the top row of the watch ) .
When you want to find what time it is , just press the button to watch a grid of L - shaped notches come to life .
The hours , minutes , and seconds are encoded in a geometric pattern .
The first two rows , comprised of 12 lights , tell the hour .
The next three lights are increments of 15 minutes , and the next 14 lights are 1 minute each .
The last 3 are seconds ( those tick by quickly ! )
Here 's a handy dandy cheat sheet on how to tell time with an e35 JLr7 :
3. Oberon
This one is stylish and geeky !
The Oberon watch uses concentric rings to tell the time .
Each LED on the outer ring indicates 1 hour .
The LEDs on the second ring are 1 minute each , and those on the inner ( or third ) ring are 10 minutes each .
Thankfully , the LEDs are positioned just like the numerals on a regular watch face , so it 's really quite easy to tell the time .
4. e35 Geomesh
Let 's step it up a notch : another watch by e35 is the Geomesh , where you have to count the vertical lights to figure out the hours and the horizontal lights for the minutes ( either 5 minutes or 1 minute increments , depending on where the lights are ) .
Here 's the chart :
Let 's try to figure out the example on the left .
There are 9 horizontal ( green ) lights , so it 's 9 o'clock .
5 lights x 5 minutes each + 4 lights x 1 minute each = 29 .
The time is 9:29 .
Pretty straight forward , right ?
5. Eleeno Kion Elite
Just when you thought that there 's a familiar clock hand pointing out the time , you 've just underestimated the Kion Elite by Eleeno .
If you look closer , you 'll find that there 's only ONE clock hand - and it's telling the minutes !
So how do we figure out the hour ?
Turns out , it 's the background of the watch : the pattern will " point out " what hour it currently is ( 7:50 in the image above ) .
6. Tokyoflash 1000100101
If you look closely , you 'll probably see this watch on a Sci -Fi movie from the 1960s about the future .
Besides looking cool ( the colored LEDs blink a LOT ! ) , this watch will make you do math .
Every time you want to figure out what time it is , you have to do a mental arithmetic :
The first LED is 10 hours , then the next 9 is worth 1 hour each .
The next 5 are 10 minutes , then the last 9 are 1 minute each .
So , 11:35 is 1000 +100+30+5 .
And who said you 'll never use math in real life !
7. Radioactive Active Reactor
By now , you should already pick up a pattern : Tokyoflash watches want you to do math to figure out the time .
Nothing fancy , just a little addition .
Active Reactor by Radio Active adds a little humor to the math : the hour is marked on the " Danger " bar ( with the Warning button signifying the 6 hour mark .
Oh , and another thing .
This watch you simply do n't wear in an airport .
8. Shinshoku The Shinshoku is a continuous stainless steel band that wraps around your wrist with a matrix of punched out holes .
In what constitutes the front part of the band , the holes are filled with 29 LEDs that illuminate to tell the time .
In the multi-color version , 12 red LEDs indicate the hour , 3 green LEDs indicate quarter hours , and 14 yellow ones are 1 minute each .
But first , as if the whole thing is n't cool enough , the lights cascade to make the final time - giving formation .
The watch above , for example , shows 8:35 .
9. Kyokusen
In Japanese , kyokusen means curved line , which is a big part of the watch face .
The line tells the hour part of the time : each lit segment of the curve indicates one hour .
The circular array of lights are the minutes .
But here 's the twist : each dot in the outer ring is 5 minutes , and the 4 inner dots are 1 minute each .
So , the watch to the left shows 10 : 24 .
10 .
Twelve 5 - 9 Q version
If a Cylon Centurion wore a watch , I betcha the Twelve 5 - 9 Q version would be it .
The watch just oozes that creepy cool " biomechanical " feel : the watch face has a contoured undulating effect .
Peering through five tiny strips are 26 very bright multi-colored LEDs .
Like its name implies , the watch uses the 12 - 5 - 9 method ( 12 hours , 5x10 minutes , 9 single minutes ) to tell the time .
Moving clockwise , the first two lines of the LEDs show the hours .
The next line is the minutes up to 50 , with each glowing LED showing 10 minutes .
The final two lines are the single minutes , with one LED for each minute .
Got it ?
We did n't either ... but it sure looks cool !
Wiimote add - ons of all sorts have been flooding in virtually since the console 's debut , but when it comes to sheer uselessness and dangerousness , it 's tough to beat this latest bundle from the folks at Dragon Electronics , which offers no less than eight ways to accessorize your Wiimote and nunchuck .
That includes a pair of daggers , an axe , and a pistol to name a few , which the company says should provide " amazing , exciting , fantastic and training body reaction . "
If that sounds like the added depth of realism you 've been waiting for , you can grab a set of your own right now for just under $ 30 . [ Via Wii Fanboy

Wow .
I can understand getting the woman out with blood on her hands .
However , I strongly disagree with what happened afterwards .
The Code Pink ladies were just sitting there , based on what this video shows , and suddenly they were grabbed and pulled out .
Unlike my views on The Don't Tase Me , Bro Boy , who set the whole thing up , and went after one of our own , in this case , IMO cops were totally unjustified .

One of the " Code Pink " ladies is from Phoenix AZ .

I would too .

I am sick and tired of the social engineering .
Torture , illegal wars , fixed elections , etc. DEMAND that we speak out .
Enough already with labelling protestors as frothing moonbats .
Andrew Myers is a hero .
Enough is enough with statements that are untrue .
I am with you Cynthia , and everyone else who is for the truth .
Myers went after " one of our own ? "
No answer for that one , " John Dean ? "

When did you last pick up a book to hunt out a nugget of information instead of Googling it ?
Or read a novel instead of powering up the PlayStation or the telly ?
Some time ago , quite possibly , especially if you 're a man and aged 16 to 24 - half have n't read a single book in the past 12 months , making this group the least likely to read books , according to government statistics .
The rest of us are n't much better .
And some , including Victoria Beckham , claim never to have read a book at all .
WHERE AND WHEN WE READ In bed On holiday
On way to work In the bath On the toilet Source : Bedtime Reading Week
So why do n't more of us make use of these repositories of knowledge and , with so much information to be gleaned online and from the TV , do we need to read books any more ?
" They 're vital to learning .
Half the population do n't go to football matches but that does n't make football any less important , " says Professor John Sutherland , who has chaired the Booker prize judging panel .
Books are essential because at their very heart is the storage of information , he says .
" The best storage system we have is the book .
Few artefacts have lasted as enduringly - and few will .
If you dropped Chaucer into the middle of Oxford Street today he would n't have a clue what was going on , but if you took him to a bookshop he'd know exactly what they were , even be able to find his own work . "
Sum of knowledge
And every book has a part to play in our accumulation of knowledge , right down to autobiographies by the likes of Peter Andre and Kerry Katona .
Writes books , does n't read them
But while books have great cultural value , others argue that you do n't have to read them to be intelligent and knowledgeable .
" I did n't read a book last year and do n't know when I will read one , " says Jamie Sharp , 37 .
" That does n't make me illiterate or stupid , I just get my information in other ways .
" I read a paper everyday and use the internet .
That probably makes me better informed than a lot of book readers out there .
They may read a book but it 's just as likely to be David Beckham 's autobiography as it is Shakespeare . "
And reading involves intellectual snobbery , he says .
" It always has to be about certain types of books .
Often people just read them because they think they should , not because they want to .
Sometimes they pretend to have read them to look intelligent . "
He has a point - 40 % of people admit to lying about having read certain books , according to a study published last year by the Museums , Libraries and Archives Council .
And half read the classics just because we think it makes us look more intelligent .
Musty tomes
Basically , not everyone is a natural reader .
Books have also lost their " chic " , according to some .
Some books do booming business
Despite this , book sales in the UK are huge and on the rise .
Last year we bought an estimated 338 million books , at a cost of £ 2,478 m .
This was 13 % higher by both volume and value than five years ago , according to the Book Marketing Limited 's latest Books and the Consumer survey .
It appears that while books might be disappearing from our homes , they are still a treasured part of our culture .
" Britain produces more titles per person than any other country in the world , " says Prof Sutherland .
" That 's the real measure of how important they are to us . "
Being able to read has never been so important
Honor Wilson - Fletcher
" It 's not for nothing that books have been burned over the centuries , " she says .
" They are repositories of ideas and ideas empower people and broaden their horizons .
" But because the cultural landscape is changing so much we need to recognise every variety of reading and acknowledge being able to read has never been so important .
" No medium is less important than any other , be it a classic novel , Scott 's last message from the North Pole , one of Morrissey 's lyrics or graffiti on a wall - they can all educate and change lives .
This is not a year of worthiness , it 's a year of reading . "
Mr Jarratt has told friends he never wants to go to sea again
Survivor reaches land
The exhausted swimmer was found on a beach , and coastguards were then able to find one of the men .
He had spent 30 hours at sea , clinging to debris .
The search continues for the boat 's skipper .
The three fishermen were on board a trawler that sank about 15 km ( 9 miles ) off the east coast near Byron Bay .
" Judging that the second fisherman survived through the night ... we can only hope that the same has occurred with the third , " a spokesman for the Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter service said .
Exhausted
The fishermen were thrown into the sea early on Wednesday after their ship hit a reef , prompting a major search and rescue operation .
Hours later , fisherman Michael Williams crawled onto New Brighton Beach , north of Byron Bay .
Chris Gort , who saw Mr Williams on the beach , said the fisherman " had pretty bad cuts and bruises to his legs and his arms , he was pretty exhausted , pretty badly sunburnt " .
Mr Williams raised the alarm about his two companions , and a second fisherman was picked up by a rescue helicopter 30 hours after first being thrown into the ocean .
John Jarratt was found at sea north - east of Ballina , suffering from hypothermia and dehydration .
Mr Jarratt said he and skipper Charlie Picton , an experienced fisherman , had clung to an insulated cooler after the ship went down , but that in the darkness the two became separated .
He said a rescue helicopter had apparently flown above the exhausted pair without spotting them .
Mr Jarratt has told friends from hospital that he will " never " go back in the ocean , local media reported .
How far off were they ?
Well , it depends on which figure you choose to start with .
Here 's the range : According to key officials in the Bush administration back in 2002 - 2003 , the invasion and reconstruction of Iraq was either going to cost $ 60 billion , or $ 100 - $ 200 billion .
Actually , we can start by tossing that top figure out , since not long after Bush economic advisor Larry Lindsey offered it in 2002 , he was shown the door , in part assumedly for even suggesting something so ludicrous .
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz championed the $ 60 billion figure , but added that much of the cost might well be covered by Iraqi oil revenues ; the country was , after all , floating on a " sea of oil . "
( " To assume we 're going to pay for it all is just wrong , " he told a congressional hearing . )
Still , let 's take that $ 60 billion figure as the Bush baseline .
If economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes are right in their recent calculations and this will turn out to be more than a $ 3 trillion war ( or even a $ 5 - 7 trillion one ) , then the Bush administration was at least $ 2,940,000,000,000 off in its calculations .
That definitely qualifies as a ballpark figure for an administration that never saw a budget estimate for one of its imperial dreams that it could n't hike .
Take just one of its major " reconstruction " projects : getting the vast U.S. embassy staff out of a former palace of Saddam Hussein and into a brand - new , almost Vatican - sized " embassy , " a genuine mother ship , being built from the ground up inside Baghdad 's heavily fortified ( and often heavily shelled ) Green Zone .
Originally scheduled to open in mid-2007 , what will undoubtedly be the largest " diplomatic " mission on the planet was initially budgeted for $ 592 million .
Predictably , its price tag soared another $ 144 million , and now comes in at $ 736 million , as yet unopened .
In December 2007 , the State Department officially certified it " substantially complete , " but , as with most Bush administration construction projects in that country , it remains in a state of staggering unreadiness ; two of the State Department employees who worked on it are now " under criminal investigation " ; and the State Department is dragging its feet about handing over relevant documents to Congress .
Ho-hum .
Nothing , of course , has been cheap for American taxpayers who are financing the Bush administration 's war policies .
It 's been like putting up money for an administration staffed by shopaholics let loose in Neiman Marcus or gambling addicts freed to roam Las Vegas with no betting limits .
But what does money matter ?
After all , this administration has been spending as if there were no tomorrow .
And now , with tomorrow staring them in the face , the latest scare tactic seems to be claiming that doing anything about present policies will simply be too expensive .
Not long after the price of oil crested above $ 103 a barrel , Karl Rove , for instance , predicted that any serious " redeployment " from Iraq would mean $ 200 a barrel oil .
Sigh Fortunately , we 've got William Hartung , director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation , to try to put Bush spending policies in its wars of choice into perspective .

War is Hell , But What the Hell Does it Cost ?
One Week at War in Iraq and Afghanistan for $ 3.5 Billion By William D. Hartung
War is hell -- deadly , dangerous , and expensive .
But just how expensive is it ?
In a recent interview , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz asserted that the costs of the Iraq war -- budgetary , economic , and societal -- could reach $ 5 trillion .
That 's a hard number to comprehend .
Figuring out how many times $ 5 trillion would circle the globe ( if we took it all in one dollar bills ) does n't really help matters much , nor does estimating how many times we could paper over every square inch of Rhode Island with it .
The fact that total war costs could buy six trillion donuts for volunteers to the Clinton , Obama , McCain , and Huckabee campaigns -- assuming a bulk discount -- is impressive in its own way , but not all that meaningful either .
In fact , the Bush administration 's war costs have already moved beyond the human scale of comprehension .
But what if we were to try another tack ?
How about breaking those soaring trillions down into smaller pieces , into mere millions and billions ?
How much , for instance , does one week of George Bush 's wars cost ?
Glad you asked .
If we consider the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan together -- which we might as well do , since we and our children and grandchildren will be paying for them together into the distant future -- a conservative single - week estimate comes to $ 3.5 billion .
Remember , that 's per week !
By contrast , the whole international community spends less than $ 400 million per year on the International Atomic Energy Agency , the primary institution for monitoring and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons ; that 's less than one day 's worth of war costs .
The U.S. government spends just $ 1 billion per year securing and destroying loose nuclear weapons and bomb - making materials , or less than two days ' worth of war costs ; and Washington spends a total of just $ 7 billion per year on combating global warming , or a whopping two weeks ' worth of war costs .
So , perhaps you 're wondering , what does that $ 3.5 billion per week actually pay for ?
And how would we even know ?
The Bush administration submits a supplemental request -- over and above the more than $ 500 billion per year the Pentagon is now receiving in its official budget -- to pay for the purported costs of the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , and for the Global War on Terrorism ( GWOT ) .
If you can stay awake long enough to read the whole 159 - page document for 2008 , it has some fascinating revelations .
For example , to hear the howling of the white - collar warriors in Washington every time anyone suggests knocking a nickel off administration war - spending requests , you would think that the weekly $ 3.5 billion outlay is all " for the troops . "
In fact , only 10 % of it , or under $ 350 million per week , goes to pay and benefits for uniformed military personnel .
That 's less than a quarter of the weekly $ 1.4 billion that goes to war contractors to pay for everything from bullets to bombers .
As a slogan , insisting that we need to keep the current flood of military outlays flowing " for Boeing and Lockheed Martin " just does n't quite have the same ring to it .
You could argue , of course , that all these contracting dollars represent the most efficient way to get our troops the equipment they need to operate safely and effectively in a war zone -- but you would be wrong .
Much of that money is being wasted every week on the wrong kinds of equipment at exorbitant prices .
And even when it is the right kind of equipment , there are often startling delays in getting it to the battlefield , as was the case with advanced armored vehicles for the Marine Corps .
But before we get to equipment costs , let 's take a look at a week 's worth of another kind of support .
The Pentagon and the State Department do n't make a big point -- or really any kind of point -- out of telling us how much we 're spending on gun-toting private - contract employees from companies like Blackwater and Triple Canopy , our " shadow army " in Iraq , but we can make an educated guess .
For example , at the high end of the scale , individual employees of private military firms make up to 10 times what many U.S. enlisted personnel make , or as much as $ 7,500 per week .
If even one - tenth of the 5,000 to 6,000 armed contract employees in Iraq make that much , we 're talking about at least $ 40 million per week .
If the rest make $ 1,000 a week -- an extremely conservative estimate -- then we have nearly $ 100 million per week going just to the armed cohort of private - contract employees operating there .
Now , let 's add into that figure the whole private crew of non-government employees operating in Iraq , including all the cooks , weapons technicians , translators , interrogators , and other private - contract support personnel .
That combined cost probably comes closer to $ 300 million per week , or almost as much as is spent on uniformed personnel by the Air Force , Army , Navy , and Marines .
By one reliable estimate , there are more contract employees in Iraq alone -- about 180,000 -- than there are U.S. troops .
There are thousands more in Afghanistan .
But since many of these non-military employees are poorly paid subcontract workers involved in cooking meals , doing laundry , and cleaning latrines , the total costs for the services of all private - contractor employees in Iraq probably runs somewhat less than the costs of the uniformed military .
Hence our estimate .
So , if $ 650 million or so a week is spent on people , where does the other nearly $ 3 billion go ?
It goes for goods and services , from tanks and fighter planes to fuel and food .
Most of this money ends up in the hands of private companies like Boeing , Lockheed Martin , and the former Halliburton subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown and Root .
The list of weapons and accessories paid for from our $ 3.5 billion is long and daunting :
$ 1.5 million for M - 4 carbines ( about 900 guns per week ) ;
$ 2.3 million for machine guns ( about 170 per week ) ;
$ 4.3 million for Hellfire missiles ( about 50 missiles per week ) ;
$ 6.9 million for night vision devices ( about 2,100 per week ) ;
$ 10.8 million for fuel per week ;
$ 5 million to store and transport that fuel per week ;
$ 14.8 million for F - 18E / F fighter planes per week ( one every four weeks ) ;
$ 23.4 million for ammunition per week ;
$ 30.7 million for Bradley fighting vehicles ( 10 per week ) .
And that 's only a very partial list .
What about the more mundane items ?
" Laundries , showers , and latrines " cost more than $ 110,000 per week ;
" Parachutes and aerial delivery systems " cost $ 950,000 per week ;
" Runway snow removal and cleaning " costs $ 132,000 per week ;
Flares cost $ 50,000 per week .
Some of these figures , of course , may cover worldwide military operations for the U.S. armed forces .
After all , by sticking the acronym GWOT in the title of any supplemental war - spending request , you can cram almost anything into it .
Then there are the sobering figures like : $ 2.4 million per week for " death gratuities " ( payments to families of troops killed in action ) and $ 10.6 million per week in " extra hazard pay . "
And do n't forget that all the death and destruction lurking behind these weekly numbers makes it that much harder to get people to join the military .
But not to worry , $ 1 million per week is factored into that supplemental funding request for " advertising and recruitment " -- not enough perhaps to fill the ranks , but at least they 're trying .
Keep in mind that this only gives us a sense of what we do know from the public Pentagon request ; there 's plenty more that we do n't know .
As a start , the Pentagon 's breakdown of the money in its " emergency " supplemental budget leaves huge gaps .
Even your own congressman does n't know for sure what is really in the U.S. war budget .
What we do know is that the Pentagon and the military services have been stuffing more and more projects that have nothing to do with the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , or even the war on terror , into those war supplementals .
Layered in are requests for new equipment that will take years , or even decades , to build and may never be used in combat -- unless the Iraq war really does go on for another century , as John McCain recently suggested .
These " non-war " items include high - tech armored vehicles and communications devices for the Army as well as new combat aircraft for the Air Force .
Even though these systems may never be used on our current battlefields , they are war costs nonetheless .
If they were n't inserted into the supplemental requests for Iraq and Afghanistan , they might never have been funded .
After all , who wants to vote against a bill that is allegedly all " for the troops , " even if it includes weapons those troops will never get ?
These add - ons are not small change .
They probably cost in the area of $ 500 million per week .
Given all of this , it may sound like we have a fair amount of detail about the costs of a week of war .
No such luck .
Until the " supplemental " costs of war are subjected to the same scrutiny as the regular Pentagon budget , there will continue to be hundreds of millions of dollars unaccounted for each and every week that the wars go on .
And there will be all sorts of money for pet projects that have nothing to do with fighting current conflicts .
So do n't just think of that $ 3.5 billion per week figure as a given .
Think of it as $ 3.5 billion and counting .
Does n't that make you feel safer ?

ON TUESDAY , I got a sarcastic e-mail from a Hillary supporter .
She forwarded a crack made by Howard Wolfson , Clintons media man , about Obama .
 Senator Clinton ,  he scoffed , is not running on the strength of her rhetoric .
To which my friend added : Unfortunately .
By evening , the Wisconsin blowout was serious enough that the posters in last - chance Ohio read : Weve Got Your Back Hillary .
Clintons speech sounded ominously shopworn :   One of us is ready to be commander in chief ...
One of us has faced serious Republican opposition in the past .
These are disheartening days for Hillary supporters .
Not just because of the string of losses but because of the kind of loss .
This was nothing if not a careful campaign .
Neither the strategists nor the candidate had illusions about the hurdles that would face the first woman president in American history .
They knew women have to prove and prove again their toughness .
They knew women have to prove and prove again their experience .
They began as well by framing Clinton as the establishment candidate .
But then the establishment became  the status quo and the historic candidacy became old politics .
She even got demerits for experience .
Something else happened along the way .
If Hillary Clinton was the tough guy in the race , Barack Obama became the Oprah candidate .
He was the quality circle man , the uniter - not - divider , the person who believes we can talk to anyone , even our enemies .
He finely honed a language usually associated with womens voices .
Does this transmutation resonate with women who have tried to become CEOs of lesser enterprises than America Inc . ?
Women of Hillarys generation were taught to don power suits and use their shoulder pads to push open corporate doors .
In the 1970s , the lessons on making it in a mans world were essentially primers on how to behave like men .
As University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee political scientist Kathleen Dolan says , They had to figure out a way to go undercover .
They could only be taken seriously if they filled the male model with XX chromosomes .
But the next generation of advice books urged women to do it their own way .
The old stereotypes that defined women as more compassionate and collaborative were given a positive spin .
They were framed and praised as womens ways of leading .
Todays shelves are still full of titles  from Seducing the Boys Club to The Girls Guide to Being a Boss ( Without Being a Bitch )  to Enlightened Power  that tell us to act like a man or act like a woman .
But in many ways , the transformative inspirational , collaborative , female style has become more attractive .
Especially to a younger generation .
And  heres the rub  especially when it is modeled by a man .
Dolan sees Obama as  the embodiment of the gentle , collaborative style without threatening his masculine side .
But she adds , Hes being more feminine than she can be .
She is in a much tighter box .
This too is a bit like whats happened in business .
Whatever advice they follow , women are still only 3 percent of the CEOs in Fortune 500 companies .
Meanwhile , its become more acceptable for a man to take an afternoon off to watch his kids play ball than for a woman .
Ilene Lang heads Catalyst , which surveyed more than 1,200 senior executives in the United States and Europe .
This research calculated the tenacity of double binds and double standards .
It showed how hard it still is for a woman to be seen as both competent and likable .
And it led her to the conclusion that What defines leadership to most people is one thing .
It s male .
As for the Obama style ?
Both men and women are much more likely to accept a collaborative style of leadership from men than from women .
From women it seems too soft ,  she adds ruefully .
Hillary was quite right that she needed to be seen as the experienced , competent , commander in chief .
Obama was quite right about the countrys desire to reach across boundaries and beyond divisiveness .
We have ended up in a lopsided era of change .
After all , how many of us wanted to see male leaders transformed from cowboys to conciliators ?
Now we see a woman running as the fighter and a man modeling a womans way of leading .
We see a younger generation in particular inspired by ideas nurtured by women , as long as they are delivered in a baritone .
So , has the womens movement made life easier ?
For another man ?

FORT DAVIS , Texas — University of Texas at Austin astronomer and Hubble Fellow Seth Redfield has used the Hobby - Eberly Telescope ( HET ) at McDonald Observatory to make the first ground - based detection of the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system .
This research has been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters .
“ It ’s a remarkable pioneering discovery , ” said McDonald Observatory Director David L. Lambert .
The work is an incremental step in finding life in the universe , falling between the initial detections of planets around other stars ( known as “ extra - solar planets ” or “ exoplanets ” ) , and the anticipated discovery of planets similar to Earth .
“ What we all want to find is a planet with an Earth - like atmosphere , ” Redfield said .
The planet Redfield studied orbits HD189733 , a star about 63 light - years away in the constellation Vulpecula , the little fox .
But it ’s not like Earth .
The planet is 20 percent more massive than Jupiter , and orbits very close to its parent star ( more than 10 times closer than Mercury is to our Sun ) .
From Earth ’s line of sight , the planet passes directly in front of the star on each orbit .
That means this planet , HD189733 b , is what ’s known as a “ transiting extra - solar planet . ”
It was this “ transit ” property that allowed the planet ’s discovery in 2004 by Francois Bouchy of France ’s Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille , and the detection of its atmosphere in 2007 by Redfield .
Redfield 's team for this project included University of Texas at Austin astronomers Michael Endl , William Cochran , and Lars Kosterke .
Astronomers have only once before detected the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star in such a way , using a now inoperable instrument on Hubble Space Telescope , the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) .
“ STIS broke soon after the detection , and there was no capability to do this from space .
Ground - based observations are the only option at this time , ” Redfield said .
The feat has been tried unsuccessfully several times from the ground in recent years , he said .
In most cases , astronomers had studied their target stars through only one transit .
“ I knew we had to take it one step further , ” Redfield said .
“ I knew that we would probably have to go for many transits ” to detect the atmosphere .
He studied 11 transits over the course of a year with HET and its High Resolution Spectrograph .
To obtain the planet ’s ‘ transmission spectrum , ’ and thus the chemical composition of its atmosphere , he used what he called “ a very straightforward ” technique .
“ Take a spectrum of the star when the planet is in front of the star , ” he said .
“ Then take a spectrum of the star when it ’s not .
Then you divide the two and get the planet ’s atmospheric transmission spectrum . ”
Straightforward , but not easy .
The light blocked by the planet is a mere 2.5 percent of the star ’s total light , plus another 0.3 percent for the planet ’s atmosphere .
“ Each time the planet passes in front of the star , ” Redfield said , “ the planet blocks some of the star ’s light .
If the planet has no atmosphere , it will block the same amount of light at all wavelengths .
However , if the planet has an atmosphere , gasses in its atmosphere will absorb some additional light . ”
It was predicted that sodium atoms should be present in the atmosphere .
The atmosphere of the planet will absorb more starlight at those wavelengths that correspond to specific transitions of the sodium atom .
“ This causes the planet to appear larger , since we now ‘ see ’ the planet plus the atmosphere , and we measure more blocked light from the star , ” Redfield said .
When studying the planet at the particular wavelength of the sodium transition , the planet appears about 6 percent larger than at other wavelengths .
The detection of sodium was possible because there ’s a lot of it there , and the atomic transition is strong and falls within the visual range that ground - based telescopes can detect .
“ Many other atomic and molecular constituents of the atmosphere may be studied in a similar way , including potassium and hydrogen , ” Redfield said .
“ I look forward to the detection of other gasses around this planet , ” Lambert said .
And , “ I wish every success for Seth as he chases oxygen , water vapor and other molecules — indicators of life — around planets far more accommodating to life than this one . ”
The data analysis involved studying hundreds of observations spread over a year , taken under different conditions .
Redfield and his collaborators removed contamination to the data caused by water vapor in Earth ’s own atmosphere , modeled how the star itself may have contributed to their measurements , and more , to make sure their detection was sound .
In the end , the extra -solar planet ’s " transmission spectrum " from HET was much higher resolution than that previously made with Hubble Space Telescope on a different planet .
“ I was actually surprised and encouraged that it was even possible , ” Redfield said .
“ We ’ve proved that it ’s possible .
Let ’s start doing this for other transiting planets .
Let ’s start doing ‘ comparative exoplanetology . ’ ”
“ It is just breathtaking how fast the progress in the field of exoplanets is , ” said Redfield ’s collaborator , Michael Endl .
“ We have arrived at a point where we can study the composition of the atmospheres of ‘ hot Jupiters ’ in great detail .
The HET is not only a planet finder now , but also a great tool to examine the atmospheric features of transiting extrasolar planets with unprecedented resolution .
I ca n’t wait to see how the results for the other planets will compare to our initial findings . ”
Redfield said HET can study the atmospheres of many of the brightest transiting planets .
The Hobby - Eberly Telescope is a joint project of The University of Texas at Austin , The Pennsylvania State University , Stanford University , Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München , and Georg - August - Universität Göttingen .

In between are more squishy details like how many habitable planets there are per planetary system ( one to five they said ) , and what fraction of those habitable planets develop life , intelligence and the technology to communicate with other worlds .
The Dolphins pegged those last three probabilities optimistically as , respectively , 100 percent , 100 percent , and 10 percent to 100 percent ( dolphins , for example , do n’t build radio telescopes ) .
Multiply all the factors together and you get the putative galactic census .
In the realms in which astronomers have actually gotten new data , the old guesses of the Dolphins have held up very well , Seth Shostak , an astronomer and spokesman at the institute , explained .
In the more sociological and biological realms , where the data are ambiguous or nonexistent , you ca n’t prove they were wrong .
“ These guys were either enormously lucky or amazingly prescient , ” he said .
One change , he said , was in the notion of a habitable world , that is to say , one with liquid water .
In the old days “ habitability ” meant a planet had to be small and rocky and in a narrow Goldilocks zone around its star where the temperature would be just right .

Astronomers say space missions like NASA ’s Kepler , scheduled to be launched next year , will determine the frequency with which these Goldilocks planets occur in our neck of the galaxy .
But the possibilities have expanded since spacecraft discovered evidence of water on or in some of the moons of Jupiter .
At the same time , scientists discovered that life on Earth was tougher and more versatile than scientists had thought , thriving in weird places like boiling undersea vents .
“ There is so much evidence for lots of pathways to the origin of life , ” Dr. Drake said .
But how often does intelligent and technological life actually emerge from such environments ?
Some evolutionists , like Stephen Jay Gould , who died in 2002 , have argued that intelligence is not inevitable .
The dinosaurs did just fine for 150 million years without getting appreciably brainier .
“ This particular night , it was December 2003 , there was , I ’d say , more than 100 targets , ” Mr. Sepi said .
“ Each little team had a list .
And at this one house , we blow the gate and find out that there ’s this guy sitting in his car just inside that gate .
We move in , and he , like , stumbles out of his car , and he ’s on fire , and he ’s , like , stumbling around in circles in his front yard .
So we all kind of do n’t know what to do , and he collapses , and we go inside the house and search it and find out it ’s the wrong house . ”
Although Mr. Sepi said that he felt bad at the time , he also knew that he had done nothing but follow orders and that the Army had paid the man ’s family a settlement .
He did not imagine that the image of the flaming , stumbling Iraqi civilian would linger like a specter in his psyche .
Listening to Mr. Sepi recount the story of a death that he regretted in Iraq while grappling with a death that he regretted in Las Vegas , his lawyer grew determined to get him help .
“ It was just so shocking , and his emotions were so raw , and he was so messed up , ” Ms. Lemcke said .
An Unusual Legal Deal
She found compassion for him among the law enforcement officials handling the case .
The investigation backed up Mr. Sepi ’s story of self - defense , although it was never determined who fired first .
It made an impression on the police that he was considerably outweighed  his 130 pounds against a 210 - pound man and a 197 - pound woman .
And it helped Mr. Sepi that his victims were drifters , with no family members pressing for justice .
The police said that Kevin Ratcliff , 36 , who was shot and wounded by Mr. Sepi , belonged to the Crips and was a convicted felon ; Sharon Jackson , 47 , who was killed , belonged to NC , the Naked City gang , and an autopsy found alcohol , cocaine and methamphetamines in her blood .
Buoyed by an outpouring of support from Mr. Sepi ’s fellow soldiers and veterans ’ advocates , Ms. Lemcke pressed the Department of Veterans Affairs to find treatment programs for Mr. Sepi .
This allowed an unusual deal with the local district attorney ’s office : in exchange for the successful completion of treatment for substance abuse and PTSD , the charges against Mr. Sepi would be dropped .
After about three months in jail , Mr. Sepi spent three months at a substance abuse program in Prescott , Ariz. , in late 2005 , where the graying veterans presented an object lesson : “ I do n’t want to be like that when I ’m older , ” he said to himself .
In early 2006 , he transferred to a PTSD treatment center run by the V.A. in Topeka , Kan. , where he learned how to deal with anger , sadness and guilt , to manage the symptoms of his anxiety disorder and , it seems , to vanquish his nightmares .

( LifeWire ) --
When her husband of more than a decade revealed he was gay , Anna Marie Will was surprised -- but not shocked .
Jim and Anna Marie Will decided to stay together after he announced he was gay .
Her husband , Jim , had never fit her stereotypical idea of the sports - loving , macho , straight guy , and the two had even gone to gay bars with a friend who was gay .
But that did n't mean she was prepared for the news .
" Neither one of us had a clue -- he did n't know what being gay meant for him .
...
He needed to figure that out , " recalls Anna Marie Will , of Sacramento , California .
" I needed to figure out what his being gay meant for me , and whether I could incorporate that into my life and my marriage . "
What they did know was that they believed in their marriage and wanted to make it work .
Jim Will 's revelation in 2001 began a three - year process during which they sorted out their feelings for each other .
Ultimately , the couple , whose daughter turns 15 in March , decided to stay together .
" He had to learn to talk to me -- he had spent so many years not saying what was really on his mind , and not dealing with his true feelings , " says Anna Marie Will , now 39 , a worker 's compensation program administrator .
" We found out once we got past all that , our marriage was so much better .
We still loved each other as people and partners . "
Although Jim Will , 39 , a secretary , had known on some level about his true orientation since he was 5 , he did n't want to lose his deep bond with Anna Marie , whom he first befriended when they were in high school .
" When we married , and now still , we feel that we could spend the rest of our lives together , " he says .
" We want to be together . "
An uncommon commitment
The Wills ' commitment to making their mixed - orientation marriage work over the long haul is more the exception for couples in this situation .
Nearly all couples decide to end their marriage by the third year of a spouse coming out , according to informal research conducted by Amity Pierce Buxton , a founder of and spokeswoman for the Straight Spouse Network , a support group that claims to reach about 7,000 spouses .
Even if the union is likely to end because one spouse is gay or lesbian , Buxton and her group try to help couples resolve their feelings in as positive a manner as possible .
The straight spouse is likely to feel that his or her sexual orientation has been rejected , says Buxton , whose first marriage ended in the early ' 80s after her husband came out .
The straight spouse often also feels deceived and questions his or her beliefs about gender , as well as assumptions about the relationship :
Was n't I enough of a woman to keep him from straying ?
Was n't I man enough to keep her from " turning " ?
" After the initial shock , they gradually get to face the reality of the changes , " says Buxton , author of " The Other Side of the Closet : The Coming - Out Crisis for Straight Spouses and Families . "
" Once they realize they can't go back , only then can they start ... deciding what 's best for them . "
What Should You Tell the Kids ?
Mixed - orientation couples like the Wills who also are parents must figure out what -- if anything -- to tell the kids about their relationship .
If the gay or lesbian spouse is not planning to act on his or her orientation , it may not be necessary to explain the situation at all , according to Shara Sand , a clinical assistant professor of psychology at the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , at Yeshiva University .
For couples who agree on an open relationship , they may feel they have to broach the subject with their child .
But Sand believes it 's not advisable to do so before he or she reaches age 10 , or the point at which they are capable of understanding abstract concepts .
" I might say something like , ' Mom and Dad still love each other very much ... but we have a need to be close to other people .
Some people have relationship where it's okay to live with someone and also be close to other people ' , " Sand suggests .
At no time should the couple discuss their sex life with their kids .
" I do think we 've become a little boundary - less , " Sand says .
" I do n't think it 's necessarily appropriate for children to be led into the intimate part of their parents ' relationship ever .
Even if you have an open marriage , and you go out swinging , it 's not something you necessarily tell your children . "
One thing 's familiar -- compromise
The Wills did n't talk much about their situation for about three months while Anna Marie Will began to come to terms with it .
Then they started a series of discussions about the future of their relationship -- talks that were helped when she consulted the Straight Spouse Network and Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays .
The Wills set aside a time each week to discuss their feelings , rather than have the issue dominate their daily lives .
Eventually , they decided to have an open relationship , in which either could seek companionship from other people , and to continue their marriage on both an emotional and a sexual level .
Nevertheless , Jim identifies himself as gay , not bisexual .
Anna Marie is straight .
" Both of us are free to do whatever we choose , " Anna Marie Will says .
" I have n't strayed beyond the marriage because I 'm happy with the marriage in a mental and physical capacity . "
Jim Will says he has had encounters with men but has not pursued a full - fledged relationship .
" To this day , I have a very difficult time going out , " he says .
" It 's not cheating because she knows what I 'm doing , but something about it is not right for me , and then the experience does n't seem worth it .
" I feel like I need to find the balance somehow of living both sides , " he says .
The Wills ' relationship , albeit nontraditional , seems to be like most marriages in one respect :
It 's all about compromise .
" You can't help who you love , " Anna Marie Will says .
" I can't imagine sharing a sunrise or sunset , or good day or bad day , with anyone else .
" When you find that person , you know that 's it . "
Says her husband : " Your relationship can be different from everyone else 's , and if it works for you in your heart , that 's what you do . "

All About Marriage
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In his first public testimony since his company 's product became the subject of the largest meat recall in U.S. history , the president of Westland / Hallmark Meat Co. acknowledged Wednesday that at least two " downer " cows depicted in hidden - camera videos appeared to have entered the U.S. food supply .
He previously had denied that any had gotten into the food supply .
Still , there was " less than a minute chance of that product being contaminated , " Steve Mendell told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce 's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations .
Wednesday was the latest in a string of hearings prompted by the company 's voluntary recall on February 17 of 143 million pounds of beef -- representing the Chino , California , plant 's output since February 1 , 2006 .
The recall was ordered amid uproar over the release of video filmed with a hidden camera over a six - week period by a worker at the plant who was also working for the Humane Society of the United States .
The video , which was released to the media January 30 , showed downer cows being chained , dragged , rolled , kicked and jabbed in an effort to make them stand so they could be led into the chute for slaughter .
As the animals screamed , workers prodded them with forklifts , shocked them and shot powerful streams of water into their nostrils .
Excerpts of the video were played for the committee members .
In his written testimony , delivered under oath , Mendell said that " the activities shown on the video are not ' food safety issues . '
The cows shown in the video could not walk , were designated to be euthanized and were not put into commerce . "
But after being shown excerpts of the videos showing two such cows in the " kill chute , " he acknowledged that it " would be logical " to conclude that at least two such cows had entered the food supply .
Mendell said that he had not seen the videos before , but he expressed skepticism that the animals could have threatened anyone 's health .
No reports of illness have been linked to the meat , though experts say it could be years before some diseases might emerge .
Cattle that can't walk to slaughter on their own are deemed " downer cows " because they may be sick .
Downer cows are not allowed to enter the food supply because they are associated with a higher risk of mad - cow disease , a fatal brain - wasting syndrome that takes an average of 13 years to appear .
Of the 15 cases of mad - cow disease diagnosed in cattle in the United States and Canada , 12 were among downer cows .
The latest case , in Canada , was reported February 26 .
Asked what went wrong at Westland / Hallmark , Mendell said , " Obviously , there was a breakdown in our training or our programs to allow that kind of behavior to occur . "
He said that , since the release of the videos , he has ordered the installation of 17 video cameras " that cover every square inch " of the yard and the unloading area .
Mendell , who appeared Wednesday only after being subpoenaed , apologized for not having attended a February 26 hearing on the matter .
Other matters were more pressing , he said .
" I was overinundated with phone calls , news reporters , and my business was in the middle of the biggest recall in U.S. history , " he said .
Mendell said he disagrees with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's handing of the recall , which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars and is likely to result in the permanent closure of his company .
" I think , in my humble opinion , that USDA could have contacted Alameda , our local area office , talked to the veterinarian in charge , talked to my area supervisor and thought about this a little bit before the recall . "
He said that safeguards in place -- removal of high - risk spinal cord tissue -- would have ensured the safety of the beef .
Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States , said Mendell 's testimony raised serious questions .
" This is a guy who claims he had a good training program ; this is a guy who had third - party audits ; this is a guy that says USDA has a full complement of inspectors at his plant , " he said .
" Well , why did things go so badly ?
If other plants are making similar claims , should we have confidence in what they 're saying ? "

Jose Ramos - Horta won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996
Jose Ramos - Horta
Mr Ramos - Horta was shot in a pre-dawn attack on his Dili home , and later airlifted to Australia for treatment .
Later Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao declared a 48 - hour state of emergency , including a night - time curfew .
Mr Gusmao , who was targeted in a separate incident but was unharmed , described the events as a coup attempt .
Rebel leader Alfredo Reinado and another rebel died in the attack on Mr Ramos - Horta .
Australian PM Kevin Rudd pledged to send more peacekeepers to East Timor .
He said the " attempt to assassinate the democratically elected leadership of a close friend and neighbour of Australia 's is a deeply disturbing development " .
' Under control '
The attack on Mr Ramos - Horta happened at about 0700 on Monday ( 2200 GMT Sunday ) .
JOSE RAMOS - HORTA
Founder of East Timor 's independence movement Spent 24 years in exile after Indonesia invaded Won Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 Former journalist , fluent in five languages
Unrest fears after shooting Timorese shock at shooting
In pictures : Timor leader shot
Two cars drove past the president 's house on the outskirts of the capital , Dili .
He was outside the compound at the time .
He apparently tried to return home after hearing gunshots but was shot on the way in , according to UN officials .
One soldier was also reported to be seriously wounded .
Mr Ramos - Horta was taken to a hospital run by the Australian military in Dili , where he was stabilised .
He was later evacuated to Darwin for further treatment , and put in intensive care on a ventilator .
He received three gunshot wounds - one in the stomach and two in the chest - and his condition is described as " serious but stable " .
But the Darwin hospital 's general manager told AFP news agency he was hopeful for a full recovery .
" The fact that he is in a stable condition is a good sign that we should see some reasonable outcomes for him , " Dr Len Notaras said .
" He 's not fighting for his life but his injuries are extremely serious . "
' Failed coup '
Shots were also fired at Mr Gusmao 's convoy , shortly after the attack on Mr Ramos - Horta , but no - one was hurt .
The attack happened after the prime minister had left his house .
The vehicles came under heavy fire , and one reportedly left the road and rolled over .
Mr Gusmao told a press briefing that the situation was under control .
" I consider this incident a coup attempt against the state by Reinado and it failed , " he said .
" This government will guarantee security and development will continue . "
He later announced a state of emergency , including a curfew between 2000 and 0600 and a ban on gatherings and protests .
Dili is reported to be quiet and heavily patrolled by local and international security forces .
But the BBC's Andrew Harding says officials are concerned that there could be fighting between rival groups .
Unrest fear
An Australian - led UN force has been in charge of security in the capital since mid-2006 .
Peacekeepers were invited into the country to quell violent clashes between police and the military , triggered by then Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri 's decision to sack a third of the armed forces .
Peacekeepers have stepped up security in Dili
At least 37 people were killed in several weeks of fighting and more than 150,000 were forced to flee their homes .
Reinado , a former naval commander , was accused of being involved in several shooting incidents during the violence and charged with murder .
But he escaped from jail and , with a group of followers , holed himself up in the mountains , refusing government pleas to surrender .
His continued stand - off with the government had led to fears of renewed violence in what is one of the world 's newest and poorest nations .
Mr Ramos - Horta is a political veteran .
He spent 24 years in exile after Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975 , leading the country 's bid for independence from overseas and winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts .
He served in the more powerful role of prime minister in the wake of the 2006 violence , before elections last year which saw him switch roles with then President Xanana Gusmao .
East Timor gained independence in 2002 .
Hello App Store
The big day has come and passed .
And you know what ?
We ’re still in uncharted territory : for most of us Mac developers , the App Store is something new and strange .
Let ’s start by looking at Apple ’s cut in the deal .
Is 30 % reasonable ?
My first impression was that it seemed a little high , but acceptable .
You ’re getting someone else to deal with the hassles of downloading , payment processing and , to some degree , promotion .
There ’s a lot of value in that .
Look at what it costs to be on other plaforms , such as Xbox Live , and it seems fair .
But thinking through the situation a bit more , I realized that those things pale in comparison to the value of being associated with the Apple brand .
Having their explicit stamp of approval and being included in the App Store will make any product more appealing to a customer .
Buying directly from Apple means that your software wo n’t screw up their phone and that can be returned if it does n’t live up to expectations .
That , combined with the ease of a single click purchase , is going to drive a lot of sales .
You ’ll make up that 30 % without even trying .
Update on March 13th , 2008 : A reader , Philip Smith , wrote in with an interesting observation : how many developers have the ability to offer gift cards for their products ?
Traditionally , giving software as a gift has been a very hit or miss affair .
But when friends and relatives can go down to the local grocery store and pick up a gift card for the App Store , that problem is solved .
Yet another way to increase your sales with the help of Apple .
One thing that disappoints me about the iPhone SDK sign - up is that the entry fee of $ 99 is too low .
I look at the entry fee as a way to filter out developers that are n’t fully committed to the platform .
Unfortunately from what we ’ve seen so far , including the load on developer .
apple.com on the day of the SDK release , there ’s a huge amount of interest .
I fear that Apple is going to be overloaded with application reviews , issuing certificates , and other administrative tasks .
A higher entry fee would lessen the chance of this becoming a bottleneck for getting my product into the system .
Please charge me $ 499 and let move to the front of the line .
Now , let ’s look at how this affects our current business and way of doing things .
Even though writing applications for the iPhone is now incredibly easy , selling software is much more than just writing code .
My primary concerns at this point are with the details of distribution .
Take a look at our Twitterrific product : we ’d love to offer both free and paid - for versions .
Will that be allowed in the App Store ?
There ’s also the traditional “ try before you buy ” model that we ’re used to having with our desktop applications .
As a customer , I ’d like to know what I ’m getting before I put my money down .
Will the App Store allow some kind of trial period ?
As Apple builds out the App Store , I hope they take the approach that they have with the iTunes Store .
Let me write an application “ preview ” that anyone can download freely .
If they like it , the buy button makes us both happy .
All I need to do in order to make this happen is provide two files to Apple : one is the software equivalent of the 30 second clip , the other is the real deal .
Anyone who ’s been selling online for more than one major release knows how important upgrade fees are to the continued growth of a product .
It drives new features and keeps the product life cycle moving along .
Yet we ’ve heard nothing about how this will be handled at the App Store .
Will we be able to identify existing users and offer them discounts ?
Keeping existing customers happy is in my best interest and that of my new partner : Apple .
Update on March 10th , 2008 : Another issue that occurred to me was how we ’ll be able to offer the product at varying price points .
For example , NFR licenses for reviewers , free licenses for contest prizes and discounted licenses for promotions like MacSanta .
Again , I hope that Apple keeps our promotional needs in mind as they implement the App Store .
There has also been no indication on how we ’ll be able to handle distribution during a beta test .
There ’s no way I ’m going to release a major product without letting a significant number of users run a private version of the application .
Can we get these pre-release versions of the product onto their phones without using the App Store ?
Will the App Store itself provide some special beta mechanism ?
Will we have to run our own App Store like large enterprises ?
Any guidance in this regard needs to happen soon , June will be here before we know it .

Dalai - backed violence scars Lhasa
Source : CCTV.com | 03-15-2008 14:19
The situation has begun to return to normal in Lhasa after a day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , and a mosque burnt down .
The Tibetan regional government says seven people have been confirmed dead in the riot .
Witnesses say the unrest started around 1 p.m. on Friday .
Several people clashed with and threw stones at the local
police near the Ramogia Monastery in downtown Lhasa , the

Witnesses say the unrest started around 1 p.m. on Friday .
Several people clashed with and threw stones at the local police near the Ramogia Monastery in downtown Lhasa , the capital of southwest China 's Tibet Autonomous Region .
Rioters set fire to shops along two main streets in the capital .
At least five fires were reported and dense smoke was seen covering the area .
A Tibetan government official told China 's Xinhua News Agency that there was enough evidence to prove that the sabotage in Lhasa was organized by the Dalai clique .
The official says the violence , which included looting and arson , disrupted the public order , jeopardized people 's lives and damaged property .
Several injuries were reported as a result of the violence and the injured were taken to hospital .
The number of causalities is not yet known .
A local official said relevant departments of the regional government are taking effective measures to handle the incident .

COX - 2 inhibitors are having a tough year .
Vioxx was withdrawn voluntarily a few months ago and now Celebrex , the arthritis drug that blocks pain by inhibiting the COX - 2 enzyme , has been shown in laboratory studies to induce arrhythmia , or irregular beating of the heart , via a pathway unrelated to its COX - 2 inhibition .
University at Buffalo researchers discovered this unexpected finding while conducting basic research on potassium channels .
Celebrex ( Celecoxib ) has been taken by over 27 million patients since its approval by the FDA in 1998 .
The new research found that low concentrations of the drug , corresponding to a standard prescription , reduced the heart rate and induced pronounced arrhythmia in fruit flies and the heart cells of rats .
The drug inhibited the normal passage of potassium ions into and out of heart cells through pores in the cell membrane known as delayed rectifier potassium channels , the study showed .
" The adverse effects of drugs like Celebrex and Vioxx based on their selective inhibition of COX - 2 currently are a topic of intense discussion in the medical community , " said Satpal Singh , Ph.D. , associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and senior author on the study .
Vioxx was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 .
" We now have shown an important new effect of Celebrex through a totally different pathway , one that is unrelated to the drug 's effect as a pain reducer , " Singh said .
" The adverse effect arising from this unexpected mechanism definitely needs to be studied more closely , because the potassium channels inhibited by the drug are present in heart , brain and many other tissues in the human body .
The research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation to Singh and Randall D. Shortridge , Ph.D. , UB assistant professor of biological sciences , to analyze the basic properties of potassium channels .
Aware that COX - 2 inhibitors had been shown to produce cardiovascular side effects , the researchers first tested whether Celebrex would affect the heart in fruit flies , a good animal system for studies on heart in other species , including humans .
" When we found an effect on the fly heart , we began looking for the underlying mechanism , " said Singh .
" We searched the fly genome and were surprised to find that these flies do n't have cyclooxygenases , the enzymes targeted by Celebrex .
" Because the main effect of the drug in our study was induction of arrhythmia , and arrhythmia is often the result of ion-channel dysfunction , " continued Singh , " we examined the drug 's effect on potassium channels and other ion channels in their models and were struck by the strong inhibition of the potassium channels . "
The researchers now are examining the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the drug 's action and its effect on other ion channels that play a prominent role in setting the rhythm of the heart .
" We are trying to determine whether the drug binds directly to the channels or to some other molecule , and if it acts by blocking the pore of the channel through which potassium ions travel or by some other mechanism , " Singh said .
Results of the study appear in the Jan. 18 edition of the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
Roman V. Frolov , a doctoral student working in Singh 's lab , is first author on the paper .
Ilya G. Berim , M.D. , research scientist in the UB Department of Medicine , also is a study author , and Malcomb Slaughter , Ph.D. , UB professor of physiology and biophysics and ophthalmology , made significant contributions to the research .
Dear Congress : “ My will , not thy will be done ” is my joke about The Lord ’s Prayer .
A friend of mine replies with a smile : “ And God says ---- NOT ! ”
~ Where God and man are concerned , such is the relationship .
But where Congress , the people and the Constitution are concerned , it really is the job --- the paid position --- of Congress to say to Us , the People : “ Thy will , not my will be done ” .
America is supposed to be a government of the people , by the people and for the people .
The Constitution never defined the US government as being “ of the corporations , by the corporations and for the corporations “ .
It also never said “ Of the politicians , by the politicians and for the politicians ” .
Your job as Congress is to uphold , protect and defend the Constitution , which means intrinsically to implement the majority will of the American people .
No one else .
~ I regret to inform you , Congress , that you have chosen to do anything but that .
The written statement by Sen. Diane Feinstein is a great example :
“ We are going to have to disagree about this bill ” , writes the Senator in her auto - reply about the flag burning amendment .
However strongly many among us may agree or disagree about flag burning as a protected form of free speech is beside the point :
The fact remains that with only a few exceptions , the overwhelming majority of you have taken the attitude that you are “ the deciders ” , seizing power which was never yours to begin with .
Please be reminded , Congress , that we * pay * you to be implementers of the public will and not your own whims .
You are our employees .
You work for us , not the other way around !
And that means that we have the right to fire you when the going gets rough .
And we will , for all the reasons stated below .
~
A ) Regardless of the fact that we are in a recession , you continue to fund the war , as if to deliberately bring the country into a depression , not merely a recession .
~ Is this the thanks you have for the masses of people who pay your salaries with their tax dollars ?
Should we pay our own way into a depression and starvation just because you desire to squander * our* money in this way ?
Congress , you are frivolously playing with our financial and physical health .
We hold you legally and morally responsible .
~
B ) A war based on lies is better known as a mass murder ring .
This is far from an act of “ incompetence ” as you say :
It is a premeditated act .
Is this what you insist on paying for , with our tax dollars ?
Unacceptable .
~C ) Must the system of checks and balances come from overseas ?
~ While still governor of Texas , our President un-elect had the highest record of capital punishment of any governor in US History .
Hmm ….. What of the fact that our President has broken more than 900 laws ?
Let me state that only gang leaders endanger a life out of revenge , as exemplified by the Valerie Plame case .
Who but a criminal would abandon Katrina victims to die and withhold medical care from children and our soldiers ?
Since you refuse to impeach our President and our Vice President un-elect , is this the kind of behavior you support , Congress ?
Let me ask another very direct question :
Who but criminals would treat signing statements as the law of the land ?
~D ) You have run roughshod over our civil liberties here at home , while touting Democracy abroad .
~ “ Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech , or of the press ” says our first amendment :
What about warrantless wiretapping ?
What of censoring and filtering the news media ?
What about gagging scientists from speaking up about global warming ?
What about gag orders in the National Security Letters part of the Patriot Act ?
~ The first amendment “ right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances ” is surely being violated by tasering peaceful protestors , by threatening to jail or forcibly remove impeachment button - wearing citizens from Congressional offices , and jailing those who rightfully tell Condi Rice that she “ has blood on her hands ” .
~ “ The right of all persons ” ---- not merely all citizens ----“ to be safe in their persons , houses , papers and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized ” states the fourth amendment .
~ Only Red China jails people without warrant or probable cause , as legislated into the Patriot Act which you , Congress , voted for by overwhelming majority not once , but twice .
What about CIA kidnappings and extraordinary renditions to countries overseas for torture ?
~ You know better than we , Congress , that Martin Luther King was wiretapped and shadowed by the FBI until he was finally murdered .
And that ’ s why laws prohibiting warrantless wiretapping were passed to begin with .
So for what exact purpose would you now vote for warrantless wiretapping , if not to shut vocal people up ?
~ Oh , lest you think I forgot , the claim that this assists the hunt for terrorists is bogus :
~ The Nazis tortured innocent people and called them “ The Enemy ” , as you have done with more than 850 Guantanamo detainees who have actually been proven innocent .
Yet you wo n’t let those innocent people go and you wo n’t close Guantanamo , despite torture being outlawed by US and International Law alike .
Of all forms of racial profiling , this has got to be the most heinous .

This coleslaw is FANTASTIC !
I was really skeptical when my friend Mary Sutherland sent me this recipe , since I ’ve never in my life bought instant Ramen noodles .
But Mary , who is an excellent cook , has been making it for years and said her daughters ( who are in college ) love it !
With a leap of faith , I purchased the ingredients and decided to give it a go .
( First , a note of caution : Instant Ramen noodles are most definitely not on the healthy end of the food chain .
On occasion this is a tasty splurge , but I would caution anyone against a regular diet of Ramen noodles . )
Coleslaw is a salad made with either red or white shredded cabbage as its base .
You can then add a variety of different vegetables like carrots , celery , onion , etc .
A mayonnaise or vinaigrette dressing binds everything together .
There are an infinite number of recipes available for every palate .
This is a very versatile recipe , as it can be eaten as a side dish , main dish , or just a snack .
There are five quick steps involved in making this recipe :
Make the dressing Toast the sliced almonds and the sesame seeds
Cut up the white part of four green onions
Mix together the coleslaw , noodles , almonds , sesame seeds and green onion .
Add the dressing and – that ’s it !
Be sure to buy the “ Chicken - flavor ” Ramen noodles .
To make things really simple , I purchased a pre-shredded bag of coleslaw mix ( which is available in many supermarkets . )
If you prefer , you can easily shred your own head of cabbage to make the coleslaw .
( Buy the white – not the red – cabbage for this recipe ! )
You will need approximately 6 - 8 cups of cabbage or coleslaw mix .
For those of you ( like me ! ) who have never purchased Ramen noodles , it is a small “ brick ” of dried noodles that comes with a flavor packet .
These noodles are not going to get cooked , but just broken up into the coleslaw .
They add an amazing crunch to this dish .
Make the dressing first .
You will need :
2 Tablespoons of sugar ( or sweetener such as Equal , Sweet & Low , or aspertame )
1/2 teaspoon of pepper
2 Tablespoons of red wine vinegar
1/2 cup of oil
chicken flavor packet from the Ramen noodles
You could use a bowl and a whisk to mix everything together , but it is easier to just put everything in jar … .
… and give it a good shake .
Set it aside until the coleslaw gets made .
You can buy already toasted sesame seeds or toast them yourself .
To toast sesame seeds , put them in a dry fry pan .
Set the temperature to medium high and do n’t walk away from the stove .
Keep the seeds moving in the pan by stirring them with a spoon or by shaking the pan .
It takes just a minute or two for the seeds to go from untoasted …
… to toasted …
… to burnt in the blink of an eye !
Once you start to smell the seeds toasting , they will only need a few more seconds to get nicely browned .
Toast the almonds the same way .
All toasted !
Wash four green onions and remove the green part .
Slice the white part into small circles .
Put the cabbage ( or coleslaw ) in a large bowl .
Add the almonds , green onions and sesame seeds .
With your hands , break up the ( uncooked ) Ramen noodles on top of the coleslaw .
Gently mix everything together .
Just before serving add the dressing …
… and gently toss the salad .
Serve the salad immediately .
If there are any leftovers , the Ramen noodles will eventually “ soften ” and the coleslaw will lose some of that crunchy texture .
This will easily make four large servings or 6 medium size servings .
Enjoy !

A day after Microsoft Corp. accidentally sent a patch to some users running the Windows Vista operating system , the company updated the preview release of Vista Service Pack 1 ( SP1 ) to a small group of testers , the company confirmed Thursday .
" Microsoft [ has ] released the latest prerelease build of SP1 , Windows Vista SP1 RC Refresh , to approximately 15,000 beta testers , " a spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
" This group includes corporate customers , consumer enthusiasts , software and hardware vendors , and others .
The code is not available for public download . "
Four weeks ago , Microsoft made Vista SP1 Release Candidate available to the general public for the first time .
The 15,000 testers , however , had earlier beta versions to work with , as well as this most recent update .
The company has slated Vista SP1 for final delivery this quarter , and on Thursday said it remained on track .
" We are still on schedule to deliver SP1 RTM in Q1 [ calendar year 2008 ] , " said the spokeswoman .
In a separate issue , though , the company Wednesday admitted a snafu in a Windows Vista update it issued Tuesday to prep PCs for the later release of SP1 .
The update , which is described in the support document KB935509 , was one of three prerequisites for SP1 unveiled Tuesday , and was supposed to end up only on Vista Enterprise and Vista Ultimate machines , since it targeted BitLocker , the full - drive encryption technology bundled with those premium versions of the operating system .
Instead , the update was also offered to PCs running Vista Home Basic and Home Premium .
" We had a small number of early customer reports , that in some cases , this update was being offered for installation on all Windows Vista editions versus just Ultimate and Enterprise , " said an anonymous poster on the Microsoft company blog devoted to the Windows Update development team .
" For systems set to download and install updates automatically , the update will not install even if it has already downloaded , so most people will not be affected by this , " the post continued .
" Customers who installed the initial release of the update on editions other than Ultimate or Enterprise should not be concerned as the update will have no negative impact on their systems . "
Although some users on Microsoft 's support forums wondered why they had seen the BitLocker patch when it did n't apply to their machines , no one running Home Basic or Home Premium had reported problems as of midday Thursday .
The remaining pair of prerequisites tweak Vista so that users will be able to roll back to the debut version of the operating system by uninstalling SP1 if they find that necessary .
This week 's glitch was the latest in a series of Windows Updates snafus that include the September revelation that , contrary to users ' instructions , Windows ' update code had updated itself on their PCs , and charges in October that the company 's OneCare security suite was also monkeying with users ' update settings .
Microsoft denied doing anything untoward with OneCare .

He was hired by Sergey Brin and Larry Page , Google 's founders , in the belief that like a Napoleonic army , an internet giant marches on its stomach .
As Google 's first chef , his mission was to seduce an unruly gaggle of brilliant but wayward computer engineers into wanting to stay at the office .
His success , he said , meant Google 's rise to the top was fuelled by free beer , barbecues and rum .
It began in 1998 , when Page and Brin started Google in a friend 's garage near Stanford University in California .
A few months later , they recruited Ayers .
" They said : ' We are not going to charge for food here , ever . '
" I said : ' That 's crazy . '
They explained my job was to create this ambience , to build this captivated audience where people wanted to come in super - early and stay super - late .
" They interviewed me above a bicycle shop .
They thought they were going to go global .
I thought ' Good luck . '
The way they were playing with children 's toys , riding around on scooters , I had no idea they were doing any work . "
He signed up , however , and started easing the computer engineers into the long hours culture with innovations including free beer and fortnightly " big-ass " barbecues .
To introduce computer experts fresh out of university to early mornings , he developed breakfast specials , such as " French toast with coconut , macadamia and rum " .
The rum , beer and barbecues provided perfect cover for converting the " googlers " to a diet that ensured they kept working after lunch , weaning them off pizzas and on to salads .
As explained in his new book , Eat Yourself Smart , his faith in the profit - making power of raw food extended to generous offerings of sushi .
" The fat found in fish helps make the cell membranes round the brain more elastic and more able to absorb nutrients easily . "
His kitchen empire grew to five chefs , 75 dishwashers , and 150 cooks , serving up to 7000 meals a day to the staff of 5000 at the 280,000 - square - metre " Googleplex " — the HQ in Mountain View , California .
Ayers would fly in more than 200 kilograms of live lobsters for " Lobster Boil Day " .
The Googleplex houses a pool table , a gaming arcade , two swimming pools and a beach volleyball court — complete with sand .
" I still wonder how the work gets done , " says Ayers .
But Google enjoys $ A4.6 billion annual profits .
Brin and Page are now billionaires at the age of just 34 .
Ayers bought a $ A1.5 million house with a fraction of his reputed $ A28.8 million of Google shares .
He was deemed so important that , after he left in May 2005 , the food court was renamed Charlie's .
The free food was , he says , part of a strategy that helped Brin and Page steer Google through the great dotcom crash of 2001 .
TELEGRAPH
Former Giants slugger Barry Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2000 , the year before he set baseball 's single - season home run record , federal prosecutors said Thursday .
In documents filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , the government provided new details on its claim that baseball 's home run king had failed multiple tests for banned drugs and then lied about it to the grand jury investigating the BALCO steroids scandal .
In November , when Bonds was indicted on five counts of perjury and obstruction of justice , the government first claimed that investigators had seized " positive tests " for Bonds in their probe of BALCO but gave no specifics .
The explanation is contained in the documents filed Thursday in connection with Bonds ' upcoming trial on perjury charges .
Bonds has pleaded not guilty , and in his 2003 grand jury testimony repeatedly denied ever using banned drugs .
Major League Baseball did n't begin steroid testing until 2003 .
A source familiar with the case previously disclosed that Victor Conte , founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative in Burlingame , had arranged for private steroid tests for Bonds to test the results of his BALCO drug regimen .
Federal agents seized a trove of documents regarding banned drug use in 2003 raids on BALCO and on the Burlingame home of Greg Anderson , Bonds ' trainer , court records show .
In the filing , the government said that at trial it would produce evidence showing that Anderson provided Bonds with steroids before a positive test dated November 2000 .
The test report , marked " Barry B , " showed positive results for two anabolic steroids , the government said .
In 2000 , Bonds , then age 35 , batted .306 with 49 home runs .
The following year he hit 73 home runs , surpassing the single - season mark of 70 set by St. Louis Cardinal slugger Mark McGwire in 1998 .
Both sluggers have been the focus of steroid allegations .
The government made the disclosures in a motion asking Judge Susan Illston to allow the five - count indictment to go to trial as handed up .
Last month , Bonds ' legal team had asked the judge to dismiss parts of the indictment and pare back others , arguing that prosecutors had asked Bonds " fundamentally ambiguous " questions when he testified before the grand jury .
But the government said Bonds clearly understood the import of the prosecutor 's questions .
" Bonds denied that he ever knowingly took steroids provided by Anderson , " the government wrote in the filing .
At trial , prosecutors said , the government 's evidence will show that Bonds received steroids from Anderson in the period before the November 2000 positive drug test .
The matter is set for a hearing Feb. 29 .
But , as you 'll see , the hypothesis does not hold up well to the data .
( Q : " What 's the difference between a blogger and a pundit ? "
A : " One tests their ideas against the data , the other tests the data against their ideas . " )
That is , it is not entirely true -- Obama 's performance in a state is probably explained better by geography , by timing , and by whether it is a caucus or primary state , than it is by how red or blue the state is -- but , as you 'll see , it 's not entirely false either .
This post begins with a hypothesis : that Obama 's wins have been bigger in red states than in blue states .
It was based on the recollection that Clinton had fared best in the northeast and California , including the Big Blue threesome ( CA , MA , NY ) while Obama had been sweeping the south and west .
If true , it seemed to challenge the conventional wisdom that one must run left in a Democratic primary to win , and the perception that Clinton is the more centrist candidate .
If true , it might also bring interest to how the coin will fall in the remaining Big Blue states , Vermont and Rhode Island , whose March 4 primaries are otherwise overshadowed by the more delegate - rich contests in Texas and Ohio .
What you 're looking at is a scatter plot in which each state ( plus DC ) that has already held its primary or caucus is represented by a dot .
The dot 's position on the X axis ( " Bush - Kerry " ) shows what Kerry 's percent margin of victory was in that state , and its position on the Y axis ( " Obama - Clinton " ) shows what Clinton 's percent margin of victory was in that state .
( Undoubtedly , someone will complain that Kerry should be on the left or Obama should be on the top .
Whatever . )
So , the reddest of the red states are on the left , and the bluest of the blues are on the right .
I expected Clinton and Obama 's " home states " -- AR and NY for Clinton , HI and IL for Obama -- to vote strongly for their daughter and son , regardless of national trends , so I put each in a special color and I recommend ignoring them .
I 've labeled some of the other dots to highlight the states that sometimes have a strong opinion -- the ones that went by large margins for any one of Bush , Kerry , Clinton , or Obama .
( The chart data I used came from electoral - vote.com ( 2004 data , 2008 data from the main page 's map ) .
The data I used can be downloaded as a comma-separated list you can open in your favorite spreadsheet program by clicking here . )
There are a few ways to read the chart .
The first , and easiest , is to imagine a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right , and ask yourself if you think the dots fall along that line .
If they do , it would suggest that Obama 's success in a given state can be explained , at least partly , by how red the state is .
Next , imagine a line from the top left to the bottom right and ask yourself the same question .
If the dots fall along that line , it means that you think Obama 's success can be explained , at least partly , by how blue a state is .
To my eye , there is a weak trend for the black dots to fall along the lower - left to upper - right line , but it is thrown off quite a bit by OK , TN , UT , and DC .
( As an aside , yes , one could use statistics to make this argument more rigorously .
Personally , my approach to data is first to ask how it looks and then to try to quantify those perceptions using statistics -- because no matter what arguments I find I can make using statistics , if they do n't look qualitatively right to my eye , I do n't really believe in them .
That said , the black dots in the chart above fit a terrible linear regression with an r-squared of less than .01 , but if you let me remove OK , TN , UT and DC -- for no good reason other than that they 're screwing up my fit -- then you get a reasonable linear regression that can be expressed as " Clinton = .8 x Kerry - 13 " , with an r-squared of .4 , which is to say that if you figure that Clinton gets about 80 percent of the Kerry voters and then loses 13 points overall to Obamania , you 'll be able to explain about 40 percent of the variation in the state - to - state vote totals so far .
The important points here are that the slope of the regression line , .8 , is positive and close to 1 , consistent with my eyeball take that Clinton tends to do better in bluer states ( although often that just means " loses by less " ) , and that the r-squared value , .4 , is midrange between 0 ( no correlation ) and 1 ( perfect correlation ) , consistent with my take that the fit is ok but not spectacular .
And , for what it 's worth , my impressions were not written post hoc -- I ran the regressions after writing the above paragraph about how the chart looked to me qualitatively . )
Another way to look at the data is to take only the extreme outliers .
For example , where Kerry had his biggest wins ( the bluest blue states ) , how did Clinton do ?
Kerry 's biggest wins were , in order , DC , MA , RI , VT , NY , MD , CA , CT , and IL .
He beat Bush by 10 points or more in each of those states .
Of those states , we 're ignoring the candidates ' home states of NY and IL , and RI and VT have yet to vote .
That leaves five contests : DC , MA , MD , CA , and CT .
Of those , Obama had a blow - out in DC which may be explained partly by racial demographics , Clinton had some of her most solid wins in MA and CA , and they nearly split CT ( it was Obama 's second - smallest win , after MO ) .
But what about MD ?
It was solidly pro-Kerry , and now it 's solidly pro-Obama .
Perhaps racial demographics again come into play .
Perhaps it 's the timing of the primary ( it went Feb 12 , a week after Obama 's Super Tuesday victories ) .
The point is , the perception that Clinton did better in blue states is often true -- but demographics , geography , and timing can trump it .
How about Bush 's biggest winners ?
Reading the chart from left to right , you can see that Bush 's second - biggest win , ID , was Obama 's biggest blowout .
Bush 's third biggest win , NE , was also among Obama 's best performances , as were Bush 's # 5 and # 6 , AK and KS .
But Bush 's # 4 state , OK , was Clinton 's biggest win after her home state of AR , and his # 1 state , UT , was much closer than a simple " red staters like Obama " model would have predicted .
Who has won " the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party " ?
The phrase was popularized by Howard Dean during his 2004 campaign , and it's a reference to his opponents at the time who , he argued , were running as " Bush Lite . "
Making a strong stand to represent traditional Democratic principles of a balanced budget , tolerance and open - mindedness , and a government dedicated to the public good , Dean sought to contrast himself with centrist candidates in the field .
As Democrats often do in a primary , he ran left -- but , startlingly for many of us , he lost .
Of the two Democratic candidates left in the race today , Obama may draw the more obvious comparison to Dean .
He is running as an outsider , who wants to change the tone of politics in Washington ( although , for that matter , Obama is equally echoing George W. Bush 's " reformer with results " outsider campaign from 2000 ) .
Obama , like Dean , is turning young people into activists and provoking their passions on a scale rarely encountered in politics .
Yet , as I 've shown above , he is certainly not performing best in the states that are the strongholds for the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party .
Although he is winning many of them , and geography and timing may be better explanatory factors than the state 's blueness , Obama is doing better in red states while Clinton is outperforming ( at least , losing by less ) in blue states .
How can this be ?
One explanation is that Clinton is the establishment candidate , and the solidly blue states are the states where the Democratic establishment is strongest -- that she 's not the favorite of progressives , she 's the favorite of party faithful .
But perhaps another explanation is that Clinton really is the more progressive candidate .
Do n't look at the win , look at the margin of victory
Another lesson here is that the widely - reported numbers about who has " won " more primaries are , in fact , fairly meaningless .
They may be hold - overs from the organized media 's comfortable method of reporting general election results , but in primaries where delegates are apportioned proportionally -- and , per DNC rules , all Democratic primaries are run that way -- it 's the size of the victory that counts .
Whether Obama won MO 49 - 48 or lost it 48 - 49 does n't matter : it will hardly affect the delegate count .
And , as I think the chart above shows , the most useful information is often in the states where a candidate won by 10 points or more .
To lump together Obama 's 4 - point win in CT and his 63 - point win in ID is to disregard common sense , and to throw away useful information .
Taking into account the size of the victories also allows one to test ideas about why a candidate has won , as I 've done here , and to try to use those ideas to make quantitative predictions .
If you take at face value the model that " Clinton = .8 x Kerry - 13 " then you can predict the following for March 4 :
TX : Obama 65 Clinton 34
OH : Obama 57 Clinton 43
VT : Clinton 52 Obama 48
RI : Clinton 52 Obama 48
and , for the week after ,
WY : Obama 73 Clinton 27
MS : Obama 65 Clinton 35
While all eyes remain on TX and OH , it will be worth keeping tuned in to VT and RI as indicators of whether the idea that Clinton does better with the true - blue Democratic left holds water .
There really are states that " do n't matter "
The Clinton campaign has been castigated for referring to states she has lost as states that did n't really matter anyway .
And they 've somewhat deserved it , because it stinks of sour grapes and a loss of message discipline .
But , as the chart above subtly shows , they have something of a point .
One of the more obvious features of the chart is that there are a LOT more points on the bottom than the top -- Obama has simply racked up many more wins .
But just as obvious is that there are even MORE also more points on the left than the right -- Bush won a far greater fraction of states than Kerry did .
Yet that election was close enough that a few diehards still insist Kerry won it , and most of us spent a great deal of election day morning expecting that to be true .
The cold electoral fact is that many of those dots just do n't matter much .
You can sweep the western bloc of ID , MT , WY , ND , and SD and still get only 16 electoral votes , where if you had just taken NJ you 'd have gotten 15 .
In fact , to become president , all you need to do is win 11 states ( NJ , NC , MI , OH , IL , PA , FL , NY , TX , GA and CA ) .
The other 39 states would n't matter .
In fact , Gore won only 20 states , Kerry only 19 .
Saying that some states do n't matter is terrible politics -- it 's rude , it 's undemocratic , it 's poor sportsmanship .
( It also stupidly ignores the importance of bringing one 's coattails to Senate , House , and local races . )
But , as is implicit in the chart above , it 's not just how many states you win , but if you 're able to win the ones that " matter . "
Summary
Obama has won the ones that matter .
He has also won blue states .
But his margin of victory has been bigger in states that are smaller and redder -- he has performed best where Kerry performed worst .
That should give us great hope for the prospect of having Obama as the nominee heading into November .
It may also give us pause about whether he represents the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party -- and whether , if he did , he would perform as well as he has .
I 'd like to acknowledge the tremendous help that it was to have the electoral - vote.com databases available during the writing of this post .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
" Civilizations die from suicide , not by murder , " said Arnold Toynbee , whose 12 - volume " Study of History " traces the rise and fall of civilizations .
Get it ?
The " fall " is an " inside job . "
Attitudes , behavior and values die first .
The soul is left for dead .
Oh , some outside force may push the button , pull the trigger or , as in ritualistic hara - kiri , some stranger may bring the sword down upon our neck .
But we set the ball in motion .
We create the world around us , including our enemies , as individuals and as nations -- we are totally responsible for our karma , our fate , our destiny , our demise .
" Suicide , not murder : " Toynbee 's chilling warning came to mind as I read recent reports of three dangerous economic trends , all tied directly to America 's addiction to drugs and how they are destroying us from within , rendering our borders vulnerable , giving our enemies billions to buy weapons and attack us from without .
These three reports highlight threats far more ominous than any threats from terrorists , nuclear war , energy shortages , entitlement failures , global warming or government deficits , as bad as they all are .
Why ?
Because we are creating an inner world that is far darker , far more lethal .
The reports cover these three areas :
" The lost War on Drugs . "
America 's failed 30 - year " War on Drugs " that 's now sabotaging our " War on Terror . "
" Weakening defenses . "
America 's leaky borders that expose us not just to terrorists but openly invite transnational drug syndicates , mobsters , criminals .
" Prescription addiction . "
America 's out - of - control addiction to prescription drugs , with Big Pharma as the main pusher .
The three trends have been exposed in recent media reports as three separate trends with significant economic impact .
However , they are very much linked together in the inner workings of the American soul .
So why does the media treat them separately ?
Very simple :
The media ( like people in general ) is also trapped in America 's ubiquitous state of denial , denial of a disease so cunning and powerful that most Americans refuse see the underlying malaise , either as individuals or as a nation : Noted psychotherapist Anne Wilson Schaef aptly describes America as a " Nation of Addicts . "
Once " in " the disease we can no longer see ourselves objectively , we become zombies , like pod people in " The Invasion of the Body Snatchers . "
The burden of addiction
For the record , I researched the addictive brain for years .
A couple decades ago I took time out of the business world and worked professionally helping addicts , alcoholics and their families deal with their problems .
A few hundred of them went through the Betty Ford Center , including executives , doctors , royalty , rock stars , actors , government officials , professional athletes and others celebrities .
I traveled nationwide and overseas to do interventions .
Behind the insanity I saw painful self - destructive behavior : Throwing away hundred - million - dollar careers , successful businesses , mansions , beautiful families , destroying health , killing people , going to prisons , dying horrible deaths .
Once in their private hell , nothing matters .
Many , like my parents , never make it out , they become trapped , blind to the havoc they leave in their wake .
I 'm lucky , in recovery now 34 years .
So yes , I am biased : as a journalist what I see and write about is admittedly affected by my experience .
That I can't deny .
The fact is that 12 % of Americans , roughly 36 million , are chemically dependent , addicts or alcoholics .
But worse yet , their self - destructive behavior has a huge negative impact on another 100 million or more Americans , their children , spouses , parents , loved ones , friends , co-workers ... their accident victims .
Moreover , the burden on the American economy is staggering , hundreds of billions .
That 's why these three reports hit me square in the face .
They are disturbing enough each by itself .
But taken together it's like watching an NFL quarterback being hit by three blitzing 300 - pound tackles , simultaneously .
Thud , whack , crack !
1. America's ' Lost War on Drugs '
Today America 's 30 - year " War on Drugs " is a miserable failure .
But worse yet , it 's now undermining our " War on Terror . "
In its latest issue , Foreign Policy magazine released the " Third Terrorist Index , " based on the collective opinions of 100 experts .
It concluded that " instead of treating the demand for illegal drugs as a market , and addicts as patients , policymakers the world over [ including the Pentagon ] have boosted the profits of drug lords and fostered narcostates that would frightened Al Capone . "
Afghanistan is one example .
According to the United Nations ' Office on Drugs and Crime , Afghanistan now supplies 95 % of the world 's poppy crop and opium production .
According to the BBC News , it has " soared to frightening record levels , " largely because we took our eye off the Taliban and marginalized Afghanistan to attack Iraq .
Illegal narcotics traffic from Afghan 's cash crop exploded 57 % in 2006 .
Our politicians and our military are virtually helpless to stop this expanding contagion that matches America 's addiction for illegal drugs ( demand ) with the entrepreneurial spirit of Afghan farmers , politicians , war lords and the Taliban ( supply ) .
America has had a " War on Drugs " since the Nixon administration , based on prohibition and criminalizing drugs .
That policy has drained hundreds of billions from our economy , driven drug traffic underground , and raised the price on a commodity that otherwise would cost pennies .
Domestically and internationally our " War on Drugs " policies are not only a dismal failure , they produce the exact opposite result .
Worse yet , our failed drug policies are sabotaging our " War on Terror " in Afghanistan .
As the Washington Post reported , " The drug war has become the Taliban 's most effective recruiter in Afghanistan , " reinvigorating Muslim extremists .
Thanks to our obstinate adherence to failed drug policies plus minimal alternatives for Afghan farmers , we are playing into the Taliban 's hand and they 're " becoming richer and stronger by the day . "
2. America's ' weakening defenses '
America 's leaky borders expose us not just to terrorists , but also to international drug mobsters , cartels and war lords .
The Post 's Misha Glenny has been " traveling the world researching a book on the jaw - dropping rise of international organized crime " in recent years .
" The problem starts with prohibition , the basis of the war on drugs , " says Glenny .
" The theory is that if you hurt the producer and consumers of drugs badly enough , they 'll stop doing what they 're doing .
But instead , the trade just goes underground , " into a " shadow economy " where " the state 's only contact is through law enforcement . "
Moreover , the American drug economy offers such lucrative payoffs , involving huge margins on a turnover of $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion sales annually , that the criminals simple do n't care if they lose a $ 1 million investment now and then in police raids , because billions do get through our open borders , both north and south .
At the same time the " expansion of world trade and financial market has provided criminals ample opportunity to broaden their activities , " with no comparable increase in police to deal with this surge .
So one of the consequences of our failed " War on Drugs " is that while " international mobsters , unlike terrorists , do n't seek to bring down the West ; they just want to make a buck ... these two distinct species breed in the same swamps " conspiring against American police , military and political policies .
3. America's ' prescription addictions '
In addition to the illicit drugs , prescription drugs are also rapidly becoming a favorite for America 's addicts .
Do n't get me wrong , Americans may be " living in a world of pain and they are popping pills at an alarming rate to cope with it " for legitimate reasons , but the truth is , medical doctors and drug companies indulge our weaknesses , like the Taliban .
Recently the Associated Press analyzed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data .
The news agency concluded that : " More people are abusing prescription painkillers because more are available , " and while doctors are " spooked " by high - profile celebrity arrests , patients have become more and more enterprising and driving greater distances to find known " pill mills " that " dispense prescription medications without verification . "
Another reason America 's prescription addiction is exploding ; Big Pharma 's ratio of two reps for every five docs , plus relentless advertising .
Between 1997 and 2005 drug company ad costs nearly tripled from $ 11 billion to $ 30 billion , while the " amount of five major painkillers sold in the nation 's stores nearly doubled , an alarming trend . "
Yes folks , " civilizations do die by suicide , not murder . "
First death within ... perhaps a failed " War on Drugs " policy backfires ... addicts indulge , multiply ... our enemies get the money ... then complete the ritualistic hari - kari for us ... and another civilization falls .
Rafik Hariri was killed using a lorry full of explosives A UN commission investigating the death of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri says the evidence suggests a network of people was responsible for the attack .
No individuals were named , but the investigators said what it called the " Hariri Network " might also be behind other deadly attacks in Lebanon .
The ex-PM and 22 others died in a huge car bombing in Beirut in February 2005 .
Past UN inquiries suggested that Syrian and Lebanese intelligence forces had played a role - which Syria denied .
The commission said the evidence indicated that the network existed before his assassination and carried out surveillance of the former prime minister .
This implies more clearly the direction of the inquiry ...
The iceberg is slowly melting
Marwan Hmadeh ,
Communications Minister
Mixed reception in Lebanon
It said at least part of the network continued to operate after Mr Hariri 's killing .
Lebanon has been in crisis and without a president for months , amid a drawn - out power struggle between the pro- and anti-Syrian factions .
Progress
This was the 10th report to be issued by the commission , but the first since Canadian prosecutor Daniel Bellemare took charge of the panel from Belgium 's Serge Brammertz at the beginning of this year .

The report says it can now confirm " on the basis of available evidence , that a network of individuals acted in concert to carry out the assassination ... and that this criminal network - the ' Hariri Network ' - or parts thereof are linked to some of the other cases within the commission 's mandate " .
It does not say whether the group was politically motivated .
But it says progress is being made in identifying both the suicide bomber who killed Mr Hariri and the individuals who belonged to the network which plotted the killing .
It says it has received close co-operation from Lebanese authorities , and " generally satisfactory " co-operation from Syria - a country which continues to deny official involvement in the Hariri killing .
HAVE YOUR SAY
But did the criminal network have political motives ?
Andy Roberts , UK
However , the report identifies some problems hampering the investigation - including the " deteriorating " security situation in Lebanon , and a lack of resources from the UN itself .
The commission is using forensic information and DNA profiling in its investigation .
The UN is currently setting up a tribunal which it is hoped will try those suspected of Mr Hariri 's murder .
Complex politics
As well as being a dominant figure in Lebanese politics in the period after the civil war ended in 1990 , Mr Hariri was also a business tycoon .
A self - made billionaire , he was among the richest individuals in the world .
Mr Hariri's death triggered huge demonstrations in Lebanon against the Syrians .
Despite its denial of involvement , Damascus eventually bowed to international pressure , pulling out its troops after nearly 30 years of military presence .
Investigators have previously pointed to links between Mr Hariri 's death and many other attacks in Lebanon since 2004 .
Analysts say Lebanon is the most politically complex and religiously divided country in the Middle East .

What are these ?
Samina Malik became the first woman convicted under new terrorism legislation after writing poems entitled How To Behead and The Living Martyrs .
Malik , described as an " unlikely but committed " Islamic extremist , was last month convicted by an jury at the Old Bailey of a charge under the 2000 Terrorism Act .
She worked at WH Smith at Heathrow , where she scribbled her extremist lyrics on till receipts .
On one she wrote : " The desire within me increases every day to go for martyrdom . "
But Malik told the jury she only adopted her " lyrical terrorist " nickname because she thought it was " cool " and insisted : " I am not a terrorist . "
Malik had tears in her eyes as she left the dock , while her mother wept during the court hearing .
The judge said Malik 's crime was on the " margins " of the offence of which she was found guilty .
He said Malik was of " good character " and from a " supportive and law - abiding family who are appalled by the trouble that you are in " .
" The Terrorism Act and the restrictions it imposes on the personal freedom exist to protect this country , its interests here and abroad , its citizens , and those who visit here .
Its protection embraces us all .
Its restrictions apply to us all , whatever our personal religious or political beliefs . "
He told Malik that if she had been convicted of the more serious charge of possessing an article for terrorist purposes - of which the jury cleared her - she would have faced a jail term .
But he said , while a custodial sentence was merited , she had already faced " extremely rigorous " bail conditions which were " tantamount to house arrest " .
The court heard that she also spent five months in custody after being arrested in October last year .
Malik 's sentence was suspended for 18 months , with the condition that she be supervised for the whole period and undertake unpaid work .
Outside court Malik 's solicitor Iqbal Ahmed read out a statement on her behalf .
He said : " The trial process has been a terrible ordeal for her and she is now relieved that it is all over .
The jury found that she did not have the material for terrorist purposes which was an important part of her case .
She now wants to get on with her life . "
Last month , Malik was found guilty of possessing records likely to be useful in terrorism by a majority of 10 to one .
She cried as the verdict was read .
Two female jurors were also in tears .
The court heard that Malik stocked a " library " of material useful to terrorists at her family home in Southall , west London .
The court was told Malik was 20 years old when she " first started to consider Islam " and was " like most teenagers , somewhat rebellious " .
Malik had been interested in poetry , and had written love poems , followed by rap poems and later by " what can only be described as the distasteful poetry which has been mentioned in this trial " .
John Burton , defending , said : " She became hooked on Abu Hamza - type addresses and that affected her mindset . "
The jury was told that she joined an extremist organisation called Jihad Way , set up explicitly to spread terrorist propaganda and support for al Qaida .
Jonathan Sharp , prosecuting , told the court she visited a website linked to the jailed cleric Abu Hamza and stored material about weapons .
The court also heard Malik belonged to a social networking website called hi5 , describing her interests as " helping the mujaheddin in any way which I can " .
Under favourite TV shows , she listed : " Watching videos by my Muslim brothers in Iraq , yep the beheading ones , watching video messages by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahri and other videos which show massacres of the kaffirs . " removed
After her conviction , Judge Peter Beaumont , the recorder of London , told her : " You have been , in many respects , a complete enigma to me . "
A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the decision by the judge to suspend the sentence .
Inayat Bunglawala said : " It always seemed a rather bizarre decision to prosecute Samina when she is clearly not an actual terror plotter .
" Samina Malik was being prosecuted in effect for a thought crime because she had downloaded some material from the internet which anyone could download . "
Mr Bunglawala said the case demonstrated how ill - conceived and " incredibly broad - ranging " the law is under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act .
" Teenagers download some quite nihilistic material every day and they are not prosecuted , " he said .
" The fact that this case went to court sends a very worrying signal that if you are Muslim and you are downloading from the Internet you may be judged to a quite different standard from others .
Fortunately the judge has been sensible about this .
The wider Muslim community must be relieved that she has n't got a custodial sentence . "
In a statement , the Crown Prosecution Service said : " Samina Malik was not prosecuted for writing poetry .
Ms Malik was convicted of collecting information , without reasonable excuse , of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism . "
Hamish Campbell has a close encounter on the sea floor
Scientists with the British Antarctic Survey ( Bas ) found Notothenia coriiceps lowers its metabolic rate during winter , saving energy .
As with hibernating mammals , the fish rouse themselves now and again from their dormant state for short periods .
Researchers suspect the " hibernation " is triggered by changes in sunlight .
The sea temperature varies by only about 2C between summer and winter , which is probably too small a difference to induce such a significant change in behaviour .
Fish are generally incapable of suppressing their metabolic rate independently of temperature
Dr Hamish Campbell
" It appears the fish utilise the short Antarctic summers to gain sufficient energy from feeding to tide them over in winter , " said Keiron Fraser from Bas .
" The hibernation - like state ... is presumably a mechanism for reducing their energy requirements to the bare minimum .
" The interesting question we still have to answer is why these fish greatly reduce feeding in winter when food is still available . "
Slowing down
The research team caught their Antarctic cod - not a true member of the cod family - and fitted them with acoustic transmitters , which meant they could be tracked using hydrophones , and re-caught later .
A smaller number of fish were fitted with heart - rate monitors and kept in sea cages .
The main conclusion was that they showed a significant set of physiological changes with the onset of winter .
Their overall metabolic rate and growth both declined by a factor of five .
They lived within a much smaller area , and swam shorter distances each day , travelling about 20 times less far .
The finding , reported in the journal Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) One , came as something as a surprise .
" Fish are generally incapable of suppressing their metabolic rate independently of temperature , " observed Hamish Campbell , who led the study from the University of Birmingham .
" Winter dormancy in fish is typically directly proportional to decreasing water temperatures .
" The interesting thing about these Antarctic cod is that their metabolic rates are reduced in winter , even though the seawater temperature does n't decrease much . "
Shaker " Fair and Balanced " Dave , who emailed me about this story , says , " [ A ] pparently if you 're a professional football player , domestic abuse is OK if you do it for Jesus , " and Vanessa at Feministing , who blogged the story over there , also notes the " good Christian " excuse .
Quite obviously , that was part of the calculation when the Steelers organization considered " each incident … on a case - by - case basis , " but what 's also notable is that the man who was released from his contract assaulted his ex-girlfriend , while the man who was retained on the team assaulted his current girlfriend — and undoubtedly the still - pervasive attitude that domestic violence is " between a man and his woman " affected the decision .
As long as she stays with him , as long as she 's willing to suffer the abuse , that 's " their " business .
The ex-girlfriend , by virtue of her " ex " status , no longer belonged to Wilson , so it 's easy to see why his hitting her was wrong .
But things are always muddier , somehow , when it 's a current girlfriend or wife , which signifies our collective belief that men still have some ownership of women with whom they 're in a relationship , and therefore have more right to do ugly things to them than men who do n't have any claim over them .
We mask that belief with mumbled questions about " why she stays if she does n't like it , " pathetically substituting the inevitably compromised agency of a battered woman for an objectively principled stand against domestic violence , as if that 's remotely reasonable .
Of course it is not — but justifications for situations like this are thin on the ground .
As well they should be .
Perhaps you 'd like to politely email the Steelers or call their administrative offices at 412.432.7800 to let them know that condoning domestic violence for any reason is not acceptable .

in 2004 , when an American missile fired from a Predator drone killed Taliban leader Nek Mohammed , an observer told a journalist that the bombing was so exact it “ did n’t damage any of the buildings around the lawn where Mohammed was seated . ”
It was an endorsement , if ever there was one , of the Bush administration ’s post - 9/11 efforts at assassinations using what are known as decapitation attacks .
The practice , which is shrouded under a veil of intense secrecy , is generally regarded as warfare ’s answer to laser surgery : clean and accurate , cheaper than waging a protracted ground battle , and less risky for American troops .
But in reality , these premeditated and narrowly focused air bombings often fail to kill their intended foe and hit civilians instead .
“ It ’s much more difficult to hunt people with a 2,000 - pound bomb than people realize , ” says Marc Garlasco , who until 2003 was one of the Pentagon ’s leading analysts of air strikes , including assassinations .
During the invasion of Iraq , Garlasco ’s job was to analyze targets with an eye toward minimizing collateral damage using a software program called Bugsplat .
Days after Baghdad fell , Garlasco , intent on examining firsthand the military ’s success or failure in sparing civilians , accepted a position with Human Rights Watch ( hrw ) and traveled to Iraq to do just that .
Among the sites he studied was a Basra neighborhood where the United States dropped bombs meant for Lt. General Ali Hassan al - Majid — nicknamed Chemical Ali because of his role in gassing tens of thousands of Kurds .
Garlasco had watched the bull ’s - eye attack live on video transmitted from a Predator drone .
“ We cheered when the bomb went in , ” he says .
But Chemical Ali survived , and witnesses told Garlasco that they ’d never seen him in the targeted location .
As part of his investigation for hrw , the analyst met a 50 - year - old laborer whose home was destroyed in the attack , killing seven family members .
He found that 10 neighbors had also died .
“ When I stood in the crater and I was talking to the survivors , ” Garlasco says , “ it was n’t so cool anymore . ”
Assassinations by air are a relatively new tactic in warfare .
Only in the past quarter century has the United States developed munitions accurate enough to attempt a surgical strike against a target as small and mobile as a person .
“ Fire and forget ” laser - guided Hellfire missiles were first used by the American military in Panama in 1989 ; jdams , or guidance kits that convert regular bombs to smart bombs , were n’t employed until 1999 during the nato bombing of Yugoslavia ; armed MQ - 1 Predator drones came online in 2002 as part of Operation Southern Watch in Iraq .
And of course , recent decades have brought dramatic advances in computer , satellite , and GPS technologies .
In the past , legal restrictions also prevented decapitation attacks .
Since 1976 , when it was revealed that the cia had made repeated attempts on the life of Fidel Castro , every American president has issued an executive order banning political assassinations .
This ban , however , never applied to leaders with whom the United States is at war , and so the military has launched strikes against Saddam Hussein , Slobodan Milosevic , and Osama bin Laden , among others .
In his first speech after 9/11 , President Bush promised to hit terrorists with “ dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations secret even in success . ”
Since then , the administration has argued that the war on terror ’s battlefield is global , and it has expanded decapitation strikes accordingly — aiming them at targets across the Muslim world .
virtually all aspects of the assassination program are classified , and so information about it has emerged only in bits and pieces .
In January 2006 , the Los Angeles Times reported that unnamed officials had confirmed that Predator drones bearing Hellfire missiles — the preferred weapon in decapitation bombings — had hit “ terrorist suspects overseas ” at least 19 times since 9/11 .
“ The Predator strikes have killed at least four senior Al Qaeda leaders , ” according to the Times sources , “ but also many civilians , and it is not known how many times they missed their targets . ”
There have been media accounts of at least nine other such strikes in Pakistan , Yemen , and Somalia , where members of Al Qaeda are thought to be hiding .
Dozens more have been conducted in Afghanistan , according to William M. Arkin , a military expert and author of the Washington Post ‘s Early Warning blog .
In Iraq , the military claims , more than 200 Al Qaeda operatives have been eliminated by air strikes , be they targeted killings or broader - based attacks .
“ The sense in the military and in Washington , D.C. , is that U.S. efforts to hunt Al Qaeda are succeeding , ” says Congressman Adam Smith ( D - Wash . ) , the chair of the House subcommittee responsible for unconventional warfare and special operations .
“ Most people understand that there are risks — of collateral damage or [ retaliation ] . ”
The upside , he says , is the degree to which targeted bombings disrupt Al Qaeda ’s operations .
“ They ca n’t just pick up the phone .
They ca n’t do a wire transfer without thinking , ‘ Is this going to be something that they ’re going to pick up on ? ’
There have been a number of these guys just walking down the street , and BOOM !
They did n’t know we knew them , and we wiped them out .
That puts Al Qaeda ’s supporters back on their heels . ”
Or , as a U.S. diplomat who requested anonymity put it , “ Aside from the fact that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars per head chasing high - value terrorists , I think it ’s good for these guys to know they ’ll be hunted forever .
It ’ll make people think twice about committing terror against the U.S. ”
Bravado aside , of course , the fact remains that “ bringing a Hellfire missile onto a house in a remote village of a remote country is an incredibly laborious and expensive operation , ” as Arkin puts it .
Intelligence is generally limited ; the military may be working from a blurry photo or composite drawing .
In 2001 , U.S. officials mistook a convoy of elders headed for Afghan president Hamid Karzai ’s inauguration for a Taliban group and bombed it , reportedly killing some 20 civilians .
In Iraq , U.S. warplanes tried to hit Saddam and his deputies based on their sat - phone signals , though these only pinpoint a phone to within about a city block .
hrw found that not a single air strike aimed at Saddam ’s henchmen during the invasion achieved its objective , and instead , dozens of civilians were killed .
The “ complete lack of success and the significant civilian losses ” showed a disregard for civilian casualties , in violation of the laws of war , the organization concluded .
Despite advances in technology , planning targeted bombings depends on gathering reliable human intelligence , notes retired Colonel Tex DeAtkine , a Middle East expert who trained Special Operations Forces for more than 18 years .
“ You just do n’t get brothers , uncles , and nephews to rat on each other , ” he says .
The United States may get false tips from informants looking to eliminate local rivals .
When a promising tip is obtained , it can take days or even weeks to verify and act upon — and targets rarely stay put that long .
In 2006 , an attempt to kill Ayman al - Zawahiri in Pakistan instead killed 18 civilians .
Later , intelligence revealed that the Al Qaeda deputy had moved to a new location two hours before the bomb detonated .
The military is working to reduce collateral damage , for example by more often conducting “ pattern of life analyses ” before launching strikes .
This may involve gathering information from satellites and also from operatives who secretly track the daily patterns of intended targets , at least in places where they are safe enough on the ground to do so .
But here there is a catch - 22 : Civilian deaths breed so much ill will , they make it harder to gather the very kind of intelligence needed to better target future attacks .
“ Let ’s say you have dropped a bomb and killed four terrorists on the first floor , but on the second floor you wipe out the grandchildren of the senior tribal sheikh , ” explains retired Colonel T.X. Hammes , a Marine Corps counterinsurgency expert .
“ Then you ’ve actually created a problem . ”
essentially carried out by remote control , targeted killings evoke novel human rights questions .
Without soldiers on the ground to make moment - by - moment evaluations , the burden of complying with the laws of war would appear to reside with commanders or intelligence sources , explains Gabor Rona , the international legal director of New York - based Human Rights First .
“ The fundamental rule remains , ” he says .
“ Targeting decisions must be made with a view toward minimizing civilian casualties .
Anything less is a war crime . ”
That argument has n’t gotten much attention in the United States — unlike in Israel , which has been carrying out these sorts of operations for at least 15 years .
Between 2000 and 2006 , nearly 300 suspected terrorists were killed along with 129 civilians .
That led Israeli human rights groups to file a lawsuit against the government in 2002 .
They argued that according to Israeli and international law , the practice constituted an illegal use of force equivalent to police shooting people instead of arresting them .
In December 2006 , the Israeli Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in the case .
While the court stopped short of an outright ban on Israel ’s assassinations program , it ruled that international law constrains the targeting of terror suspects .
Currently , in order to justify a strike , Israel must have reliable information that the suspect is actively engaged in hostilities ( such as planning a terrorist attack ) and must rule out an arrest as being too risky .
The court also requires that there be an independent investigation after each strike .
“ It is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws , ” the judges wrote .
According to Joanne Mariner , an attorney with hrw , American watchdog groups have n’t attempted to legally challenge air assassinations because U.S. courts are typically reluctant to restrict the president on matters of national security .
And so , lacking concrete information , the public is left to take the American military ’s word regarding the program ’s breadth and efficacy , says Jennifer Kibbe , an expert in intelligence at Franklin & Marshall College .

Act of 1991 , the president is required to sign off on covert missions , and key congressional committees must be notified .
But the administration has argued that those requirements do n’t apply in the war on terror .
“ The military is acting as judge , jury , and in some cases executioner , ” notes Kibbe .
“ And no one else is checking . ”

In the wake of the new studies , a group of 10 of the United States ’s most eminent ecologists and environmental biologists today sent a letter to President Bush and the speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , urging a reform of biofuels policies .
“ We write to call your attention to recent research indicating that many anticipated biofuels will actually exacerbate global warming , ” the letter said .
The European Union and a number of European countries have recently tried to address the land use issue with proposals stipulating that imported biofuels cannot come from land that was previously rain forest .
But even with such restrictions in place , Dr. Searchinger ’s study shows , the purchase of biofuels in Europe and the United States leads indirectly to the destruction of natural habitats far afield .
For instance , if vegetable oil prices go up globally , as they have because of increased demand for biofuel crops , more new land is inevitably cleared as farmers in developing countries try to get in on the profits .
So crops from old plantations go to Europe for biofuels , while new fields are cleared to feed people at home .
Likewise , Dr. Fargione said that the dedication of so much cropland in the United States to growing corn for bioethanol had caused indirect land use changes far away .
Previously , Midwestern farmers had alternated corn with soy in their fields , one year to the next .
Now many grow only corn , meaning that soy has to be grown elsewhere .
Increasingly , that elsewhere , Dr. Fargione said , is Brazil , on land that was previously forest or savanna .
“ Brazilian farmers are planting more of the world ’s soybeans  and they ’re deforesting the Amazon to do it , ” he said .
International environmental groups , including the United Nations , responded cautiously to the studies , saying that biofuels could still be useful .
“ We do n’t want a total public backlash that would prevent us from getting the potential benefits , ” said Nicholas Nuttall , spokesman for the United Nations Environment Program , who said the United Nations had recently created a new panel to study the evidence .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - John McCain ’s reputation for “ straight talk ” has helped him clinch the Republican presidential nomination but budget experts say his numbers do not add up .

McCain ’s promises to reduce wasteful spending if elected president in November would not begin to cover the costs of his proposed tax cuts , analysts say .
He also has not yet explained how he would rein in the health - care and retirement costs expected to swamp the federal budget as some 77 million people retire from the U.S. work force in the coming decades .
On top of that , a President McCain would inherit a $ 400 billion budget deficit , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that cost nearly $ 200 billion per year and a similar bill for interest payments on the $ 10 trillion national debt .
Many experts said McCain ’s proposals would make the fiscal picture worse .
“ This is one of the most fiscally irresponsible plans we ’ve seen by a presidential candidate in a long time , ” said Robert Greenstein , executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Vague , expensive promises are not unusual on the campaign trail and the proposals put forward by Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also would likely lead to increased deficits , analysts said .
“ I do n’t think anybody ’s numbers add up when they run for president , ” said Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute .
“ I do fear that ( McCain ’s ) do n’t add up the most . ”
As an Arizona senator , McCain has fiercely criticized the congressional pet projects known as “ earmarks , ” which have figured in several recent corruption scandals .
On the campaign trail , he often says he would veto any bills that contain earmarks .
But the $ 18 billion spent on earmarks last year accounted for less than 1 percent of the federal budget , according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense .
McCain advisors say the actual figure is closer to $ 60 billion when spending for projects passed in earlier years is included .
COST OF WARS
Still , McCain would have a tough time cutting all of that spending because much of it would come out of the Pentagon ’s budget as the United States fights in Iraq and Afghanistan , said Joshua Gordon , senior policy analyst at the Concord Coalition , a centrist budget watchdog group .
McCain ’s spending cuts would be outweighed by his proposed tax cuts , experts say .
He angered conservatives when he opposed President George .
W. Bush ’s income - tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 on the grounds that they favored the wealthy and were fiscally irresponsible .
He now supports making them permanent , echoing Bush in saying that allowing them to expire would amount to a tax increase .
McCain also wants to slash corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent and allow businesses to immediately write off capital expenses .
He has called for reforming the Alternative Minimum Tax , initially targeted at the wealthy but now snaring many middle - class taxpayers .
These tax cuts would shrink annual federal revenues from $ 4.55 trillion today to $ 3.4 trillion in 2018 , according to Len Burman of the Brookings Institution ’s Tax Policy Center .
Federal revenues would account for 15.3 percent of U.S. gross domestic product , the lowest level since 1950 .
“ There ’s almost no conceivable way he ’ll be able to cut spending ” to those levels , Gordon said .
The impact of such tax cuts could be offset somewhat if they lead to increased growth , said Brian Riedl , the conservative Heritage Foundation ’s lead budget analyst .
McCain ’s top economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , says simplifying the tax code would close many loopholes .
Cleaning up military procurement also would generate savings , he said .
Yet any changes in spending and taxes will be dwarfed by the ballooning costs of the Social Security retirement and Medicare health - care entitlement programs , Riedl said .
“ McCain ’s record on spending will be basically defined by whether or not he addresses Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid , ” Riedl said .
McCain has said little about how he would rein in these programs and Holtz - Eakin said any changes would have to be worked out in a bipartisan manner with Congress .
Although some of McCain ’s core proposals are not cure - alls , he said , ridding the budget of waste would give McCain the “ moral authority ” to tackle bigger but more sensitive problems like health and retirement spending , as well as Pentagon contracting .
MPs are planning a change in the law to allow babies to be conceived from artificial sperm , a move described by opponents as playing God with human DNA .
A furious debate is building over how far to leave the door open to its use in IVF treatment , ahead of a Commons vote due shortly on the government 's Human Fertilisation and Embryology bill .
The legislation currently allows so - called artificial gametes in research , but imposes a blanket ban on their use in creating a human pregnancy .
The technique involves the creation in a lab of sperm grown from embryonic cells taken from the would - be parent .
Although the science is in its infancy , it could ultimately help people rendered infertile by cancer treatment , or fortysomething women who can no longer produce their own eggs , to have children who are genetically related to them .
A cross-party group of MPs led by Liberal Democrat Evan Harris will table an amendment to relax the ban .
' There is no good explanation for not allowing this option for people who have survived cancer and cannot have children , ' Harris told The Observer .
' This is a good bill , but the government needs to recognise a few improvements are still needed - such as allowing the use of artificial gametes - before we can say the UK has rational and progressive regulation . '
Dawn Primarolo , the Public Health Minister , confirmed last night that she was considering pleas from MPs and scientists to relax the ban .
There was a ' powerful argument ' that the new technique could help solve a shortage of sperm donors , she said , but she was sympathetic to arguments that a decision should not be rushed .
So far pregnancies have been successfully created only in mice : of seven born alive , all died prematurely .
Experts believe it could be 10 years before a human pregnancy could be safely attempted .
But scientists have cultured human sperm using stem cells - immature building blocks containing DNA - taken from bone marrow .
Last night Josephine Quintavalle of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics said lifting the ban could lead to ' the ultimate incest ' of an
individual trying to create both sperm and eggs from their own tissue , making them both mother and father of a child .
It was ' quite ridiculous ' to rely on the potential of a technique still in its infancy , she said : ' If you turn the focus around from infertile adults and think about what you are creating , you always get the perspective you should adopt .
I think we are becoming extremely selfish in our attitude to the children we produce . '
Scientists however argue that research will be halted if there is no chance of being able to use the technique in IVF treatment .
Dr Allan Pacey , secretary of the British Fertility Society , said ministers had not properly explained why they wanted a ban : ' I think if you talk to people - take the example of a cancer victim who has n't got any sperm or eggs because they 've had chemotherapy - if you get to the step where we could make it for them , most people will say they can see the benefits , ' he said .
Although the bill allows for research Pacey said ' nobody is going to be able to convince a UK funding organisation to fund research in this area ' unless it could ultimately be used in treatment .
Harris 's amendment would add a so - called regulation - making power to the bill , a device ensuring that if the new technique were proven safe for humans , MPs could nod through a decision allowing it to be used in IVF without a full parliamentary debate and vote .
It would also stipulate that the gametes should come from two halves of a couple , ensuring the technique could not be used for a single parent to become both mother and father to the same child .
The approach is expected to be backed by the British Medical Association , the Medical Research Council and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology .
Primarolo said she was still consulting on the issue , but added : ' The research can be done , and the issue is whether we legislate to say if it were successful it could proceed .
There are some who are saying - and I think these are strong arguments - that it does raise some profound ethical questions . '

Human migration from Asia to the Americas occurred in three stages , with a 20,000 - year layover on the frozen strip of land called Beringia in what is now the Bering Strait , researchers said this week .
Most scientists had believed that the migration occurred in one continuous passage , but archaeological and genetic evidence indicates otherwise , anthropologist Connie Mulligan of the University of Florida and her colleagues reported Wednesday in the online journal PLoS ONE .
Ancestors of current Native American populations migrated eastward out of Siberia about 40,000 years ago , according to studies of both mitochondrial DNA , which is passed down from mothers to children , and nuclear DNA , which contains genes from both parents .
But two major glaciers along their route trapped them in Beringia , researchers said .
The climate would have been similar to that of Siberia or Mongolia , and the populations would have subsisted by fishing and hunting for mammoth , bison , caribou and other animals .
“ It was n’t paradise , but they survived , ” Mulligan said .

During the layover , many characteristic mutations developed in their DNA .
When the climate warmed and the glaciers melted 15,000 years ago , they were able to continue their journey into the New World .
The genetic evidence indicates that 1,000 to 5,000 individuals were the ancestors of all Native Americans .
Previous estimates were as low as 100 individuals .
As the climate continued to warm , sea levels rose , creating what is now the Bering Strait and submerging archaeological evidence of the humans ’ passage .
“ The idea that people were stuck in Beringia for a long time is obvious in retrospect , but it has never been promulgated , ” said anthropologist Henry C. Harpending of the University of Utah , who was not involved in the study .
“ It ’s very plausible . ”

While there is no definitive scientific study that links cancer to hair dye , there are reports that show an increased rate of some types of cancer in people who are exposed to it .
The dangers of hair dye are real , but there are several non-chemical / vegetable dyes you can use .
Reactions to Hair Dye
According to the Food and Drug Administration ’s Office of Cosmetics and Colors , hair straighteners and hair dyes are among its top consumer complaint areas .
Allergic reactions to dyes include itching , swelling of the face , and even difficulty breathing .
The petroleum products used in hair dyes are known to cause allergic reactions in some people .
Synthetic chemicals , including hair dyes and other color additives , were originally manufactured from coal tar , but today manufacturers primarily use materials derived from petroleum .
One problem is that people become sensitized .
You may think that if you ’ve been using a particular hair dye for years there ’s nothing to worry about .
Actually , people in this category are most at risk .
Years of using a chemical have increased your sensitivity and you may find that one day using your favorite hair dye will leave you with bald patches , swollen eyes , and / or irritated skin .
A study published in the January / February 2005 issue of Public Health Reports , the official journal of the US Public Health Service , found that the use of permanent hair dyes among men and women increases the risk of developing bladder cancer by up to 50 percent compared to those who do n’t use hair dye .
Harmful Dangers of Hair Dye
In 2004 a study by Yale researcher Tongzhang Zhen found that long - term use of permanent hair dye , in dark colors , doubles a person ’s risk of non-Hodgkins ’ lymphoma .
In the summer of 2004 , the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) analyzed 117 hair dyes .
It found :
62 percent of products contained ingredients that are known or probable carcinogens , including dyes derived from coal tar
One product contained lead acetate , a known reproductive toxin
79 percent of products contained ingredients that contained impurities linked to breast cancer
96 percent of products contained penetration enhancers that increase exposures to carcinogens and other ingredients of concern
73 percent of products contained ingredients that are known allergens
Women who use permanent , hair dyes once a month for 1 year or longer have twice the risk of bladder cancer .
Women who use permanent hair dyes for 15 or more years at least monthly have three times the risk of bladder cancer using permanent dyes for 15 or more years when the dyes are used monthly or more frequently
Those who have worked as hairdressers or barbers for 10 years or more have five times the risk of bladder cancer .
Safer alternatives include henna and natural dyes .
Look for brands such as Naturtint , Surya , and Herbatint .
Pedro E. Piñate , an agricultural consultant in the city of Maracay , said : “ We live in two countries , one inhabited by officials who think they can alter reality by sending soldiers to intimidate citizens .
The other country is where the rest of us live in fear of being killed or kidnapped or of our businesses being seized . ”
This fear is reflected in a statistic that is illegal to publish in Venezuela : the black - market value of the strong bolívar , or bolívar fuerte , put into circulation at the start of the year to replace the old bolívar .
Its value hovers around 5.2 to the dollar according to currency traders here , less than half at the official rate , 2.15 .
For other domestic problems , Mr. Chávez ’s approach has been equally erratic .
After the recent outbreak of dengue fever , which reached into his cabinet to infect Culture Minister Francisco Sesto , the president did not shake up the public health system .
Instead , he called for an investigation of claims that the disease may have been altered into a more virulent strain as part of an attack on Venezuela by unidentified enemies .
Enemies of Venezuela have rarely been more threatening than in recent weeks , according to Mr. Chávez , who has elevated a political dispute with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia to the point of mobilizing troops .
Last month , Mr. Chávez claimed Colombian military officials were conspiring with American officials in Bogotá to kill him .
It was the 25th time that Venezuela ’s government said that Mr. Chávez was the target for assassination since 2002 , according to Tal Cual , a newspaper here .
As these domestic and economic troubles accumulate , Mr. Chávez faces a new test this year in state and municipal elections , with a reinvigorated opposition .
Mr. Chávez stands to lose some authority if opponents win just a handful of important states or cities , almost all of which are now controlled by his supporters .
Even more unpredictable are the dynamics within the president ’s own movement , with insurgent candidacies clamoring to challenge the status quo .
“ Chavismo is most vulnerable at the local and state level , ” said Steve Ellner , a political scientist at Oriente University in eastern Venezuela .
“ That opens great opportunities for the opposition to erode Chávez ’s power and influence , beginning with big gains in the elections held at the end of this year . ”
I have always worked on software that needed to squeeze the last bit of practical performance out of a piece of hardware .
Anything less , and I ’m bored at work .
For most of the 2000s , this has been financial software , which is a brilliant example of how Moore ’s Law solves nothing .
See , every year , your average $ 2000 computer is going to be faster and more capable than last .
But with the stock market , it just means that if I can execute 100 trades in the time it took me to execute 90 last year , I ’ll probably find a way to make 10 more trades , because if I do n’t , somebody will steal profits from me because they ’re certainly going to execute 10 more trades .
Or I ’ll run my models for 48 months instead of 36 , so as to have a more accurate programmed model .
Remember , the finance markets are like a bad experiment in social darwinism , to a fault .
How else can you explain why all of those stupid “ me too ” startups were funded in the dotcom bust ?
This has implications for those of us who have to deal with this stream of data .
Programming tools
Take , for example , profiling .
Simple profilers have been around since 1979 .
But you ca n’t use one for this kind of software because any instrumenting profiler is going to slow down the software enough that any instrumentation results are n’t going to be as accurate anymore for finding slow code because it wo n’t be able to keep up with a realistic feed .
On the other hand , a modern sampling profiler like OProfile or VTune is n’t going to have these problems .
But there are n’t any good sampling profilers for OpenVMS , so you need to manually instrument code if you ca n’t run a full profiler .
The same goes for memory debuggers … they wrote their own malloc tracker because nothing else worked .
All of these things sucked up a lot of silent time .
Remember , if you put two mythical identical engineers , one armed with OProfile , one without , both are going to look like productive little engineers while they solve a performance problem , it ’s just that the one using OProfile will probably be done faster .
This is actually when I realized that I needed to write this article — I was debugging a performance problem at my current job and I realized just how handy it was to toss OProfile at it .
Even things like the compiler were productivity - killers .
It has n’t been until fairly recently that the majority of commonly available C++ compilers all implemented a decent amount of the standard including the library and templates .
But once that situation got mostly fixed , there ’s a lot of completely brilliant C++ libraries out there , and brilliant articles about how to program C++.
Except that any library needs to be ported and the technique may not work .
Remember , there are some incredible bits of code in Boost that simply wo n’t compile on an old C++ compiler .
Thing is , when you are on a minority platform , even if they had used the STL , you know that it would n’t have been the same sort of quality that the one that comes with a mainstream platform would have .
Kids these days … sheesh …
Now , you also have to consider the main recruiting push from the company — mostly kids out of CS programs from good universities .
Overall , this is a good thing because it provides a constant infusion of fresh blood and new ideas .
In the eighties , most of those kids had fond memories of coding on various DEC hardware .
In 2000 , using OpenVMS was foreign and legacy and they would all be unhappy because things did n’t work like they did in Windows or Unix .
So they probably lost at least some folks simply because , even though VMS fans still think that Unix is a piece of crap , nobody cares .
People wanted something modern at work , like Linux or Windows .
Similarly , people needed to take some time to get used to the quirks of the almost - but - not - quite STL vector and string classes and the quirks of the compiler .
So , every time you got a new person , even if they lived and breathed C and C++ , you needed to re-train them .
All of these things suck up time and most of these are hidden costs .
It did n’t help that there was some hardware that was fairly questionable .
But before we get to that , I ’d like to talk about the other side of the coin .
In my next article ..

LAS VEGAS -- Eddy Buompensiero noticed eight pairs of shoes outside the door of the modest house on Mother of Pearl Street , evidence that the former owners were still living there even though the bank had foreclosed .
Mr. Buompensiero , a gray - bearded inspector for REO Asset Services - 1st Realty Group , rang the bell .
When no one answered , he taped a letter to the door offering the occupants $ 1,000 to move out .
The catch :

— About 5,000 mourners filled The Pit on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus Thursday evening for a candlelight vigil to remember the school 's student body president – the victim of a shooting that has sent shockwaves through the UNC community .
Chapel Hill police reported Thursday morning that they had identified a woman found dead in a neighborhood about a half - mile from the campus on Wednesday as Eve Marie Carson , 22 , of Athens , Ga. ( Read more about the investigation and view related video . )
Police found her body at the corner of Hillcrest Road and Hillcrest Circle about 5:15 a.m. while responding to reports of gunshots nearby .
The UNC senior suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head , authorities said .
" We 're all in a state of shock , " UNC Chancellor James Moeser said during an informal afternoon gathering in which a , a solemn , similar - sized crowd of students , faculty and staff flocked to the quad outside Polk Place .
At a makeshift memorial behind the old campus YMCA building , students left flowers on the ground and messages on large boards .
Staff from the university 's counseling center and Duke University were on hand , and they planned to be available for the remainder of the week and next week .
" We are all hurting .
We are all grief - stricken – stunned , " Moeser said .
" This university needs an enormous group hug .
It 's OK to cry .
It 's OK to be filled with grief . "
Gov. Mike Easley also ordered all state flags on the campus lowered to half - staff .
“ There are few other words that can express the sorrow of such a promising life ended so soon and so violently , ” he said in a statement .
Carson , a pre-med major studying political science and biology , was active in leadership and service roles .
As a Morehead - Cain scholar , she spent her summers volunteering and working overseas in Ecuador , Egypt and Ghana .
She was also a tutor at Githens Middle School in Durham her junior year and an assistant coach with Girls on the Run in 2005 , according to the university .
" Eve Carson personified the Carolina spirit .
She did it , perhaps , more profoundly than anyone I 've known my whole time here , " Moeser said .
" She felt the very pulse and heartbeat of this university . "
" She was just an incredible person that I think had an effect on a lot of people 's live , " UNC senior Katie Eagan said .
" The way in which she died was obviously a shock .
I think we 're all just trying to process it right now . "
By midday Thursday , Chapel Hill police had located Carson 's blue 2005 Toyota Highlander in Chapel Hill , about a mile from where her body was found .
Investigators said they believe it had been stolen after the killing .
With no suspects or possible motives disclosed , officers spent Wednesday and part of Thursday following up and searching for leads to try to identify Carson .
Police found no identification with her body , but they said a physical description and a pair of unusual tennis shoes she was wearing helped them find out who she was .
" We 're at the very beginning of this investigation , " Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said .
" A lot of it , up to this point , was just trying to figure out who the victim was . "
Curran urged anyone with information about that might help police to call the police department at 919-968-2760 or Crime Stoppers at 919-942-7515 .
Calling her a person who touched lives not only on campus but also throughout the town , Chapel Hill Mayor Kevin Foy said the town was reeling from Carson 's death .
" Her service as student body president , a member of the ( UNC ) Board of Trustees and ( in ) other ways only provides a glimpse of the person that Eve was , " he said .
" She was happy , vivacious , intelligent , engaged and a presence in our community whose absence leaves a permanent void in our hearts and in our lives . ”
" She really brought you into the Carolina family , made you feel like we 're all united here , " UNC student Gina Mottesi said .
" And something like this just impacts you in a way you would n't expect it to . "

It would take months for the agency that licenses Oregon teachers to discipline a Salem - area teacher for inappropriately touching at least eight girls .
To get Kenneth John Cushing , then 44 , away from Claggett Creek Middle School students immediately , administrators cut him a deal :
If Cushing resigned , they would conceal his alleged conduct — clutching students ’ waists , touching their buttocks and massaging their shoulders — from the public .
Cushing signed the pact — obtained by The Oregonian through public records requests — with Salem - Keizer Public Schools in 2004 , and officials promised not to reveal the teacher ’s behavior if potential employers called looking for a reference .
They would attribute his departure to “ personal reasons , ” the document reads , and make “ no reference to this agreement . ”
Salem ’s deal is just one of 47 similar confidential settlement agreements obtained or confirmed by the newspaper .

Last August , as a team at the North Pole prepared to plunge more than two miles to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean , some of the dozens of specialists who staged the dive engaged in a time - honored ritual : drawing on foam cups , decorating more than 100 of them .
The cups were then gingerly sent into the deep .
During the historic dive , led by Russian scientists , the pressure of the surrounding water crushed the cups to the size of thimbles , also squeezing their whimsies of writing and drawing .
Afterward , the tiny cups became instant mementoes of the polar dive , offering striking proof of the descent into an unfamiliar zone and silent testimony to the crushing power of plain old water .
“ The real North Pole , ” read one cup ’s shrunken writing .
“ Explore the abyss , ” another urged .
Deep explorers have made thousands of such keepsakes over the decades , and more recently , schools have joined the fun as a way to drive home some of the peculiarities of a planet where very deep water covers some 65 percent of the surface .

BY LEUREN MORET RADIOACTIVE TIMES VOL .
6 NO . 2 March 2008 RIVERBANKS AND COASTLINES HAVE HIGHEST CANCER RATES
Fresh water has higher concentrations of radionuclides than seawater because there is a greater dilution factor in seawater , and salts in seawater control uptake of radionuclides .
It is clear that dilution is not the solution to pollution .
Dumping radioactive contaminated materials into bodies of water has a boomerang effect .
It is not long before the radiation is washing back up on riverbanks and shorelines .
In fact , in the first cancer mapping survey in history ( 1850 - 60 ) in the Lake District of Britain , Alfred Haviland reported that the highest cancer rates ( from natural background radiation ) were along riverbanks and shorelines providing a strong environmental link to cancer before manmade radiation was introduced into the environment after 1900 .
Pre -1900 cancer rates represent the true baseline for cancer studies .
The chance discovery of an abstract in the Journal of Environmental Radioactivity , " Radiocesium in North San Francisco Bay and Baja California coastal surface waters " , provided me with an answer to a puzzling question about breast cancer .
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by the University of California to identify the cause of what may be the highest breast cancer rates in the United States in Marin County , California , just north of San Francisco .
Fig. 1 : San Francisco Bay Area , with Marin County in upper left corner .
Even more surprising , the radiocesium reported in the paper had been measured by the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Lab , from the north end of San Francisco Bay to the coastal waters at the tip of Baja California , Mexico .
By mapping the pattern of breast cancer in Marin County , I identified the San Francisco Bay shoreline of the Marin County peninsula as the environment where the highest rates of breast cancer occur in the county .
The deepest part of San Francisco Bay is offshore from Marin , and the highest volume of sediment - laden water passes through this area each day with the tides .
The lowest breast cancer rates are along the Pacific coastline of Marin .
The spatial distribution of breast cancer made it clear that there had to be an environmental cause .
Large areas of mudflats and estuaries along the bay side shoreline of Marin , like the Welsh seacoast , provide a low energy environment for radioactive contaminated fine sediments to settle out .
CONTAMINATION OF REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES
Most of the fresh water coming into San Francisco Bay is from the Sierra Nevada Mountains east of the California coastline , a very high mountain range running north and south along the border with Nevada .
The soils of the Sierras are now contaminated with radioactive materials from nuclear bomb testing , Chernobyl , and the emissions from the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant , which operated east of San Francisco until it was shut down in 1989 .
Most of the drinking water for the San Francisco Bay area comes from the Sierras .
Approximately 95 % of the radioactive emissions from Rancho Seco were rained and snowed out into the Sierra Nevada Mountains .
During the lawsuit , which eventually shut down Rancho Seco nuclear power plant in 1989 , the citizens who owned the Sacramento municipal power company contracted with Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons lab to measure fission product emissions in the Rancho Seco environment .
I obtained the Livermore radiation reports and communications with lawyers , from Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass who had been an expert witness on the lawsuit .
It was a surprise to discover that Livermore nuclear weapons lab has not only secretly conducted extensive global monitoring of radiation for decades , but local radiation monitoring as well .
In fact , I saw fresh samples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki lying on a table in a Livermore environmental laboratory in 1991 .
When I asked why they were still monitoring Hiroshima and Nagasaki , I was told " Because they are still radioactive . "
LIVERMORE NUKE LAB SECRETLY MONITORING GLOBAL RAD LEVELS
Livermore nuclear weapons lab reported measuring one Curie of radiocesium per year , passing through San Francisco Bay attached to fine sediment .
Clay particles are highly charged and act as scavenging agents for radioactive particles suspended in water .
This has been a chronic and cumulative source of low - level radiation washing up daily on the San Francisco Bay side of the Marin shoreline for at least 60 years ­ since bomb testing started .
The European Committee on Radiation Risk ( ECRR ) report has stated that chronic exposure to low - level radiation is " up to 1000 times more biologically damaging than the ICRP standards and risk model predict " .
The ICRP standards and risk model are based on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Atomic Bomb studies , which were deceptively conducted by the U.S. Government .
Radiocesium is just one of hundreds of radionuclides produced in the fission process , which means far more radiation has been washing through north San Francisco Bay than the 1 Curie of cesium reported in the Livermore report .
Even worse , the public health impact from global pollution by depleted uranium , was not officially measured or reported from bomb testing , but someone must have been monitoring it .
All atomic and hydrogen bombs have large amounts of depleted uranium packed as " tamping " around the small plutonium core weighing less than 20 lbs .
A global diabetes epidemic is the result primarily of the uranium pollution which is particularly damaging to the pancreas and insulin function .
Pancreatic cancer mortality in Japanese males increased 12 - fold between 1945 and 1965 , during the peak of atmospheric testing .

MARIN COUNTY : A NATURAL CONTROL STUDY
The Marin County study is the kind of natural experiment geoscientists find useful in their research , with the Pacific coastline as a natural control and San Francisco Bay mudflats in Marin County as the study area .
It is also a good comparison of the public health effects of radionuclide concentrations in contaminated freshwater compared to seawater .
When the mud samples from the Marin County bay side shoreline and the Pacific coastline are analyzed , low - level radiation from the Sierras will be identified as the cause of what may be the highest breast cancer incidence in the United States .
High rates of autism also occur in areas , between the Sierras and Marin County , in low energy environments where swampy still water and mudflats occur and are recharged with contaminated water washing down from the Sierras .
Radiation in the environment has a cumulative effect .
I 'M THE " MOUSE LADY " The University of California , as the unchallenged manager for 61 years of the nuclear weapons program at Los Alamos National Lab , Lawrence Livermore Lab , and Lawrence Berkeley Lab , has received billions of dollars to make a global radioactive environmental mess , hundreds of millions of dollars more to " study " the breast cancer clusters in Marin County , and has still failed to identify the cause .
Yet , during a breast cancer conference on January 21 , 2006 , by the Bay Area Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Center ( BABCERC ) , Dr. Mary Helen Barcellos - Hoff from the Lawrence Berkeley Lab , who introduced herself as " the mouse lady " , stated very clearly during her presentation to 600 women , that " radiation is the only known cause of breast cancer in mice " .
She spoke repeatedly in her talk about her experiments on mice , saying " Radiation is the only known cause of breast cancer in mice and that is why I use it to cause breast cancer in mice . "
She said they never identified the cause of breast cancer in women .
THE MOUSE THAT ROARED
When it was time for questions , I held up an enlarged breast cancer map using US Government data , which identified a 100 - mile radius from nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons labs as the location of 2/3 of all breast cancer deaths in the United States from 1985 - 89 .

I asked the speaker , Dr. Mary Helen Barcellos - Hoff , if BABCERC was investigating radiation as a cause of breast cancer around these sites .
She quickly replied , " Oh , I 'm a microbiologist ! " distancing herself from exposing radiation as the obvious cause .
The University of California will forever be known as the University that poisoned the world .

Following the GOP debate on Thursday night , Huckabee showed both his ignorance and his willingness to believe fairy tales , regardless of whether he heard them or made them up himself .
During the debate , the Huckster said that Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction ( a meaningless term covering everything from WWI - era mustard gas to nukes ) were like Easter eggs that we never found , “ it does n’t mean they ’re not there . ”
Questioned by Chris Matthews following the debate , Huckabee suggested that the WMD were moved to Jordan .
When Matthews pointed out that Jordan is a close ally of the US , Huckabee started spinning his fairy tale .
Instead of realizing his mistake ( he probably meant Syria , not Jordan ) , he explained that these elusive little WMD could have ended up anywhere , and without the knowledge of the King of Jordan .
The idea that Saddam moved his weapons out of the country before his regime fell never made sense to me , unless you believe that he was so moral as to refuse to use the weapons to save himself and defend his rule .

The Chinese are at it again , murdering peaceful Buddhist monks and Tibetan protestors .
Not that Chinese government cruelty is anything new ; for instance , China has been detaining , torturing , and executing Falun Gong members and members of other groups for years .
Thousands of prisoners have been executed for their organs ( video , 5 min 12 sec ) , which bring huge profit to the regime .
And under Mao , tens of millions of Chinese citizens were murdered by their own government .
- 2 -
The news about China 's assaults on Buddhists and others in Tibet last week reminded me of how jaw - droppingly cruel governments are in general .
Try to imagine any free - market institution doing what China routinely does , which is to push people around at gunpoint and to murder them ( or detain them or torture them ) if they resist , and often even if they do n't resist .
Does Apple Computer do that ?
Does Stanford University do that ?
If they did , would we put up with it ?

It is easy to pick on China -- and they certainly deserve the exposure -- but in fact cruelty is an essential element in government action of almost any type .
This is because government is simply a scheme to do things via coercion , and coercion itself is cruelty .
In some cases , the cruelty is obvious and severe almost beyond belief .
The United States federal government continues to arrest and imprison terminal cancer patients who use marijuana to quell pain or to help keep their food down during chemotherapy .
How does anyone still believe the fiction that government exists to help us and to provide " compassion " in any sense of the term ?
Would n't something as shocking and depraved as imprisoning terminal cancer patients for using pot pretty much cancel any amount of " compassion " the government might be credited with in other areas ?
Even when doing something that appears compassionate and helpful , government ends up causing pain , misery , and poverty in the long run .
We are presently in the midst of a huge , century - long example in the form of economic destruction caused by government over - spending and over - printing of money .
These sins have brought down nations and empires repeatedly in history and they are currently bringing down the American empire .
The cynical , phony rationale for all the spending and programs that have bankrupted America has been to " help " us in an endless variety of ways , some of which would actually have been helpful had they not been funded coercively ( i.e. , if the private sector had done the job ) but most of which have been harmful even in terms of their direct results ( for instance , how many millions of children have grown up without their fathers because Mom would have lost welfare benefits if Dad had stayed at home ? )
In aggregate , the programs have simply drowned this nation in red ink , and our time as a rich , powerful nation and " beacon to the world " is now about over .
If you do n't think this represents a form of cruelty , just keep your eyes open over the next year or two .
Government is a way to do things based upon the cruelty of coercion , and government action creates more cruelty as a side - effect -- even when that is not immediately apparent .
This is one reason that love and freedom go together : unfreedom erodes and destroys the conditions necessary for compassion .

IT 'S FREE Jason Jepson works for a chi-chi yacht dealer in Newport Beach , Calif. , but he 's so worried about the economy he stopped buying $ 1.79 PowerBars at his gym .
Richmond , Va. , legal secretary Angela Harris is passing up her beloved $ 3.46 Iced Mocha Latte at Starbucks ( SBUX ) .
TELL US :
Are you changing your spending habits because of the slowing economy ?
If so , what are you doing ?
ECONOMY : Even as consumers lose heart , prices rise William Muckelroy II , a research director from Eagle , Idaho , now carries a bottle of tap water instead of buying $ 1.29 bottles of Evian at Walgreens ( WAG ) .
Such small luxuries seemed almost necessities in happier economic times .
But no more for lots of folks , including those and other USA TODAY readers who described how they 've changed their habits .
The murky financial outlook and recession fears are factors .
Another driver : fear of being out of step with a cultural mind - set that increasingly says less is more .
If your best friend and next - door neighbors are cutting back on little luxuries , should n't you be , too ?
" For years , we had the opposite .
It was all about keeping up with the Joneses .
Now , the Joneses are starting to cut back , " says Ellie Kay , author of 12 personal finance books .
The cold , hard numbers on the nation 's economic mood bear out that consumers do n't feel flush .
Consumer confidence plummeted in February to its lowest since February 2003 , which was just before the U.S. invaded Iraq .
The Conference Board 's much - watched index of consumer confidence fell to 75 from 87.3 in January , the group reports " There 's a sense that prices are rising — and will continue to rise — but wages will not , " says Ken Goldstein , economist at The Conference Board .
" This is squeezing household budgets whether they 're $ 200 per week or $ 200,000 per year .
Folks are looking closely at anything they do n't have to purchase now . "
Most consumers actually feel more pain from these small cuts than from big ones .
You miss your daily java jolt a lot more than , say , a new car you 'd only hoped to buy sometime this year .
Small cuts can also have a big effect on the economy .
If cutting back becomes a cultural mind - set , it can be very hard to turn around .
" The new status is n't how much you 've got , but your ability to show what you do n't spend , " says futurist Watts Wacker , who advises businesses on trends .
" This is a seminal moment .
It 's not a fad that will die out when the economy picks up . "
Trends guru Faith Popcorn puts it this way : " It 's cooler not to spend . "
There 's no turning back soon for mortgage loan originator Martin Richardson of Suffolk , Va .
He used to buy four suits a year at J.C. Penney ( JCP ) .
In the past year , he did n't buy any and will make do with his wardrobe again this year .
" I ca n't afford it , " he says .
" Nothing could lure me back .
Not two - for - ones .
Not 20 % off .
Nothing . "
It 's not just leaner times , Richardson says .
" I wo n't go back to my old ways when the economy improves , " he says .
" It 's hard for friends to understand , but I 'm working on becoming more of a minimalist .
It 's a relief to have less . "
While making do with less is not for everyone , here 's how some USA TODAY readers are cutting back on small pleasures — and responses from some of the businesses who might feel their pain :
Fishing for fewer fast - food meals Between Sara Winters and her husband , David , of Columbus , Ohio , they bought lunch out about eight times a week , often at McDonald 's ( MCD ) .
She usually got a fish sandwich and a small soft drink .
He typically got two fish sandwiches and a large soft drink .
It added up to more than $ 170 a month .
When the school year began , Winters started packing lunches for herself and her husband , as well as her 15 - year - old son .
" We 're not panicking .
We 're more aware of what we spend our money on , " she says .
" We miss McDonald 's fries , but you have to think about your future . "
McDonald 's customers know that " regardless of whether they have a little money to spend — or a little bit more to spend — there 's always something on the menu for them , " says spokesman Bill Whitman .
The Winters family also spends less time at a nearby Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) bookstore — a favorite family hangout — and a lot more time at the public library , says Sara Winters , who works in marketing .
Still , when a search of the library and a used - book store did n't turn up a series of science - fiction books her son , Jack , wanted , she made an exception and spent $ 40 to buy them at Barnes & Noble .
" When your son wants to read , it 's hard to say no . "
Barnes & Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating says that during recessions , consumers may pull back on big - ticket items , but they tend to keep buying books .
Movie theater out ; Netflix in About once every six weeks , William Muckelroy II and wife Lore would hit the local Regal Cinema ( RGC ) in Boise to catch a movie .
A pair of tickets , two popcorns and two soft drinks set them back just under $ 30 .
After the show , they 'd often stop at a restaurant — an additional $ 40 .
Now , they pay $ 17 a month for a subscription to online DVD service Netflix ( NFLX ) — and watch about two movies a week .
" At the end of the month , the credit card statements are less , " says Muckelroy .
Their last movie out was eight months ago .
Dick Westerling , Regal senior vice president of marketing , points out , however , that theaters have a long history of not being hurt in downturns and that Regal 's loyalty program signed up 3 million new members last year .
Muckelroy also used to stop at the convenience store during errands to grab a bottle of Evian water that typically cost $ 1.29 .
Ditto for his wife .
He figures they spent $ 40 a month on bottled water .
Then , his wife started to carry tap water in a bottle .
He followed and has n't bought water in months .
" I realized it was stupid , " he says .
Still , he adds , " It 's been rough .
I miss the taste . "
Evian spokeswoman Lauren Kinelski says the company has n't seen sales " suffering as a result of consumer cutbacks . "
Of all Muckelroy 's simple luxuries , few cost more than his monthly trips to The Body Shop , which sells natural and socially responsible personal care products .
With items such as $ 8 bars of soap , he 'd sometimes run up an $ 80 tab .
" I was a Body Shop die - hard , " he says .
" I not only like their products , but I like what they stand for . "
But the expense , he says , " got ridiculous . "
Now , it 's Dial and Irish Spring bars at Walgreens — and only on sale .
Body Shop spokeswoman Shelley Simmons says , " Many of our customers see us as an affordable luxury . "
She also says , however , that it recently offered a three - for - the - price - of - two deal on skin care products and that a loyalty program gives 10 % discounts .
Pre - workout energy bar takes a $ 1.20 price cut One of the first things to go for Jason Jepson , a marketing executive at a yacht dealer : his pre-workout PowerBars .
He paid about $ 1.79 for each one at his gym , slightly less at his neighborhood Vons supermarket .
Jepson ate an energy bar before working out five days a week .
He 's still does , but now he 's buying Tiger 's Milk bars at Trader Joe 's for about 59 cents each .
At $ 1.20 less per bar , he figures his annual savings is about $ 312 .
" I'm in a different financial position than I was five years ago , " he says .
" I want to save . "
Jepson 's move is not a movement , according to PowerBar spokeswoman Kathleen Boyle .
" Our data shows that the PowerBar business remains healthy . "
From Starbucks lattes to Folgers
To say legal secretary Angela Harris loves Starbucks is an understatement .
At least four times a week , she would plunk down $ 3.46 for a beloved Iced Mocha Latte .
She was spending more than $ 55 a month , or about $ 664 a year .
Now , she makes Folgers coffee at home and squirts in some Hershey 's syrup .
It " does n't taste the same , " says Harris .
" But with gasoline at $ 3 per gallon , I can pass up Starbucks . "
Starbucks has had other issues in addition to the economy and is in the midst of a plan to revitalize its focus on its customers ' experience .
" We are taking bold steps to reignite the emotional attachment with our customers and make foundational changes to our business , " CEO Howard Schultz says .
At its March 19 annual meeting , Starbucks will reveal five new consumer initiatives .
It also is testing $ 1 regular coffees in some Seattle stores .
Surviving on plain water A glass of water never tasted right without some Crystal Light flavoring , says Sharon Honeywell , a bookkeeper from Flourtown , Pa .
Her favorite flavors : green tea and raspberry .
Around Christmas , when the weather got cold and the budget got tight , she quit cold turkey and now tries to drink plain tap water .
" Sometimes I miss it , " she says .
" I get a craving for something besides water , " so she treats herself to a soft drink once in a while .
Crystal Light spokeswoman Bridget MacConnell says the company " listens to what consumers want " and has been trying to offer it , such as enhanced versions with vitamins .
No more $ 100 designer jeans Visits to Spa Nordstrom ( JWN ) for Deshaun Davis are few now .
The college professor from North Richland Hills , Texas , found herself spending $ 311.76 monthly at the department store 's spa for such services as $ 85 facials and $ 25 lip waxes .
While she was in the store , she 'd been known to saunter over to the sales floor and pick up a $ 100 pair of designer jeans .
Now , it 's $ 19.95 jeans at Gap Outlet ( GPS ) .
" I 'm never going to pay $ 100 for jeans again , " says Davis .
The upscale chain has felt some economic chill , but spokeswoman Brooke White says , " While we may face short - term challenges , we focus our efforts on things within our control .
Things like treating each customer with respect . "
After Davis cut back her treatments —
" I 've only gone once since January , " she says — Nordstrom noticed .
Her beautician has sent her notes that she 's missed .

Is this the return of the summer showdowns between Capitol Hill Democrats and the White House ?
The Senate Judiciary Committee moved a big step closer to contempt citations against top Bush administration officials today .
Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) ruled that White House claims of executive privilege “ are not legally valid . ”
A Senate aide tells Mother Jones the committee could begin contempt proceedings as early as next Thursday if current and former administration officials do not comply immediately with the subpoenas .
More than four months have passed since the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers for contempt .
Bolten , Miers , and other administration officials had refused to comply with congressional subpoenas for testimony and documents relating to the U.S. attorneys scandal .
But with the committee vote a fading memory , the full House still has yet to vote on the measure .
On the Senate side , Leahy never followed through on vague threats to cite the President for contempt if the White House did n’t provide the documents Congress had subpoenaed .
And despite a letter House Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman sent three months ago ( PDF ) requesting information on the 5 million emails the White House “ lost , ” they are still nowhere to be found .
The Democrats have made almost no progress in their efforts to obtain more information about the attorney firings .
They have proven equally ineffective in holding the people stonewalling them accountable .
The Democrats have been distracted by other issues , and they were outmaneuvered by a stubborn administration .
For months , the Democratic leadership has held off on a confrontation with the White House , but Leahy ’s ruling today may signal that they ’re returning to the attack .
Some amount of distraction is understandable .
With the much - hyped Petraeus report on Iraq in early September and the resignation and replacement of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , the Dems had a lot on their hands .
But the heart of the U.S. attorneys scandal — and the part the Democrats are most interested in — lurks at 1600 Pennsylvania , and the White House remains implicated , even if Karl Rove has resigned .
If the Justice Department and Gonzales were fall guys to shift blame for the attorneys scandal away from the White House , as many on the left alleged , they did their job .
Even after Gonzales ’ replacement , Michael Mukasey , was confirmed in early November , the Democrats still failed to press for answers .
On November 5 , House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers Jr. made what was widely reported as a “ ninth and final ” offer to the administration to stave off contempt citations for Miers and Bolten , agreeing to previous administration requests that interviews with senior White House staff not be conducted under oath .
He even went so far as to file the contempt report with the clerk of the House — a move toward a full House vote .
“ Subpoena Showdown in House Grows Near , ” CBS News reported .
Conyers asked for a response from the administration by the end of the week .
The White House quickly indicated it would not comply with Conyers ’ request .
But no House vote on the contempt citations came .
Instead , the Democratic leadership backed off , choosing to focus on Iraq and the budget .
That was just the opening the administration was looking for , says James Horney , director of fiscal policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
“ The president thinks it ’s in his political interest to have a confrontation with the Congress over budget issues .
Even if a majority of the people in the country does n’t support what he ’s doing I suspect he ’d rather have people reading press accounts about this than about Iraq and a number of other issues . ”
Instead of battling over the attorneys scandal and voting on contempt charges or subpoenaing email records , Congress spent November bickering with the White House over budget issues and the war and did n’t pass a single major bill .
Meanwhile , the Democrats have been losing the battle on the president ’s chosen ground : spending .
After making no progress on passing the $ 22 billion of extra domestic spending they want for FY 2008 , Senate majority leader Harry Reid offered to split the difference .
But the White House , sensing weakness , held firm .
Now House Democrats are worried they ’re being lured into a repeat of the Bill Clinton - Newt Gingrich clash that shut down the government in 1995 .
Between pay - as - you - go rules , Iraq war funding , and a White House that wo n’t give an inch , the Democrats look increasingly trapped .
In recent months , outside groups have made the most progress on the accountability front .
Earlier this year , two nonprofits , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) and the National Security Archive , sued to find out what happened to the missing emails .
On November 12 , they scored a big victory by obtaining a court order that forces the White House to maintain copies of all its emails .
Meredith Fuchs , the general counsel to the National Security Archive , says she was surprised Congress was n’t being more aggressive .
“ It ’s pretty remarkable that the Congress has n’t done more , ” she comments .
“ Congress ought to be asking the White House to explain what its doing with its records .
These same kind of things happened with the Clinton administration and Congress was outraged . ”
CREW chief counsel Anne Weismann says she ’d like to see Congress subpoena more information .
“ We have to operate within the court system and we have no way to compel a judge to rule on any of our motions , ” she said .
“ I ’d like Congress to ask for some of the same documents we have .
Ask the White House to give them documents that show what the White House knows . ”
Leahy ’s ruling today may be a signal that the process is finally moving again .
If the Judiciary committee does debate contempt citations next week , the full Senate could conceivably be voting on the issue before the end of the year .
“ The Senate Majority Leader has a very ambitious agenda for the next three weeks , ” says Erica Chabot , a spokeswoman for Leahy .
“ But that does n’t mean it ca n’t change should something develop ” before Congress recesses over the Christmas holidays .
The House leadership has also signaled a willingness to proceed with contempt proceedings in December , and Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House speaker Nancy Pelosi , says part of the delay was the time it took for the leadership to consult members and make sure they had the votes .
“ It appears that we do [ have the votes ] and the speaker said it ’s likely we ’d go forward , ” he said .
Still , some in the blogosphere have questioned the leadership ’s commitment to the issue .
On November 16 , TAPPED ‘s Adele Stan asked why freshman representatives had been asked to whip the contempt vote .
“ Why , in the House , where seniority is everything , has the fate of the U.S. Constitution been left in the hands of the freshman members ?. . . Why is this fight not being fought without quarter , floor vote after floor vote ? ”
Daly says the freshmen were the perfect choice .
“ They are the ones that are very concerned about this .
Many of them got elected on restoring the integrity of the Congress and this is an important part of that . ”
Still , the rhetoric at the top remains strong .
“ Pursuing contempt is crucial , ” Conyers said in an email to Mother Jones .
And Daly , the speaker ’s spokesman , notes , “ It ’s the integrity of Congress that ’s at stake here . ”
But no one on either side of the Capitol was particularly committal about bringing contempt citations to a vote before the full Congress — or subpoenaing email records — before the end of the year .
And no one had a good answer for the most obvious question :
If holding the administration accountable is so important , why is it taking so long ?
These are words that move and uplift , that give hope to the hopeless .
These words inspired millions of voters nationwide to join the grand experiment called democracy , casting votes for their candidate , their country , their destiny :
" More than anything else , I want my candidacy to unify our country , to renew the American spirit and sense of purpose .
I want to carry our message to every American , regardless of party affiliation , who is a member of this community of shared values . . .
For those who have abandoned hope , we 'll ...
Senator Barack Obama called Thursday for tighter regulation of mortgage lenders , banks and financial houses , even as he spoke of pumping $ 30 billion into the economy to shield homeowners and local governments from the worst effects of the collapse of the housing bubble .
Mr. Obama laid much of the blame for the crisis on lobbyists and politicians who dismantled the regulatory framework governing the energy , telecommunications and financial services sectors .
Speaking at Cooper Union in Manhattan , Mr. Obama blamed Democrats no less than Republicans for the crisis that now casts a shadow of foreclosure and insolvency over millions of Americans .
He did not mention former President Bill Clinton by name , but the target of his criticism seemed clear .
“ Under Republican and Democratic administrations , we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ The result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady sustainable growth , a market that favors Wall Street over Main Street but ends up hurting both . ”

MELBOURNE ( Reuters ) - An Australian “ prankster ” barmaid who served a patron a shot of disinfectant has appeared in court over what her lawyers said was a “ misguided ” joke .
Melbourne barmaid Emily Craig , 23 , served a client a single 30 ml shot glass of Pine - O - Cleen disinfectant in March during a 6 a.m. drinking bout at Evolution Nightclub , causing him to become violently ill , the Melbourne Magistrates court was told .
“ This was a misguided joke at an ungodly hour , ” Craig ’s lawyer George Balot told the judge , according to reports on Tuesday in local newspapers .
Police told the court that Craig “ was known for her prankster - style behavior ” and once covered a bar in sticky tape .
She “ upped the ante ” with her pranks by serving up the powerful floor cleaner after giving the man shots of pure water .
The patron developed ulcers on his skin after drinking the disinfectant shot from Craig , who has since lost her job and faces four charges of intentionally causing injury .
The case was adjourned until February .
HOUSTON  A federal prison in Texas erupted in violence early Friday when two gang - related fights broke out almost simultaneously in facing housing units .
One inmate was killed , and 22 were injured , officials said .
It was the second outbreak of fighting in a federal lockup in Texas in three weeks .
The prison , the Federal Correctional Institution in Three Rivers , was locked down as F.B.I. agents began an inquiry , the Bureau of Prisons announced .
The prison , between San Antonio and Corpus Christi , houses 1,160 men .
The fights , which broke out about 6:20 a.m. , were quelled with the help of 10 nonguards  plumbers , electricians , secretaries and other workers  who happened to be reporting early , said Richard Wechsler , local president of the American Federation of Government Employees , a supervisor and a former guard at the prison .
The employees , like the guards , were unarmed according to practice , Mr. Wechsler said , “ but they could start yelling , using their radios and grabbing inmates . ”
As luck would have it , Cheryl Charles ’ twin daughters both found careers in the mortgage industry .
One was laid off just before the holidays and returned home to live with her mom , and the other moved back in to save money as the real estate market went south .
At least one of the 39 - year - old twins can help pay the rent on Charles ’ condo in Chatsworth , which is no small matter .
Americans ’ biggest average annual expense , by far , is for housing , including utilities and property taxes .
For the typical family , housing gobbles up 33.8 % of the annual budget , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
( The next - largest expense is transportation , with the cost of a vehicle accounting for 7.1 % of a budget , while fuel eats up 4.6 % and insurance and repairs an additional 3.2 % . )
Charles , an executive assistant at Cal State Northridge , says she has n’t had a raise in three years , “ thanks to Arnold . ”
So she recently took a second job doing data entry for an insurance company .
She works 60 hours a week and makes about $ 45,000 a year .
And she worries , about the economy , retirement , medical insurance and the rising costs of milk , bread and fruits and vegetables .
“ Things that you want to eat on a daily basis to have a healthy diet keep going up , ” she says .
She cuts back where she can .
If her hair needs color , she dyes it herself .
A trim ?
Her sister does that .
The only thing she has bought to wear lately was a dress for her father ’s funeral .
“ You have to prioritize , making sure the rent is paid .
You ’ve got to get gas to get to work and you ’ve got to maintain your car , ” she says .
“ There ’s basically nothing left for splurging . ”
She ’s even given up Costco .
“ They have good deals , ” she says .
“ But you have to pay that membership , that big $ 50 -- and that ’s a tank of gas . ”
She wishes that , someday , she could buy a home in the San Fernando Valley , near her office .
“ When you walk across the campus and see squirrels in the trees , it ’s so beautiful , ” she says wistfully .
“ So relaxing . ”
Like so many others , though , Charles doubts that she ’ll ever be able to make such a purchase .
“ I wish it was easier for the people who were born here , and worked here all their life , to at least obtain the American dream of owning your own home , ” she says .
“ You ’re kind of forced to move elsewhere , where the cost of living is cheaper . ”

McCain ’s use of his list as collateral could open the unlikely possibility of donors suing his campaign for breach of contract .
McCain loan could violate donor privacy
When John McCain ’s presidential campaign all but went broke , it borrowed money from its bank using its fundraising list as collateral .
Problem : McCain ’s own privacy policy promises donors he wo n’t sell their information .

That seems to put the Republican senator 's campaign in a pickle ; either it pledged to its bank proceeds from something it can’t sell , or it offered to violate its own promise to donors .
McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker stressed that the campaign pledged all of its assets as collateral , not just the list .
“ Such a blanket pledging , ” she said , “ is normal procedure for a bank loan — and does not mean that they can [ or ] would ever be used in any way that violates our policies . ”
The privacy policy on Arizona Republican 's website states : “ John McCain 2008 will not sell your information to third parties or any commercial entities . ”
Fundraising lists are valuable political commodities , since they offer the possibility of millions of dollars in contributions .
And campaigns routinely rent or trade them .
McCain ’s use of his list as collateral , however , could open the unlikely possibility of donors suing his campaign for breach of contract .
Some momentum now returns to Mr Obama after earlier defeats
He remains ahead in the overall contest in terms of delegates but is trying to regain momentum lost last week when Mrs Clinton won Texas and Ohio .
Wyoming sends 12 delegates to August 's Democratic convention , making it one of the smallest prizes in the race .
The next test for the Democrats is the Mississippi primary on Tuesday .
After netting seven of Wyoming 's delegates to Mrs Clinton 's five , Mr Obama now has a total of 1,578 against 1,468 for his rival , according to the Associated Press .
It takes 2,025 to secure the party 's nomination .
The Republican party has already chosen John McCain as its candidate for the November presidential election .
Iraq strategy
Mr Obama told supporters in Wyoming on Friday that he would end the war in Iraq in 2009 .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATE RACE BARACK OBAMA : 1,578 Delegates won on 8 March : 7 States won : 25
HILLARY CLINTON : 1,468 Delegates won on 8 March : 5 States won : 16
Delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,025 .

Dirty dogfight
But a former adviser told the BBC earlier this week that the Illinois senator 's exit date was a " best - case scenario " that he would revisit if he became president .
Campaigning in Mississippi , Mrs Clinton also called for an end to the Iraq involvement .
" He [ Mr Obama ] has attacked me continuously for having no hard exit date , and now we learn he does n't have one , in fact he does n't have a plan at all , " she said .
Both candidates have reported massive fund - raising totals for February , with Mr Obama bringing in $ 55 m ( £ 28 m ) and Mrs Clinton $ 35 m ( £ 17 m ) .
Running mates ?
Amid the intense rivalry , Mr Obama has played down the possibility he could run as Mrs Clinton 's vice - president .
There were large turnouts at the caucuses in Wyoming
" You wo n't see me as a vice presidential candidate - you know , I 'm running for president , " he told CBS affiliate KTVQ - TV on Friday .
" We have won twice as many states as Senator Clinton , and have a higher popular vote , and I think we can maintain our delegate count . "
Mrs Clinton has previously hinted she would consider sharing the ticket , with Mr Obama as her vice - presidential candidate .
After Tuesday 's primary in Mississippi , in which 33 Democratic delegates will be awarded , the next major battle will be the Pennsylvania primary on 22 April , with 158 delegates up for grabs .
Debate on whether to hold fresh ballots in Florida and Michigan also continues .
Both states breached party rules by holding primary elections before 5 February and therefore their delegates will not be seated at the party 's August national convention .
This means they cannot vote on who should be the Democratic presidential candidate .
Aides to Mrs Clinton have indicated they would be open to new elections being held , saying they believe her prospects would be good .
CARLSBAD , Calif .  Marty Ummel feels she paid too much for her house .
So do millions of other people who bought at the peak of the housing boom .
What makes Ms. Ummel different is that she is suing her agent , saying it was all his fault .
Ms. Ummel claims that the agent hid the information that similar homes in the neighborhood were selling for less because he feared she would back out and he would lose his $ 30,000 commission .
Real estate lawyers and brokers say the case , which goes to trial in the north county division of San Diego Superior Court on Monday , is likely to be the first of many in which regretful or resentful buyers seek redress from the agents who found them a home and arranged its purchase .
“ When your house appreciates $ 100,000 in the first six months , you ’re not quite as concerned that maybe the valuation was $ 25,000 or $ 50,000 off , ” said Clifford Horner of the law firm Horner & Singer .
“ But when your house goes down , you ask : ‘ Who might have led me astray here ? ’ ”

The latest indicator that there is more to breast milk than providing food for a baby 's physical needs came recently when Dr. Mark Cregan , a molecular biologist with The University of Western Australia , discovered stem cells in breast milk .
Not only is this a very exciting revelation , but Dr. Cregan is very hopeful that this is the first of many discoveries in the potency of breast milk .
" We already know how breast milk provides for the baby 's nutritional needs , but we are only just beginning to understand that it probably performs many other functions , " Dr. Cregan recently said .
He believes that breast milk takes over from the placenta at birth providing for all of a baby 's genetic developmental needs .
" It is setting the baby up for the perfect development , " stated Dr. Cregan .
It has already been established that breastfed babies have an IQ edge over their formula - fed peers .
There are also a host of immune - system boosts that a baby receives when breastfed .
Scientists are now maintaining that these health benefits carry a baby on into their adult life as well .
Dr. Cregan 's message is clear .
" The point is that many mothers see milk as identical  formula milk and breast milk look the same so they must be the same .
But we know now that they are quite different and a lot of the effects of breast milk versus formula do n't become apparent for decades .
Formula companies have focused on matching breast milk 's nutritional qualities but formula can never provide the developmental guidance , " he says .
Dr. Cregan received his PhD at the University of Western Australia , specializing in the cellular composition of breast milk .
The focus of Dr. Cregan 's research at this time is the cellular composition of breast milk in relation to milk synthesis , milk removal and potential lactation difficulties , as well as the potential use of breast milk in breast cancer research .
His research team cultured the cells of human breast milk and the result was positive for the stem cell marker , nestin .
Further analysis has shown that the cells could potentially be " reprogrammed " to pattern themselves to many types of human tissue .
Additionally , the immunity cells found in breast milk have been found to survive a baby 's digestive process and could possibly be used to provide a method of developing targets to conquer certain bacteria and viruses .
Dr. Cregan recently presented his findings to 200 of the world 's leading experts in the field .
He stated , " We have shown these cells have all the physical characteristics of stem cells .
What we will do next is to see if they behave like stem cells . "
If this is found to be the case , the stem cells in breast milk will provide science with an ethical method of harvesting stem cells for research .

Great tool unless you 're going into some more complex text such as ASCII and such .
One issue I 'm coming across , however , is that I sometimes get a " unable to create temporary file " that gets spammed , but then it says the replacement is done and it moves onto the next file .
Seeing the results APPEARS to work , so I 'm assuming it spams the ability to create the file until it works , but you see the attempts made as errors .
Is this assumption correct ?
If so , I 'd imagine the errors is due to the system not deleting the previous temporary file quick enough and it spams it until the previous has been removed .
