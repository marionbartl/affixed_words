The world 's biggest banks are urging the EU and US to back down on threats to clamp down on their industry which they insist will damage consumers and investors and hinder plans for an international approach through the G20 .
In a letter to US treasury secretary Tim Geithner and EU markets commissioner Michel Barnier , the bankers warn of their concerns " that the US and EU are pursuing regulatory reforms in a manner that could conflict with G20 reform commitments , potentially resulting in a fragmented transatlantic capital market , to the detriment of consumers , investors and other market participants " .
The banks , represented by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , are particularly concerned about the US plans for the Volcker rule , intended to stop banks engaging in risky trading activities , and Europe 's planned curbs on hedge funds .
" The financial regulatory reforms currently being proposed and adopted by the US and EU will directly affect our firms ' ability to provide the products and services our customers demand , " the groups warned .
" Fragmented or conflicted regulation , even when the policy rationales are identical , will complicate the ability of market intermediaries , investors and those seeking to raise capital to conduct business efficiently , " they added .
The organisations are raising their concerns at a time when the industry is warning that plans to make banks hold more capital could actually make them lend less money .
Last week HSBC gave a clear warning that a new credit crunch could be sparked if new rules were introduced too quickly .
Bankers admit that regulatory change is needed but would rather it followed an international approach , particularly as the G20 leaders had published principles during the banking crisis which major countries pledged to follow .
President Barack Obama appeared to break ranks with the G20 when he outlined plans to impose restrictions on banks ' activities – although it is far from clear that the legislation will be passed to allow his proposals to be implemented .
In their letter , the bankers made the point that the " health of our respective economies is inextricably connected , with trade and cross - border investment flows linking the transatlantic economies and capital markets " .
Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the first draft of the human genome .
It has provided tremendous insight into human genes , and formidable advances in biotechnology have accompanied this genomic breakthrough .
However , the way these genes and their products interact with one another still has to be fully understood .
Maths plays a central role in this understanding , partly because new biotechnologies produce vast amounts of data that have to be coped with somehow .
But it 's not just about quantity — mathematical models of genetic processes can provide qualitative insight into how things work .
In our work at University College London a pretty straightforward model has helped to understand molecular processes that are relevant to cancer biology .
What does DNA do ?
What causes a healthy cell to become cancerous ?
DNA is important to the functioning of cells because it acts as a template for proteins , which are among the active molecular agents in cells .
Turning the information coded in the DNA into proteins is not a straightforward process .
There is an intermediary molecule , aptly named messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , which is produced by a molecular apparatus called RNA polymerase .
RNA polymerase reads the information on the DNA and produces mRNA molecules as it slides along the DNA .
This first step is termed transcription and the mRNA molecule is called a transcript .
A gene is a part of DNA that codes for a specific protein .
The second step is called translation .
Here the mRNA molecule is treated by another molecular machine , the ribosome .
It reads the mRNA to produce chains of amino acids , which when folded become active proteins .
A single molecule of mRNA can be used several times to produce more than one protein .
Only a portion of the DNA codes for proteins and in certain organisms that portion is actually quite small .
For example , in us humans , only 2 % of the DNA codes for proteins .
Another twist is that in an individual cell not all coding portions of the DNA are used .
This is because individual cells in multicellular organisms typically perform specialised functions — a liver cell is different from a skin cell — so they do n't need the entire coding repertoire contained in the DNA .
In the same vein , not all proteins are being continuously produced , as some of them are needed on specific occasions only .
How is DNA switched on ?
So , what causes a particular gene to be turned on — or expressed in biological jargon — in an individual cell ?
There are many factors that can influence gene expression , but a major role is played by special molecules called transcription factors .
These attach to regulatory regions of the DNA and recruit the transcription machinery to express the adjacent gene .
Transcription factors can also act as repressors , ie diminish the expression of certain genes .
They can work in combination with other transcription factors , or bind to other non-coding sequences of the DNA .
If this was n't complicated enough , transcription factors are proteins themselves , so they may arise from the work of other transcription factors or cause their appearance .
These chains of transcription factors can branch back onto themselves , creating feedback loops .
In summary , life at the molecular level is rather baroque and understanding how complex networks of genes and proteins are connected and function is one of the major challenges of contemporary biology .
DNA repair
A transcription factor ( blue ) binding to DNA ( red ) .
One system that 's particularly interesting , and linked to the formation of cancer , is the DNA damage response network .
When a cell 's DNA has been damaged repair mechanisms systematically spring into action .
But these mechanisms do n't always get things right .
They can commit errors , which can lead to cancerous mutations threatening the whole organism .
To try and avoid such danger , a cell affected by a potentially dangerous mutation has the option to commit suicide — called apoptosis — for the greater good .
One transcription factor that 's heavily involved in directing these voluntary cell deaths is called p53 .
It has been found to be mutated in about half of human cancers .
So if we can understand exactly which genes p53 helps to express , then this could help to find ways to fight the disease .
Finding target genes
Identifying the target genes of p53 involved some mathematical detective work .
The extent to which a given gene is being expressed in a particular cell can be measured by looking at the concentration of mRNA in the cell — the more mRNA there is , the more the gene is being expressed .
If p53 is implicated in the expression of the gene , then a high concentration of mRNA should coincide with high activity of p53 , and a low concentration with low activity .
Differential equations : a bathtub problem
Alec finds that his bathtub fills at a rate of ten litres per minute but leaks six litres of water per hour .
From being empty , the bathtub is full after twenty minutes and Alec can have his bath .
Can Alec know how much water there is the moment he steps in ?
In essence , this is the problem posed in solving differential equations .
You are given rates of change ( fluxes of water ) , initial conditions ( the bathtub is empty to start with ) and have to deduce a state at some point in the future ( how many litres are there after 20 minutes ? ) .
The differential equation encapsulating it is the following : ' The fraction on the left hand describes how the content b of the bathtub changes over time .
The constant terms on the right ( and ) capture the rates at which the bathtub is filled or leaks , respectively .
Solving the problem means finding the function whose derivative satisfies the equation .
In this case the solution is If Alec were to live up to his name , he would know that there are a whopping litres of water in his bath and also , that if he took showers and got his bathtub fixed , he would make substantial savings on his water bills .

In this case the solution isIf Alec were to live up to his name , he would know that there are a whoppinglitres of water in his bath and also , that if he took showers and got his bathtub fixed , he would make substantial savings on his water bills .
We can make this intuition precise using a differential equation ( if you have n't come across a differential equation before , look at the box on the right ) :
Here the function describes how much of mRNA there is at time
The left hand side of the equation is the derivative of with respect to time : it describes the rate at which the quantity changes over time .
According to this equation , the rate of change of the mRNA quantity is the sum of three terms .
The first ( ) corresponds to a constant - or basal - rate of mRNA production ( the bathtub equivalent is an open tap no one fiddles with ) .
Each gene comes with its own constant .
The second term is more interesting , as it can vary over time .
It ’s a product of two things .
The first is the component which describes the transcription factor activity .
It ’s a sort of profile of how p53 behaves , which is independent of the particular gene we ’re looking at .
The second factor is a constant .
This constant is specific to the gene , and describes to what extent p53 is involved in mRNA production .
For some genes , this constant will be close to zero , indicating that the transcription factor has little or no influence whatsoever on that particular transcript ’s production .
We are of course interested in those genes that are sensitive to the transcription factor activity , namely those that have a sensitivity constant that is significantly greater than zero .
The third and last term ( ) describes the loss ( or degradation ) of mRNA , hence the negative sign attached to it .
This corresponds to " leaking " mRNA molecules .
( Actually , leaking is not quite the right word : the mRNA molecules may be chopped up before having a chance of being translated into proteins , rather than literally leaking out of the cells .
But in any case , they disappear . )
The rate of loss of mRNA is not constant , but proportional to the quantity of molecules that are present there and then ( in contrast to the bath tub analogy ) .
This is because more molecules are likely to be degraded if more are present in the cells .
That ’s why the constant is multiplied by
Finding target genes of p53 is a reverse bathtub problem .
This model now gives us a strategy for finding out whether p53 is involved in the expression of a given gene .
Using microarrays we can measure the quantity of mRNA over time , and the rate at which this is changing .
We can then try and find constants and which make the equation work .
The dependency status of individual genes to p53 is captured by the sensitivity to the transcription factor activity , which is described by the parameter in the model .
To be a potential target , the sensitivity has to be quite large , and the model has to fit the data well enough .
( Note that this situation is different from our bathtub example .
With the bathtub , we knew all the constants that made up the equation , and were after the function which described the state of the system at time
In this case we know the state of the system , given by and are after the constants that make up the equation .
In some sense , this is an inverse problem , and this kind of endeavour is indeed often called reverse engineering . )
The missing link
So far , so good , but it turns out that we ’re actually missing a crucial bit of information – the transcription factor profile described by the function Trying to deduce as well as and from the data at hand would involve creating more information than there was to start with , the mathematical equivalent of creating perpetual motion .
But thankfully , p53 is an important transcription factor and fairly well - documented .
Some of its target genes are already known .
Using this information and fitting a handful of the known target genes to our model , we were able to deduce the activity profile of p53 .
That activity profile was then used to fish out potential targets of p53 : these were genes whose expression profiles fitted the model well , and had a high sensitivity constant
Our predictions were later confirmed by an independent experiment – the genes we identified really were targets of p53 .
The icing on the cake was that a significant proportion of those confirmed predictions were of genes that were n’t previously known to be p53 targets .
Knowing targets of a single transcription factor is admittedly only a portion of the bigger picture sketched above .
For example , p53 is only one among several transcription factors that is being activated upon DNA damage .
By rearranging our model for gene expression and combining it with transcript turnover rates , we have been able to extract the main transcriptional activities governing the cellular response to stress .
We are now working on trying to understand how these activities combine in stressed cells .
In summary , a lot remains to be done to fully understand this system ( and others ) but there is little doubt mathematics will play a central role in this process .

Chevrolet and Nissan both have electric vehicles set to hit the streets this Fall .
But unless you 're extremely lucky the chances are you wo n't be driving one until at least the middle part of 2011 .
Why ?
Because of limited production runs , demand is outstripping supply .
Is it part of some big conspiracy with big oil , automakers dragging feet or a plot to ensure EVs never become popular ?
Orwellian conspiracies aside , the answers behind limited EV production runs at the present time are more practical and pragmatic .
Here 's five reasons why EVs are being produced in limited numbers right now , and why it could be a good thing for the long term EV future .
Limited initial production is less risky .
Making sure that buyers exist for a product even before it is officially launched is a great way to ensure that there is a constant flow of money to help offset retooling costs , research and development and retraining of staff .
As car companies have found to their peril in past years , making lots of something does n't necessarily ensure it will sell .
Exclusivity comes from limited numbers .
Remember what happened when the Toyota Prius launched ?
Every movie star , environmentalist and politician had one .
Toyota created a desirable , ecologically sound vehicle which initially had a huge waiting list .
Nothing says desirable like limited numbers , and nothing attracts attention like an unusual car .
If you 're lucky enough to be an early adopter of the 2011 Volt or 2011 Leaf then expect to be stopped regularly by people wanting to know about your new ride .
It 's easy to make an electric car , but it 's hard to make a good electric car .
With any new vehicle or new vehicle technology there are bound to be some hiccups which need smoothing out along the way .
With any first generation of a new vehicle problems crop up in the wild which were never conceived of in the prototyping process .
Selling a limited number of first generation vehicles allows car companies an easy way to make any final tweaks before ramping up production .
New technology is always expensive .
It does n't matter if the technology is the latest computer chip , the latest OLED television or a plug - in vehicle ; new technology costs more to produce .
Naturally , that cost filters down to the consumer .
High ticket items have less buyers and as the cost comes down , more consumers can afford them .
By that time , the new technology is n't all that new .
Not everyone is ready for an EV .
brabus smart ev geneva live 005
A large proportion of the population struggle to comprehend how the 2010 Toyota Prius works .
In fact , it is often mistaken for an electric car that ‘ you do n't have to plug - in ' .
Range anxiety is also rife .
Many consumers panic about being stuck without a charge , a fear the 2011 Chevrolet Volt should easily overcome with its range - extended gasoline engine .
Initially , more consumers will feel at home with the Volt than they will with a Leaf .
But until the general image of EVs change , many consumers still feel unable to make that switch .
Developing new products is risky , both to the companies creating them and the consumers buying them .
Electric cars are no different .
For now , demand outstripping supply is a good thing .
It creates buzz , fosters good relationships with natural EVangelist drivers , minimizes risk , and proves the vehicles have what it takes to tackle the mainstream auto market .

The federal and provincial governments refuse to recognize the lingering effects of mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows First Nation – a problem first identified 40 years ago , aboriginal and human rights groups say .
The Ontario government has yet to take responsibility for allowing a paper mill to dump 20,000 pounds of mercury into the Wabigoon River between 1962 and 1970 , said Grassy Narrows Chief Simon Fobister at a press conference to mark the 40th anniversary of the provincial ban on fishing the river .
Grassy Narrows is a community of nearly 1,000 people about an hour outside of Kenora .
Health problems and unemployment are the legacy of mercury poisoning , Fobister said .
He wants mercury safety guidelines revised and the poisoning of his people recognized .
A newly translated study by Japanese scientists Dr. Masazumi Harada indicates 79 per cent of 187 people tested in 2002 and 2004 had or may have had Minimata disease – a condition arising from exposure to methyl - mercury .
Tremors , tunnel vision , impaired hearing and speech and loss of muscular co-ordination and sensation in the extremities are hallmarks of the condition .
Premier Dalton McGuinty responded to the chief ’s concerns by saying the province has a “ heavy responsibility ” to study Harada ’s findings , because they conflict with what the federal government claims – that mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows is under control .
“ It seems we have conflicting data and information , ” McGuinty told reporters in Peterborough where he was visiting a health clinic .
“ We have a report , apparently , which says we have a continuing problem and this contrasts with the federal government which is saying , ‘ Well , things are under control ’ . ”
Harada first tested community members in 1975 .
He found people with mercury levels over three times the Health Canada limit in Grassy Narrows and seven times the limit in White Dog .
When Harada returned in 2004 , the people he tested in 1975 with mercury levels in their bodies considered above health guidelines were dead .
Grassy Narrows residents were told not to eat the fish due to mercury contamination in the 1970s , said Fobister .
“ Over the years we have fought hard to find the truth as to how widespread this contamination was , ” he said .
Grassy Narrows grandmother Barbara Fobister travelled 36 hours by train with her granddaughter Latoya Assin to be at the press conference and the planned Wednesday rally at Queen ’s Park .
Latoya , 9 , does not eat the fish or drink the water at home on Grassy Narrows .
“ It is too polluted , ” Assin said .
Grassy Narrows people say Health Canada stopped testing them for mercury poisoning nearly 10 years ago because their mercury levels were well below federal guidelines .
People began to eat the fish again .
While the federal and provincial governments say contamination is no longer a problem , Harada ’s research indicates the possibility of congenital Minamata disease is high , said Ontario Regional Chief Angus Toulouse .
Children are being born with neurological problems , mental deficiency and cerebral palsy , he said .
“ What the people of Grassy Narrows seek is justice – for those that have passed on , those that are living and those that have yet to be born , ” Toulouse said .
The situation in Grassy Narrows is “ utterly shocking ” said Amnesty International ’s Craig Benjamin .
“ One ca n’t imagine this kind of injustice going unaddressed for 40 years in a non-aboriginal community , ” he said .
Many in Grassy Narrows are sick , unemployed and live in poverty due to poisoning , he said .
“ It is as if the kind of severe health problems and chronic unemployment are more acceptable because it is on a reserve . ”

IT IS not the invasion of Normandy , but by peacetime standards the flotilla stationed about 65 km ( 40 miles ) off the Louisiana coast is a mightily impressive one .
Where once the ill - fated Deepwater Horizon drilling rig floated in solitary splendour , there are now two similar rigs , along with the Discoverer Enterprise , a drilling ship ; the Viking Poseidon , which knows how to install things on the sea floor ; four mother ships for remotely operated underwater vehicles ; various barges and supply vessels ; and the Q4000 , a rig that specialises in repairing and closing wells .
If the well that the Deepwater Horizon was in the process of closing off four weeks ago continues to spray oil into the sea for months to come , it wo n't be for a lack of expensive , sophisticated and improbable - looking hardware a mile up above it .
It is that mile which is the problem .
The oil industry has been fixing blowouts for more than a century .
The challenge is doing it under 150 atmospheres of pressure with the tools and lights of a robot mini-submarine that gets its power and instructions by way of a cable .
Under these conditions well - laid plans can come to naught , as they did when icy methane hydrates that form when natural gas gets mixed up with cold water at high pressure scuppered plans to funnel the leaking oil up to Discoverer Enterprise .
The hydrates did not just clog the pipes , they also buoyed up the 125 - tonne cofferdam that had been lowered over the leak , lifting it right off the sea bed .
On May 16th , though , oil did start to be collected , thanks to a subtler intervention .
Oil is currently escaping from two leaks , one at each end of the well 's riser .
The riser connected Deepwater Horizon to its blowout preventer , a stack of valves on the sea floor which marked the top of the well proper ( see illustration ) .
When the rig sank , the riser broke near the top while remaining attached to the blowout preventer at the bottom , bending itself like a pretzel in its subsequent collapse .
Some oil is now flowing from where the riser and the blowout preventer meet ; most is coming from the broken end of the riser , which has ended up about 300 metres away on the sea floor .
It is from a tube slipped into that distal end that oil is now being pumped up to Discoverer Enterprise and its attendant barges .
The insertion device , about a fifth of the diameter of the riser itself , is not supposed to block the flow of oil completely .
If it did , the pressure of the oil would blow it out of the riser like a cork in a hose .
Instead it sucks at the oil flowing around it , but gauging how hard to suck is tricky .
Without enough suction more oil than necessary would continue to leak out ; too much and it will let in water which will make the formation of those pesky hydrates more likely .
Other anti-hydrate measures include a small pipe feeding methanol , an antifreeze , into the maw of the riser , and hot water circulating through a sleeve to warm the pipe bringing the oil to the surface .
According to Kent Wells , vice - president of BP , the oil company in overall charge of the project , the amount of oil coming up through the pipe had risen to 2,000 barrels a day by May 17th .
What fraction of the whole that represents is unclear .
The American government has estimated that about 5,000 barrels a day are pouring out of the well .
Other analysts reckon the flow rate may be five or ten times higher , on the basis of video images from mini-submarines and the area and thickness of the slicks at the surface .
A well might produce 50,000 barrels a day .
BP is keeping mum , but it does say that the plume of leaking oil looks significantly different now that suction is being applied .
That suggests 2,000 barrels a day is a noticeable fraction of the whole .
Full fathom five hundred
The next step is to try to staunch the flow proper with drilling mud , a mixture of water and clay minerals .
The well is gushing because of the pressure the oil is under in its reservoir 4,300 metres below the sea bed .
If drilling mud can be forced into the well under even greater pressure — a technique called “ top kill ” — it will eventually reach a depth where the weight of the column of drilling mud exerts enough pressure to stop any oil flowing upwards .
The tough bit is getting the requisite amount of drilling mud far enough down the well .
To do this , BP has been replumbing and rewiring the blowout preventer , paying particular attention to its choke pipe and the kill pipe .
These provide access to the central bore of the well underneath most of the heavy valves which should have closed off the flow of oil , but for some reason did not .
The two pipes , which originally went up to the Deepwater Horizon , have been reconnected with heavyweight hoses to a metal framework called a manifold that has been installed nearby .
Above it the Q4000 rig and three attendant vessels have 50,000 barrels of peculiarly heavy drilling mud and pumps capable of providing 30,000 horsepower with which to muscle that mud into the well .
The blowout preventer 's control pod , which was also originally connected to the lost rig , has been taken up to the Q4000 , where it has been tested and attached to new cables .
The pod should soon be on its way back down for reattachment to the preventer .
The Q4000 will then have control over the valves that connect the choke and kill lines to the well proper .
One reason why all this is taking time is that there are now up to 14 remotely operated underwater vehicles working around the well .
A “ simultaneous operations ” unit is needed to choreograph the complex dance of vessels , submersibles and rigs .
Mr Wells says that once the control pod has been reinstalled on the blowout preventer and the manifold is attached to the Q4000 , the top kill could start .
The control pod will open the valves that allow the drilling mud to be forced into the well .
At that point the fluid - dynamics equivalent of a titanic arm - wrestling match will get under way , with the surface vessels ' pumps trying to push the mud down the well while the rising oil tries to push it out .
If the oil wins , then the team will try a “ junk shot ” .
The manifold has two containers full of various sorts of rubber and plastic that are particularly good at gumming things up ( Mr Wells prefers to call this a “ bridging agent ” ) .
Open and close a few valves on the manifold and the drilling mud from the surface can squirt one of these junk shots down the pipes and into the blowout preventer .
The oil pressure will force it up into the heart of the stack of valves .
There , by making it harder for anything to get out of the top , the junk will give the drilling mud a better chance in a second bout of arm wrestling .
The second container of junk provides another shot .
If both barrels fail there is the possibility of putting a new blowout preventer on top of the old one .
That would mean cutting the existing riser , but now that the siphon inserted into it is bringing oil up to the barges it means risking a serious setback .
So it may be wiser to wait for the relief wells that are being drilled to get down to the point , 4,000 metres below the sea bed , where they will intersect the existing well .
At that depth stopping the flow with a deadweight of drilling fluid should create few problems , once the exceedingly difficult challenge of hitting the well is met .
So far , the first relief well is only about 1,000 metres or so below the sea bed , and the second has only just been started .
Underwater spraying
Not all the remotely operated vehicles at the site have been involved in replumbing kill lines , hooking up manifolds and supporting the relief wells .
Some have been swanning around spraying chemical dispersants into the oily waters .
If the top kills do not work this spraying may also help limit the damage done by the oil before the relief wells are finished .
Dispersants consist of surfactants ( which are like detergents ) in a solvent .
When applied to a slick of oil they are meant to break it up into tiny droplets which disperse widely and are broken down by bacteria .
The use of dispersants reduces the chances of direct exposure to oil by birds , fish , sea animals and everything ashore , but it may increase the risks for things on the sea floor in some circumstances .
This is why they can not be used everywhere .
They are also toxic , though a lot less so than oil itself .
In the early days of the spill Corexit 9527 , the manufacture of which requires a solvent that has been linked with health problems in workers spraying the stuff , was used because there was not enough of its less toxic version , Corexit 9500 , to hand .
BP has been criticised for its exclusive use of these two chemicals , which have been around for decades .
Inevitably companies have claimed to offer products that are more effective and less toxic .
Although BP had at first said it was not considering any other dispersants , a source at the company says it is now evaluating four additional dispersants , already approved by America 's Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , and assessing the reliability of supply as well as toxicity .
By mid-week some 582,000 gallons of dispersant had been sprayed since the emergency began .
Spraying dispersants in new ways , rather than using new formulations , may make more of a difference .
BP thinks spraying dispersants into the oil plume where it leaves the riser may be 20 times more effective than waiting until it reaches the surface .
If so , the 45,000 gallons so far sprayed at depth may have done more good than all the spraying at the surface .
Three trials of this technique have been made by the EPA , the first two being inconclusive due to logistical difficulties .
The EPA has been trying to find out whether oil treated with dispersants at depth behaves in the way one would expect if dispersed higher up .
It also wanted to make sure there were no problems with oxygen levels .
The bugs which eat oil use oxygen to do so , so slightly lower levels would be a good indicator that they are at work .
There is a risk , though , that the bugs might eat up all the available oxygen — which would harm other things and then stop any further oil - eating .
On May 17th , after the third of the trials at the well , the EPA approved the deep - sea use of dispersants , and BP is now preparing a ship to provide the analysis and monitoring that continuous spraying will require .
Research into dealing with spilled oil is limited , and breakthroughs are scarce .
If spraying at source really is as good or better than surface spraying , and requires a great deal less dispersant , it will be a boon .
There will be plenty of lessons to learn from the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Once the leaks have been stopped , Mr Wells hopes to get the failed blowout preventer to the surface so that it is at last possible to see what really went wrong .
It is not just the engineering response to future oil spills that will be affected , but also working practices , safety systems and regulation .
The future safety of offshore drilling for both the roughnecks and the environment will be shaped by what happens a mile below .
TRENTON
— Lawmakers have approved a plan to delay the start of New Jersey 's legal medical marijuana program by three months .
Republican Gov. Chris Christie asked for the delay .
The state Senate approved it 27 - 5 on Monday .
The Assembly followed suit with a 71 - 1 vote with six abstentions Tuesday morning .
The Legislature passed earlier this year a law to allow patients with certain chronic conditions to buy pot from alternative treatment centers .
Legal sales were to start in October .
The delay allows health officials to write regulations .
It also may give politicians time to consider a different model for the program .
Christie has suggested having the marijuana grown at Rutgers University and distributed by hospitals .
Medical marijuana advocates oppose the delay .

In this week 's " Ask a Physicist " we figure out whether there 's a universe out there with another version of you , and whether you could kill her and take her place .
Advertisement
For this week 's " Ask a Physicist " I 'll answer a question put to me by our own Annalee Newitz who wants to know :
Do we live in a multiverse or not ?
And if yes , what is the likelihood that other universes will have versions of us in them , the way they do on Fringe or in Iain Banks ' novel Transition ?
Advertisement
I 'll go out on a limb from the outset and say with as much definiteness as we 're able : " probably , " but I 'm also going to add some lawyer - talk .
Even if your double exists , you can't ever meet alternate Annalee , or kill her and take her place .
Not even with a heaping dose of septus .
Those of you who are only reading this in the hopes of making out with your double can stop reading now , though I should point out that it 's worth staying tuned for the carnage that 's likely to ensue in the comments section alone .
You should also feel free to follow up with your own question , or check out my book .
But before doing any of that , let 's start with a bit of nerdly taxonomy .
There are lots of different kinds of multiverses .
Fortunately for us , Max Tegmark at M.I.T. came up with a nice hierarchy of them .
Without any further ado :
Level 1 : The universe is big , very big , but in a normal sort of way .
It 's so big , in fact , that we can't see to the ends of it , even with light traveling toward us since the beginning of time .
We can only see to a distance of about 50 billion light years , a distance known as the horizon .
Some smarty - pants on the internet is no doubt going to note that since the universe is only about 14 billion years old , we should n't be able to see further than that many light years .
True , except that the universe has been expanding this whole time , which changes the calculation somewhat .

Regardless of the exact distance , the universe has a horizon , and nothing outside the horizon could possibility have affected what happens here on earth .
You might think of everything within the horizon as being our " universe . "
But what 's beyond the horizon ?
The first instant or so of the multiverse was pretty active , and the first 10 - 35 seconds , especially so .
The current theory ( for reasons I 'll get into another time if someone has the burning desire to ask ) is that at for a brief instant , the universe underwent a tremendous exponential expansion known as inflation making small patches of the universe about 10100 times larger than they started out .

Are there an infinite number of these patches ?
Or is it more like a Pacman universe , where if you went far enough in one direction , in principle you 'd get back to where you started ?
We honestly do n't know , but the point is that even if we do live in a Pacman universe , the size of the screen is humungous .
So we do live in a multiverse .
There are other regions of space with the exact same laws of physics as ours , but which lie outside of our horizon just as we lie outside of theirs .
For all intents and purposes , these are different universes than our own .

How big does a Level 1 Multiverse have to be before we start getting exact duplicates of everybody ?
Pretty damn big .
Tegmark estimates it at around 1010 ^ 29 meters from here .
This is the biggest number that 's going to come up in this discussion outside of infinity itself .
What this means is that every atom in the duplicate universe is in precisely the same spot and moving with the same speed ( up to the limits of quantum uncertainty ) as in our own universe .
That means that even if alternate Annalee did n't have exactly the same history as our own , her brain is configured so that she thinks she did .
Of course , if the universe were infinite ( and I 'm not convinced that it is ) then it would be plenty big enough to accommodate not only a duplicate of you , but an infinite number of them .

It 's humbling , and also a bit creepy .
It 's like you have an infinite number of stalkers .
But if our Level 1 Multiverse is anything less than infinite , it 's not clear that it's as large as it needs to be to have duplicates , although there might be " close enough " worlds .
A conservative theoretical estimate puts the minimum size of our Multiverse at around 1075 meters , which seems huge until you realize that it 's only a tiny , tiny fraction of the space required for duplicates .
The observational limits , primarily from the WMAP satellite are even smaller than that .

Level 2 : Other universes popped out of inflation .
Our bit of the universe grew out of one tiny patch of the very early multiverse , but it 's possible that others did as well .
What 's more , some , perhaps all , of those patches may have physics just a wee bit different from our own .
Electricity might be a bit stronger or weaker ; the strong force ( the one that holds protons and neutrons together ) could be a bit different ; there could be more than 3 dimensions .

Let me make a couple of things clear :
1 . It 's not obvious that this model is correct .
It may be that the fundamental forces really are hardwired in nature , and that all universes have the same underlying physics .
We do n't really know , but I kind of hope that this is the case , in which case there 's no Level 2 Multiverse .
2 . If there really is a Level 2 Multiverse , with universes each with different physics , these universes are n't going to look much like our own .
No io9 , no Annalee , no humans , and possibly no life or complex structure at all .
It turns out that physics needs to be very finely tuned in order to make things like stars or heavy elements , and most universes simply do n't cut mustard .
This is the origin of the " anthropic principle " ( the weak version for all of you pedants out there ) , which says that there may be lots of universes with different physics , and we 're very lucky to be in one which supports life — but of course we could n't be anywhere else and still have the conversation .
The weak anthropic principle pisses off most physicists .
I will say that while most universes in the Level 2 Multiverse are completely uninhabitable , if you wanted to get extra - fancy in your scifi writing , this is the only option where you get to change the fundamental physics .

Level 3 : Many Worlds .
Admit it ; this is the one you 've been waiting for .
If you 've read Transition or , more shamefully , if you were a fan of Sliders , or for that matter , if you 've read any science or science fiction in the last 50 years , you almost certainly know what I 'm talking about .
In 1957 , Hugh Everett , fed up with the uncertainty in the standard model of quantum mechanics devised the " Many Worlds Interpretation , " which is the idea that at each instant , as different quantum mechanical " choices " are made on the subatomic scale , universes split off from one another .
In one universe , you 've got a dead Schrodinger 's Cat and in another , you have you a live one .
Advertisement
People love this idea , because it allows us to think about all the possible counterfactuals in history .
If I were a grumpier sort , I 'd point out that Many Worlds is simply an interpretation of quantum mechanics and it does n't make any concrete predictions at all beyond what ordinary quantum mechanics says .
I 'll let this go for now and simply point out that even if your double does exist there 's no way to visit her without invoking magic .
Advertisement
Besides , the Many Worlds are unlikely to be as similar to our own as we'd like for scifi purposes .
As the tagline from " Butterfly Effect " wisely points out , " Change one thing .
Change everything . "
Incidentally , Tegmark has a 4th level of multiverse in his hierarchy , but the other universes would be even stranger than in Level 2 .

In the end , there are lots of possible ways to get duplicate yous , but it would be far more expedient to pursue the cloning option .

Qt 4.7 has not been released yet , but the curious can download the beta or even grab a snapshot from git .
The big news in this point seven release is Qt Quick - a new approach to user interfaces .
Before I get carried away and start throwing screenshots at you , let 's step back and look at today 's user interfaces .
On the desktop , standard buttons , sliders , text fields and windows still serve a purpose .
However , on all gadgets running Linux these days , gray buttons are considered boring .
Instead , the users want fluid , animated , glossy user interfaces that go with the branding of the device .
This is where Qt Quick fits in .
So , back to Qt Quick .
The solution can be said to consist of two parts : the QtDeclarative module that runs and integrates Qt Quick in Qt applications , and the language QML .
Using QtDeclarative it is possible to share objects between C++ and QML , as well as inserting C++ classes into QML and such .
The QML language is a brand new language , primarily for creating user interfaces , but useful in other applications as well .
So , how does QML look , smell and feel ?
Let 's have a look at a minimal example :
import Qt 4.6
Rectangle { width : 200 height : 200 Text { text : " Linux Journal " font.pointSize : 10 font.bold : true anchors.centerIn : parent } }
Reading the code and looking at the screenshot that comes with this article pretty much explains it all .
Each word starting with a capital letter ( Rectangle and Text ) creates a new object .
The outer Rectangle forms the area that we have to play with .
Then properties are set .
The anchors property asks the Text to stay centered in the parent ( i.e. the Rectangle ) so when the user resizes the window , the text will stay positioned .
So , I talked about fluid , animated , glossy user interfaces and I 've shown you a simple text string on a white surface .
Well , add the following property assignment to the Text and you will be amazed .
rotation : NumberAnimation { to : 360 ; duration : 1500 ; running : true ; repeat : true ; }
Now the text is spinning madly ( as shown in the screenshot ) !
Actually , what you have done is that you have bound a property to the value generated by a NumberAnimation object .
There is far more to Qt Quick - states , effects and cool elements .
Also , there is the whole question of integrating QML with a C++ back - end .
I 've shown you spinning text but the possibilities are unlimited .
They really are .
It wont be long before half of Russia and China will be partying it up in Mykonos .
Life is pretty tough these days in Greece .
With huge a debt burden over their shoulders the Greek government has been forced to think of some clever initiatives to ease their debt burden .
One of those ideas ( you can thank the Germans for this one ) has been for the Greek government to begin to sell many of the 6000 islands that dot the Meditteranean .
Sounds like good news ?
Wait until Lady Gaga buys Mykonos …
Now Greece is making it easier for the rich and famous to fulfill their dreams by preparing to sell , or offering long - term leases on , some of its 6,000 sunkissed islands in a desperate attempt to repay its mountainous debts .
The Guardian has learned that an area in Mykonos , one of Greece ’s top tourist destinations , is one of the sites for sale .
The area is one - third owned by the government , which is looking for a buyer willing to inject capital and develop a luxury tourism complex , according to a source close to the negotiations .
Potential investors also looking at property on the island of Rhodes , are mostly Russian and Chinese .
Investors in both countries are looking for a little bit of the Mediterranean as holiday destinations for their increasingly affluent populations .
Personally , we are wondering if that includes the occasional dictator by way of Iran or North Korea who will be checking into their new five star pensione courtesy of the Greek government or can we expect to see someone like Lady Gaga buy half of Mykonos out and turn it into a 24/7 committed freak farm ?
In its battle to raise funds , the country is also planning to sell its rail and water companies .
Chinese investors are understood to be interested in the Greek train system , as they already control some of the ports .
In a deal announced earlier this month , the Greek government also agreed to export olive oil to China .
Export olive oil to China , while China exports computers , electronic goods and cars to Greece .
That sounds like a great plan to help Greece out .
Property prices have fallen between 10 % and 20 % since the May riots in Athens , as bad publicity has drawn visitors away , Perdikaris said .
But we ’re sure once word gets out that Lady Gaga is buying Mykonos even the hedge funds themselves will go bullish on Greece .
Sort of .
Athens wants to let you know it ai n’t gonna take it lying down …

If you think about it , a lot of the ‘ best practices ’ for using social media can seem completely counterintuitive to companies that are new to these tools .
Take linking , for example .
On the surface , the process sounds absurd : I ’m spending time every day as a social media consultant purposely promoting what OTHER people are writing , doing and saying about social media .
And what ’s worse , I ’m using this as a strategy to increase my OWN exposure !
How many companies would balk if you suggested that they promote their competitors , and as a way to promote YOUR company ?
But funnily enough , it works amazingly well .
Here ’s why :
1 – As I am sharing valuable links , more people will start paying attention to me , and even following me as a result .
They share my links with THEIR networks as well , which means more exposure and followers for me .
2 – This means more people will want to find out more about me , and will check out my site .
This means more traffic for me , and more exposure for me .
BTW it also means that when I share a link to one of MY posts , that it will get more traffic and exposure !
3 – The people that I am linking to see that I am sending all these RTs and traffic to their site , and they are grateful .
That in turn makes them more likely to promote ME in return .
Which means more followers and more traffic and more exposure for me .
4 – By sharing valuable content , I can become a TRUSTED source of information .
This makes people more likely to promote me to their networks .
Which means even more followers and traffic and exposure for me .
And now that you ’ve gotten to the end , I can give you my REAL reason for adopting this strategy : I want to create value for others .
That ’s the TOP goal , because I know if I am creating value for others by pointing them toward writings by other people that HELP them with their own social media efforts , I win .
Creating value is the DIRECT goal , because I know if I will do that , I will benefit INdirectly .
And it works beautifully .
More people will follow me because I am sharing valuable links .
More people will trust me because I am sharing valuable content that OTHER people are creating .
More people will be grateful for those links , and be more likely to link TO ME .
More people will be grateful for those links , and want to check out my site .
So in the end by promoting OTHER people , even competitors , I get more followers , more links , more traffic , and more exposure .
Whole process sounds completely insane , does n’t it ? 😉
PS : I will have data to back up the effectiveness of this strategy in a post on Sunday , be watching for it !

Pimp my shooter :
The amazing bling guns that belong to Mexico 's drug lords
Mexican soldiers have seized an arsenal of gold - plated and diamond - encrusted weapons believed to belong to the Valencia gang , allies of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel and , it seems , fans of hip - hip excess .
Showing just how flamboyant gang members spend much of their ill - gotten wealth , pictures show how most of the 31 ' pimped ' pistols found in a raid on a home in western Mexico had gold or silver - plated grips or were glittered with diamonds .
Three of the assault rifles are almost entirely gold - plated and there was even a silencer plated with gold .
One particularly image - conscious gangster has made his pistol unique by adding rows of gaudy red and green jewels and a Ferrari logo .
Gangster bling :
The weapons were plated with silver and gold , encrusted with diamonds , and one even emblazoned with a Ferrari logo
Identification documents were found at the home on the outskirts of the western city of Guadalajara in the name of Oscar Nava Valencia .
The Attorney General 's Office said he is a leader of the Valencia gang who has worked with Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ' El Chapo ' Guzman .
On Mexico 's southern Pacific coast , the Mexican navy announced that a Mexican fishing boat and its five - member crew had been captured while transporting nearly 5,300 pounds ( 2,400kg ) of cocaine .
Silver heat :
Even the ammunition magazines were covered with silver
Dazzling :
The barrel of one weapon sparkles with the gleam of small diamonds
The 78ft boat was detained on April 27 in international waters , after local authorities received information from U.S. officials .
They found 105 bales of cocaine in hidden compartments in the boat 's fuel tanks .
Some of the weapons , snatched from the notorious Valencia gang , were almost entirely golf and silver - plated
Large arsenal : Mexican soldiers who carried out the raid found more than 30 weapons that had been ' pimped ' with silver , gold and diamonds
The boat is believed to have picked up the drugs in Colombia .
On Sunday , police said they captured a man believed to be the leader of the Zetas drug gang in the southern state of Chiapas .
Prosecutors in neighboring Tabasco state said suspect Pablo Martinez Rojas was detained near the border with Chiapas , along with four alleged accomplices .
They said the suspects carried out killings and kidnappings for the Zetas , a gang founded by army deserters .
Three assault rifles and pistols were found in the men's possession .
Notes from an American on the other side .
Timothy F. Ball ( Tim Ball )
Credentials
Ph.D. ( Doctor of Science ) , University of London , England , 1982 . [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]
M.A. , University of Manitoba , 1971 . [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]
B.A. , University of Winnipeg , 1970 . [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]
Background
Tim Ball was a professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg from 1988 to 1996 .
He is a prolific speaker and writer in the skeptical science community . [ 2 ]
He has been Chairman to the now - defunct Natural Resources Stewardship Project ( NRSP ) , “ Consultant ” to the Exxon - funded Friends of Science ( FoS ) , senior fellow at the Frontier Centre for Public Policy ( FCPP ) , and has connections to numerous other think tanks and right - wing organizations . [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 1 ]
He is now chief science advisor to the International Climate Science Coalition ( ICSC ) and a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute . [ 80 ]
Tim Ball is member of Climate Exit ( Clexit ) , a climate change denial group formed shortly after the UK ’s decision to leave the EU .
According to Clexit 's founding statement ( PDF ) , “ The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade .
Man does not and cannot control the climate . ” [ 5 ] , [ 6 ]
NRSP Denier Connections
The NRSP 's past list of “ scientific advisors ” has also included prominent deniers Tim Patterson , Tad Murty and Sallie Baliunas , all of which are also listed as advisors to the FOS . [ 3 ] , [ 7 ]
DeSmog previously noted that two of the three directors on the board of the Natural Resources Stewardship Project were at one time senior executives of the High Park Advocacy Group , a Toronto - based lobby firm that specializes in “ energy , environment and ethics . ” [ 8 ]
First PhD in Climatology ?
Ball and the organizations he is affiliated with have repeatedly made the claim that he is the “ first Canadian PhD in climatology . ”
Ball himself claimed he was “ one of the first climatology PhD 's in the world . ” [ 9 ] , [ 10 ]
Many have pointed out that there have been numerous PhD 's in the field prior to Ball . [ 11 ]
Ball was a former professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg from 1988 to 1996 .
The University of Winnipeg never had an office of Climatology .
His degree was in historical geography and not climatology . [ 12 ]
Stance on Climate Change
April 16 , 2018
“ I knew right from the start how much the climate changes naturally , and what 's going on right now is well within natural variability .
There 's nothing unusual about it at all , ” Ball said on an episode of Focus Today , a program at the Dove Media . [ 84 ]
The Dove Media describes its mission as to “ proclaim the Good News of Jesus Christ though all media platforms . ” [ 85 ]
August 5 , 2016
“ ' Climate change is real , ' they say .
Of course , that is true .
Climate has been changing since the origin of the atmosphere billions of years ago , and there is nothing humans can do to stop it from changing . ” — Tim Ball & Tom Harris . [ 54 ]
July 30 , 2016
Tim Ball co-wrote an article with Tom Harris of the ICSC , claiming :
“ ' Climate change is real , ' they say .
So what ?
Gravity and sunrise are also real .
That does n’t mean we cause them or we would be better off without them .
Climate has been changing since the origin of the atmosphere billions of years ago . ” [ 53 ]
2006
“ What 's wrong with global warming ?
There are lots of positive benefits to global warming . ” [ 13 ]
Key Quotes
January 31 , 2018
Ball praised President Donald Trump 's State of the Union Address .
He said in a statement at the Heartland Institute : [ 68 ]
“ President Trump demonstrated the ability necessary in all leaders , historically known as the ' common touch . '
It is the ability to talk to all people without talking down to them .
It even worked on many of those adamantly pre-determined not to like or listen to his message . ” [ 68 ]
July , 2016
In a guest opinion post Watts Up With That , a blog maintained by climate change denier Anthony Watts , Tim Ball declared ( Emphasis added ) :
“ The problem is not adequate funding .
It is too many people getting too much money for useless projects because there are too many people in universities .
It is too many people going to university .
The blunt truth is that for the majority of students it is a socially acceptable form of unemployment .
Students getting less than a B average should not even be in university ; for them , it is simply Grades 13 , 14 , 15 , and ( 16 ) .
Some of this over attendance is because immigrant or newly successful middle - class families want their children to attend university . “ [ 14 ]
July 30 , 2016
In an article he co-posted with climate change denier Tom Harris of the International Climate Science Coalition ( ICSC ) , Ball and Harris declare :
“ All this would be humorous if it did not have such serious ramifications .
In the vain hope of stopping trivial changes in climate , activists and compliant politicians are working hard to force us to switch from coal and other fossil fuels , America 's least expensive and most abundant power sources , to unreliable and expensive alternatives such as wind and solar power .
The public need to ask them , ' Why are you doing this ?
Who are you trying to please ? '. ” [ 53 ]
February , 2015
In a guest opinion post at the blog Watts Up With That , Tim Ball said :
“ Pope Francis advocates the global warming agenda of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , with the help of the Obama White House .
Apparently , he does n’t know their ultimate objective of reducing and controlling population generally contradicts Catholic doctrine . ” [ 15 ]
May , 2006
In a May , 2006 interview with the Ottawa Citizen 's editorial staff , Tim Ball said :
“ CFC 's were never a problem . [ … ] it 's only because the sun is changing . ” [ 13 ] , [ 64 ]
Key Deeds
August 2019
In 2011 , climate scientist Michael Mann had filed a defamation claim in a British Columbia court against the Frontier Center for Public Policy ( FCPP ) and Tim Ball , after Ball had suggested in an interview that Mann should be imprisoned . [ 81 ]
In June 2019 , FCPP issued an apology to Mann for what it described as “ certain untrue and disparaging accusations which impugned the character of Dr. Michael Mann . ”
The letter continued : [ 82 ]
“ Although The Frontier Center for Public Policy still does not see eye to eye with Dr. Mann on the subject of global warming and climate change , we now accept that it was wrong to publish allegations by others that Dr. Mann did not comply with ethical standards and wrong to suggest that Dr. Mann was guilty of any dishonesty concerning his 1998 and 1999 research which produced the so - called ' hockey - stick ' temperature graph . ” [ 82 ]
“ The Frontier Centre hereby unreservedly retracts such allegations and apologizes to Dr. Michael Mann for any embarrassment and distress caused by our previous publications . ” [ 82 ]
A judge dismissed a case against Tim Ball that had been brought on by Michael Mann , after Ball 's lawyers cited their client 's poor health and the low ranking of his website .
Mann later took to Twitter to counter climate change denial sites ' spin of the dismissal . [ 83 ] , [ 81 ]
October 15 , 2018
Tim Ball co-wrote an article at The Washington Times with Tom Harris where they criticized the latest U.N. IPCC ’s report on climate change .
The IPCC report found that drastic and rapid cuts to fossil fuel use would be needed to maintain a 1.5 °C target . [ 79 ]
“ In climate research and modeling , we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system , and therefore that the long - term prediction of future climate states is not possible , ” Ball and Harris claimed .
“ The supposed threat is a 1.5 to 2C increase , but global temperatures were higher than today by at least that much for most of the last 10,000 years .
Yet polar bears and the world survived .
No one should take the new IPCC climate report seriously . ”
According to SkepticalScience , these blanket statements that modeling is inaccurate and that the earth was warmer in the past are two common climate change myths refuted by the available science .
June 29 , 2018
Ball co-wrote an Op - Ed with Tom Harris suggesting that then - EPA - Administrator Scott Pruitt “ must ignore the flak and use it only as a guide to drop more bombs . ”
The Op - Ed suggests media criticism of Scott Pruitt for his spending practices is “ a typical example of how technocrats respond to anyone doing things other than their way , they fear Pruitt because he is dismantling unnecessary and expensive environmental policies of the Obama administration . ” [ 78 ]
“ World War II Lancaster bomber pilot Sandy Mutch explained the approach Pruitt should take when he is attacked .
' On bombing raids over Europe , we could tell we were closing in on the target when we started to get the most flak .
Anyone who wants to kill the dangerous and unfounded climate scare … should focus on exposing the shaky science behind climate alarm , ' said Mutch , who passed away on April 15 , 2018 at the age of 98 .
' That is the Achilles heel of the whole movement .
Shoot it down and you win the war , ” Harris and Ball wrote . [ 78 ]
May 27 , 2020
In a follow - up to the previous libel case against Andrew Weaver , DeSmog reported that a judge made the unanimous decision for the BC Court of Appeal that the prior decision by Justice Skolrood was “ taking into account the poor quality of the writing ” and “ based on evidence known to the Court , but not to the ordinary and reasonable reader . ” [ 87 ]
Reacting to the new judgment , Dan Johnson , the environmental science professor whom Ball tried to sue in 2006 , said it was obvious that some people have been taking Ball seriously , in part because he had so consistently leaned on his overstated academic credentials .
Ball ’s “ phony argument from authority convinced some to ignore the science , ” Johnson said .
“ And we need respect for science more than ever , so it is good to see those who undermine it exposed and disregarded . ” [ 87 ]
The case would go back to the lower court to go over some unresolved issues . [ 87 ]
February 14 , 2018
DeSmog reported that a libel claim against an article written by Tim Ball was thrown out due to the letter not being sufficiently credible to cause damage to a professional climate scientist .
While Ball 's supporters celebrated the outcome as a “ A great victory for free speech , ” B.C. Supreme Court Justice Ronald Skolrood was critical of Ball 's work : [ 75 ] , [ 76 ]
” […] despite Dr. Ball ’s history as an academic and a scientist , the Article is rife with errors and inaccuracies , which suggests a lack of attention to detail on Dr. Ball ’s part , if not an indifference to the truth , ” Justice Skolrood wrote . [ 75 ]
He added later in the judgement : [ 75 ]
“ [ T ]he Article is poorly written and does not advance credible arguments in favour of Dr. Ball ’s theory about the corruption of climate science .
Simply put , a reasonably thoughtful and informed person who reads the Article is unlikely to place any stock in Dr. Ball ’s views , including his views of Dr. Weaver as a supporter of conventional climate science . ” [ 75 ]
While the judge agreed that Ball 's intention with the January 2011 Canada Free Press article ( titled “ Corruption of Climate Science Has Created 30 Lost Years , ” since taken down after an apology from CFP for defamatory content ) . [ 77 ]
“ These allegations are directed at Dr. Weaver ’s professional competence and are clearly derogatory of him .
Indeed , it is quite apparent that this was Dr. Ball ’s intent , ” the judge wrote , adding , however , that “ It is very unlikely that the Article and the opinions expressed therein had an impact on the views of anyone who read it , including their views , if any , of Dr. Weaver as a climate scientist .
Rather , the reasonably thoughtful and informed reader would have recognized the Article as simply presenting one side of a highly charged public debate . ”
February 4 , 2018
In January 2018 , more than 200 scientists endorsed an open letter calling on the American Museum of Natural History ( AMNH ) to remove climate change denier Rebekah Mercer from its board and to “ end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation . ”
The New York Times reported that those among the AMNH letter calling for Mercer to step down were Michael E. Mann , director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University , and Katharine Hayhoe , director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University . [ 72 ]
Ball was among a group of climate change deniers who responded with their own open letter , calling for the AMNH “ not to cave in to this pressure . ”
The letter was signed by numerous individuals with ties to groups funded by the Mercer Family Foundation such as Will Happer of the CO2 Coalition ; Richard Lindzen , a fellow at the Cato Institute ; and Craig Idso , the chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change .
There are a number of signatories affiliated with the Heartland Institute , which has received over $ 5.78 million from the Mercer Family Foundation since 2008 . [ 73 ]
The letter reads : [ 74 ]
“ The Earth has supported abundant life many times in the geological past when there were much higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
It is quite likely that future generations will benefit from the enrichment of Earth ’s atmosphere with more carbon dioxide .
“ Make no mistake , the agitators are not defending science from quackery — quite the contrary ! ”
July 2017
When the American Meteorological Society ( AMS ) sent an open letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry , saying “ it is it is critically important that you understand that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary cause [ of recent global warming ] , ” Tim Ball responded : [ 67 ]
“ These are completely false statements , ” Ball said , quoted in the Pensacola News Journal ( and several other news outlets ) by fellow climate change denier Tom Harris .
“ The only evidence in support of CO2 as the primary cause of global warming are the outputs of the computer models used by the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which have been wrong in every forecast or scenario they produced since 1990 .
If your forecast is wrong then your science is wrong . ” [ 67 ]
February 23 , 2017
Tim Ball was a signatory of a petition ( PDF ) organized by Richard Lindzen of the Cato Institute urging President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the United Nations international convention on climate change ( UNFCCC ) . [ 65 ]
“ In just a few weeks , more than 300 eminent scientists and other qualified individuals from around the world have signed the petition below , ” Lindzen wrote in the letter . [ 65 ]
DeSmog investigated the list , and found that only a small handful of the signatories could be considered “ even remotely ‘ qualified ’ or ‘ eminent ’ — but not in the field of climate science . ”
The list included individuals “ interested in climate , ” and one signatory who only identified as an “ emailer who wished to sign the petition ” while some signers provided no affiliation or address whatsoever . [ 66 ]
January 2017
Ball wrote at The Rebel that he had been invited to a meeting on Capitol Hill through Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , who had been appointed to Donald Trump 's transition team shortly before . [ 86 ]
“ On Capitol Hill , Senator Roberts , Tony Heller and I made presentations , similar but shorter , than those we gave in Australia .
The audience included members of the Senate , Congress , and their aides , plus members of the public .
A broad question and answer session followed , ” Ball wrote . [ 86 ]
We then moved to CEI for a question and answer session that lasted about three hours .
In addition to Ebell , several members of the Trump transition advisory team on the EPA and climate were present . ” ( Emphasis in original ) . [ 86 ]
“ The major discussion at our meeting involved US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Conference Agreement .
Lawyers explained that provisions in the Agreement allow for withdrawal after advance notification .
However , their final observation was that there was nothing to prevent the US simply walking away . ” [ 86 ]

Timothy F. Ball was a signatory to a Cornwall Alliance open letter supporting Scott Pruitt for EPA Administrator under the Trump administration . [ 61 ]
“ Mr. Pruitt has also demonstrated understanding of and open - mindedness toward scientific insights crucial to the formulation and implementation of environmental regulation .
He is prepared to hear all sides in debates over the risks and benefits of various activities that come under the purview of the EPA , ” reads the letter .
On January 12 , 2017 , Senate Democrats raised conflict of interest concerns regarding Scott Prutt 's fossil fuel ties .
Pruitt had spent years working to combat the Obama Administration 's Clean Power Plan . [ 62 ]
In an open letter to the Office of Government Ethics , members of the Senate 's environmental panel commented :
“ During his tenure as Attorney General of Oklahoma , Mr. Pruitt has blurred the distinction between official and political actions , often at the behest of corporations he will regulate if confirmed to lead EPA , ” the letter said .
“ Public reporting based on documents produced by Freedom of Information Act requests illustrate how Mr. Pruitt and members of his staff have worked closely with fossil fuel lobbyists to craft his office 's official positions . ”
Pruitt was further grilled on his fossil fuel ties at his confirmation hearing on January 18 . [ 63 ]
Some notable signatories of the Cornwall Alliance letter , as of January 5 , 2017 , included :
December 12 , 2016
Tim Ball was an attendee at a private meeting also attended by Trump 's EPA Transition team lead Myron Ebell on Capital Hill .
E&E
News reported that the event was not open to the public or to the press and Ebell refused to give any details .
The event was hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) and held in the hearing room of the Senate Environment and Public Works ( EPW ) Committee .
The EPW committee is chaired by Senator James Inhofe who , like Trump , has described human - caused climate change as a hoax . [ 57 ]
DeSmog reported that the event featured the “ Who 's Who of Climate Science Deniers . ” Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts , who spoke at the event , also wrote that the meeting was a gathering of the Cooler Heads Coalition and then listed some of the participants on Facebook : [ 58 ] , [ 59 ]
Names mentioned above included :
DeSmog also noted that three of the attendees — Myron Ebell , Randy Randol , and Steve Milloy — had all been part of the Global Climate Science Communications Team in the late 1990s , a group organized by the American Petroleum Institute .
According to an early memo , the group said “ victory will be achieved when [ … ]
Average citizens ' understand ' ( recognize ) uncertainties in climate science ; recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the ' conventional wisdom ' . ” [ 60 ]
December 3 , 2016
Tim Ball was a speaker at Freedom Force International 's “ 3rd Congress ” event titled “ Global - Warming ; an Inconvenient Lie . ” Freedom Force International describes the event as “ a gathering of the world ’s top experts on this subject who will put an end , once - and - for - all , to the myth of anthropogenic ( man- caused ) global - warming . ” [ 56 ]
Ball 's speech was titled “ Global Warming Is the Biggest Deception in History . ”
“ This is a a deception .
It ’s the greatest deception in history because there have been deceptions in the past , but this is the first one on a global scale that affects every single person and every single thing , ” Ball began .
“ The public simply do n’t understand the science of climate change ; therefore , they are easily fooled .
And that ’s what ’s been going on . ”
Ball claimed that schools are “ indoctrinating ” children :
“ We should be teaching things in schools that students need to understand the world , but we ’re not doing that .
School has become an indoctrination , not an education . [ … ]
It ’s not that long ago that in the universities , the old professors had the prevailing wisdom and the young professors came in and challenged it .
Now the young ones are coming in with the indoctrinated views , and it ’s the old people that are saying , ‘ hey , hang on a minute . ’
People like me , and Fred Singer at 92 , and Bill Gray at 86 .
They ’ve completely flipped the whole process of the education approach upside down because of what they ’re doing in the schools with the indoctrination , ” Ball said .
According to Tim Ball , environmentalism has become a religion :
“ Environmentalism has become a religion .
It ’s taken on all the hard marks of a blind belief , and particularly amongst the young people .
Because one of the things a lot of people do n’t realize is that science used Darwin to get rid of religion , okay .
That left a vacuum .
“ And when you went to Oxford University in Darwin ’s day , there were two or three doors to the library : there was the door to the natural sciences , the door to the humanities , and the door to the library .
You go to any university today , the largest door is to the social science .
And the social sciences emerged because once you get rid of God you ’ve got to have some other explanation for why humans are here and why we ’re different than all the other animals .
“ That ’s what the social sciences are doing .
I call it human navel gazing . ”
Describing a story when Ball put his students on the spot , and they did n't quickly make the connection to a biblical reference , he suggested environmentalism could be part of the problem :
“ So you start to see what ’s happening with the environment .
And of course the environment then fills a moral vacuum for them .
Right ?
The mother Gaia and so on . ”

Tim Ball is a member of a group titled Climate Exit ( Clexit ) founded in the summer of 2016 .
According to Clexit 's founding statement ( PDF ) , “ The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade .
Man does not and cannot control the climate . ” [ 5 ] , [ 6 ]
As Desmog reports , another key member of Clexit 's “ 60 well - informed science , business and economic leaders ” is Hugh Morgan , a former board member of the Reserve Bank of Australia and former CEO of Western Mining Corporation with close ties to Australia 's Liberal party . [ 16 ] , [ 17 ]
According to Clexit 's founding statement :
“ If the Paris climate accord is ratified , or enforced locally by compliant governments , it will strangle the leading economies of the world with pointless carbon taxes and costly climate and energy policies , all with no sound basis in evidence or science [ … ] ” [ 6 ]

Tim Ball co-wrote an article with Tom Harris of the ICSC where he claims that “ The best answer to most of the claims by climate activists and their political allies is simply : so what ? ”
“ ' Climate change is real , ' they say .
So what ?
Gravity and sunrise are also real .
That does n’t mean we cause them or we would be better off without them .
Climate has been changing since the origin of the atmosphere billions of years ago , ” Ball and Harriss write . [ 53 ]

Writing at Watts Up With That ( WUWT ) , Tim Ball responded to an article in Vox titled “ The 7 biggest problems facing science , according to 270 scientists . ” [ 14 ]
While Ball agrees with some of the points , Daily KOS reports he ultimately blames immigrants and the middle class for pursuing higher education : ( emphasis added ) [ 18 ]
“ The problem is not adequate funding , ” Ball writes at WUWT .
“ It is too many people getting too much money for useless projects because there are too many people in universities .
It is too many people going to university .
The blunt truth is that for the majority of students it is a socially acceptable form of unemployment .
Students getting less than a B average should not even be in university ; for them , it is simply Grades 13 , 14 , 15 , and ( 16 ) .
Some of this over attendance is because immigrant or newly successful middle - class families want their children to attend university . ” [ 14 ]
Ball concludes that “ “ We can solve many of our problems quickly by closing down 75 percent of our universities . ”
Ball 's other complaints include the “ the use of science for political agendas , ” and that “ some scientists exploit ” the bias of the media . [ 14 ]
March 3 , 2016
Tim Ball produced a list of “ handy CO2 talking points ” to helpo “ defeat global warming alarmists . ” [ 19 ]
“ The ' green ' activists ' focus on CO2 was premeditated and designed to demonize it as the toxic byproduct of fossil - fuel driven industries that was causing runaway global warming , ” Ball writes .
In fact , C02 is a gas essential to plant life , and thereby all life , because plants produce oxygen . ” [ 19 ]
Ball 's list includes a number of common myths that Skeptical Science has previously debunked .
Some examples below , with information from Skeptical Science below : [ 19 ]
Tim Ball : “ The IPCC assume an increase in CO2 causes a temperature increase .
It does n’t .
Every record for any period shows temperature increases before CO2 . ” [ 19 ]
SkepticalScience : CO2 does not cause the warming , but rather amplifies it : “ When the Earth comes out of an ice age , the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth 's orbit .
The warming causes the oceans to release CO2 .
The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere , spreading warming throughout the planet .
So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise .
Overall , about 90 % of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase . ” [ 20 ]
Tim Ball : “ Let ’s assume CO2 IS causing warming .
Then , when its density reaches a certain level , the warming ability is maximized .
But it IS currently maximized – so how will the addition of more CO2 have much effect ? ” [ 19 ]
SkepticalScience : “ If the CO2 effect was saturated , adding more CO2 should add no additional greenhouse effect .
However , satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy .
This is empirical proof that the CO2 effect is not saturated . ” [ 21 ]
Tim Ball : “ CO2 is only approximately 0.0397 % of the total atmospheric gases .
Figure 2 shows the proportional relationship between atmospheric gases and GHGs . ” [ 19 ]
SkepticalScience : “ Saying that CO2 is ' only a trace gas ' is like saying that arsenic is ' only ' a trace water contaminant .
Small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects . ” [ 22 ]

Timothy F. Ball is a signatory to an open letter to Pope Francis on climate change .
The letter invites the Pope to reconsider his views on climate change before his upcoming encyclical letter on the environment , which is widely expected to call for measures to prevent climate change in the interests of the world 's poor . [ 25 ]
The open letter was coordinated and signed by Calvin Beisner of the Cornwall Alliance .
According to the letter , “ Good climate policy must recognize human exceptionalism , the God - given call for human persons to ' have dominion ' in the natural world ( Genesis 1:28 ) , and the need to protect the poor from harm , including actions that hinder their ascent out of poverty . ” [ 25 ]
Another excerpt below :
” […] the [ climate ] models are wrong .
They therefore provide no rational basis to forecast dangerous human - induced global warming , and therefore no rational basis for efforts to reduce warming by restricting the use of fossil fuels or any other means . ” [ 25 ]
Judith Curry comments on her blog Climate Etc. that “ Arguably the most effective ' pushback ' comes from Cal Beisner of the Cornwall Alliance , who coordinated An Open Letter to Pope Francis on Climate Change . ” [ 26 ]

Tim Ball is one of several climate change skeptics cc'd on an email from S. Fred Singer in hopes of countering the documentary film “ Merchants of Doubt , ” which exposes the network of climate change skeptics and deniers trying to delay legislative action on climate change . [ 27 ]
The October , 2014 email was leaked to journalists before the documentary was released .
“ Can I sue for damages ? ” Singer asked in the email .
“ Can we get an injunction against the documentary ? ” [ 27 ]
InsideClimate News reports in their article “ Leaked Email Reveals Who 's Who List of Climate Denialists , ” how “ Many of those copied on the email thread , such as Singer and communications specialist Steven Milloy , have financial ties to the tobacco , chemical , and oil and gas industries and have worked to defend them since the 1990s . ” [ 27 ]
InsideClimate News also documented all those who were cc'd on the email , including the following skeptics and groups :

Sept 1 , 2006
On September 1st , Ball launched a libel suit against Dr. Dan Johnson and the Calgary Herald over a letter the paper ran on April 23 , 2006 .
Johnson is a Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Lethbridge .
Original documents below : [ 39 ] , [ 40 ]
Ball had written an article that attacked the qualifications of renowned climate change author Tim Flannery , in which the Herald described Ball as “ the first climatology PhD in Canada and … a professor of climatology at the University of Winnipeg for 28 years . ”
Johnson 's letter to the editor challenged those details , noting that when Ball received his PhD ( in Geography ) in 1983 , “ Canada already had PhDs in climatology and it is important to recognize them and their research . ”
Johnson also pointed out that Ball had been a professor for a much shorter time ( Ball later admitted eight years ) , during which Ball did “ not show any evidence of research regarding climate and atmosphere . ” [ 41 ]
The Calgary Herald 's Statement of Defence , filed with the Alberta Court of Queen ’s Bench , dismissed Ball ’s credibility saying that “ The Plantiff ( Dr. Ball ) is viewed as a paid promoter of the agenda of the oil and gas industry rather than as a practicing scientist . ” [ 42 ]
Ball subsequently dropped his lawsuit . [ 43 ]

An attempt to shut down the electronics payload of the out - of - control communications satellite Galaxy 15 has failed , leaving the satellite - which ceased responding to ground commands last month - still in its uncontrolled " zombiesat " drift toward orbits occupied by other spacecraft , the satellite 's fleet operator Intelsat said Tuesday .
Galaxy 15 is closing in on the geostationary orbital slot occupied by another C - band satellite , the AMC - 11 spacecraft operated by SES World Skies , and with its stuck - on communications payload will be in a position to cause potentially severe interference with the SES satellite during a two - week period starting around May 23 , according to Intelsat and SES estimates .
The unsuccessful attempt to shut down the so - called " zombiesat " – a satellite industry term for failed satellites in orbit - occurred on Monday .
IN PICTURES : ' In orbit '
In a Tuesday statement in response to Space News inquiries , Intelsat said it is researching other ways to shut down Galaxy 15 once the satellite has passed through the AMC - 11 position and enters — for a limited period of time — a stretch of orbital terrain unoccupied by other C - band spacecraft .
" We do not have an additional specific technical attempt identified at this time , " Intelsat said in the statement .
" But we will not give up , and expect to have other options to pursue at that time .
We are now cooperating with other operators and customers to minimize potential service disruptions caused by interference . "
Galaxy 15 stopped responding to ground commands April 5 and since then has drifted out of its 133 degrees west longitude orbital slot on an eastward path along the geostationary arc at around 36,000 kilometers above the equator .
After sending between 150,000 and 200,000 commands to the satellite to coax it back into service , Intelsat was forced to scrap its satellite - recovery efforts and to resort , on Monday , to a limited - duration effort to force the satellite to shut down its transponders .
This was to be accomplished by sending a stronger series of signals designed to cause Galaxy 15's power system to malfunction and force a shutdown of the satellite 's payload .
That attempt , which Luxembourg - based , Washington - headquartered Intelsat had viewed as its last , best - understood option for Galaxy 15 , was unsuccessful .
With the satellite now nearing AMC - 11 , Intelsat is limited in what it can do besides assure itself of the satellite 's location .
" There is no active testing of the payload , " the company said in its Tuesday statement .
Sending radio signals strong enough to force a satellite to shut down could pose dangers to other spacecraft in the target area , which is why Intelsat had only a short window of time to " pulse " Galaxy 15 with signals intended to trigger a failure of its power system .
That period lasted about 30 minutes on Monday .
" Intelsat fully coordinated with neighboring operators the timing and the effects of this testing to neighboring spacecraft .
It is our current understanding that no SES AMC - 11 customers were affected by the disabling attempt , " Intelsat said .
Intelsat and Luxembourg - based SES have been closely coordinating interference - avoidance options since the initial Galaxy 15 failure , knowing that at predicted drift speeds the satellite will enter AMC - 11's 131 degrees west slot to within 0.5 degrees of AMC - 11 on or about May 23 .
SES officials say they are devising an elaborate series of maneuvers to create a maximum distance between Galaxy 15 and AMC - 11 during the period of maximum threat .
While they cannot guarantee that there will be no interference to media customers using AMC - 11 , the SES officials believe they have the resources , including teleport facilities to reroute traffic , required to minimize the problem during this two - week period .
Continuing its eastward drift , Galaxy 15 will exit the AMC - 11 orbital slot starting around June 7 , when it is expected to have moved to 0.5 degrees to the east of the satellite .
At that point , a new opportunity will be open to Intelsat as there is no C - band satellite at the next orbital station of 129 degrees west .
What Intelsat might do to precipitate a shutdown remains unclear .
Industry officials say the Galaxy 15 problem — a satellite operating at full payload power that is no longer under control — is unprecedented .
Intelsat has said it is seeking advice from satellite operators and manufacturers — not just the Galaxy 15 builder , Orbital Sciences of Dulles , Va. , but also other companies with more experience with in - orbit problems — on possible options to force a shutdown .
Current estimates are that Galaxy 15 will lose Earth orientation sometime in late July or early August .
The exact date can not be known .
But when it loses Earth pointing , its solar arrays will lose their lock on the sun , draining the satellite 's batteries and causing the satellite to shut down on its own .
Once the satellite leaves the vicinity of the AMC - 11 and passes through the relatively safe neighborhood of 129 degrees west , it will enter a new neighborhood where it poses an interference threat similar to what AMC - 11 now faces .
But this time , it is only Intelsat - owned satellites and their customers at risk .
Galaxy 15 will be moving through the operating areas of Intelsat 's Galaxy 13 in mid-July , and is expected to arrive at the Galaxy 14 neighborhood in late July .
By mid-August , it will be at the orbital slot of Intelsat 's Galaxy 18 .

In a video comparison that just screams “ appropriate ” , the Motorola Droid 2 goes one - on - one with the original Motorola Droid .
Looking at the two devices side - by - side , one can conclude that these things are almost identical at first glance .
The Droid 2 does away with those gold accents Motorola included on the original offering , and they also improved on the physical typing experience by removing that ghastly directional pad to make more room for the slide - out keyboard . ’
It ’s usually the inside that counts with an Android device , though , and the Droid 2 does n’t disappoint .
The original Droid sports a TI OMAP3430 processor clocked at 550MHz and 256MB of RAM , while the Droid 2 gets a nice hike in speed thanks to its 1GHz TI OMAP 3630 and 512MB of RAM .
The speed benefits shows in several benchmarks with the Droid 2 outperforming the original Droid in every category ( including GPU benchmarks , which is pretty significant seeing as they house the same GPU ) .
If you want to see more impressions on the Droid 2 and how it stacks up against the Droid , be sure to visit our friends at Android & Me who are today ’s benefactors in bringing us more Droid 2 information than our brains can handle .
The body can heal minor bone injuries itself - but with major injuries , it needs help .
That ‘s when implants frequently come into use .
In contrast to long - term solutions based on titanium , degradable implants are intended to replace the missing pieces of bone only until the fissure closes itself up .
That may last months or even years , depending on the size of the defect , the age and health status of the patient .
A new implant improves the conditions for the healing process .
It emerged from the » Resobone « project of the federal ministry for education and research , and is sized - to - fit for each patient .
Unlike the conventional bony substitutes to date , it is not made up as a solid mass , but is porous instead .
Precise little channels permeate the implant at intervals of just a few hundred micrometers .
» Its precision fit and perfect porous structure , combined with the new biomaterial , promise a total bone reconstruction that was hitherto impossible to achieve , « as Dr. Ralf Smeets of the University Medical Center of Aachen summarizes the findings of the first tolerability studies .
The porous canals create a lattice structure which the adjacent bones can grow into .
Its basic structure consists of the synthetic polylactide , or PLA for short .
The stored granules from tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) ensure rigidity and stimulate the bone ‘s natural healing process .
As pastes , granulates and semi- finished products , TCP and PLA already have proven to be degradable implants .
The body can catabolize both substances as rapidly as the natural bones can regrow .
But the material can only be applied in places where it will not be subject to severe stress :
Thus , the » Resobone « implants will primarily replace missing facial , maxillary and cranial bones .
Currently , they are able to close fissures of up to 25 square centimeters in size .
Their unique structure is made possible through a manufacturing process that was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT in Aachen for the development of industrial prototypes – Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) : A razor - thin laser beam melts the pulverized material layer - by - layer to structures that may be as delicate as 80 to 100 micrometers .
The patient ‘s computer tomography serves as the template for the precision - fit production of the implants .
The work processes – from CT imaging , to construction of the implant , through to its completion – are coordinated in such precise sequences that the replacement for a defective zygomatic bone can be produced in just a few hours , while a five - centimeter large section of cranium can be done overnight .
In addition to the obvious benefits , there is a considerable gain in time during surgery : » No custom - fit , degradable implants ever existed before now .
During the operation , the surgeon had to cut TCP cubes , or the patient ‘s own previously removed bone material , to size and insert it into the fissure , « explains Simon Höges , Project Manager at ILT .
In addition , the operations are now fewer in number : Physicians no longer take the bone replacement from the patient ‘s own pelvic bone .
Similarly , they can dispense with the countless follow - up operations on children to exchange long - term implants that do n‘t grow as the child matures .
» We have achieved our project goal : a closed process chain to produce individual bony implants from degradable materials , « explains Höges with satisfaction .
Now it is up to the project partners – which also include implant manufacturers – who must turn the results into products .
With only six weeks until Arizona ’s immigration enforcement law goes into effect , area housing analysts are already expecting the worst .
According to the Arizona Republic , housing experts anticipate that SB 1070 will not only drive illegal immigrants out of the state , but legal residents and potential new homebuyers with them — “ departures from a state where growth is the economic foundation . ”
The resulting exodus will likely spur more foreclosures and create more vacant homes and apartments , which as real - estate analysts point out , will scare off potential homebuyers who fear lower home values .
With a budget deficit of $ 4.5 billion and an economy struggling to get back on its feet , a declining housing market is the last thing Arizonans need .
The Pew Hispanic estimates Arizona ’s undocumented population at around 500,000 people — many of whom own homes and pay taxes .
But according to Phoenix housing analyst , Mike Orr , many of these homeowning immigrants are expected to leave as a result of the new law :
Estimates are that there are several hundred thousand undocumented aliens residing in Arizona .
If the law has the intended effect and these people do leave , then both population and demand for housing will probably decline .
Likewise , many of Arizona ’s documented residents are also expected to leave the state thanks to SB 1070 .
According to the U.S. Census , Latinos make up roughly one - third of all Arizonans ( 29.7 % ) — many of whom feel targeted by the new law .
According to Jay Butler , director of realty studies at Arizona State University :
The immigration law creates a difficult situation for both legal and illegal residents .
Some illegal residents may have planned on leaving the Valley anyway because they can’t find jobs .
But I have talked to young Hispanics who are residents and so are their parents and grandparents .
And those Hispanics plan on moving to other states because they do n’t want to be perceived as second - class citizens .
Real - estate experts are using Arizona ’s 2007 employer - sanction law — which made it illegal to knowingly hire an undocumented immigrants in the state — as a point of comparison .
According to a report from the Department of Homeland Security , “ more than 100,000 illegal immigrants left Arizona in 2008 , more than any other state .
Metro Phoenix foreclosures and apartment vacancies both jumped that year . ”
Unfortunately , a declining housing market is just one of the many negative fiscal impacts of SB 1070 .
While the cost of implementation alone could reach the hundreds of millions of dollars , the legal fees resulting from lawsuits could also soar into the millions — not to mention the economic boycotts and loss in economic activity ( to the tune of $ 26.4 billion ) if all undocumented immigrants were removed from the state .
“ The immigration law just piles onto our problems , ” said Brett Barry , a Phoenix real - estate agent with HomeSmart .
“ We are already struggling to find the jobs and keep the schools open to entice new residents . ”
As other states consider similar legislation , legislators should also consider the economic consequences .
Clearly the problems within our broken immigration system should not be overlooked , but nor should the critical roles immigrants — both documented and undocumented — play in the economic stability of our nation as workers , entrepreneurs , consumers and homeowners .

It 's like spam opposite day !
This is a replica of an actual 15th - century invention , created to do exactly what it sounds like .
It 's from the personal collection of Erwin Kompanje , a medical ethicist fascinated by forgotten medical discoveries .
Of course , while it flies in the face of everything you 've learned via Maxim and unsolicited emails , there 's a very good reason for the penis - shortener to exist .
Frankly , sometimes over - endowment can be a hindrance .
A painful hindrance .
Kompanje first wrote about this in a research paper published in 2006 in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior .

Pensacola , Florida ( CNN ) --
As oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the Florida Panhandle , a BP official said Saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the Gulf of Mexico .
BP Senior Vice President Bob Fryar said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface .
" That operation has gone extremely well , " Fryar said at an Alabama news conference .
" We are very pleased . "
That 's about 31 percent of the 798,000 gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day .
The company 's progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline .
Tony Kennon , the mayor of Orange Beach , Alabama , confronted Fryar at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced .
Visibly upset , Kennon said local officials have been asking to meet with BP officials for over a month , but their requests went unanswered .
" If you sensed our frustration , you would have been here a lot sooner , " Kennon told Fryar .
" People in Orange Beach are starving to death now because they can't get out to catch the fish . "
BP engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago , said Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the federal government 's response manager .
Allen told reporters at a briefing Saturday that BP plans to shut valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased .
The ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day , still shy of the amount spewing .
Earlier , coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of BP 's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the Florida Panhandle .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as Bay County , home to popular destinations in Panama City .
Florida beaches remained open Saturday but the number of beachgoers was down .
Sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist walked the beach accompanied by " Margaritaville " singer Jimmy Buffet , who is building a hotel on the Pensacola shoreline .
" I saw some tar balls , " Crist said .
" It 's terrible when you see something like that .
It breaks your heart . "
Florida Sen. George LeMieux , a Republican , demanded that BP donate $ 1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five Gulf states and said that President Obama " needs to push them to do that . "
" I want to see this president more engaged here on the ground , working through problems , " LeMieux said .
The oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the Gulf Coast .
Images of oil - drenched pelicans were all over the internet , prompting even more public anger toward BP .
Obama sought in his weekly address Saturday to ease fear along the Gulf Coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
" It 's brutally unfair .
It 's wrong , " Obama said in the address , recorded a day earlier in Grand Isle , Louisiana .
" And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I 'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole . "
It appeared that BP was making progress after capping the breached well head , Obama said , but he said the federal government was " prepared for the worst . "
He cited a series of statistics that illuminated the " largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country . "
They are as follows :
• 17,500 National Guard troops authorized for deployment .
• 20,000 people currently working to protect water and coastlines .
• 1,900 vessels are in the Gulf assisting in the cleanup .
• 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available , enough to stretch 1,300 miles .
• 17 staging areas across Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines .
Meanwhile , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Saturday reopened an area of the Gulf to fishing .
After reviewing images and data , the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles west of the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas .
At the same time , it closed 2,275 - square miles off the Florida Panhandle , extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of Choctawhatchee Bay .
That means that 32 percent of the Gulf still remains off - limits for fishing .
The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 .
Eleven people on board died and the BP - leased rig sank two days later , leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily , according to federal estimates .
BP has struggled to contain the gushing oil , trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude .
Thursday was the first time the British oil giant was able to report progress , when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well .
Even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil , the solution is temporary , Allen said .
The gushing well can only be killed after BP completes drilling of two relief wells .
Allen said the first relief well is about 7,000 feet below the ocean floor .
BP will have to go down to between 16,000 and 18,000 feet to be able to intercept the breached well .
The long - term threat , Allen said , will not go away until a relief well is completed .
BP has said the earliest that will be done is August .
Women and their partners in the United States are increasingly using male condoms when they have premarital sex for the first time , which may explain why teenage birth rates have declined in recent decades , according to a new government survey of contraceptive methods .
The proportion of women who used some form of contraceptive the first time they had premarital sex rose to 84 percent in the survey compared with 55 percent before 1985 .
Most of the increase came from the growing use of a male condom , used by 72 percent of women at first intercourse compared with 34 percent before 1985 .
Contraceptive use varied greatly by the education level of parents .
About 84 percent of women whose mother had a college education used contraception the first time they had sex compared with 53 percent of women whose mothers did not finish high school .
The numbers come from the National Survey of Family Growth , which is conducted every six to seven years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The most recent survey was carried out from 2006 to 2008 , and its results were released for the first time Wednesday .

The ICRC paints a bleak picture of conditions in Gaza
Israel 's blockade of Gaza is a clear violation of international humanitarian law , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has said .
In a statement , the ICRC describes the situation in Gaza as dire , saying the only sustainable solution is a lifting of the blockade .
It says Israel is punishing the whole civilian population of Gaza .
It also urges Hamas movement to allow ICRC delegates to visit a detained Israel soldier Gilad Shalit .
Key message
The ICRC , a traditionally neutral organisation , paints a bleak picture of conditions in Gaza : hospitals short of equipment , power cuts lasting hours each day , drinking water unfit for consumption .
" The whole of Gaza 's civilian population is being punished for acts for which they bear no responsibility .
The closure therefore constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel 's obligations under international humanitarian law , " the agency said in the statement .
And the ICRC blames differences between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority for some of Gaza 's shortages .
But the key message from the body which rarely publicly criticises governments is that Israel 's blockade of Gaza must be lifted .
That message is yet another indication of growing international concern over conditions in Gaza - just last week US President Barack Obama called the situation there unsustainable .

The fathers surrendered wearing sashes that read : " Prisoners of God "
Dozens of ultra-orthodox Jewish men have been jailed for defying a school integration ruling in Israel , but 22 mothers have been given a reprieve .
The Ashkenazi parents were given two weeks ' jail time for refusing to send their children to school with Jewish Sephardi girls , on religious grounds .
Masses of ultra-orthodox Jews staged one of the biggest protests against the state of Israel on Thursday .
They oppose a Supreme Court ruling that forbids the separation of students .
The Ashkenazi parents , who are of European descent , want segregated classrooms because they say the Sephardi families are not religious enough .
Sephardi families are of Middle Eastern or North African origin , with ancestors originating from the Iberian peninsula .
Mass demonstration

As tens of thousands of ultra-orthodox protesters packed into the centre of Jerusalem on Thursday , 35 fathers handed themselves in to the police to begin their two week jail terms .
But the mothers were given a stay of arrest while an Israeli court considered a plea to let them stay at home to care for their children .
" We shall wait for the court 's decision before taking any action , " police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the AFP news agency .
The ruling is expected on Sunday , local media report .
On Thursday , some 120,000 Ashkenazi Jews rallied in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak , near Tel Aviv , in the biggest demonstration by the ultra - orthodox community in over two decades .
The families at the centre of the legal battle come from a strictly observant sect of Hasidic Jews called Slonim , who have Ashkenazi lineage .
They have pulled their children out of Beit Yaakov girls ' school in the West Bank settlement of Immanuel , saying the less observant students would be a bad influence on their children .
The parents follow strict religious codes and do not allow influences such as televisions and the internet in their homes .
In 1838 the First Anglo - Afghan War began .
The British had installed a puppet regime in Kabul .
Without British support it could not survive .
Many Afghans were against this regime .
In four years , British were attacked on the streets of Kabul and forced to leave the country .
The Russians now moved into Afghanistan .
In 1865 they annexed Tashkent , then Samarkand .
The Russian Empire now extended to the Amu Darya river .
In 1878 , Britain demanded the ruler of Afghanistan ( Sher Ali ) to accept a British diplomatic mission .
As expected , he refused .
Forty Thousand British soldiers crossed the border , beginning the Second Anglo - Afghan War .
The war ended with a new puppet on the throne , and management of Afghanistan 's foreign policies given to the British .
In 1884 the Russians seized the oasis of Merv and fought with Afghan troops over the oasis of Panjdeh .
The British considered the situation .
They decided to accept the Russian conquests to avoid war .
There was no Afghan say in the matter .
The Brits and Russians divided up the area , delineating a permanent northern Afghan frontier at the Amu Darya .
Afghanistan lost much of its territory .
As the Twentieth Century approached , both Empires noted Germany 's activity in the Middle East .
( It must be mentioned that these three nations were ruled by one family ; Victoria 's son was the King of England , her eldest grandson , was German Emperor Wilhelm II , and Tsar Nicholas was the nephew of Alexandra , Queen consort of Edward VII . )
To paraphrase an Arab adage ; " Me and my brother against my cousin , me and my cousin against the world . "

Annie surely knew to expect that other immigrant , the tall one from France .
Not yet six years in the harbor , the Statue of Liberty was already famous , even as far away as Cork , for her inscription welcoming the wretched refuse if not for her cold , suspicious face .
What Annie would n’t have expected was Ellis Island .
When her parents had come from Ireland four years earlier , they ’d been brought to Castle Garden , which was neither a castle nor a garden but a scandal - ridden immigrant station at the tip of Manhattan .
Maybe as Annie and her two younger brothers waited out their last frigid night on the S.S. Nevada — they had arrived in the harbor on the evening of December 31 , 1891 — someone explained to them that things had changed .
They and the 145 other steerage passengers would be among the first immigrants sent to a new facility whose opening was planned for New Year ’s Day .
How could Annie have cared about that ?
She and Anthony and Phillip had not left Ireland unchaperoned — had not endured the twelve dark and airless belowdecks days of the crossing , including Christmas !— to be the first of anything .
They just wanted to see their parents and their older brother and sister , who by now were young adults of New York .
To that end , the less attention the better .
There were tales about immigrants being rejected for any reason , from a limp to a lie , and all three Moores , probably to save their father money on the passage , had understated their ages .
If Annie wanted to make as little of the big day as possible , the press had the opposite idea .
Perhaps it was for the papers ’ benefit that the two other ships whose passengers might have had the honor of inaugurating Ellis Island — the City of Paris and the Victoria — were overlooked in favor of the Nevada .
It sounded so American .
And perhaps it was on the press ’s behalf , too , that a “ rosy - cheeked ” Irish lass headed the line to get off the barge as it moseyed into its slip , amid foghorns , bells , and shrieking whistles .
How perfect that it also happened to be her 15th birthday !
( Too perfect : She ’d turned 17 the previous spring . )
But this was not the only detail the press seems to have invented .
“ As soon as the gangplank was run ashore , ” the Times reported the next day , “ Annie tripped across it . ”
Maybe .
Or maybe , as other versions have it , she was so visibly upset by the emotions of the day that the Italian gentleman who was actually first in line insisted she take his place .
Or was it a German man , who was shunted aside in favor of the English - speaking youngster ?
Surely she would make a better ceremonial subject for the Treasury Department dignitary who ’d come from Washington to welcome Ellis Island ’s first immigrant .
Nor was that the end of the pomp : A Catholic chaplain blessed Annie , and the island ’s commissioner handed her a gold Liberty coin .
It seems doubtful that Annie said , as the Times also reported , that she would never part with the $ 10 piece , but would “ always keep it as a pleasant memento of the occasion . ”
Is it more believable that , as family lore maintains , she barely kept it five minutes ?
Supposedly , her father , a longshoreman , took it for safekeeping — it was a week ’s salary , a month ’s rent !— and that night , to celebrate the reunion of his family , drank it away in the saloons of the dismal Fourth Ward , in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge .
Annie may have stepped off the boat and into American legend — the first of 12 million to pass through Ellis Island in its 62 years of operation — but as an actual person she seemed to dissolve the minute she reached Manhattan .
No less than in Arizona today , immigration then held a complicated place in the developing country ’s psyche : both romanticized as the source of American versatility and demonized as the source of , well , immigrants .
Given that , Annie might understandably have preferred to be ignored .
In any case , it was n’t until decades later that the press looked her way again , and by then she was unfindable : “ If she is still alive , she is 100 years old , ” mused the Times in 1977 .
She had landed at the impossible intersection of several dead ends .
The Ellis Island building she ’d inaugurated in 1892 burned down in 1897 , the Nevada was scrapped the year before , and if she had a grave , no one knew where .
Still , as impossible as it seems that someone so lost to history could ever be found again , Annie Moore was not only found but found twice , in two different incarnations — and this past winter we even got to see what ( some say ) she looked like on the day she arrived .

If that image was until recently lost , others , largely fanciful , filled the void for the few immigration hobbyists and Hibernians who valued her .
In 1986 , one such image , on a Belleek commemorative plate titled “ First Sight of Miss Liberty , ” sparked the memory of an elderly woman named Margaret O’Connell Middleton .
The bonny young Annie on the plate , Middleton announced to her family , was her mother : an Irish girl who had come through Ellis Island , moved to Indiana , and kept going west .
In Texas , she married a man descended from the Irish patriot Daniel O’Connell .
Together , they were among the earliest settlers of Clovis , New Mexico , where they owned the town ’s first hotel and where her husband died in 1919 , a victim of the flu pandemic .
Four years later , on a trip back to Texas , the feisty widow was mowed down by a streetcar , leaving five orphans , including the 10 - year - old Margaret .
This American story — plucky immigrant turned pioneer discovers wealth and dies picturesquely — hit a nerve .
Once family members excitedly announced themselves as her descendants , and provided photographs and lore to annotate the tale , the Widow of Clovis took her place as an iconic American .
An Irish - American group began raising money for a statue on Ellis Island , which now included in its materials her prototypical tale .
Within a few years , Annie Moore was being celebrated in the names of pubs , in bronzes , in brochures , and even in song .
“ And the first to cross the threshold / Of that isle of hope and tears , ” warbles Irish tenor Ronan Tynan , “ Was Annie Moore from Ireland / Who was all of fifteen years . ”
Fifteen , seventeen — what ’s the difference ?
The girl arrived in New York closer in time to George Washington than to us .
How much can you recall of your great - grandparents ?
Could you vouch for what you think you know ?
When Geraldine Donovan heard about this New Mexican Annie , she told her relatives it was baloney .
Her grandmother was the real Annie Moore , she said , and she ’d never lived farther west than Madison Street , on the Lower East Side , a stone ’s throw from where Geri herself still lived .
For it turned out that during the years of Annie ’s obscurity , there was a private legend being kept alive by that invaluable fixture of every immigrant clan : the crazy maiden aunt .
It was a difficult tale to pin down because this Annie had died before Aunt Geri was born .
But Geri frequently visited Annie ’s husband — no descendant of Irish nobility but rather the son of a German baker — before his death in 1960 .
Pop Schayer , as she called him , was a warm , dapper old man , with marvelous blue eyes , a neat bow tie , and , despite the waves of tragedy in his life , a happy disposition .
He was full of funny stories , like the one about his wife ’s getting a gold coin at Ellis Island .
Geri wrote to churches and the Irish Echo , trying to set the record straight .
But she was a woman of little means for whom the Internet did n’t exist — and it did not help her credibility that she also insisted that Pop Schayer ’s father , Simon the baker , had invented the macaroon .
Meanwhile , the Widow of Clovis reigned .
It would be fifteen years before anyone questioned her story .
But when Megan Smolenyak Smolenyak , a professional genealogist whose double last name is the result of her marrying a tenth cousin , was researching Annie Moore for a 2002 PBS documentary , it became clear that something did n’t match .
Document after document showed that the widow was n’t an immigrant :
She was born in Illinois .
Smolenyak contacted Ellis Island , which is run by the National Park Service , and a historical society in Ireland , but they were , she says , uninterested : “ They probably thought I was crazy . ”
The only solution was to find the “ right ” Annie Moore — though , to a genealogist , hers was a wretchedly common name .
Without knowing whom she married , it was needle - in - a - haystack work .
Smolenyak dropped Annie from the documentary and put the matter aside but remained troubled .
It was one thing for there to be no Annie Moore , quite another that a false one was still being promoted .
In 2006 , she took to her blog and issued a challenge to the “ genie ” community : $ 1,000 to the first person to figure out what really became of Ellis Island ’s inaugural immigrant .
Even if she ’d read blogs , it was by then too late for Aunt Geri .
She had died in 2001 , still frustrated that the truth — her truth — was unknown by the world and would probably always remain that way .
That truth was a harsh one .
The five - story brick tenement at 32 Monroe Street to which Aunt Geri ’s Annie Moore was taken after arriving in Manhattan sat at the center of a one - eighth - square - mile rectangle in which , having traveled 3,000 miles to get there , she would spend the rest of her life .
The Fourth Ward was at the time “ one of the oldest and worst sections of shantytown in the city , ” as Caleb Carr described it — the home turf of dozens of Irish gangs named for the very streets Annie would live on , shop on , pray on .
They make a litany : Water Street , where her parents soon moved .
( It was common for tenement renters to change locations every May Day , when many leases were up . )
Batavia Street , “ the most Dickensy street in New York , ” in one contemporary description , where Annie probably met her husband , who lived above his father ’s bakery there .
James Street , where in 1895 she married him at St. James Church — surely the only beautiful place she ’d ever know in the neighborhood .
Rutgers Street , where the couple set up home and where their first known child , William , died at age 20 months in 1898 .
New Chambers Street , where the 1900 census found them living with daughter Catherine and son Joseph Jr. Oliver Street , their home for more than a decade , where Theodore and Julia were born and Winifred , Walter , and Edward died at , respectively , 3 months , 3 years , and 3 days of age .
Finally , Cherry Street , where Mary Anne was born ; where Henry , Annie ’s last known child , died in 1919 ; and where Annie herself died in 1924 — so fat , says a family story , that firemen could not carry her down the stairs .
They had to haul her out the window .
She was 50 , and is it a surprise that the cause of death was listed as heart failure ?
This was no glamorous pioneer lady , hit by a tram , no slim and highbred colleen as the drawings and bronzes suggested .
She had spent nearly every year of her marriage pregnant with , giving birth to , or burying a child .
Three of the survivors would go on to have children themselves , but only one — Geri ’s mother , Catherine , known as Kitty — would outlive their father , who continued to work at the fish market nearby and never remarried .
This Annie was not the kind of hero American stories are made of ; no wonder the world seemed bent on wiping out any vestige of her .
Even the tenements she lived in were cleared , to make room for high - minded mid-century projects like the Alfred E. Smith Houses .
About all you can see of Annie ’s life now is her church , though you ’d be hard pressed to find anyone Irish inside .
Much of my family came through Ellis Island in the years immediately following Annie .
So did much of America ’s : Estimates say at least a third of the country can trace its origins through that bottleneck .
For a fee , online ancestry sites help curious descendants open some of history ’s archives .
The results are sometimes a shock .
In the 1930 census , I found my paternal grandmother disavowing her Lithuanian heritage .
Elsewhere , I found my maternal grandfather living with more siblings than I ’d ever heard of .
And then I found something even more unexpected : U.S. patent No. 320,003 , dated June 16 , 1885 :
Be it known that I , Simon Schayer , a citizen of the United States , residing in the city , county and State of New York , have invented a certain new and useful Article of Manufacture in Confectionary …
My invention relates more particularly to that class of confections known as “ macaroons ” …
My improvement consists in combining and arranging with such macaroons a filling or layer of fig preserve or paste , which in turn is provided with a filling of peanut or other nut candy or paste , the whole united and baked together …
A most delicious and attractive article of food is thus produced , in which the different flavors of the ingredients are blended and combined , while the body of the cake is rendered soft , but tenacious and gummous , thus agreeably protracting the degree of mastication essential to its consumption …
In order to enable others skilled in the art to make and use my improved articles of food , which I intend to designate as “ fig - blossoms , ” I herewith set forth the process of manufacture …
Maybe crazy Aunt Geri was n’t so crazy .
Six weeks after Smolenyak issued her challenge , several keys , turned in succession , led to the “ real ” Annie Moore .
One came from Brian G. Andersson , New York City ’s commissioner of records ; after reading Smolenyak ’s blog , he tracked down the 1921 Declaration of Intent — part of the naturalization paperwork — of Annie ’s brother Phillip .
Thanks to information on that form , Smolenyak was able to confirm that this was the very Phillip she ’d found in the 1930 census , living with a daughter named Anna .
Anna ’s listing in a subsequent death registry then led , after several false starts , to her son , Michael Shulman , who was in the phone book .
Shulman and his sister , Patricia Somerstein , believed all along that they were the great - nephew and great - niece of Ellis Island Annie .
So when Smolenyak called , Shulman was delighted to tell her she ’d hit gold ; indeed , he shared the family tale of the $ 10 coin .
But the clincher came when Smolenyak spoke to Somerstein , who recalled her mother ’s stories of wonderful trips to the Lower East Side to visit Annie ’s widower — a man who had once , she thought , lived above a bakery .
Smolenyak asked his name , but Somerstein could n’t remember .
Then she suddenly blurted out “ Gus Schayer . ”
She had no idea that Gus was short for Joseph Augustus Schayer , or even how to spell the last name .
Once Smolenyak figured that out , it took only a few minutes to unearth Annie from census records .
Soon she had located all but one of her living descendants , and Commissioner Andersson had found a notation of the Schayers ’ 1895 marriage in a ledger at St. James Church .
Next , a death certificate in the Mormon genealogical archive in Utah led Smolenyak to Calvary Cemetery in Queens , where a disgruntled sexton provided a list of the names of the others buried with Annie in the unmarked grave .
With one exception , the names matched those of her children .
The exception was a 1 - year - old named James , whom Aunt Geri ’s niece , Maureen Peterson , was able to explain .
Geri had told her about a Mrs. Doherty , who lived at 86 Oliver when Annie lived at 90 .
“ When the Dohertys lost their baby James , ” Peterson recalls , “ and were so poor they did n’t have any place to bury him , Annie offered her plot . ”
In an age when the average life expectancy for white Americans was 47 , and surely lower in the slums , Annie would have expected some children to die .
Life was a cup of sugar : borrowed , replaced .
Perhaps it did n’t grieve
Annie the way it grieves us today .
When Somerstein , who works in a pharmacy , asks me to read aloud the causes of death of Annie ’s children as recorded in the Mormon archive — “ aedema of lungs , exhaustion w/ tubercular pneumonia ” ; “ merasmus ” ( severe malnutrition ) ; “ diphtheria and broncho - pneumonia ” ; “ haemophilia … bleeding from mouth continuously ” : “ enterocolitis for 24 days ” ; “ chronic valvular disease ” — she starts to cry .
“ Diseases of neglect , ” she whispers .
“ Of poverty , ” I suggest .
“ Neglect , ” she insists .
“ I hear that list and I think of Angela ’s Ashes .
I do n’t want Annie to be an Angela !
I think the Irish brought that kind of hard life with them .
It has to do with the British presence .
If you can have national low self - esteem and at the same time be very arrogant , that was Ireland .
“ I guess I ’m just comparing it to what happened to Jewish immigrants .
My father , who was Jewish , was just as poor as my Irish relatives , but no one in his family died as a baby of malnutrition .
The Jews created a lot of organizations almost immediately because no one helped them for thousands of years .
The Irish trusted the church .
What I do n’t understand is how the church they were so loyal to betrayed them . ”
This Annie was not the kind of hero American stories are made of ; no wonder the world seemed bent on wiping out any vestige of her .
But perhaps the church did n’t betray them completely .
How else but with its help could Annie , if not Mrs. Doherty , have managed to bury so many children ?
The “ wrong ” Annie ’s family , notified by Megan Smolenyak , was “ cool about it , ” she reports .
They ’d had a nice run for more than decade , being fêted and hobnobbing with the president of Ireland .
It was all perfectly innocent : “ You could say it was wishful thinking . ”
The “ right ” Annie ’s family had a more complicated response .
They were fascinated to meet one another , for the first time , at a genealogical gathering in New York , and to discover how diverse the line had become , with Dominicans , Chinese , Jews , and Italians now among their ranks .
They could not fail to note how much better off and better educated they were , too .
Putting food on the table is no longer a top concern for any of them .
That a legacy has no monetary value does not , however , mean heirs wo n’t squabble over it .
After Smolenyak split the $ 1,000 bounty between Somerstein and Commissioner Andersson , problems began .
Both pledged their winnings toward the creation of a headstone to mark Annie ’s grave in Calvary Cemetery , but by the time another branch of Annie ’s descendants started asking Somerstein for her contribution , she and some other relatives had become leery of the whole hagiographic project .
The design alone was budgeted at $ 12,000 ; it featured a Celtic cross in Irish blue limestone , Celtic knots , an Irish harp , two garlands of shamrocks , an etching of the $ 10 gold coin , and a sprig of cherry blossoms to represent Annie ’s years on Cherry Street .
“ I ’m glad she did n’t live on Broome Street ! ” Maureen Peterson harrumphs .
“ Instead of such an exquisite headstone , a plainer one would have been appropriate , and then send some money for poor children here or in Ireland .
To me , it ’s just a weight on her chest . ”
As for Somerstein , she eventually gave her winnings to Jane Goodall ’s foundation .
Nevertheless , the stone was dedicated at a ceremony in 2008 .
Among those in attendance was the tenor Ronan Tynan , singing the still - inaccurate ballad .
At a political moment in which new immigrants are welcomed with ever - higher walls , the competition to embrace Ellis Island ’s first seems almost poignant .
Formerly one kind of symbol , Annie Moore is now becoming another .
But of what ?
The nearly bankrupt Save Ellis Island website lists a $ 500 membership level called the Annie Moore Society .
A Gaelic phrase carved on the tombstone means “ May their noble souls rest in peace . ”
“ Some family members want everything to be holy , ” says Peterson .
“ For them , she should have walked over on water instead of taken the ship . ”
In truth , the Moore family story is not so noble ; they were shanty , not lace - curtain , Irish , says Somerstein .
Their story included , as many do , premarital pregnancy , heavy drinking , and , in the case of Annie ’s mother , years in an institution .
Or are those once - shameful facts now inseparable from nobility ?
“ When she got off the boat , freezing her big butt off , her walk up Broadway was not to a fancy home , ” says Shulman .
“ The great miracle is that starting with this totally down - and - out Irish immigrant , look what ’s become of her family !
And in a relatively brief period of time , compared with other countries .
It ’s the American Dream . ”

It was Shulman who discovered one of the two pictures of Annie that are generally accepted as authentic .
In his , she sits on a carved bench holding an infant — thought to be Kitty — whose coat is improbably trimmed with fur .
The other photograph , found this winter in a scrapbook by Peterson , says “ Mama Schayer ” on the back , in Aunt Geri ’s hand , and shows Annie years later , stout enough to fill a doorway , if not a window .
She does not look the kind of person you would want to fight for a Fig - Blossom .
And then there is a third photograph , which Shulman spotted in Ellis Island ’s archives .
In it , a girl and two boys stand apart from a crowd at an immigrant station in the late nineteenth century .
Though the Park Service ’s archivists think otherwise , Shulman and Smolenyak believe the trio are Annie and her brothers .
Shulman points out that the girl is the image of his mother .
Smolenyak analyzes the woodwork in the background to support her case , and this March offered another $ 1,000 bounty to anyone who can prove her wrong .
So far , no one has .
It would be nice to think she is right because it is a dour picture indeed , a corrective both to the former image of that first immigrant as a kind of Annie Oakley and to the later image of her as a singular Mother McCourage .
The girl in the photograph is defiantly ordinary , and seems to stare down the national cult of exceptionalism .
If she is really Annie Moore , she has no more of a smile to offer America than the Statue of Liberty offered her — but no less , either .
She came , did the best she could with what she had , and left the rest to another time .
And if she is n’t Annie — well , she ’s someone else , who did much the same thing .
Australia 's first IVF baby is celebrating her 30th birthday today .
About 85,000 babies have been born in Australia using the same technology since Candice Reed 's birth on June 23 1980 .
Ms Reed now lives in New Zealand and is an advocate for children born through IVF .
While declining to do any interviews , in a prepared statement she says knowing she was the first Australian IVF baby has had a profound impact on her life .
" The best thing about being an IVF baby is knowing that I was loved and wanted well before I was even conceived , " she said .
" On one hand I do n't think knowing I was an IVF baby really did affect me at all .
It 's just like if you 've got blonde hair or you wear glasses .
" But on the other hand , I think having had those conversations at home and knowing a little bit more about reproduction and sex , I was probably a little more informed than my peers in even primary school , high school . "
Ms Reed is using her birthday to lobby the Federal Government to include learning about reproductive technology in the Australian school curriculum .
Peter Illingworth , president of the Fertility Society of Australia , says Ms Reed 's birth was groundbreaking .
" At the time babies being born through this sort of technology was considered revolutionary and really quite odd and unusual and quite bizarre , " he said .
" Quite reasonably many people had fears that we were entering into a brave new world of designer babies and synthetic babies and there was a lot of concern and fear . "
The chief scientist involved in the breakthrough , the University of Melbourne 's Alex Lopata , says there was a lot of attention on Ms Reed .
" There were lots of photographs of Candice when she was one , and the first year after her birth was a prolonged celebration , " he said .
" The birth ... attracted worldwide attention not only because of the media publicity but also because the procedures that we used were published in detail in medical journal Fertility and Sterility in 1980 . "
Dr Lopata says the birth also put Melbourne on the medical map .
" [ It ] acted like an IVF beacon that attracted infertility specialists to Melbourne , " he said .
" All of the international specialists who visited us obtained information that enabled them to establish successful clinics .
The first ones were in France , USA , Germany , Austria , England , Japan and Israel . "
But Dr Lopata says the the triumph was tinged with tragedy , as fears over genetic abnormalities meant the team 's second attempt at a baby was lost after an invasive test for abnormalities .
" Our second pregnancy was lost at 19 weeks following an amniocentesis and the second pregnancy followed the first by about six months , " he said .
" That was terrible and we were terribly worried that there might be genetic abnormaility and that 's why people were doing amniocentesis almost routinely on the first few IVF babies . "
Dr Lopata says he is impressed with the evolution within the field over the past 30 years .
" The technology is really moving very fast and to the advantage of infertile couples , so it 's delightful that this work has led to where we are now and things are still improving , " he said .
Stigma decreased
Also marking the 30th anniversary of Australian IVF is journalist and IVF mother Theresa Miller .
Ms Miller , who wrote the book Making Babies about her experiences , says she and her husband tried for five years to conceive naturally before turning to IVF .
" We were incredibly lucky - we got pregnant on the first round , which is almost unheard of , " she said .
" My little girl Zoe has just turned seven and then a few years later we had a home grown surprise , another little girl Sienna who 's three . "
Ms Miller says she is pleased 30 years on attitudes have change towards such procedures .
" I remember the headlines myself as a kid , " she said .
" Test tube baby - what does that mean ?
Is she an alien ?
Is she long and skinny ?
" People did n't understand what that meant and there 's a young IVF girl in my book who was one of the first 50 and she said she was teased at school because it got out .
" Some [ children ] said , " oh , my parents said that 's really wrong that you 're a result of IVF and you 're a fake " or " you 're a robot "
" She 's now an ambassador in fertility networks and wants to spread the word that she 's a result of her parents really wanting a child and needing some medical help . "
" I think we 've got accept that just as we accept people need help if they 've got diabetes or asthma or any other condition , that some people need help if they 're infertile . "

There ’s nothing like grabbing a cooked ROM for Android and loading it up onto your device for some that fresh feeling goodness .
We all know how irritating it can be when there are delays on getting our updates , even if they ’re delayed for good reason .
So the hacker community has always been quick to the rescue with hacked ROMs so that we can update our handsets before the new versions of an OS is officially available .
It ’s all been fine and dandy until HTC decided it was time for it to stop .
The site Shipped - ROMs just received a cease and desist letter from HTC , where the Taiwanese manufacturer says that those ROMs are illegal copies of HTC ’s “ artwork ” – whatever that means – and should not be distributed .
Perhaps HTC did n’t have a better way to frame it than to call it art , and I ’m not quite sure exactly what it ’s referring to , but whatever works .
HTC definitely acted with the quickness here as Shipped - ROMs is only about a month old .
I ca n’t remember the last time XDA Developers ever getting a slap on the wrist , or so quickly .

Police have raided the headquarters of the Belgian Catholic church following accusations of child sex abuse involving Church figures , a spokesman for Brussels prosecutors said .
" Within the context of a recent investigation , prosecutors have been informed of accusations denouncing abuse of minors committed by a certain number of Church figures , " said the spokesman , Jean - Marc Meilleur .
Police entered the premises of the archdiocese of Brussels - Malines , just north of the Belgian capital , " in order to establish if these accusations are backed up or not , " he added , without giving any more details .
The Roman Catholic Church in Belgium was rocked in April when its longest - serving bishop , 73 - year - old Roger Vangheluwe , resigned from his Bruges post after admitting sexually abusing a boy for years .
Paedophile priest scandals and allegations of high - level cover-ups have surged again since last year and rocked the Catholic Church across Europe and the United States .
The pope has condemned paedophile priests several times and met with abuse victims in Australia , the United States and Malta .

Dear Richard , I ’m an atheist , and although I ’ve only been reading The Friendly Atheist for a couple of months , I suspect my situation is unique : I ’m actually famous , literally , for the Christian music I used to write and perform .
I grew up in the Pacific Northwest , the son of a conservative , Christian pastor .
I began writing Christian songs as a child .
As a teenager , my music was already being performed on Christian TV programs .
After attending a well - known Christian university in the Midwest , I headed for Nashville , where I wrote songs for ( and recorded or performed with ) many of Christian music ’s biggest stars : Sandi Patti , Amy Grant , and many others .
I ’ve won Dove Awards ( Christian music ’s highest award ) and even a Grammy Award , all for Christian music .
Church congregations around the world sing my music .
Music that was written by an atheist .
Even as a child I ’d questioned religion , but I was always admonished to ward off those “ evil thoughts . ”
Finally , while in Nashville , I allowed myself to embrace my inner atheist ( privately ) all the while writing and recording Christian music .
Eventually I tired of that double life , however .
So , I moved to the east coast .
Although I continue to have success as a songwriter , I no longer write Christian music .
It was never more than a gig ; I did it for the money .
I now write songs for major country and pop artists .
My dilemma is this : because I recorded a couple of Christian albums , years ago , both certified gold , I have a following ; people recognize me and assume I ’m still a Christian .
I have a Facebook fan page , where I can let fans know what I ’m up to .
But so many of them are devout Christians who post messages like , “ Continue to do the Lord ’s work ! ” and “ We thank the Lord for your ministry ! ”
But I do n’t have a goddamned ministry !
If they merely write “ God bless you ” or something , that ’s fine .
But I ’ve been deleting the more sanctimonious messages , because I just ca n’t stand them .
While most of my fans are aware of my pop and country work , they do n’t realize I ’ve abandoned my Christian writing , all together .
And sooner or later , they ’re likely to figure out I ’m singling out the religious posts on my Facebook page for deletion .
Although I ’ve done well financially , I ’m not independently wealthy .
So , it ’s important I maintain my fan base and keep them informed about new projects .
I may even record a new solo project , something they ’ve been asking me to do , but of course it wo n’t be religious music .
Who knows what ’ll happen once they realize that .
So , I ’m trapped : If I “ come out ” as an atheist , I ’ll lose fans in droves .
But by not doing so , I ’m “ condemning ” myself to the “ torture ” of fans who assume I ’m still a Christian .
It ’s not that I can’t hold conversations with Christians .
Of course I can .
What ’s driving me nuts is the fact that so much of their conversation is God-centric .
They ca n’t simply say , “ Hello . ”
Instead , they greet you with , “ Praise the Lord ” and such .
( Ugh . )
I ’ve seen you advise others , so eloquently , about not being in a rush to reveal their atheism to friends and family .
Or that if they do so , they must be prepared for the consequences .
My problem is that I ’m , pardon the expression , “ damned if I do and damned if I do n’t . ”
How do I come to terms with this ?
Sincerely ,
The Autographing Atheist
Dear Autograph ,
At first glance , some people might think that the main issue here is an ethical one , centering around your writing Christian music while being an atheist .
I do n’t think so .
It would be a shame for that to distract from what I think is the more important issue , so let me briefly attempt to put the ethical one to rest .
Years ago , you got tired of having to pretend , so you stopped writing that kind of music .
You stopped feeding people ’s misconceptions of you , and increasing a situation where you might be considered a hypocrite .
Good idea .
My good friend , ethics expert Jim Lichtman agrees with me :
If there was any ethical concern about being disingenuous , it was resolved when you stopped writing the songs , and you do not owe it to anyone to reveal your private , personal views and beliefs .
Not then , and not now .
For centuries , artists and composers have been producing both secular and sacred art and music .
For many of them , it is impossible for us to know how devoutly and sincerely they believed in the religion they were glorifying .
Certainly many did , but it is likely that some did not .
For some perhaps , it was never more than a gig ; they did it for the money .
They had to paint landscapes or saints ; they had to write quartets or hymns .
They had to eat .
But that makes no difference .
Regardless of their private thoughts and innermost feelings , by their talent and their hard work they produced great things .
Their creations give both believers and skeptics experiences of awe , astonishment , inspiration , insight , and sheer pleasure .
I think that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder , and artists and composers make mirrors .
When we see and hear their works , we are moved by seeing the reflection of our own humanity , which is deeper , richer and more beautiful than we usually appreciate in our daily lives , our mundane routines .
You wrote wonderful Christian music , and Christians still love it today .
They feel joyful , inspired , and perhaps moved to be kind and generous .
That is them doing that .
Their reaction to your creation is their creation .
They are seeing their beauty in your superbly crafted mirrors .
Now to what I think is the important issue , your tolerance .
I think you should take a long look at your revulsion at the gushier Christians who admire and thank you in their religious terms .
Where does your disgust come from , to the point that you call it “ torture , ” even if you put it in quotations ?
Some of them are gushy , some are more reserved , but it ’s the language they speak .
You spoke it very well in your Christian songs .
I talked about the ethical issue above just in case you feel some inappropriate guilt about your past as an atheist Christian songwriter .
There ’s no need for self - reproach if that is what is feeding your aversion to these Christians .
Years ago when you started to feel conflicted , you stopped writing those songs and you moved on .
You resolved the conflict .
I suggest that when Christians compliment you on your Facebook page , do n’t delete their more religious remarks .
You do n’t have to refute their beliefs or reinforce them .
Take a couple of deep , slow breaths , and thank them just as you do the less overtly religious ones .
Allow everyone to admire any work you have done for whatever reason they have , in whatever terms they use .
Many artists reinvent themselves during their careers .
A few do it several times .
Their talent either outlasts the fashion of their original genre , or they outgrow that genre .
They need to explore new avenues .
When they change , some of their old fans will continue to only like the earlier works , some will follow the artist into the new art form , and some new fans will embrace the artist for the first time .
Sometimes artists will express frustration that they are most admired for work that they do n’t consider their best or their most important .
Artists and art lovers do n’t necessarily have the same agenda .
I think you should gradually tell your fans in simple terms that as an artist you must try many things .
Express your gratitude for their support of your earlier work , and invite them to follow you as your art evolves .
If some prefer your earlier songs , that ’s okay , no hard feelings .
Autograph , your great talent is about helping people see the beauty of their own humanity reflected in your mirrors .
It does n’t matter what the genre is that you want to develop now .
That ’s like the style of the mirror ’s frame .
People will choose various frame styles to fit their lifestyles .
Let them .
Just keep helping us see ourselves in ways we might otherwise miss .

P.S. Hemant pointed out an interesting fact :
Dan Barker of FFRF actually spent much of his career writing Christian music .
He even wrote two musicals for children called Mary Had a Little Lamb and It ’s Fleece Was White as Snow which still get performed and which still generate royalties for him today ( as far as I know ) !
He writes about it in his book Godless .
A porn actor wanted for allegedly murdering a co-worker with a samurai - style sword has died after jumping from a cliff edge following a stand - off with law enforcement , police said .
Stephen
Hill plunged around 50 feet off a sheer rock face after being stunned with a taser by Los Angeles Police Department officers , who had been negotiating with him for several hours .
Television footage of the incident showed Hill scrambling off the edge of the cliff feet first as police moved in after stunning him .
" He jumped down off the cliff after he was tased , " LAPD spokesman Bruce Borihanh said .
Hill was wanted for one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder after attacking colleagues at a pornographic film distribution company warehouse in Los Angeles on Tuesday .
Today 's dramatic denouement began when police received a tip - off that Hill had been spotted at a property in the San Fernando Valley .
Hill was discovered at the property and was cornered by officers at the edge of a steep cliff adjoining the house , where he had threatened to kill himself , police said .
Local television footage showed the actor holding a samurai sword and shouting at police to keep their distance .
Hill , who has appeared in several porn films under the stage name Steve Driver , is alleged to have murdered fellow actor Herbert Wong at the warehouse - style offices of Ultima DVD on Tuesday .
Wong , who had appeared in two films with Hill under the name Tom Dong , died as he tried to help other staff to escape , the company 's owner said .
Hill 's rampage appeared to have been triggered by the discovery that he was about to be fired and evicted from the office where he had been living , according to local media reports .

It ’s time to retire the following phrases .
They should no longer be used , ever , in any context except derisive mocking :
Fast and easy
Putting customers first
The Holy Grail of
The leading provider of
Legendary customer support
Also eschew these words , as devoid of meaning as a yogi ’s mantra and as useless as a simile that does n’t contribute new information :
Authentic
Solution
Genuine
Powerful
Secure
Simple
Innovative
Insight
Disruptive
These words have been corrupted by those who claim to honor their meaning but do not act accordingly .
When a company claims to “ put customers first ” but then uses “ Level 1 support ” as a shield to prevent customers from intruding on profits , we realize talk is cheap .
When a company claims to have “ secure ” payments but then 100,000 credit card numbers are stolen , we realize you do n’t need a permit to claim security .
When a company claims to be “ innovative and disruptive ” but then pitches an idea you ’ve heard ten times in the past month , it reminds us that if you have to say it , it ’s probably untrue .
When 78 % of “ About Us ” web pages claim “ the leading provider ” of something , we are no longer impressed .
Like a song over - played on the radio , like a restaurant over - hyped in the magazines , repetition of even powerful , wonderful phrases can kill them .
Oh I know 21 % of you stopped reading as soon as you saw that “ authentic ” made the list , and shot down to the comments section to unleash a scathing missive explaining how “ authenticity ” is the prime mover of modern marketing , honorable salesmanship , and meaningful relationships .
I agree !
In fact all these words and phrases should theoretically carry meaning , but theory is for people who do n’t need to sell $ 2,600 more software by next Friday so they can make rent .
If I had enough hubris to run around christening years , I would declare 2009 The Year of “ Authentic . ”
Enough !
We get it !
I respect the work of all those bloggers and Twitter -ers and lecturers and consultants who drove this word deep into our psyches .
Indeed it ’s a tremendous gift : bringing concepts like authenticity , genuineness , and give - first - sell - later to the traditionally aggressive , non-engaging , selfish world of marketing .
The more people honor this new code , the better for us all .
Nevertheless , it ’s time to retire words like “ authentic . ”
The misuse is to too widespread , the abuse too deep .
So what should you do instead ?
Be specific .
Many of the dead words were n’t especially illustrative to begin with .
As far as I know , a “ solution ” just means product and / or service , so the word does n’t add information anyway .
Instead , be specific and inspire me .
Instead of “ easy ” say “ so straightforward , you wo n’t need a manual . ”
Instead of “ inexpensive ” say “ just a dollar a day . ”
Instead of “ powerful ” say “ processes 6,253,427 requests daily . ”
Instead of “ disruptive ” say “ 72 % of our customers say they ’ll never go back to a normal email client . ”
Want even more specifics ?
Here
Show , do n’t tell .
Some dead words are descriptive , but they do n’t paint a picture .
“ Powerful ” sounds nice I suppose , but how does that change my life ?
Showing something in action is more evocative than describing it .
Instead of saying it ’s fast , show a speed test ( especially against competitors ) .
Instead of saying it ’s easy , have a video demonstrating your tool solving someone ’s problem in 60 seconds flat .
Instead of saying you have eager , responsive , intelligent tech support , put a “ chat now ” bar on every page of your website .
Instead of a bullet - list of benefits , quote actual customers describing your impact on their lives .
Face it .
My favorite way to start a sales pitch is to make fun of typical sales pitches .
For example :
I know you were hoping for a 22 - slide PowerPoint deck with our mission statement and company history .
I ’m really sorry to disappoint !
‘ Cause I ’m just going to start the demo and let you interrupt me with questions .
Or :
People claim that peer code review tools will do magic things like make your developers smarter or fix existing social problems with the team .
Actually , if anything code review can magnify social issues !
However , I do believe our tool will save you time and aggravation in these 4 specific ways …. so as we go through the demo , see if you agree .
Because you ’re willing to say what others wo n’t , especially when we all know it ’s the truth , you ’ve earned credibility .
Now folks are more open to your claims — even those that are well - worn .
Own it .
You can still use an abused word if you totally , 100 % own the concept .
You can claim “ legendary customer service ” if you back that with first - ring , human phone service , online chat from your home page , quick - response Twitter monitoring , and 15 - minute turn - around time on tech support emails even at 3 am on a Sunday .
Be sure to communicate all that too , because if you lead with the dead phrase I ’ll leave before you get the chance to prove it .
Be the change you wish to see in the world .
— Gandhi
When old ideas become cliché , that ’s an implicit call for new ideas .
This time around , can you lead instead of follow ?
Of course this is a bit unfair .
Quick : Come up with a compelling new philosophy for human interaction and global communication , marketing , sales , and relationships !
Yeah it ’s an unreasonable expectation , and not certainly required , but remember the best ideas often are n’t ( excuse the clichés ) ground - breaking , innovative , out - of - the - box , Earth - shattering epiphanies .
Often great ideas are a synthesis of other ideas with just a smidge of novel insight , or just putting into words what others sense but cannot articulate .
This is the hardest and most time - consuming way to break out of the mundane , but also the most rewarding .
And if you do come up with something , there ’s a lot of people who will love to help you spread the word .
What else ?
What other phrases should be avoided ?
What are good alternatives ?

The Pixies have cancelled their first - ever performance in Israel , just days after a deadly Israeli naval raid on an international aid flotilla .
" It is with great regret that we announce today The Pixies ' decision to cancel their appearance in Israel on June 9 , " promoter Shuki Weiss said .
A short statement from the band read : " We 'd like to extend our deepest apologies to the fans , but events beyond all our control have conspired against us . "
The group did not specify why they were pulling out of the show .
In March , The Pixies were sent an open letter from human rights activists urging them to cancel the appearance because of Israel 's policies towards the Palestinians .
" As much as some of us are huge fans and would love to hear your show , we wo n't cross the international picket line that is growing in numbers steadily nowadays to come and see you , " the group Boycott ! wrote .
" The picket line might not always be visible , yet it is there .
" Are you prepared to perform in Tel Aviv while , just under your nose , millions of human beings are suffocating under a cruel Israeli military regime , denying them elementary human rights ? "
Other acts - including Elvis Costello , Carlos Santana and rap forefather Gil Scott - Heron - have recently pulled out of gigs there .
Costello called off two concerts which were due to have taken place in the coastal city of Caesaria on June 30 and July 1 , citing Israel 's " intimidation " and " humiliation " of Palestinians .
It is unclear whether his wife , singer - songwriter Diana Krall , will go ahead with a show in Tel Aviv in August .

Some of the most popular comments on Cailin ’s video in Newfoundland were about the music she featured by The Fables .
You probably figured out that the music scene in Newfoundland and Labrador is heavily influenced by the Irish .
At any night during the week , there ’s at least one Irish - influenced band playing somewhere .
My favourite nights out are when some friends and I hit up the Irish pubs for some fiddle music and classic Newfie tunes , the kinda music that just feels like home .
Here ’s some of the best .
Peter Street – The Fables
My favourite song by The Fables .
Ca n’t beat that fiddle .
There ’s Gonna be a Time Tonight – The Fables
Seriously , how can you not dance ?
This one reminds me of high school dances .
Heave Away – The Fables
But now we ’re bound for old St. John ’s where all the girls are dancing !
Candlelight and Wine – The Punters
Probably my all - time favourite .
Reminds me of warm summer nights and dancing at the local pub .
Grey Foggy Day — Eddie Coffey
This is REAL Newfoundland music , not Irish .
Notice the insane stress on some of the words .
Lots of story - telling .
Makes me want to waltz with some senior citizens .
The Rose in Her Hair – Simani
Another real Newfoundland song , same waltz style , sad little story about courtship .
Like New Years with lots of tinsel .
Mary Mac – Great Big Sea
Great Big Sea kinda became a big deal , most people have at least heard of them .
But their old stuff ?
Now that ’s golden .
Try to keep up .
Also , if you ever get to see these guys in concert , DO IT .
They ’re bloody fantastic .
Ron Hynes – Sonny ’s Dream
I wish I had an original of this song , because it ’s amazing .
Hynes played this song while opening for Steve Miller Band last week .
I later saw the two girls in front of me who were so drunk they kept dancing on their chairs hitting on him at a pub .
It ’s in the lyrics :
Sonny ’s dreams ca n’t be real , they ’re just stories he ’s read
They ’re just stars in his eyes , they ’re just dreams in his head
And he ’s hungry inside for the wide world outside
And I know I can’t hold him though I ’ve tried and I ’ve tried
Oh , Sonny do n’t go away , I am here all alone
And your daddy ’s a sailor who never comes home
And the nights get so long and the silence goes on
And I ’m feeling so tired , I ’m not all that strong
Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers – Saltwater Joys
Most people love this one .
You ’ll find nostalgia is a common thread in all these songs .
Plus , man , check out that accent .
This island that we cling to has been handed down with pride
By folks that fought to live here , taking hardships all in stride
So I ’ll compliment her beauty , hold on to my goodbyes
And I ’ll stay and take my chances with those saltwater joys .
Shanneyganock – I Had a Hat
Just a super fun song .
I had a hat when I came in , and I hung it on the rack , and I ’ll have a hat when I go out or I ’ll break somebody ’s back !
Great Big Sea – The Night Paddy Murphy Died
This is about as Irish as it gets .
The Fables – St. John’s
This song is SO HARD TO FIND , and I have no idea why .
There ’s a good day comin ’ when you lay your head in St. John’s .
Enjoy !
Coming to Newfoundland ?
Check out my Newfoundland guidebook , available soon .
In 2008 research showed that 42 % of all Americans had at least tried smoking Marijuana at least once , yet and the percentages rise as the age of those surveyed is lowered to below 50 , so if most Americans Smoke or have smoked pot why is it still illegal .
When asked why marijuana is illegal most Americans will say because it ’s a gateway drug that leads to harder drugs , and that the money goes to funding terrorism .
The 2 biggest arguments for keeping Marijuana illegal are both false and easily fought with common logic .
Smoking pot is not a gateway drug any more than alcohol or tobacco are .
More people smoke tobacco or have drank alcohol before they smoked pot for the first time , but the fact that weed is illegal means that you are more likely to come into contact with people that sell harder drugs when trying to score some smoke and this makes you more likely to try harder drugs .
In an Herb legal society ganja would not be sold on street corners and alleyways in bad neighborhoods , you could go into a Dispensary and get a measured out amount of grass for a pre determined price , and guess what that price would include a sales tax .
So not only are people not having to put themselves in dangerous areas but the government could use this money for things like schools and helping clean the real drugs off the streets and help for the people .
If it is regulated and sold in licensed establishments it will also make it harder for kids to get and just like alcohol can be kept to adults 21 years .
Sure kids will still be able to get this is not going stop kids from getting weed , but it will make it harder .
The next argument is that the money for pot is going to fund terrorism .
Ok maybe it is , all the more reason to make it legal people have been told where the money is going but they still buy it cause I do not buy it from a Taliban member and I know the person I get from does not get it from one either .
But if I can run to the corner shop get a bit of smoke and a coffee I know few sure where the money is going .
So than why is it illegal .
As much as I hate conspiracy theories the fact is that big business is to blame .
Tobacco growers do n’t want you smoking pot .
Weed tastes better than tobacco and it has the added bonus of getting you high .
Pharmaceutical companies do n’t want you smoking something that can easily be grown in most people ’s yards that can help cure many different aches and pains that when you can buy their pills for lots of money that may help you while killing you with side effects .
Unfortunately it ’s all about the money , but the fact remains that as the 70’s and 80 ’s generation gets closer and closer to taking the reins of power in the country it will eventually become inevitable .

Many of us can't start our days without at least one cup of coffee , but we do n't really give the magic beans much thought after we drain our mugs .
Let 's take a look at a few questions you might have about the intricacies of the coffee business .
How do you decaffeinate coffee beans ?
There are a number of ways to cut the eye - opening power of a cup of joe , but the methods are basically pretty similar .
First , processors use water or steam to swell the green beans , then they extract the caffeine using a solvent .
Water , ethyl acetate , methylene chloride , or highly pressurized carbon dioxide strip the caffeine away from the beans , which are then steamed to remove any solvent residues and dried .
Do these methods get all the caffeine out ?
Not quite , but it strips away quite a bit .
According to U.S. law , any decaffeinated coffee must retain less than 2.5 % of its caffeine , while in the EU only 0.1 % of decaf beans ' dry weight can be caffeine .
According to the International Coffee Organization , a cup of decaf has around 3 mg of caffeine in it , while the average 5 oz .
cup of drip coffee contains 115 mg .
What happens to all the caffeine that gets stripped from the coffee ?
It would be a shame for all that caffeine to go to waste — there are undercaffeinated children in third - world countries , you know — so processors save and sell the jittery gold .
Pharmaceutical companies and soft drink makers are the big customers for the extracts ; although the kola nut provides a bit of a jolt for your cola , the majority of the caffeine in your soda comes from the addition of caffeine extracted from coffee beans during decaffeination .
Can you age coffee ?
You do n't want to age that bag of beans you picked up at your local coffeehouse , but coffee producers have aging down to a science .
Green coffee beans can take up to 10 years of aging in special warehouses ; over time their acidity dies down as their body increases .
A special type of aging in tropical regions results in what 's known as " monsooned "  coffee .
Processors leave beans in open - sided warehouses where they will be exposed to the moist air and winds of monsoon season , which can cut down on acidity and add body in just a few weeks .
The most common example of this practice is monsooned Malabar , a prized coffee from southern India .
Has coffee ever been illegal ?
The Ottoman Empire cracked down on coffee and coffeehouses at various times , but the most notable ban came under Murad IV , who was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire between 1623 and 1640 and probably was n't described as " a fun guy "  by any of his subjects .
Murad banned tobacco use in the empire and would even walk around in plain clothes looking for smokers .
If the emperor caught someone lighting a butt , his majesty would beat the person with his mace .
Tobacco was n't Murad 's only nemesis , though .
When he realized that his subjects were congregating in coffeehouses to grouse about having an absolute whack job for an emperor , he banned coffee in the entire Ottoman Empire .
Getting caught with a cup of joe earned subjects a beating .
Hitting the java a second time got you sewn in a sack and dumped into the waters of the Bosphorus .
Where did the cappuccino get its name ?
The delightful concoction of espresso , hot milk , and foam takes its name from the Capuchins , a Roman Catholic order of friars .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the drink 's color resembled the brown robes worn by the Capuchins , so Italian coffee fans began to call the drink the cappuccino .
Where did we get the name " mocha " ?
From a port in Yemen .
During the 19th century , Mocha was an important port in Yemen where sailors could load their holds with Mocha Java , a tasty blend of local Arabian coffee and beans from the Indonesian island of Java .
The renowned blend was n't cheap , though , so other coffee roasters attempted to replicate the subtle chocolate notes of Mocha Java by adding chocolate directly to lesser beans .
Over time , this combination of chocolate and coffee took on the name " cafÃ© mocha "  as a tribute to the port that inspired it .
Why do some coffees market themselves as " arabica " ?
Although the name sounds exotic , " arabica "  does n't refer to a special roasting process or preparation .
Instead , Coffee arabica is the scientific name of the species of coffee that produces over 60 percent of the world 's beans .
Arabica coffee is generally regarded as being tastier and less bitter than the other main commercial species , Coffee canephora , but it is more susceptible to disease .
While Coffee canephora does n't have the same yummy taste , it is a hardier plant and produces beans with more caffeine and a full - bodied mouthfeel .
Is there an actual Maxwell House ?
There used to be .
When it opened in 1869 , the Maxwell House Hotel was Nashville 's largest and swankiest hotel , and through the early 20th century it pulled in famous guests like Teddy Roosevelt and various members of the Vanderbilt clan .
The coffee took its name from the hotel , and for years ad men claimed that the " Good to the Last Drop "  slogan originally came from Teddy Roosevelt after he slurped down a cup of the brew .
Modern research , though , has suggested that the slogan came from a particularly inspired ad exec .
A fire destroyed the Maxwell House in December 1961 .
Ever had a friend start buzzing with The Dating Glow ?
You know , they start seeing someone new and suddenly start walking with a new pep in their step , a new trot in their walk ?
Maybe they lose five pounds , show up with a new haircut , or start wearing tight pants .
Or maybe they just smile wider , laugh louder , and exude a new confidence about themselves .
Being with someone new makes them look and feel better and that ’s a great thing .
That ’s The Dating Glow .
Now , if you do n’t mind , let ’s switch gears and talk about sandwiches — soggy , squashed , Saran - Wrapped sandwiches from the bowels of your bookbag .
Those warm and tired messes look pathetic with sweaty cheese , slimy tomatoes , and warm turkey .
Yes , it ’s a sandwich down on its luck , lacking a bit of confidence , and in desperate need of a glow of some sort .
That ’s where potato chips come in .
When you crunch up your sandwich with some carefully inserted potato chips , you inject a spicy vial of Grade A Oomph .
Suddenly that pasty gob of bread and meat transforms into a rainbow of crunches and flavors .
It ’s the sandwich equivalent of getting a new hairdo , wearing something scandalous , or buzzing with a new vibe .
Now , before we call it a day here , let ’s chat about something funny about putting chips on a sandwich .
Alright , here it is : everybody thinks they invented it .
Honestly , I ’ll be grabbing a quick lunch with a friend from work and he ’ll just sort of raise his eyebrows at me mysteriously .
“ Know what I like to do ? ” he ’ll ask , squinting a bit and cracking a wry smile .
“ Put chips on my sandwich , that ’s what , ” he ’ll unveil , a stiff bottom lip , some scrunched eyebrows , and a firm nod echoing the big reveal .
So that ’s it , ladies and gentleman .
Putting potato chips on a sandwich .
You invented it .
We all love it .
AWESOME !

Warning : Some language in this video NSFW .
The Washington Post published this two weeks ago , but unless he releases something today , Attorney General Eric Holder has missed the deadline , condemning thousands more to sexual assault in prison :
" RAPE IS VIOLENT , destructive , and a crime -- no less so when the victim is incarcerated . "
These were the opening words of a report delivered to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. last June by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission .
By law , the attorney general was given one year to consider the report 's recommendations and issue standards to reduce the scourge of sexual violence in the nation 's prisons .
The Justice Department is about to miss its June 23 deadline -- and probably by a shamefully wide margin .
The department will not say , but those following this issue closely estimate that the Justice Department is unlikely to take action until the end of this year .
At that time , federal prisons will be obligated to adopt whatever standards Justice approves .
State and local facilities will not be forced to embrace the measures for another year after that .
In the meantime , more prisoners -- including juveniles -- will have been senselessly brutalized .
This is such a basic impulse of human decency , to keep prisoners from being sexually brutalized -- and the thing is , the report had solid bipartisan support .
As far as I can tell , the only people who oppose it are the corrections officials , who do n't want anyone looking over their shoulder while they ignore prisoners getting gang raped -- or molested by guards .
So I do n't have a clue why Holder has n't acted .
Even the screwed - up people who believe prisoners deserve whatever happens might want to give some thought to the fact that prison rape happens frequently to innocent people who are being held in custody until they 're released without charges .
Maybe even those sick bastards might give some thought to the possibility of their 17 - year - old kid being raped by an HIV - positive convict after their kid's held for DUI .
Because even in this Taser - lovin ' America of ours , people might still see the injustice of inflicting a life sentence like HIV on someone who has n't even been found guilty of a major crime .
And that 's not even looking at the fate of gay prisoners , who are treated like sex slaves while guards and prison officials look the other way .
Kendall Spruce testified at the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission hearings in 2005 :
Being raped at knifepoint was the worst thing I could ever imagine .
The physical pain was devastating .
But the emotional pain was even worse .
I reported the rape , and was sent into protective custody .
But I was n’t safe there either .
They put all kinds of people in protective custody , including sexual predators .
I was put in a cell with a rapist who had full - blown AIDS .
Within two days , he forced me to give him oral sex and anally raped me .
I yelled for the guard , but it was so loud in there , no one came to help me .
I finally had to flood the cell to get a guard to come .
Because I was raped , I got labeled as a “ faggot . ”
Everywhere I walked , everyone looked at me like I was a target .
It opened the door for a lot of other predators .
Even the administrators thought it was okay for a “ faggot ” to be raped .
They said , ‘ Oh , you must like it . ’
I ’m here to tell you that no one wants to be raped .
No one likes being violently attacked .
I documented the abuse , I filed grievances , I followed all of the procedures to report what was happening to me , but no one cared .
They just moved me from cell to cell .
This went on for nine months .
I went through nine months of torture – nine months of hell - that could have been avoided .
In August , I started bleeding really bad from the rectum .
I did n’t want to go to the infirmary , because I was still so ashamed about what had happened to me , but I had to .
They gave me a test , and that ’s when I got the devastating news .
I was HIV - positive .
Keith DeBlasio testified about a retaliatory transfer to a high - risk prison because he reported abuses by guards at a minimum - security prison :
After being convicted of a nonviolent securities offense , I was sent to FCI - Morgantown .
Set at a former youth facility , Morgantown is a minimum security facility with no fence .
Places like Morgantown are used for individuals with relatively no risk of violence , escape , or predatory behavior .
As an inmate at Morgantown , I witnessed corrections officials breaking the rules of the institution , and I reported them .
Because of my reports , the prison officials retaliated against me by holding me in solitary segregation , by falsely accusing me of misconduct on charges that were later proven to be false , and finally , I suppose as a last resort , by transferring me to a higher - security facility in Milan , Michigan .
At the time , FCI - Milan was a facility often used for more unmanageable inmates in the mid-Atlantic region .
It had a history of gang activity , large scale riots , violence , and predatory assaults .
I was being sent to a place known to be dangerous simply for speaking up .
I was worried about what might happen to me there , but I honestly had no idea how bad it would turn out to be .
I tried to protest the decision to transfer me , and I asked not to be housed in the dangerous dormitory - style housing at Milan .
But I was placed in a double dormitory with about 150 inmates , dozens of blind spots , and only one officer on duty at any given time .
It was here that my nightmare began .
It was here that I was sexually assaulted by the same assailant , more times than I can even count .
Today , one of the things that disturbs me the most is that before the abuse began , I told officials that I felt vulnerable in the open dormitory unit , and I told officials that I felt threatened by the assailant .
My assailant was a leader in a gang called the Vice Lords , and he was known for being violent .
When he began to threaten and harass me , I told the prison officials , but the prison officials did nothing .
After serving three days in segregation for brutally assaulting another inmate in a stairwell , he was released and assigned to my dormitory .
That was when the repeated assaults began .
He threatened to stab me , and he raped me .
There were numerous assaults in a long period of ongoing abuse , especially after prison officials moved my assailant into the same cubicle with me as my bunkmate .
I could n’t defend myself , because he had his fellow gang members standing watch .
I knew that if I reported him , I would face repercussions from the other gang members and no action was being taken by officials .
I felt there was no escape .
Another man had reported abuse before me and , instead of finding safety , he was put in a recreation cage alone with his rapist , all while under protective custody .
So I had just cause for staying silent .
Unfortunately , my story does not end there .
Eventually , I became very ill .
My illness was mysterious – swollen lymph nodes , vomiting , diarrhea , weakness , dizziness , and scabs on my scalp .
Medical staff could not identify the illness , and so I spoke with my personal physician and friend at home .
She prompted me to ask for an HIV screening .
Permission to take the HIV test took quite some time .
It was only after a lengthy grievance process and calls from the outside physician and family members that an HIV test was performed .
Sure enough , I was determined to be HIV positive , and extensive triple therapy was begun which would be a lifelong ordeal .
Later I found out that prison officials knew the assailant was emotionally disturbed , a repeat predator , and on psychotropic drugs for his mental problems , and yet they did nothing to protect me .
I was a nonviolent offender , but I was given a life sentence .
I was repeatedly denied protection from a known predator with HIV .
And finally , this is the testimony of Erica Hejnar .
Everything she describes happened in a Philadelphia police station not very far from my neighborhood , in the rapidly - gentrifying area of Fishtown -- but of course , because she was homeless , she was powerless against this kind of treatment :
The officer next asked my friend and I if we were girlfriends and whether or not we liked “ eating each other ’s p***ies . ”
I was shocked , and could not believe that this was really happening .
Because our cell was inside a larger closed room , there were no other officers in sight that we could call out to or who could hear what he was saying to us .
Trying to keep the situation from escalating , I responded that we were just friends and that we had never had sex .
I prayed that he would stop asking us these questions , but he continued to look at us and our bodies in a very suggestive manner .
It felt as though his eyes were piercing right through our clothes .
The officer propped up his feet and continued tormenting us .
He asked us again if we were girlfriends and threateningly demanded that we kiss each other .
As he told us this he jangled his keys in front of us , mocking us , and reinforcing the fact that he had all the power in the situation .
In total fear that we would not be allowed to leave if we did not comply with his demands , my friend and I kissed .
Unfortunately , the officer would not stop .
He told us that he wanted to see us touch each others ’ breasts .
My friend put her hand on one of my breasts in compliance ; the officer then proceeded to ask her if she liked “ eating [ my ] p***y . ”
I was so horrified that I started crying uncontrollably .
I demanded to know why he was doing this to us , but he continued to insist that we touch each other if we wanted to get out .
He threatened us that if we said anything , or made any noise , he would find something to charge us with so that we could n’t leave .
Then he told us to “ lick each other ’s p***ies . ”
I got so upset that I told him we were definitely not going to do that , but he pressed on , telling us that “ no one would see [ us ] , ” and that he would not let us go until we did as he said .
My friend and I were both sobbing and started yelling in hopes that somebody would hear and help us .
We wanted to be let out of the cell and get away from this monster as soon as possible .
We were distraught , angry , frightened , and crying hysterically .
Despite our outrage , there was no way out .
He kept telling me to “ eat [ my friend ’s ] p***y ” and that if I did n’t , we could n’t go home .
When he said that he would find something to charge us with if we did n’t comply with all of his demands , I believed him .
It was without question the most humiliating and degrading moment of my life , and I could not believe that this so - called officer of the law had the power to violate us this way .
I was beginning to feel like this officer would be able to get away with absolutely anything he chose to do .
While this was happening , I noticed that another male officer stuck his head into the cell room and saw what was going on .
Instead of doing anything to help us , he gave the first officer a smile , a “ thumbs up , ” and walked away .
The women were never charged .
Nothing was done about what happened to Erica and her friend until the Philadelphia Inquirer began to cover her case .

I want to begin by saying that though I covered wars wherever they were taking place on Planet Earth in my television reporting days – it was in Vietnam as a very young correspondent that I first started to ask myself questions about why things are as they are in the world – I am an Englishman and one who did n’t serve in his country ’s armed forces .
( Not because I was a draft dodger .
Conscription had ended ) .
So it is both an honour and a privilege for me to be with you this evening .
And please believe me , I really mean it .
I ’m not a politician just saying it .
We do , of course , have something in common , OUTRAGE that ca n’t be expressed adequately in polite words at the continued suppression here in America of the truth about a war crime – Israel ’s attack on the U.S.S Liberty ; an attack which , if it had gone completely according to plan , would have seen the sinking of the ship with the loss , the murder , of all hands on board .
( Which means that some of you here tonight would not be here ) .
In my latest book , Zionism : The Real Enemy of the Jews , an epic journey in three volumes through the lies and truth of history as it relates to the making and sustaining of the conflict in and over Palestine that became Israel , I have a chapter titled The Liberty Affair , “ Pure Murder ” on a “ Great Day ” .
( I ’ll source those quoted comments later ) .
In that chapter I say the attack ought to have been a sensational , headline - grabbing news story , but beyond the fact that an “ accident ” had happened and that Israel had apologized , it did not get reported by America ’s news organisations .
It was too hot an issue for them to handle and pursue .
If it had been an Arab or other Muslim attack on an American vessel it would have been an entirely different matter , of course .
In that event there would have been saturation coverage with demands for retaliation including war , with columnists and commentators who are pro-Israel right or wrong setting the pace and tone .
I know that one of the prices Liberty survivors pay for telling the truth is vilification by supporters of Israel right or wrong .
The message sent to James Ennes was no doubt typical of many .
“ You are an anti-Semitic , Nazi bastard .
Drop dead . ”
Those and similar other false and filthy charges come out of the mouths of people who have been brainwashed by Zionist propaganda and are beyond reason .
I mean that they are not open to informed , honest and rational debate .
And that , simply stated , is the reason why peace has not yet been possible in the Middle East and probably never will be .
In passing I ’ll tell you what I have used as a shield against false and malicious charges of anti-Semitism .
I think I am probably the only person in the world who enjoyed intimate access to , and on the human level friendship with , arguably the two greatest opposites in all of history – Golda Meir , Mother Israel , and Yasser Arafat , Father Palestine .
( She was called Mother Israel because without the $ 50 million dollars she raised in America in 1947 , Ben-Gurion would not have been able to purchase the arms that enabled Israel to unilaterally declare its independence and impose its will on the Arabs ) .
One of my most treasured souvenirs from my television reporting days is a signed picture of Golda when she was prime minister .
The inscription in her own hand is – “ To a good friend , Alan Hart . ”
Because I am a goy ( a non - Jew ) that meant a lot to me .
The picture is on my web site and it ’s the first one in my latest book .
In the late 1980 ’s when I lectured and debated coast - to - coast across America and Canada , I had the picture with me and sometimes used it as a shield .
When I was accused of anti-Semitism , I would hold up the picture , read out Golda ’s inscription , and say to my accuser – “ Do you think that old lady was so stupid that she could n’t have seen through me if I was anti-Jew ! ”
That always won me the applause of the audience and its contempt for my accuser .
Now to my explanation of why , really , the Liberty was attacked .
I ’m going to follow this with some thoughts about why the truth has to be given its necessary context and handled with great care .
I ’ll start by telling you where I was on Thursday 8 June 1967 .
I was in the Sinai desert .
I was the first Western correspondent to the banks of the Suez Canal with the advancing Israelis .
On reflection some years later , I realised that what I witnessed in the desert , well out of sight and sound of the attack on the Liberty , was a key to understanding why America ’s most advanced and sophisticated spy-ship ( perhaps I should say intelligence - gathering platform ) was attacked .
I ’ll come to what I witnessed in a moment .
First , and to provide some context to assist complete understanding , I must summarise very briefly the whole truth about that particular war .
By elements in the mainstream media which peddle Zionist propaganda , and other elements of it which are terrified of offending Zionism either too much or at all , the Western world was conditioned to believe that Israel went to war because it was in danger of annihilation – “ the driving in the sea of its Jews ” .
Zionism ’s first assertion was that the Arabs started the war by attacking Israel .
Zionism ’s second story was that the Arabs were intending to attack and that in the name of self - defense , Israel had no option but to launch a pre-emptive strike because its very survival was at stake .
Both those stories were big , fat , propaganda lies .
The Arabs did not attack and were not intending to attack .
It was a war of Israeli choice and aggression .
If that was only my Gentile view , it could be dismissed by supporters of Israel right or wrong as an alleged manifestation of anti-Semitism .
But let me now tell you this .
The forthcoming Volume 3 of my book begins with the longest chapter in the entire work .
It ’s titled America Takes Sides , War With Nasser Act II ; and the Creation of a Greater Israel .
In this chapter I name and quote a number of Israel ’s political and military leaders of the time who , years after the war in most cases , admitted the truth .
There is n’t time this evening for me to name and quote them all , but here to make the point are four :
> In an interview published in Le Monde on 28 February 1968 , Israeli Chief of Staff Rabin said : “ I do not believe that Nasser wanted war .
The two divisions which he sent into Sinai on 14 May would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel .
He knew it and we knew it . ”
> On 14 April 1971 , a report in the Israeli newspaper Al - Hamishmar contained the following statement by Mordecai Bentov , a member of the wartime national government .
“ The entire story of the danger of extermination was invented in every detail and exaggerated a posteriori to justify the annexation of new Arab territory . ”
> In the spring of 1972 , General Peled , Chief of Logistical Command during the war and one of 12 members of Israel ’s General Staff , addressed a political literary club in Tel Aviv .
He said : “ The thesis according to which the danger of genocide hung over us in June 1967 , and according to which Israel was fighting for her very physical survival , was nothing but a bluff which was born and bred after the war . ”
In a radio debate Peled said : “ Israel was never in real danger and there was no evidence that Egypt had any intention of attacking Israel . ”
He added , “ Israeli intelligence knew that Egypt was not prepared for war . ”
> In 1982 , Prime Minister Begin , arguably the world ’s most successful terrorist leader , went even further .
He said : “ In June 1967 we had a choice .
The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us , We must be honest with ourselves .
We decided to attack him . ”
When I was writing the chapter on the 1967 war , I found myself saying to my readers that there were times , this was one of them , when I wanted to “ cry out with the pain of knowing how much Israel ’s Jews ( not to mention the whole of the Western world ) had been deceived , lied to , by their leaders “ .
In passing I ’ll tell you why I was well informed in my television reporting days about what was happening behind closed doors in Israel .
One of my sources , my deep - throat , was General Chaim Herzog , a founding father of Israel ’s Directorate of Military Intelligence .
( He went on to become Israel ’s ambassador to the UN and eventually the state ’s president ) .
On the second day of the war , when he was advising me on the best route into the Sinai to catch up with the advancing Israelis , he said to me : “ If Nasser had not been stupid enough to give us a pretext to go to war , we would have created one within a year or 18 months . ”
Another summary truth about what happened in June 1967 is that there would NOT have been a war if Israel ’s prime minister , the much maligned Levi Eshkol , and his Chief of Staff , General Yitzhak Rabin , had had their way .
After Eygpt ’s President Nasser had closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping , they wanted only a limited military operation – to satisfy Israeli public opinion and , most of all , to put pressure on America to lead the international community in delivering on a promise President Eisenhower had made – that in the event of Eygpt closing the Straits of Tiran , the “ society of nations ” would be mobilized to cause the Straits to be re-opened by all means short of war .
That was what Nasser was hoping would happen .
For reasons of face , he needed to be able to say to the Arab world , “ I backed down because of international pressure . ”
So why did n’t Prime Minister Eshkol and Chief of Staff Rabin have their way ?
The short answer is that in Israel the week before the war there was what amounted to a MILITARY COUP in all but name and without a shot being fired .
The best journalists have their brains not up here in their heads , but down here in their guts .
From early May , my gut instincts were telling me that war was inevitable , and I persuaded my editor - in - chief at ITN ( Independent Television News ) to let me go to Israel with a film crew to report on the countdown to it .
In those weeks I witnessed Israel ’s military and political hawks rubbishing Prime Minister Eshkol .
They were painting him as indecisive , weak and frightened to confront Nasser .
Their objective was to create a crisis of confidence in his leadership , in the hope that he would be forced to resign .
When that did n’t happen , the generals demanded that Eshkol , who was both PM and Defense Minister , surrender his Defense Portfolio and give it to Israel ’s one - eyed warlord and master of deception , General Moshe Dayan .
And that ’s what happened on Thursday 1 June , when a government of National Unity came into being .
It was then inevitable that Israel would go to war in a matter of days .
I actually predicted that it would do so on the morning of Monday 5 June .
Defense Minister Dayan ( whom I knew quite well ) was a law unto himself and had plans that went far beyond the war aim on which all of Israel ’s generals were agreed .
It was the total destruction of Eygpt ’s Soviet supplied military equipment – planes , missiles , artillery , tanks , the lot .
( For further background I have to tell you that Nasser had not wanted to be armed by the Soviet Union .
He wanted America to be his arms supplier , and it was only when America refused that he turned in despair to the Soviet Union .
Also true is that Nasser did n’t want an upgraded military for the purpose of initiating war with Israel .
He wanted Eygpt to be well enough armed to be able to demonstrate to Israel that attacking Eygpt to impose Zionism ’s will on it would not be a cost free option ) .
The key to understanding WHY Dayan ordered the attack on the Liberty is in President Johnson ’s pre-war understanding with Israel ’s generals .
Probably through Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , Johnson gave Israel ’s generals the greenlight for war with Eygpt .
But it was , effectively , a CONDITIONAL GREENLIGHT .
On no account was Israel to widen the war the purpose of grabbing Jordanian and / or Syrian territory .
Dayan intended to do just that if and as the opportunity arose , but he had a problem .
He knew , as all of Israel ’s generals and politicians knew , that although they had Johnson ’s greenlight to attack Eygpt , they would have only three or four days of complete freedom to act .
Why ?
Because by the end of the third or fourth day , the Johnson administration would have to go along with a Security Council Resolution demanding an end to the fighting .
To guarantee that Israel could complete the job on the Egyptian front in a race against the diplomatic time clock , Dayan had to assign the bulk of Israel ’s armour , including elements of it that would be needed for an extended war on the Jordanian and Syrian fronts , to the Sinai .
Now to the significance of what I witnessed in the Sinai on the afternoon of Thursday 8 June when ( unknown to me at the time ) the Liberty had been silenced ….
Scores of Israeli tanks and armoured personnel carriers , which had blitzkrieged their way through the Sinai sand , were being loaded onto huge lorries with trailers for transportation to the north , and re-deployment to the Jordanian and Syrian fronts .
The orders for this re-deployment were coming by radio from Dayan ’s staff at the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv .
This takes us to what the Liberty ’s mission was .
It was assigned to listen to all of Israel ’s military communications because some in the highest levels of American military and political decision - making did not trust the Israelis to keep their word about not extending the war to take chunks of Jordanian and Syrian territory , to create a Greater Israel of Zionism ’s mad dream .
The biggest fear of those who did n’t trust Israel was the possible consequence of an Israeli attack on Syria , which had also been armed by the Soviet Union .
The reasoning behind the fear went something like this .
Soviet leaders almost certainly could and would live with the humiliating defeat of their Egyptian client , but for reasons of face they might not be able to live with the humiliating defeat of their Syrian client also .
And that raised at least the possibility – if Israel attacked Syria – of Soviet military intervention , leading to the Cold War going Hot .
( And this at a time when American forces were getting bogged down in an unwinnable war in Vietnam ) .
The idea behind the Liberty ’s deployment was that if it picked up messages indicating that Israel was re-deploying from the Sinai to launch major offensives in the north , and against Syria in particular , the evidence of Israeli intent and duplicity would be passed to Johnson , and that he would then pick up the ‘ phone to Prime Eshkol and say something like : “ We know what your generals are up to .
You must order them to stop , and if you do n’t or can ’t , I will . ”
Simply stated , the Liberty was on station as the Johnson administration ’s insurance policy .
It ’s main mission was to prevent Israel going to war with Syria and possibly provoking a U.S - Soviet confrontation .
Dayan ordered the attack on the Liberty to prevent it giving the Johnson administration early warning of his intentions to extend the war .
As it happened , Israel ’s last land grab of the war – the taking for keeping of the Syrian Golan Heights – DID provoke the threat of Soviet military intervention .
For some hours there was the prospect of a superpower confrontation and possibly World War III .
But at the brink , catastrophe was averted by use of the White House - Kremlin hot line .
Of all the evidence indicating that Dayan did n’t want any of the Liberty ’s crew to live to tell the story , the most compelling in my view is the use of NAPALM during the attack .
In Vietnam I saw what napalm can do .
It reduces targeted human bodies to small piles of squelchy , black pulp .
So far as I am aware , the only honest piece of reporting in the American media in the immediate aftermarth of the attack was on 19 June in Newsweek ’s “ Periscope ” section .
A small item in that read as follows :
“ Although Israel ’s apologies were officially accepted , some high Washington officials believe the Israelis knew the Liberty ’s capabilities and suspect that the attack might not have been accidental .
One top - level theory holds that someone in the Israeli armed forces ordered the Liberty sunk because he suspected it had taken down messages showing that Israel started the fighting . ”
One could salute Newsweek ’s brief moment of courage , but in one important respect the item was very wide of the mark .
Everybody in Washington ’s war - loop who needed to know did know that Israel had started the war and that President Johnson had given it the greenlight to do so .
For many years there has been speculation that an Israeli general opposed Dayan ’s decision to attack the Liberty and said it would amount to “ Pure murder “ ?
Who was that general ?
I think I know .
Despite the fact that in his own memoirs he went along with the fiction that Israeli pilots failed to identify the Liberty as a U.S. ship and that the attack was a tragic mistake , I think it was , very probably , Chief of Staff Rabin – the Israeli leader who , many years later as prime minister , was stopped from advancing the peace process with Arafat and his PLO by a Zionist assassin .
In the time available to me this evening , I ’ll give you just one reason of several why I ’m convinced it was Rabin who opposed Dayan .
When the Liberty was being attacked , the insider gossip in Israel was that Rabin had “ lost his nerve … cracked under the pressure … was drinking heavily … was under the table … a disgrace . ”
I first heard this gossip from Israeli friends I knew to be very , very close to Dayan .
It was then former DMI Herzog who confirmed to me that such rumours were rife .
In retrospect I think the gossip was inspired by Dayan to give him scope to discredit Rabin if the need arose – if he so much as hinted to anybody outside the command circle that he had tried to prevent the attack on the Liberty .
( Could it not be said that the idea of attacking the Liberty was enough to drive any rational human being , even an Israeli general , to drink ? )
The idea that Rabin might have been tempted to make trouble for Dayan was not unthinkable if he shared – and he probably did – Eshkol ’s private view of Israel ’s one - eyed warlord .
When the prime minister learned that Dayan had ordered the attack on Syria without consulting or informing himself or Chief of Staff Rabin , he thought about cancelling the order and said of Dayan , to his aide - de- camp , “ What a vile man . ”
( That quotation was unearthed by Avi Shlaim , one of Israel ’s leading “ revisionist ” , which means honest , historians ) .
What could have made Eshkol resort to such extraordinary language ?
My guess is that use of the adjective “ vile ” reflected most of all the prime minister ’s horror at Dayan ’s ordering of the attack on the Liberty .
Who was it who described Thursday 8 June 1967 as a “ Great Day “ ?
That evening Egypt ’s President sent the following message to his Syrian counterpart :
“ I believe that Israel is about to concentrate all of its forces against Syria in order to destroy the Syrian army , and regard for the common cause obliges me to advise you to agree to the ending of hostilities and to inform U Thant ( UN Secretary General ) immediately , in order to preserve Syria ’s great army .
We have lost this battle .
May
God help us in the future .
Your brother , Gamal Abdul Nasser . ”
That Nasser message , no doubt like all others , was intercepted by Israeli military intelligence .
In the margin of a copy of it , Dayan scribbled the following note :
“ Eshkol ,
1 . In my opinion this cable obliges us to capture maximal military lines .
2. Yesterday I did not think Egypt and Syria would collapse in this way and give up the continuation of the campaign .
But since this is the situation , it must be exploited to the full .
A GREAT DAY .
Moshe Dayan . ”
The Syrian leadership took Nasser ’s advice and announced its acceptance of the cease - fire .
It came into effect at 0520 hours the following morning , Friday 9 June .
So far as the Arabs and the organised international community represented by the UN were concerned , the war was over … .
Six hours and ten minutes later , the IDF invaded Syria .
Dayan had postponed the attack to allow for the redeployment of IDF units from Sinai – a redeployment that might not have been possible , Dayan had believed , if the Liberty was allowed to go on listening to IDF movement orders .
I end my chapter on this Israeli war crime with this sentence :
The lesson of the cold - blooded attack on the Liberty was that there is nothing the Zionist state might not do , to its friends as well as its enemies , in order to get its own way .
Now to my explanation of why the truth needs its necessary context and must be handled with great care .
The problem with the truth , not only the truth about Israel ’s attack on the Liberty but its ethnic cleansing of Palestine and many other manifestation ’s of its arrogance of power and contempt for international law , is that it ’s pregnant with extreme danger because it could provoke anti-Semitism throughout the Western world where most Jews live as citizens of many nations .
There is , however , a way to exorcise this extreme danger .
It is by explaining the difference between Judaism and Zionism .
I believe that knowledge of this difference is THE key to understanding .
JUDAISM is the religion of Jews , not “ the ” Jews because not all Jews are religious .
Like Christianity and Islam , Judaism has at its core a set of moral values and ethical principles .
ZIONISM as Jewish nationalism is a sectarian , colonial ideology - and - enterprise which , in the process of creating in the Arab heartland a state for some Jews – mainly by terrorism and ethnic cleansing – made a mockery of , and demonstrated contempt for , Judaism ’s moral values and ethical principles .
Supporters of Israel right or wrong conflate Judaism and Zionism because the assertion that they are one and the same enables them to claim that criticism of Israel is a manifestation of anti-Semitism .
Often , almost always these days , the accusation that criticism of Israel IS anti-Semitic is a form of blackmail , intended to silence criticism of , and suppress informed and honest debate about , the Zionist ( not Jewish ) state and its policies .
The reality is that Judaism and Zionism as Jewish nationalism are total opposites , and knowledge of the difference is the key to understanding two things :
1 . Why it is perfectly possible , with good reason on the basis of all the facts , to be passionately anti-Zionist ( opposed to Zionism ’s on - going colonial enterprise ) without being , in any way , shape or form anti-Semitic .
2 . Why it is wrong to blame ALL Jews everywhere for the crimes of the hardest core Zionist few in Palestine that became little Israel , and then Greater Israel .
Though it is not well known , even by many Jews today , the fact is that prior to the obscenity of the Nazi holocaust , Zionism ’s colonial enterprise was of no interest to more than a tiny minority of the Jews of the world and was OPPOSED by many of them .
For example : On 5 March 1919 , the New York Times revealed that 30 of the most prominent and outstanding Jewish Americans had signed a petition to President Wilson , warning him against any U.S. commitment “ now or in the future to Jewish territorial sovereignty in Palestine . ”
One of the 30 signatures was that of Adolph S. Ochs , the Jewish - American of German origin who was then the owner and publisher of the paper .
In 1943 , when the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism was formed , the then owner and publisher of the New York Times , Arthur Hays Sulzberger , was a member of it .
The many Jews who opposed Zionism ’s colonial enterprise , including the early owners and publishers of the New York Times , knew it was morally wrong .
They also believed it would lead to unending conflict with the Arabs .
Most of all they feared that if Zionism was allowed by the big powers to have its way , it would one day provoke anti-Semitism .
That fear was given a fresh airing in 1986 by Israel ’s longest serving Director of Military Intelligence , Yehoshafat Harkabi .
In a remarkable book , Israel ’s Fateful Hour , he wrote this :
“ Israel is the criterion according to which all Jews will tend to be judged .
Israel as a Jewish state is an example of the Jewish character , which finds free and concentrated expression within it .
Anti-Semitism has deep and historical roots .
Nevertheless , any flaw in Israeli conduct , which initially is cited as anti-Israelism , is likely to be transformed into empirical proof of the validity of anti-Semitism .
It would be a tragic irony if the Jewish state , which was intended to solve the problem of anti-Semitism , was to become a factor in the rise of anti-Semitism .
Israelis must be aware that the price of their misconduct is paid not only by them but also Jews throughout the world . ”
Today there is almost a case for saying that Israel ’s “ misconduct ” - in my view it sometimes amounts to naked state terrorism – has become not only “ a factor in the rise of anti-Semitism ” but the prime factor .
I said “ almost ” a case because what we are witnessing today as a consequence of Israel ’s policies and actions is NOT the rise of anti-Semitism , not prejudice against and hatred of all Jews everywhere just because they are Jews .
What we are witnessing today in many nations , where more and more citizens are beginning to see an arrogant and insufferably self - righteous Israel as the obstacle to peace , is anti-Israelism , which is more accurately described as anti-Zionism .
But as Harkabi warned , the danger is that what starts out as anti-Israelism could be transformed into anti-Semitism .
My own view , which I know is shared in private by a growing number of eminent Jews , is that this will happen – I mean that there will be another great turning against the Jews , possibly starting here in America
> IF Israel stays on its present course ;
> IF the Jews of the world do not then distance themselves from the Zionist state ’s criminal behaviour and its denial of justice for the Palestinians ; and
> IF Americans and Europeans among whom most Jews of the world live remain ignorant of the difference between Judaism and Zionism …
And that is why I say the truth has to handled with great care and given its necessary context .
As some but perhaps not all of you will know , it was your first ever Secretary of Defense , James Forrestal , and General George C. Marshall when he was serving as Secretary of State , who took the lead in trying to persuade President Truman that support for Zionism ’s colonial enterprise was not in America ’s own best interests .
Their views were shared by all of your relevant intelligence agencies of the time .
In my book I offer explanations of why a deeply troubled President Truman did not take their advice .
In that historical light I think it ’s not uninteresting that a serving American General of our time , General David H. Petraeus , has dared to say that continuing American support for Israel right or wrong is not in America ’s best interests and is even damaging them .
The Epilogue to the forthcoming Volume 3 of my book is titled Is Peace Possible ?
In it I ask this question :
Could it be that the stage is being set for a titanic struggle in which President Obama , after the mid-term elections , will have to chose between doing what the Zionist lobby and its stooges in Congress want and what America ’s top military men know to be necessary if America ’s own interests are to be best protected ?
And I add this comment :
If they could speak from their graves , I imagine the two most senior executives who advised President Truman not to support Zionism ’s colonial enterprise – Defense Secretary Forrestal and Secretary of State Marshall – would say , “ Let ’s hope so and that this time reason will prevail . ”
I ’ll end my remarks to you this evening by quoting a line from the Dear America introduction to Volume 1 of the American edition of my book .
It ’s a sort of open letter in which I am speaking directly to readers .
In the very first sentence I say that if all of our children , wherever they live , are to have the prospect of a future worth having , the world needs America ’s BEST ..
Only the truth can bring out the best of America , and there ’s no better place to start than with the truth about Israel ’s attack on the U.S.S. Liberty .
I salute your efforts to make this truth known ,
If you can assist my efforts to promote it and other related truths , it might be possible to bring out the best of America before it ’s too late for us all .

“ They came in the dark , shining bright flashlights while my family was asleep , keeping me from milking my cows , from my family , from breakfast with my family and from our morning devotions , and alarming my children enough so that the first question they asked my wife was , ‘ Is Daddy going to jail ? ' ”
That ’s how Amish farmer Dan Allgyer described an early morning visit last week from two FDA agents , two U.S. Marshals , and a Pennsylvania state trooper .
Apparently , investigating a single farmer for possibly trafficking raw milk across state lines requires a show of force .
“ I became aware of the cars as soon as I walked out on the sidewalk as part of my morning routine around 4:30 a.m. and immediately said to myself something is going on , ” Allgyer wrote in a statement for the National Independent Consumers and Farmers Association .
“ I was watching and noticed three cars were cruising down right behind each other , and immediately thought , hey , that looks like trouble .
I watched and pretty soon one car came back and parked on my neighbor ’s farm , on private property . ”
After tooling around , the cars showed up Allgyer ’s property .
“ They all got out of their vehicles – five men all together –with big bright flashlights they were shining all around .
My wife and family were still asleep .
When they could n’t find anybody , they prepared to knock on the door of my darkened house .
Just before they got to the house I stepped out of the barn and hollered at them , then they came up to me and introduced themselves . ”
Without telling him what is was , one of the agents handed Allgyer an FDA warrant that allowed the agents to inspect Allgyer ’s farm .
The warrant read : “ You are authorized to take all necessary actions , including , but not limited to , the use of reasonable force , to effectuate entry to the above - named premises , the land and buildings located there , at reasonable times during ordinary business hours and to remain thereon to inspect within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner all portions ” of Allgyer ’s farm .
Allgyer is n’t the criminal that the FDA is making him out to be .
“ When Americans first began pasteurizing milk at the turn of the last century , testing was rudimentary and farms were far less hygienic , ” Katherine Mangu - Ward wrote in February , the first time inspectors showed up to raid Allgyer ’s farm .
“ Today , the situation is different .
Testing for the presence of such pathogens is much more precise , and farms are far cleaner .
While processing milk remains a good choice for milk shipped to the population as a whole , there are a group of food rebels who would rather drink their milk straight from the cow . ”
When Allgyer asked why the agents wanted to inspect his farm , FDA investigator Joshua C. Shafer said , “ We have credible evidence that you are involved in interstate commerce . ”
“ I went to go talk to my wife , ” Allgyer said in his statement .
“ As I walked away , they held a quick excited conversation and I heard one of them say , ‘ I ’ll take care of him . ’
At that point , apparently , they had designated one of the marshals to stick close to me and dog my footsteps .
He followed me as I walked toward the house .
I went in the house quickly and told my wife a few words to let her know the situation , then immediately came back out of the house before the marshal had time to follow me in .
When I came back out , they were inspecting all the coolers sitting out .
They spent about a half hour digging through the packed coolers filled with milk and other food – all private property – taking pictures . ”
After watching the agents root through his barn , open his freezers , and dig through his dumpster , Allgyer set about milking the cows , hours behind schedule .
“ When I was just about done milking , Schafer and the other agent came in the barn and wanted me to answer some more questions .
I told them I would not .
The second agent said , ‘ Are you gong to deliver those coolers to Bethesda and Bowie Maryland ? ’
I just looked at him .
Then Schafer made a gesture and said , ‘ The stickers with those towns names are on the coolers , ’ as through to say , you might as well tell me . ”
Allgyer refused to say anything and the agents left .
Several days later , Allgyer received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration that read , “ An investigation by the u.s .
Food and Drug Administration has determined that you are causing to be delivered into interstate commerce , selling , or otherwise distributing raw milk in final package form for human consumption . ”
The letter does not list the evidence against Allgyer , nor does it name specific violations .
In fact , the letter from the FDA says exactly the opposite : “ This letter is not intended to provide an all - inclusive list of violations . ”
Two paragraphs later , the letter instructs Allgyer to report within 15 days “ the specific steps you have taken to correct the noted violations . ”
“ Failure to make prompt corrections could result in regulatory action without further notice .
Possible actions include seizure and injunction . ”

When you are an elite athlete , you are bound to have an award or two lying around the house .
When you are the greatest , most celebrated American to ever play the game of hockey , you probably have a room full of them .
Such is the case for the Dallas Stars ’ own , who on Saturday night , picked up yet another accolade and became the first hockey player to receive the National Italian American Foundation ’s ( NIAF ) prestigious Special Achievement Award in Sports .
Past winners include the likes of Yogi Berra , Joe Montana , and Phil Rizzuto .
Being in the company of such great names is not something that is lost on Modano .
“ It ’s a great honor and a great thrill , ” Modano said .
“ These are guys that I looked up to and were idols of mine growing up , to emulate them and receive the same award is great .
” The NIAF Gala , which was attended by nearly 400 people at the Adolphous Hotel is Dallas , was the first of its kind in the state of Texas , and a celebration of Italian heritage and values .
Values , NIAF North Texas Coordinator , Charlie Turano said Modano has , “ has accomplished all that he has with a great sense of humility that in today ’s athletes is so rare .
We would like to attribute some of his humility to the fact that he is an Italian American .
” In fact , Modano is a second generation Italian American who grew up with a very keen awareness of his roots .
Modano ’s grandfather was an Italian immigrant who made it a point to preserve the culture and ideals of his home country .
That Italian culture was passed down to Modano ’s father , Mike Sr. , and later to Mike himself .
It is something a teary eyed Modano admitted helped shape him as a person and a hockey player .
“ Two things that I always appreciated , that I did n’t when I was a kid , but I certainly do now are my dad ’s discipline and hard work .
He was a guy who did anything and worked his butt off to give me an opportunity to play hockey ; I ’ll never be able to thank him enough .
” No one could blame Modano for being emotional on this night .
The last few months have been a time of great reflection and more than a little overwhelming , as he considers retirement after 20 NHL seasons .
In his final home game , Modano earned an assist , the game tying goal , and the shootout winner to cap off one of the most memorable nights in Stars ’ franchise history .
Two nights later , he played what may have been the last game of his career in the place where it all started .
Minnesota .
As the sun begins to set on Modano ’s career , it is impossible to know if that game in Minnesota was his final curtain call .
Only time will tell .
But like his grandfather before him , the journey Modano has taken has been an unexpected success .
“ I would have never thought in a million years I ’d be in Texas , getting an Italian award , ” he joked .
Luckily for Stars ’ fans , he did come to Texas .
He did work hard , and he did represent Italian Americans with humility and pride .
He has a whole room of trophies and a Stanley Cup ring to prove it .
Happy Draw Mohammed Day !

Two high - profile prosecutions criticized ; Conrad Black ’s fraud conviction vacated ; Part of Enron bossÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conviction vacated
WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€ 
The US Supreme Court Thursday set aside part of Enron boss Jeffrey Skilling ’s fraud conviction , saying it was “ flawed ” and unconstitutional .
“ Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy , honest - services wire fraud , money - or - property wire fraud , and securities fraud , ” Skilling ’s conviction “ is flawed , ” the ruling said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Also , the US Supreme Court on Thursday set aside the corporate fraud conviction of Anglo - Canadian media mogul Conrad Black and sent the case back to a lower court .
“ We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion , ” the Supreme Court ruled .
Black , 64 , who once headed the world ’s third - largest media empire , was convicted in July 2007 of stealing millions of dollars from the sales of newspapers being off - loaded by Hollinger International .
The Baltimore Sun notes ,
The Supreme Court weakened a key anticorruption law Thursday , ruling that the law against “ honest services ” fraud is too vague to constitute a crime unless a bribe or kickback was involved .
The decision is likely to have a wide impact and could affect recent convictions of public figures and corporate executives .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Wall Street Journal adds ,
In ruling for Skilling and Black , the high court , in opinions by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , found fault with a federal law that gives prosecutors the authority to bring cases against executives who deprive companies of their honest services .
The ruling could have a significant impact on some white - collar crime prosecutions .
The honest - services law has been a darling of government lawyers because it is broadly worded and gives them room to prosecute a wide range of conduct .
Ginsburg said the honest - services law should be confined only to cover fraud schemes involving bribery and kickbacks .
Ginsburg said parts of Skilling ’s conviction were flawed , but said the flaws did not necessarily require reversal of his conviction on conspiracy charges .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) released the following statement sent to RAW STORY :

Today , in Skilling v. U.S. , the Supreme Court invalidated the use of the honest services fraud statute except in cases involving bribery and kickbacks .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) had filed an amicus brief on behalf of the United States in the related case of Black v. U.S. urging the Court to uphold the honest services fraud statute in cases in which the public has been deprived of the intangible right of government officialsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ honest services .
The Court rejected this argument , finding that such an application of the statute is unconstitutionally vague .
CREW executive director Melanie Sloan said , “ TodayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s decision deprives prosecutors of an important tool in their efforts to fight public corruption .
Previous convictions may be vacated and corrupt officials will have an easier time escaping accountability for their misdeeds .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sloan continued , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Anticipating this ruling , CREW has been advocating a legislative fix .
Federal law currently prohibits executive branch employees from taking any official action that affects their personal financial interest .
This statute could easily be extended to cover members of Congress and state and local officials to ensure Americans are protected from government officials who sacrifice the public interest for their own private gain . ”
Skilling and Enron Founder Kenneth Lay hid company losses and hyped the stock ’s value while selling their own shares on the sly as the massive energy empire crumbled .

Thousands of people lost their jobs and life savings when Enron collapsed .
The ensuing scandal undermined faith in corporate America and led to a massive stock market sell - off .
Followed by other mega scandals — the collapse of WorldCom , excesses at Tyco — Enron led to significant regulatory changes .
The case was also one of the most complex involving corporate crime in US legal history and represented a high - profile test for the government ’s crackdown on corporate wrongdoing .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lay died of heart failure in July 2006 before he could be sentenced and his conviction on 10 counts of fraud , conspiracy and banking violations was thrown out because his death prevented him from appealing the verdict .
Skilling , who became the poster child for corporate malfeasance , appealed his May 2006 conviction by challenging the federal law that punishes executives who fail to provide “ honest services . ”
His lawyers argued that the statute is “ vague and unenforceable ” and does not require proof that the accused received a personal gain from the alleged fraud .
Amid the depressing BP disaster , here 's a happy story about something dumped into the ocean and washing up on Florida 's shores .
Seven months ago , Dick de Bruin , a Royal Dutch Navy sergeant stationed in the Dutch territory of Aruba , was salvaging an anchor from an American World War II ship that was to be used in a monument .
De Bruin 's bright - red Nikon camera , protected in a waterproof case , floated away .
According to the Telegraph and the AP , six months later , Paul Shultz saw what he thought was a rotten tomato floating near rocks in a Key West marina .
After a closer look , he realized , underneath a bunch of sea muck that had collected on the case , it was actually a digital camera .
Amazingly , the case had protected it and Shultz was able to view the contents of the camera .
The only problem was finding out to whom it belonged .
Shultz posted pictures on a scuba diver message board , and they were identified as being taken in Aruba .
He then posted on local message boards , and one woman recognized a child in a photo , de Bruin 's son , as being a classmate of her son .
The camera was then returned to de Bruin .
However , on its way from Aruba to Key West , the camera encountered an angry sea turtle .
A carrying leash connected to the camera got caught on one of its fins .
It apparently tried to take a bite out of it but instead hit the record button and captured a five - minute video .
The video , believed to be taken two months after the camera went missing , has been uploaded to YouTube .
Overview ( 5 )
Mini Bio ( 1 )
Although his parents were deaf - mutes , Leonidas Chaney became an actor and also owner of a theatre company ( together with his brother John ) .
He made his debut at the movies in 1912 , and his filmography is vast .
Lon Chaney was especially famous for his horror parts in movies like e.g. Quasimodo in Der Glöckner von Notre Dame ( 1923 ) .
Due to his special make - up effects he carried the characterization to be " the man with the thousand faces . "
He only filmed one movie with sound :
The remake of one of his earlier films The Unholy Three ( 1930 ) .
His son , Lon Chaney Jr. , became a famous actor of the horror genre .
- IMDb Mini Biography By : Volker Boehm
Spouse ( 2 )
Trade Mark ( 3 )
Known as the Man of a Thousand Faces .
Master of early screen make - up techniques .
Macabre , menacing characters who nonetheless always have an undercurrent of pathos and melancholy
Extremely expressive performances in silent horror films
Trivia ( 48 )
A child of deaf mute parents , Chaney became a master of pantomime and understanding people who were born different .
Following his sudden death , he was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , California , in the Great Mausoleum ( unmarked ) .
Were it not for his death , Chaney , rather than Bela Lugosi , would have been Tod Browning 's choice for the starring role in Dracula ( 1931 ) .
The Lon Chaney Theater in Colorado Springs , Colorado , is named for one of that city 's most famous native sons .
Friends with Afro-American actor Noble Johnson since both were boys in Colorado together , Chaney was responsible for giving his old friend some early breaks in a career that spanned more than four decades .
Likewise , Chaney befriended the young Boris Karloff shortly after the latter 's arrival in Hollywood .
As with Johnson , he helped Karloff gain a foothold in the movies , and until the end of his life , Karloff always spoke kindly of Chaney as a good friend and colleague .
A quiet soul by nature , Chaney valued his privacy highly .
Granting few interviews and disliking the Hollywood social whirl , he much preferred spending quiet time with his family and a few close friends , often at his cabin in the Sierra Nevadas .
This avoidance of publicity led him to be unfairly labeled by some as strange and unfriendly .
However , those who knew him best always described him as a good , loving husband , father , and friend .
Similarly , his co-stars , among them Loretta Young and Joan Crawford , remembered him as being very cooperative and helpful , especially to those performers without much experience .
In the late 1950s , there was a resurgence of interest in Chaney .
The first factor was the biopic , Der Mann mit den 1000 Gesichtern ( 1957 ) made by Univeral Studios ( then Universal International ) starring James Cagney as Chaney .
Of greater influence was the magazine " Famous Monsters of Filmland " started in 1958 and edited by devoted Chaney fan Forrest J. Ackerman .
Ackerman published many photographs and articles about Chaney .
Each issue also included at least one full page devoted to Chaney under the title " Lon Chaney Shall Not Die " .
This coverage introduced Chaney to new generations who would have probably never heard of him .
The interest in Chaney also led to early efforts to find and and preserve Chaney 's films .
For many years , the cause of the lung cancer that brought about his death at age 47 was thought to have been a piece of artificial snow , made out of crushed gypsum , that lodged in his throat during the filming of Thunder ( 1929 ) , his last silent film .
However , Chaney biographer and scholar Michael Blake points out that the most likely cause was the fact that Chaney was a heavy smoker , and that the piece of artificial snow merely hastened the inevitable .
A popular joke of the era was " Do n't step on it ; it might be Lon Chaney ! " .
His father , Frank H. Chaney , was not born deaf , but was rendered so by a childhood illness when he was not quite two .
He ultimately became a successful barber , and always claimed he could remember some sounds .
His mother , the former Emma Alice Kennedy , was born deaf , and was a teacher at a school for the deaf before her marriage .
When her most famous son was nine years old , she was stricken with inflammatory rheumatism which left her an invalid .
Lon Chaney himself was the second of four children , three boys and a girl .
All of his siblings survived him , and were generously provided for in his will .
Before turning to films , he was mainly known for his stage work .
With the exception of Charles Chaplin , Chaney was the last major silent film star to make a talkie .
Assaying five different voices in his first talkie , Chaney signed a notarized statement attesting to the fact that the different voices were his : " I , Lon Chaney , being first duly sworn , depose and say :
In the photoplay entitled The Unholy Three ( 1930 ) , produced by Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer Corporation , all voice reproductions which purport to be reproductions of my voice , to wit , the ventriloquist 's , the old woman's , the dummy's , the parrot's , and the girl 's , are actual reproductions of my own voice , and in no place in said photoplay or in any of the various characters portrayed by me in said photoplay was a ' double ' or substitute used for my voice .
Subscribed and sworn to before me , this 19th day of May , 1930 , J. L. Hendrickson , Notary Public in and for the county of Los Angeles , State of California . "
Unbeknown to many people , who consider Chaney a " horror actor " , he was an amazing dancer in his stage years .
The only film that contains footage of him dancing is the incomplete The Fascination of the Fleur de Lis ( 1915 ) .
He was also known to be a hilarious comedian .
In fact , one report of the day said , " As a comedian , he is irresistible " .
And according to Michael F. Blake ( Chaney 's biographer ) , Lon could even sing .
Sadly , no audio recordings exist of Chaney singing , but people who knew him said that he had a rich baritone voice .
Mentioned in Warren Zevon 's 1978 song " Werewolves of London " .
The working title of his film The Unknown - Der Unbekannte ( 1927 ) was " Alonso the Armless " , which seems to have led to a great deal of confusion over the years regarding the actor 's actual name .
As committed to their faith as Chaney 's parents were , they would probably have never considered giving one of their children a name not shared by a religious saint , and to this date there is neither a St. Alonso nor a St. Lon.
Chaney 's birth name was Leonidas Frank Chaney ; both St. Leonidas and St. Francis are prominent in the traditional Roman Catholic Litany of Saints .
Part of Chaney 's makeup for the role of Quasimodo in Der Glöckner von Notre Dame ( 1923 ) required that his right eye be buried under makeup , simulating a growth over that eye , as specified in the original Victor Hugo novel .
The result of looking out of only one eye for weeks at a time left Chaney extremely short - sighted , and he had to wear thick glasses off screen for the rest of his life to correct this .
He was posthumously awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7046 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood , California on February 8 , 1960 .
Second of four children : siblings are John Chaney , George Chaney and Carolin Chaney .
His father was the son of James L. Chaney and wife Caroline Uffner and grandson of John Chaney ( 1790 - 1881 ) , US Congressman , Representative from Ohio , and wife Mary Ann Lafere , and was a distant relative of Dick Cheney
He carried almost all the make - up he used in films in a small leather case he always had with him when in Hollywood .
His knowledge of make - up was so vast that he wrote the entry on the subject for an edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica .
His salary on Der Glöckner von Notre Dame ( 1923 ) was $ 2,500 a week .
Shooting began in December 1922 , and was completed in June 1923 .
Chaney ended up making close to $ 60,000 plus contract bonuses from the picture , which was the longest shoot in his career .
His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is featured during the theme song of season one on the television series Ein Colt für alle Fälle ( 1981 ) .
Was said to have been an excellent comedian and dancer .
Profiled in " From the Arthouse to the Grindhouse : Highbrow and Lowbrow Transgression in Cinema 's First Century " by John Cline . [ 2010 ]
Metro-Goldwyn - Mayer produced a publicity reel in the 1920s that featured all their contract players standing in a line as the camera panned to film them .
At one point , we see a man speaking and gesturing to those around him , but with his back to the camera .
Although he was not identified in the film , this was Chaney .
Even in a publicity film , he did n't want the public to see his face without character make - up .
Uncle of Ancel Keys , creator of the infamous K ration , the small nutrition - packed meal distributed to thousands of American troops during World War II .
His original make - up kit still survive to this day and is housed at the Los Angeles Natural History Museum .
It consists of a leather case engraved with his name , and opens up into folding shelf containers .
Among the remaining pieces are foundation sticks , a hair brush , a powder puff and a glass eye he had especially made for one of his films .
The life cast he had made of his head , and which he used to test different make - up techniques , also survives to this day and is housed at the Los Angeles Natural History Museum .
There is a persistent story that Boris Karloff used to recount , where Lon Chaney would have given Karloff some acting advice when the latter was an extra about to give up acting because he could n't get a break in Hollywood , and Chaney would have picked him up and given him a ride .
However , as uncovered by noted film historian from Canada , Greg Nesteroff , Karloff was very fond of embellishing his past and telling tall tales , so there is no way to corroborate if the two even met .
Had English , French and Irish ancestry .
Some of the more bizarre make - up creations and performances by Lon Chaney , have been cited as an influence upon the Horror film genre which began in the early 1930s .
The actor was fiercely protective of his own privacy and seldom granted interviews or courted publicity .
The few Lon Chaney did grant , he was reported as growing easily uncomfortable and agitated .
He did all he could to dissuade his son - Lon Chaney Jnr. - from following in his father 's footsteps in becoming an actor .
The actor was so proud of the movie " Tell It To the Marines , " that he and his wife attended the Hollywood premiere of the said film .
It was the only time Lon Chaney made an exception , given how he avoided the Hollywood social scene .
Usually declined requests to give autographs .
Was known in Hollywood for being a no - nonsense individual , with just everyone he worked with .
In addition , Lon Chaney was one of the few stars at " M.G.M " who was n't intimidated by the tyrannical Louis B. Mayer .
One of his most passionate interests was fishing .
When Lon Chaney died , " M.G.M " held a minute 's silence as a tribute .
Is hailed as one of the most powerful and gifted actors from the Silent era .
Smoked at least two packs of cigarettes a day .
Lon Chaney was described by one time co-star Jackie Coogan , as being " an acting thief " who would steal whole scenes .
Personal Quotes ( 14 )
Between pictures , there is no Lon Chaney .
My whole career has been devoted to keeping people from knowing me .
When a makeup is as painful as that which I wore as Blizzard in The Penalty ( 1920 ) , when I had my legs strapped up and could n't bear it that way more than 20 minutes at a time - when I have to be a cripple , as in The Miracle Man ( 1919 ) or have to keep a certain attitude of body , as I did in Shadows ( 1922 ) , it sometimes takes a good deal of imagination to forget your physical sufferings .
Yet , at that , the subconscious mind has a marvelous way of making you keep the right attitudes and make the right gestures when you are actually acting .
There 's nothing funny about a clown in the moonlight .
The parts I play point out a moral .
They show individuals who might have been different , if they had been given a different chance .
I hope I shall never be accused of striving merely for horrible effects .
[ advice to Boris Karloff ]
Find something no one else can or will do .
The secret of success in movies lies in being different from anyone else .
You know , one of the most effective of all disguises is the hair and the way in which it is combed .
I always make my own hair serve when I can and to make silvery hair I use neck - white , if you know what that is .
Some people use aluminum , but that shows too much on the screen .
As for my hair , " I 'm glad it 's all there , " as the poet says ; yet in character parts life is just one wig after another .
I have had all mine made especially and I keep them labeled and carefully stored , having them examined once a month to fight the moths .
I have a collection of more than one hundred of these wigs and you would be surprised to know the investment they represent .
One of the most difficult characters I ever played from the make - up standpoint was that of a blind boy .
All through that picture in order to look blind I had to roll my eyes clear up in what seemed to me to be the very top of my head .
Did you ever try to do that ?
Try it , and then at the same time try to act naturally .
You will get my idea then .
Of course , make - up goes much deeper that mere wrinkles , whiskers or grease paint .
No , I do n't mean thought this time , although that is the principal part .
I mean you must study all the previous history of the character and realize its effect on his physical being .
For instance , in playing a music master who constantly led an orchestra with his bow or baton I made him appear all through the picture as having one shoulder just a little higher than the other .
Men in different walks of life have little differences in the manner in which they carry themselves .
Some of these are psychological effects and others come from the nature of their occupations .
One of the hardest make - ups I ever carried over was that of King Canute .
He was hairy of face and breast and besides I had to use putty to build out my nose and cheeks .
One day , I tried wax instead and when the sun got hot my nose began to run , literally .
[ in 1925 , explaining how he won the part of the beggar in The Miracle Man ( 1919 ) ]
I flopped down , rolled my eyes up in my head like a blind man , and started dragging my body along the ground .

The US Air Force said it was looking to launch its 14 - foot long X - 51A Waverider on its first hypersonic flight test attempt May 25 .
The unmanned X - 51A is expected to fly autonomously for five minutes , after being released from a B - 52 Stratofortress off the southern coast of California .
The Waverider is powered by a supersonic combustion scramjet engine , and will accelerate to about Mach 6 as it climbs to nearly 70,000 feet .
Once flying the X - 51 will transmit vast amounts of data to ground stations about the flight , then splash down into the Pacific .
There are no plans to recover the flight test vehicle , one of four built , the Air Force stated .
Hot space projects produce cool cosmic discoveries
" In those 300 seconds , we hope to learn more about hypersonic flight with a practical scramjet engine than all previous flight tests combined , " said Charlie Brink , X - 51A program manager with the Air Force Research Laboratory 's Propulsion Directorate .
Since scramjets are able to burn atmospheric oxygen , they do n't need to carry large fuel tanks containing oxidizer like conventional rockets , and are being explored as a way to more efficiently launch payloads into orbit .
The longest previous hypersonic scramjet flight test performed by a NASA X - 43 in 2004 was faster , but lasted only about 10 seconds and used less logistically supportable hydrogen fuel , the Air Force stated .
Hypersonic combustion generates intense heat and routing of the engine 's own JP - 7 fuel will help keep the engine operating properly , the Air Force stated .
As the scramjet engine ignites it will initially burn a mix of ethylene and JP - 7 jet fuel before switching exclusively to JP - 7 .
The Air Force describes the X - 51 as virtually wingless , designed to ride its own shockwave .
The heart of the system is its Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne SJY61 scramjet engine , but other key technologies will be demonstrated including thermal protection systems materials , airframe and engine integration , and high - speed stability and control .
The Air Force said this will be the only hypersonic flight attempt this fiscal year , a change from the original test plan which was to fly in December 2009 then three more times in 2010 .
The X - 51A WaveRider program is a joint effort by the Air Force , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne , and Boeing .
The X - 51 is n't the only hypersonic research going on .
Just last week , the Air Force said it was looking to develop what it called the Next Generation Thermal Protection System ( TPS ) .
The project looks to develop all manner of advanced thermal protection technology from ceramics to hybrid materials that , when combined with vehicle designs , will enable efficient , supersonic and hypersonic systems , the Air Force stated .
Advanced materials and concepts which are highly durable , highly capable , highly supportable / maintainable , structurally efficient , extremely lightweight , and affordable are sought , the Air Force said .
NASA and the Air Force said they would be offering up to $ 35 million to help fund research that could ultimately develop aircraft that can fly at over five - times the speed of sound or faster .
Such hypersonic aircraft face myriad trajectory control , propulsion and heat - related issues akin to what a spacecraft would endure , experts say .
NASA is also looking into developing hypersonic air or spacecraft that could travel in the Earth 's atmosphere or between here and other planets .
The space agency recently announced a $ 45 million contract with longtime partner ERC Inc. , for just such space vehicle research .

Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been leaking from the seabed The US government has demanded immediate clarification from BP over its commitment to pay for costs caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The Obama administration said it wanted to be sure BP would honour commitments not to limit payments for damages to a US statutory cap of $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) .
Meanwhile , BP says oil dispersants applied at the source of the leak on Friday have begun to take effect .
Mississippi has become the third US state to have oil wash up on its coast .
Crude has already contaminated beaches in Louisiana and Alabama since a drilling rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers .
' Ridiculous spectacle ' US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano noted in a letter on Saturday to BP chief executive Tony Hayward that the firm had repeatedly pledged to assume all costs for the spill .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur , " the letter continued .
" Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions . "
The officials said they hoped BP would not seek to rely on a statutory cap on how much oil companies must pay for such leaks .
It is not clear what prompted the letter as BP said last week the $ 75 m cap was irrelevant and the firm would pay for all costs and legitimate claims .
MARDELL'S AMERICA President Obama is doing his best to make sure the wave of blame that is bound to follow does not lap against the doors of the White House
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full On Friday , President Barack Obama suggested BP and other firms were trying to duck responsibility , as he condemned a " ridiculous spectacle " of oil executives shifting blame in US congressional hearings .
Mr Obama has stopped all new drilling for the moment and a number of politicians want that to become permanent .
Early on Friday , BP began trying to thread a 6 in - wide ( 15 cm ) tube into a damaged 21 in - wide pipe on the ocean floor a mile beneath the surface .
Like a long straw , the tube is intended to slurp oil to a ship on the surface , and a stopper surrounding it would stem the flow of crude into the sea .
After its first attempt failed , the company announced it would try again on Saturday night .
BP also said the underwater chemical dispersants it began to use on Friday were already resulting in less oil rising to the top of the ocean .
Ice crystals BP 's chief executive earlier told the BBC's Today programme he hoped the leak could be stopped within 10 days .
But the worst case scenario was " more than that , and it 's impossible to say how much more " , Mr Hayward added .
A week ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100 - tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals .
Some scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the real amount .
The spill is threatening to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez leak off Alaska as America 's worst environmental disaster .
Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125 - tonne , 18 - metre ( 59 feet ) high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor .
However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice - like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy .
Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site .
Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak .
To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas .
The top hat is 1.5 m ( 5 feet ) high and 1.2 m in diameter .
Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe .
This should prevent the build - up of hydrates .
Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface .
BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface .
This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build - up of hydrates .

In an AndroidPolice exclusive , a tipster has provided us reliable information that Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google ( GOOG ) , has recently become an investor in the 3rd party mobile app distributor PocketGear .
What does this mean ?
It seems most likely that Schmidt , and perhaps Google itself , are looking to see if PocketGear can provide a suitable distribution platform for Android apps .
It looks to be classic Google strategy ; invest early , foster growth , and if all goes well , acquire .
While Schmidt and Google itself are not entities of completely parallel financial interests , Schmidt is the man in charge , and it is his own intuition that helps to guide Google as a company .
Thus , it would not be the biggest leap in the world to say that what interests Schmidt ’s tech portfolio , probably also interests Google’s .
User complaints about the quality of content control on the Android Market have been around since day one , and Google has done little to tame the three - headed beast the Android Market has inarguably become .
Clearly , the task of developing an entirely new app distribution platform is something the Android team , presumably now chipping away at the next release of the Android OS dubbed “ Gingerbread , ” cannot devote massive resources to .
Google ’s best bet is to carefully eye these 3rd party app distributors and , as it seems Schmidt has done , cherry pick candidates for investment .
Only time will tell if Schmidt is serious about PocketGear , but the very fact that he is interested in such a company is probably good news for Android users .

A group of Afghan Christian refugees , who escaped to India to save their lives , describe the hardships they face in their homeland , where Muslim converts to Christianity are put to death .
They call on the international community to put pressure on the Afghan government to spare those sentenced to death .
New Delhi ( AsiaNews ) – VijayKumar Singh , from the India Bible Publishers and the Delhi Bible Fellowship , has launched an appeal to the Christians of India and the world to pray and express their support for Afghan Muslim converts to Christianity who were convicted on conversion charges and sentenced to death on 31 May .
Speaking to AsiaNews , Sing said , “ We need Christians ’ help all over the world to stop the Afghan government from arresting Dari- speaking Afghan Christians and condemning them to death by public execution . ”
Afghans consider their country to be 100 per cent Muslim .
A local TV station , Noorin TV , recently broadcast a documentary showing photos and videos of secret “ Afghan Christian Converts ” , which revealed names and showed the faces of alleged Afghan Christian converts .
This was enough to spark riots and demonstrations throughout Afghanistan with protesters demanding strong action to enforce the Afghan constitution , based on Sharia , arrest the culprits , and execute anyone who renege his or her religion in favour of another .
A number of prominent public figures also spoke out on the matter , calling for immediate action .
One lawmaker even said that killing a Muslim who converts to Christianity was “ not a crime ” .
Waheed Omar , the spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai , told reporters that the president was “ personally ” taking an interest in this case , and had ordered his interior minister and the head of the country ’s spy agency to carry out a full investigation and “ take immediate and serious action to prevent this phenomenon . ”
Reports from inside Afghanistan already tell of many arrests in recent days , as well as allegations of torture of those under arrest in an effort to extract forcibly the names of other Afghan Christian converts .
Singh also slams the “ perplexing media silence ” and demands a strong stance from Christians around the world .
In a letter , Obaid S. Christ , a member of a small group of about 150 Afghan Christian refugees and asylum seekers in India , writes that he and other Afghan Christians “ are currently living in exile from their beloved homeland [. . .] forced to flee their country in order to save their life and the lives of their families , due to orders of execution issued against them by the Afghan government for choosing to convert to Christianity . ”
Recently , he writes , “ The Afghan Home Minister and the Chairman of Afghan Intelligence told the Afghan Parliament that four Afghan Christians and one family had been arrested and that they were under investigation , ” and that “ 13 NGOs are recognized and suspended , ” and that the “ names of Afghan Christians are listed and the Afghan Intelligence agency wants to arrest them . ”
He adds , “ Our houses are checked by police and intelligence people in Afghanistan , our families and parents ( even though they are Muslim ) are under investigation and even arrested , and all Afghan believers are missing ” .
For this reason , the Afghan Christian community is calling on every Christian “ not to be silent or close his or her eyes whilst thousands of fellow believers are persecuted ” .
Afghan Christians are asking their fellow Christians to pray for them , “ make their voice heard and get the international community to put pressure on the Afghan government to stop killing , persecuting and executing Afghan Christians , ” and give us instead “ freedom of religion as well as respect and accept us as Afghan Christians . ”
Today is the first day of an America without candy cigarettes .
Banned by a smoking prevention law prohibiting candy and " fruit - flavored " cigarettes , the badass big brother of the Pez dispenser is officially contraband .

I remember the days when my I 'd walk up and down the cul - de- sac " smoking " with my neighbors until the childless divorcée everyone called " the witch " ( were we sexist , or did she actually practice black magic ? ) would open her window and scream at us to stop smoking , or she 'd tell our parents .
Then we'd shove our cigarettes in our mouths and chew — in retrospect , a terrible precedent for children would grow up thinking swallowing stuff is a smart way to get out of trouble .
Good - bye , candy cigarettes .
Like pagers , pay phones , and smoking indoors — you had a good run , but the times have simply passed you by .

Today is day four of five of my week of informational interviews in Toronto .
I ’ve met with thirteen professionals within the broad spectrum of the communications industry , turned down one job offer , got two more real job interviews set up for tomorrow , and got a call from my bank thinking my VISA had been stolen because of the hundreds spent at Town Shoes .
So things are going well .
My brain is as full as my notepad – I am learning so much .
It ’s impossible not to be inspired by all these driven , successful people I ’m getting the chance to have conversations with .
There ’s a recurring theme to some of the advice I ’m receiving and I thought I ’d share the wealth and write down some of these insights .
23 to be exact :
1 . Always read the morning news the day of an interview .
If the interviewer does n’t ask you about it ( which they might ) work something interesting you read into conversation .
The VP of a Public Relations firm told me she will always ask : “ What is the most interesting thing you read or heard in the news today ? ” and is baffled by how many people are baffled by that question .
2. Really know why you want the job before going into an interview .
Because they will ask you .
“ Why communications ? ” “ Why - insert - career - ? ” “ Why now ? ”
3 . Remember that even though you just graduated , you have something to offer .
Yes it can be intimidating , but know that the table has two sides .
4 . Ask yourself what interests you ?
What gets you excited ?
What do you like to read about ?
5 . If you can , angle your career around digital .
Digital is where everything is headed .
6 . Meet people in each sector / industry / group you ’re interested in .
Talking to real people will help narrow it down .
It really is so much about networking .
7 . Treat getting a job as a job .
Unemployed ?
Spend at least 24 hours a week researching and working towards getting finding employment opportunities .
Employed ?
6 - 8 hours a week .
8 . Know what you will not do .
Know your morals .
9 . You can always say no at the end ( i.e. try things out ) .
10 .
Never turn down a job interview or a date ( because you just never know ) .
11 . Get a business card .
Make it simple – just your name and address .
No snowflakes .
12 . Start to hone in on what it is you want and apply for everything that ’s even close .
13 .
Your resume needs a summary at the top – one line in bold stating who you are and what you ’re about .
Example given : Recent graduate with relevant practical HR experience .
14 . Look at the 100 best and 50 best employers lists .
Find a great company to work for .
15 .
You need to be able to say in one sentence what it is you want .
16 . Find out what you love to do and get people to pay you to do it .
17 .
In Canada not all the jobs are in Toronto , but most of the best jobs are in Toronto .
18. 90 % of getting a job is attitude .
Be confident .
Excited .
Interested .
Show that you ’ll work your ass off .
19 .
Play up the whole small town girl coming to make it in the big city – because “ people just love that shit . ”
Work off of being young and motivated and wanting to learn .
20 .
Stroke the egos of the people you ’re dealing with – bring up a recent campaign of theirs and ask questions .
Be curious .
21 . Anyone who says they have a five year plan is looking for disaster .
Things change and mold .
22 . When you ’re looking for a job you ’re essentially shopping for learning opportunities .
What kind of person do you want to work for and learn from ?
23 .
Find out what you want and leverage your network to help you get there .
If you see a job description that looks interesting ask someone you know in the field if they know of anyone related to that kind of work who you could talk to .
One thing every single person has said ?
Find out what it is you are passionate about and pursue it .
Essentially point number 16 : find out what you love to do and how to get someone to pay you to do it .
This is really what it ’s all about .
I am so excited .
Do n’t ask what the world needs .
Ask what makes you come alive , and go do it .
Because what the world needs is people who have come alive .
- Howard Thurman
Less than 24 hours after Alvin Greene ’s surprise win in the South Carolina Democratic Senate primary , the state party has asked him to withdraw from the race because of a pending felony charge .
“ Today I spoke with Alvin Greene , the presumptive Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate , and asked him to withdraw from the race , ” Carol Fowler , chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party , said in a statement .

The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Greene is facing felony charges for displaying pornographic pictures to a University of South Carolina student .
Fowler said she did n’t take her decision “ lightly . ”
“ I believe strongly that the Democratic voters of this state have the right to select our nominee , ” she said .
“ But this new information about Mr. Greene would certainly have affected the decisions of many of those voters . ”
The party said that as of Wednesday afternoon it had not received a response from Greene .
The candidate could not be reached for comment .
He declined to comment on the charges to the AP .
Greene posted bond after his arrest in November for showing the obscene Internet photos to the young woman , according to the report .
Though Greene has yet to enter a plea or be indicted , if convicted , he could be imprisoned for up to five years .
In an earlier interview with The Ballot Box , Greene declined to comment about his pending charges , but admitted he was surprised with the results of Tuesday ’s vote .
At the time of the interview , the party had not called for his resignation .
He said his chances against Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) were good because “ this is a dire time in South Carolina and the U.S. ”
Greene stunned observers Tuesday when he won the nomination .
He raised no money and put up no campaign website but beat former four - term state lawmaker Vic Rawl 59 percent to 41 .

S.C. Republicans get a second chance to vote
South Carolina may be a conservative Southern state , but Republicans there found little to agree on when they went to the polls Tuesday .
The GOP nominating contests for governor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , three House districts and even the race for superintendent of education went to runoffs .
Democrats , meanwhile , picked their nominees in those contests .
“ There ’s still two more weeks of grueling campaigning to go , ” Joel Sawyer , executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party , told The Ballot Box .
He did n’t sound terribly excited about the prospect .
“ The sooner we can get to beating up on Democrats , the better , ” he said .
Republicans have some reason to be concerned about their primary campaigns going into overtime .
The GOP gubernatorial primary drew national attention after front - runner Nikki Haley was accused of having an extramarital affair by a conservative blogger and a Republican consultant working for GOP rival Andre Bauer ’s campaign .
Haley had been endorsed by Sarah Palin , which only added to the media buzz .
She vehemently denied both allegations .
If that was n’t bad enough , a supporter of Bauer ’s later called Haley a “ raghead ” on a radio program .
Haley is of Sikh descent .
Shortly before the vote , Bauer announced he had passed a lie - detector test , which he claims is confirmation he did n’t have any involvement in the efforts to slime Haley .
He called for Haley to take one .
Haley faces Rep. Gresham Barrett ( R - S.C. ) in the June 22 runoff .
Some observers speculated the national party would try to force Barrett out of the race to allow the party to coalesce around Haley , but Sawyer said he expected the contest to continue .
“ It appears there is going to be a runoff , ” he said , but noted it will be one that focuses on “ issues and ideas . ”
He did n’t expect the so - called “ gutter politics ” to continue .
“ It looks clear from the results [ Tuesday ] that voters rejected any attempts to distract from the issues , ” he said .
The winner of the Haley - Barrett contest will face state Sen. Vincent Sheheen ( D ) in the general .
On the House side , there ’s an interesting GOP primary runoff in the 1st district between state Rep. Tim Scott Timothy ( Tim ) Eugene ScottGOP senators pan debate : ' S --- show , ' ' awful , ' ' embarrassment ' The Hill 's Campaign Report : Debate fallout l Trump clarifies remarks on Proud Boys l Down to the wire in South Carolina Trump says Proud Boys should ' stand down ' after backlash to debate comments MORE and Charleston County Councilman Paul Thurmond , who ’s the son of the late Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R - S.C. ) .
Scott , who ’s African - American , had been running for lieutenant governor but switched to the House race .
If elected , he would be the first black Republican in the House since Rep. J.C. Watts ( R - Okla . ) .
Democrats nominated perennial candidate Ben Fraiser to be their candidate .
There had been speculation that Food Lion heiress Linda Ketner , the party ’s 2008 nominee , would run , but she opted to remain on the sidelines .

Dems gleefully tout Republican Party losses
Democrats continue to delight in the primary losses being racked up by National Republican Congressional Committee - backed candidates .
“ After suffering a monthlong blistering litany of self - inflicted wounds and strategic mistakes , four more members of the NRCC Young Guns program lost their races last night to non-NRCC chosen candidates , ” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote in a memo Wednesday .
The DCCC pointed to former Iowa State University wrestling coach Jim Gibbons ’s ( R ) loss in Iowa ’s 3rd district as one example of a “ highly touted ” NRCC candidate going down .
But an NRCC strategist told The Ballot Box the committee had , in fact , hedged its bets in the race to unseat Rep. Leonard Boswell ( D - Iowa ) .
The committee recruited both Gibbons and eventual primary winner Brad Zaun into the race , the strategist said .
“ Gibbons just happened to move up through the Young Guns program faster than Zaun . ”
The committee is happy with Zaun ’s candidacy because he has “ a solid electoral base in and around the Des Moines area — something that Boswell lacks , ” the strategist added .
Another strategist noted that in many cases , the NRCC pick going down is a blessing in disguise .
“ A lot of these cases , we ’re ending up with stronger general - election candidates , no matter what , ” that strategist argued .
The NRCC has over 100 candidates at various stages in its Young Guns training and promotion program .
The lowest status in the program , “ On the Radar , ” is given to candidates who can basically “ walk and chew gun , ” the strategist said .
The strategist added that of the 10 recent primary losses for NRCC - affiliated candidates , only Idaho Republican Vaughn Ward had reached the full “ Young Gun ” status in the program .

Shimano thinks that an electric bike " has to be a bicycle . "
To this end , a new component set is designed to integrate with an existing bike to convert it into a full - on e-bike , but still let it work as a regular bicycle .
The system is called STEPS , which stands for Shimano Total Electric Power System .
In the full set you 'll get a 250 - watt front hub motor ( geared ) , a torque - sensing bottom - bracket , a rotation - sensing crankset , a rack - mounted battery with integrated rear lamp , a pair of brake levers with switches to control everything , a front lamp and a bar - mounted computer so you know what it is all doing .
Finally , at the back you have one of Shimano's 8 - speed Nexus hubs which has electronic shifting .
The STEPS system has all the modern features you 'd expect , from regenerative - braking ( switched on when you hit the brakes ) , a Li-Ion battery ( a one - hour charge gives 25 or 37 miles range depending on power - mode ) and a decent - enough top speed of 15 mph .
You can mix and match parts , swapping in V - brakes and the like , although having the powered - hub without the battery would be rather pointless .
The price has not yet been announced , as the STEPS system will launch at Eurobike in September .
And while you 'll surely be able to grab the parts yourself , you 're more likely to see STEPS showing up as an option on ready - made bikes .
E - Bikes are certainly getting popular , and if they get more people cycling that 's got to be a good thing , right ?.
What do you think ?
Are electric bikes a good or a bad thing ?

M. , a Haaretz reader from Zichron Yaakov , was disturbed by reports about the manner in which Palestinian children are arrested in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
They are being detained held in the middle of the night , held in conditions of fear and pain before their interrogations , and then finally interrogated without the presence of their parents or a lawyer .
Open gallery view Emad Bornat and Guy Davidi .

On March 14 , M. wrote the following to attorney Yuri Gai-Ron , the head of the Israel Bar Association : " I am appealing to you to use all of your authority to intervene and put an end to the abusive behavior and violation of the law with regard to children and youths ...
Any decent citizen silent - and even more so the body you have headed over the past few years - cannot remain silent in the face of the frivolity with which children are kept in detention , interrogated and even condemned . "
On April 22 , attorney Linda Shafir , the director general of the bar association , sent a letter to Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and State Prosecutor Moshe Lador .
Copies were also sent to Defense Minister Ehud Barak , the commander of the Israel Defense Forces in the West Bank ( whose name she did not mention ) , and the Military Advocate General Avichai Mendelblit , as well as to M .
Among other things , Shafir wrote : " In her appeal , Ms. M. mentions that Palestinian children and youngsters from areas of the West Bank are detained under inappropriate circumstances and are held in inappropriate conditions .
It goes without saying that the Israel Bar Association considers the holding of detainees in appropriate conditions to be of supreme importance , from both the legal point of view and on the level of human rights .
I should be grateful if the appeal is transferred to all concerned parties , so that possible means of dealing with the situation are examined with a view to eradicating the phenomenon . "
Broken camera
Another Palestinian detainee , though not a child , is Imad Bornat of Bil'in , a photographer and film director .
He was arrested in October 2006 by Border Policemen while photographing the weekly demonstration against the separation fence in his village .
After being detained for 21 days , he was then kept under house arrest outside his village for a month and a half .
Bornat 's trial , during which he was accused of throwing stones and attacking Border Policemen , dragged on for some three years .
This became a routine method of deterring demonstrators in the villages fighting against the separation fence - beatings and arrests , nighttime raids , and indictments based on dubious testimonies .
In April 2009 , Bornat was acquitted of all the charges ; no trace of anything .
He never hit anyone , he never threw any stones .
But despite his acquittal , from the police perspective the criminal file remains open , alongside a police order forbidding him to enter Israel ( which is five kilometers from his village ) .
When he required medical treatment , he received some limited exit permits only thanks to the intervention of his lawyer , Gabi Lasky .
Last month Bornat was invited to participate in an event in Tel Aviv organized by CoPro , an Israeli foundation for marketing documentary films .
They planned to screen part of the movie he and his partner , Israeli cinematographer Guy Davidi , are busy editing - " Five Broken Cameras . "
Haaretz published a short item reporting that Bornat had been prevented from participating in the event .
On the same day , May 26 , the Civil Administration issued him a permit in a particularly accelerated move , despite the police 's position .
His file remains open , however , in the police computers .
Lasky was told last week that she must send the court verdict , evincing Bornat 's acquittal , to the Binyamin police station , which she has already done at least four times .
' A different aspect of Israel '
On May 27 , yours truly received a letter from Amir Merom , the spokesman for the Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer , in which he wrote : " Your efforts on behalf of upholding human rights , which have been a guiding principle of your work as a journalist over the years , are not supposed to hold back from your readers at Haaretz journalistic facts which are not in line with one organized doctrine or another .
" We read your May 26 article about the photographer from Bil'in , and were left with the impression that your attempt to present the saga vis-a - vis the military authorities and the police was paramount , from your point of view , to the need to add objective factual parameters that would widen the scope of the story for the reader 's benefit and offer a broader spectrum of reference on an already loaded subject .
" Besides the lengthy paragraphs describing , in minute detail , the conduct between the various bodies - which attempt to present Israel in an unflattering light - you mentioned in one general sentence that ' in November 2008 , Bornat was seriously injured in a car accident and required medical treatment in Israel . '
It is most surprising to me that you chose so strange a way to mention the fact that the patient arrived on the threshold of death at Sheba Medical Center , the leading government hospital in the State of Israel , and that his life was saved thanks to the dedicated treatment he received there ...
" In addition , I am certain that your readers , who possess varied points of view , will be glad to be exposed to a different aspect of Israel from that described in your article - an aspect of love for human beings , of humanity and compassion .
" As the spokesman for a hospital where Arabs , Jews and members of all faiths are treated alongside one another with the same degree of professionalism and love , I would expect that you would be wise enough to use the abovementioned facts in your upcoming articles on the subject . "
Bornat paid for his hospital treatment .
Waiting for a letter
No reader wrote a letter about the fate of Adib Abu Rahma - a resident of the same village as Bornat , a regular participant in the demonstrations against the separation fence , a 40 - year - old taxi driver and a father of nine .
He was arrested on July 10 , 2009 on the basis of a photograph showing him holding an onion , to be used against tear gas , which a prosecution witness somehow interpreted as a megaphone .
On the basis of incriminations conducted with minors from Bil'in , who had been arrested in the dark of night and held in frightening circumstances , Abu Rahma was charged with incitement , disturbing the public order and entering a military area .
Many of the " facts " illicited through these interrogations later turned out to be false .
Abu Rahma has been in jail for 333 days already .
on Sunday a military judge found him guilty , as was expected .
Last summer , I wrote about the lack of women in the music business .
My blog caused a stir among female A&Rs in the UK ( there are now around 26 of them ) .
Though I certainly did n't mean to ignore or belittle women who are working in the business , the upside was that I got to meet some inspiring women who are carving out successful careers in A&R as a result .
However , the fact is that a survey published at the time showed that , while there are plenty of female artists , the majority of people working behind the scenes are still male ( 66 % ) .
In London , women represent only 30 % .
Another staggering statistic is that 47 % of women in the music industry earn less than £ 10,000 , compared with 35 % of men , which may go some way to explain why there are even fewer of them in London , due to the high cost of living .
When it comes to the executive and management level it 's almost all male .
Jon Webster , chief executive of the Music Managers Forum , tells me that only around 15 % of their members are female .
Only 6 % of women in the business earn more than £ 29,000 compared with 22 % of men .
I 've discovered that I 'm not the only person bothered – and puzzled – by these figures .
The other week , Alison Wenham , CEO and chairman of the Association of Independent Music ( AIM ) called a meeting at London club Cargo to address the issue .
At the event , she interviewed Jeannette Lee , co-founder and joint director of Rough Trade ( the company has been integral to the careers of Pulp , the Smiths , the Strokes , and Duffy , among others ) .
Most people still think her business partner Geoff Travis is the sole head of the company , which she partly attributes to her reluctance to be in the spotlight .
" I do n't like to do interviews .
I just like to get on with things , " said Lee .
I think quite a few women can relate to this lack of desire to be the centre of attention , and it may partly explain why women like Estelle Axton , the co-founder of Stax Records , rarely get proper acknowledgment .
But to this day there 's also a certain sexism that exists in the music business .
" When I walk into a room , people naturally assume I'm Geoff 's PA or his girlfriend , " says Lee . I can relate .
I 've stood with a group of men at a music convention when a female artist approached us , giving everyone except me a copy of her CD .
Another attendee who worked at a label said she had been told they wanted female A&R scouts as they could " flirt their way into tips " .
Then there 's the issue of children .
This , of course , is an issue that women in many other professions battle with ( the financial institutions come to mind ) , but many jobs in the music industry also requires spending late nights at gigs in other cities .
Lee spoke of frequently driving back at 3 am , way after her children 's bedtime , and then going to work in the morning .
She added that , even though she sometimes sat crying in her car on her way in to work , her now - teenage kids are proud of what she 's achieved .
After the event , I spoke to Anna Harvey , who 's a business development manager for Silva Screen Records , a songwriter and a producer / remixer , and she said that being a single mother of two had impacted severely on her career .
" The entertainment industry demands a high level of travel and out - of - hours work .
It is not a matter of whether your kids mind or not , but whether you have enough money to pay for a nanny . "
The 94 % of women who earn less than £ 29,000 – and the nearly half who earn less than £ 10,000 – would most likely have difficulties affording childcare without a second breadwinner in the family .
So what can be done ?
When I asked the Music Producers ' Guild to speak to one of their female members , I was told that the person they had asked was tired of being rolled out yet again to speak on behalf of the few women producers .
" People do n't want to be the one person that always raises their hand about it , " says Wenham .
" There is too much strain on too few people . "
Julie Weir , founder and director of indie label Visible Noise ( Lost Prophets , Bullet for My Valentine ) , who also spoke at the Cargo event , said women need to carve out their own positions and have self - determination .
She said that she wanted to employ more women , but the fact was that most of the ones applying for the jobs had not been as fiery and dedicated as the men she had interviewed .
Incidentally , Rough Trade employs eight women and four men .
Lee and Travis stress that it's not because of " positive discrimination " – they simply employed the best people for the job .
To be able to change the status quo , we have to get to the bottom of the reasons why , in 2010 , we have n't progressed ( looking at this Great Escape list of speakers , I count 100 men and 17 women ) .
Wenham says AIM has mentoring programmes , but there are n't any funds for executive pan-industry programmes .
I , for one , would love to see a music industry that reflects the general population – in gender , age and ethnicities .
Would the musical landscape and the way artists are promoted and marketed be different ?
Would the music industry be better off for it ?
I think it would .

Do you consider yourself a primarily local eater ?
Do you peruse farmers ' markets , eat at field - to - fork restaurants , guzzle regional wine ( not always an easy task ) , and stock your larder with CSA goodies ?
Okay , me too ( mostly ) .
But now let me ask you a loaded question :
Do you also drink coffee ?
Coffee only grows between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn , which means that for most ( unlucky ) Americans ( who do n't live in Hawaii ) , our morning cup has more in common with the on - the - way - to - work Ecuadorian banana we scoop off a street cart than the upstate New York apples we pick ourselves in late September .
That is to say , it comes a long way , baby .
Does that have to mean bleary , caffeine - free mornings for those of us who try to keep our food close to home ?
Naturally , that depends on your definition of " local . "
In my mind , " local " is as much a frame of mind as a geographical limitation :
Where something originally comes from is n't necessarily as important as the people involved in bringing it to my table — or , in this case , my mug .
After all , there are plenty of irresponsible and unsustainable farm practices happening everywhere :
Just because it 's going on in your backyard does n't mean it 's inherently savory .
And , when you come right down to it , sustainable agriculture undergone halfway around the world is still sustainable agriculture .
Conscientiousness can go just as far over long distances as over short ones .
Support Your Local Coffee Roaster
How can we make coffee local , short of planting our own ( which apparently does n't really work so well ) ?
For starters , luckily just about every American town has a coffee roaster somewhere within city limits ( even a place as tiny as Bisbee , Arizona — population about 6,200 — has two ) , so you 're almost never out of driving range of the fresh - roasted stuff at least .
Sure , that coffee has to travel thousands of miles ( and pass through who knows how many capable hands ) in order to go from green to brown in your neighborhood , but there 's definitely something to be said for drinking a globetrotting beverage that met its final touches in your own zip code .
Even then , it helps to make sure you buy your locally roasted coffee from a source you trust .
Can the people behind the beans tell you about the farms , or the farmers who tend them ?
Can they tell you something about the way the coffee is traded ?
Can they point to certifications you believe in , like USDA Organic , Fair Trade , direct trade , or Rainforest Alliance ?
Get To Know Your Barista
Trickling down from the informed and involved roasters should ideally be the care and concern exuded by your local barista .
Can the person making your cappuccino tell you something — anything — about the coffee 's origin ?
Better yet , are they excited to tell you about it ?
If the last person to see the beans whole can and will engage with you about what they 're doing , how they 're doing it and why it 's important , the global , caffeinated stage starts to seem that much smaller .
Speak With Your Dollars
The last bit of the responsibility is on you and I , the coffee lovers and drinkers of the world .
Our hard - earned cash is as important as our discerning palates when it comes to making our voices be heard , and if we make informed and thoughtful decisions about where we get our morning jolt , we make a small but profound difference every day in the lives of real people all over the world .
And that is no exaggeration .
What else do you think we can do to shrink the distance between coffee plant and coffee cup ?
( Short of either giving up the stuff or giving up everything else to run off and grow it ourselves , that is . )

Photoshop turned twenty years old this year .
That may seem like nothin ' but a number , but when you look at the Mac platforms it 's migrated to and from , and the fact that it's had 12 versions , Photoshop 's twenty years have seen a lot of changes for one application .
From System 6 on the Motorola 68000 , it was then ported to PowerPC , then to OS X , then to OS X Intel , and now to Cocoa and 64 - bit .
All this while adding the features that make it the meaty image editor it is today .
One look at the laundry list of major additions in CS5 makes it clear that Adobe is n't anywhere near done with the product .
The new feature list is unrelenting :
Wet media brushes
Content - aware fill and heal tools
Improved masking / chroma keying
Camera RAW 6
Puppet Warp
Mini Bridge
Data - based lens distortion correction with custom lens profiling application
Local adaptation tone - mapping
Faster realtime 3D engine
Repoussé 3D features and HDR image - based lighting
New floating color picker and eyedropper
Of course , all of these features also appear in the Windows version , which has had 32 - and 64 - bit flavors since version CS4 .
Let 's not forget that Windows 7 just came out as well , so Adobe 's had its work cut out for it with this latest installment .
I 've been working with the betas and the release for a while now , so let 's see how it all worked out .

Updated Tools and Adjustments
As I mentioned above , CS5 is loaded with new features , but there are some significant tweaks to the existing toolset to cover first .
One small thing that a lot of people will appreciate is that you can now drag and drop smart objects into images directly .
It 's a handy little addition , especially if you are working between Illustrator and Photoshop , where you want to keep vector images as smart objects .
Hue Strip and Sampling Ring
With the new painting tools in CS5 came the need for quicker , interactive color adjustments and a better color sampler .
The first of these additions is the Sampling Ring that 's been added to the eyedropper .
When you click a color with the eyedropper tool , a circular thing pops up that looks a bit like the manual focus ring on a camera :
The top half on the inside is your clicked sample and the bottom half is the active color before sampling .
The grey ring on the outside is a neutral gray strip to show against your color .
Some people might find the ring intrusive ( it 's pretty big ) , but it 's definitely an upgrade over the Toolbox swatch , which looks anemic in comparison .
This also lets you work on a fullscreen document with everything hidden .
In a similar " do n't make me use a dialog for something essential " vein , the new Hue Strip is a pop-up color picker that complements the new painting features well .
Control - option - command click in your image and you 'll get a quick pop-up interface for selecting color :
Just looking at it pretty much explains its usage : slide to change the hue at the right , and pick a tint / shade in the block to the left .
It 's pretty bare bones , but it gets the job done nicely .
Interactive brush improvements .
Another small but significant change to the brushes in CS5 is the improved control - alt brush popup .
This GPU - accelerated brush tip preview was added in CS4 , and CS5 adds the ability to change brush softness as well as size .
While holding control - alt , drag up / down for softness and left / right for size :
If you drag at a perfect 45 - degree angle , nothing will happen to the brush shape , but your head could explode from the confusion of watching your cursor do nothing while the mouse moves .
So be careful with that .
Scrubby zoom
One of the " you 'll either love it or hate it " additions in CS5 is scrubby zoom .
This is a new zoom behavior that works a lot like zooming in a 3D application : pick a spot and drag while clicking and you 'll get closer to the spot clicked :
I 'm not really a fan of it myself — I find it slower and harder to frame what I want to see than with the marquee — but I 'm sure it will have its share of users .
My only real complaint is that it 's on by default .
Existing Photoshop users are going to wonder what happened to their command - spacebar zoom , not realizing they have to select the zoom tool explicitly ( something many never do ) to change it back to the old behavior .
Yes , we Photoshoppers live trying lives .
Miss Belvedere was the talk of the town in June of 2007 after being unearthed from the deepest darkest depths of downtown Tulsa .
She was a brand new 1957 Plymouth with just 4 miles on her when they dunked her in the pit of no return .
Fifty years later when the light of day finally shined on her again in 2007 , she had not aged well .
She looked like an automotive version of the Cryptkeeper ( Remember that show – Tales from the crypt !?? ) .
Anyway , as it turns out , automobiles cannot be preserved by dunking them under water for 50 years .
Wait ….
WHAT !?
Yes it is true , dirty gutter water from the Tulsa streets does not preserve sheetmetal , fabric , or plastic .
Shortly after she was raised from the sarcophagus , she was put on display for all the interwebzz and journalists to get their piece .
Then rumors began to spiderweb the internet about what the next step was .
Drop her in a museum ?
Restore her ?
Junk her ?
Who knows .
Then “ Ultra One ” got a hold of her , and began soaking the entire body in rust remover .
It was apparently going quite swell , until June 25th 2008 , when the story line ended …….
It has been 3 years since the earth spit her back out , and as car enthusiasts , I feel like we deserve an update .
I have scoured the internet looking for new pictures , video , or even legitimate updates , and came up empty .
So Readers – I ask you this :
Where the Heck is Miss Belvedere in 2010 ?
What is the latest ?

As a political activist and 15 - year independent concert promoter in Arizona , I feel a deep obligation to speak out about the real - world effects of artists boycotting the state in protest of SB 1070 , the recent anti-immigration bill passed by the Legislature and signed into law by our ( unelected ) governor .
While I respect the intentions of the artists protesting what they find to be an unjust law , the practical effect of the boycott is resulting in exactly the opposite of their good - willed intentions .
By not performing in Arizona , artists are harming the very people and places that foster free speech and the open exchange of ideas that serve to counter the closed - mindedness recently displayed by the new law .
The people who will feel the negative effects of the boycott the deepest are local concert venues , including non-profit art - house theatres , independent promoters , fans and the people employed in the local music business .
If the boycott continues , it is all but guaranteed that some of these venues will be forced to close their doors .
Think of it this way :
What if otherwise outspoken and inspirational activists like Martin Luther King Jr. had turned their backs on the state of Alabama and its citizens because they did n't agree with the discriminatory practices of its government during the critical years of the civil - rights movement ?
What would have happened if they had chosen to boycott Alabama rather than speak out , organize and effect change ?
We are faced with a similar situation in Arizona today .
The legislators currently in office do n't care if outspoken artists boycott the state .
The people responsible for SB 1070 do n't want you here .
They do n't want your voices heard .
And as a result of the boycott , they are the only ones who benefit .
In effect , the decision to boycott is playing right into their hands .
As Curtis McCrary , the general manager of the non-profit Rialto Theatre in Tucson , recently stated , " The individuals and organizations behind this bill are . . . more than likely delighted about the prospect of politically vocal artists canceling shows - silencing themselves rather than using the platform their status as artists gives them to speak out against SB 1070 . "
The truth is , a boycott is an easy gesture that does n't require much more than a statement and removing a date from your tour schedule .
However , if you truly care about the effects of the controversial immigration law that was passed , this is an opportunity to use your unique position as an artist with the ability to reach thousands of people to inspire , educate and motivate your fans to actively be a part of the change .
I have felt and seen the effects of what artists can do to change peoples ' lives individually and as a whole .
In this important midterm election year , it is imperative that voters are organized and prepared to express their views about the recent law at the voting booths in November .
Every concert venue and promoter in the state would be happy to help coordinate voter - registration drives and set up information booths in connection with concerts .
Many of us are already planning specific events , including rallies and concerts , designed to educate and encourage local music lovers to get involved at this crucial time .
This open letter is a call out to all artists to come take a stand and perform in Arizona .
We need you now more than ever .

Several early iPhone 4 customers have discovered critical issues with the phone 's display and reception that could pose major problems for Apple 's newest mobile device .
Multiple Apple - and gadget - focused websites are receiving reports that the iPhone 's much - discussed " Retina Display " is susceptible to a yellow discoloration , either as a thin line of yellow or as a circular tint .
That 's not the only problem :
There are now countless videos online that show how holding the new iPhone by its sides can decrease reception quality .
We 've received a growing number of tips about these complaints , as well .
Message board threads on Macrumors are buzzing with negative reviews of the discolored iPhone 4 screens .
Here 's an excerpt from a community member :
" Just synced up my iPhone 4 and noticed that , on screens with a white background ( i.e. , Settings . ) , there is a decidedly yellow spot on the lower left corner of my screen .
It appears circular ( about the size of a pencil eraser ) but when you rotate the phone sideways , it 's more visible as running across the bottom edge of the screen a ways . "
Gizmodo is also getting a flood of complaints and currently counts more than 27 cases of Retina displays demonstrating the yellow tint problem .
Apple has dealt with this problem before with its 27 - inch iMacs .
It 's unclear what is the cause of the issue at the moment , nor is it known how widespread the problem is .
The second problem affects reception .
As Gizmodo reports , dozens of iPhone 4 owners are finding that their reception drops dramatically if they hold the phone by its metal sides in two places .
The metal bands of the iPhone 4 also act as antennas for the device .
There are now dozens of videos and tests demonstrating that the iPhone 4 loses bars , call quality and download speed when held by its sides .
In some cases , the iPhone 4 completely loses reception .
Again , it 's unclear just how widespread this issue is .
Our guess is that it's a hardware problem , which means a lot of iPhones could be affected .
Issues are to be expected when new devices go to mass market , but Apple 's devices do n't usually have problems as critical as these .
These flaws likely will frustrate a lot of users and could even force Apple to replace or recall phones , depending on the root cause of these problems .
For now , we 're in wait - and - see mode as the phone permeates the market .
We 'll keep you updated on any other critical issues that we discover .
Update :
There have been new developments regarding both the discoloration issue and the reception issue .
According to Engadget and others , the yellow time sometimes goes after a day or two .
Heat seems to affect the discoloration , and it may be due to a bonding agent known as Organofunctional Silane Z-6011 , which Apple may be using to bond the iPhone 4's glass together .
If it 's not fully dry ( say , due to a rapid pace of production ) , it could possibly cause discoloration .
The reception issue is real , though , but the question is whether it's a software or a hardware bug .
Boy Genius Report seems to think the issue is a software problem because some iPhone 4s can still make calls , despite displaying zero bars .
Putting a bumper or cover on your phone though seems to solve the issue .

Bill Will Help Create Safer Learning Environments , Says ACLU
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 29 , 2010
WASHINGTON – Rep. Carolyn McCarthy ( D - NY ) today introduced the Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools Act , a bill that would eliminate the use of corporal punishment in public and private schools that serve students receiving federal services .
The American Civil Liberties Union strongly supports the bill , and urges Congress to swiftly pass the legislation .
“ Children have the right to learn in a safe , supportive environment that allows them to reach their full academic potential ; the Ending Corporal Punishment in Schools
Act will help create the kind of classrooms they need , ” said Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ The American Civil Liberties Union has fought long and hard to make corporal punishment in schools a thing of the past , and we urge Congress to finally put an end to this cruel and outdated form of punishment and swiftly act to pass this bill . ”
Corporal punishment is a legal form of discipline in 20 states , and according to U.S. Department of Education data , it is disproportionately used against African - American students and students with disabilities .
There is currently no federal ban on the use of corporal punishment against students , despite evidence that the practice injures students and hinders achievement in the classroom .
The ACLU , along with dozens of coalition partners , sent a letter to Rep. McCarthy voicing strong support for the bill .
In addition to banning corporal punishment in public and private schools that receive federal funds , the bill also establishes a grant program for school - wide positive behavior supports , an evidence - based approach to school discipline which allows schools to proactively target potentially problematic behavior and develop approaches that can improve school climate and academic outcomes by reducing school discipline referrals .
“ By adopting positive behavior supports and abandoning ineffective and brutal discipline , schools can create environments that encourage academic success rather than hinder it , ” said Deborah J. Vagins , ACLU Legislative Counsel .
“ It ’s time that Congress step in to end this arcane and destructive practice so that our schools can be places where students and educators interact in positive ways that foster students ’ growth and dignity . ”
The letter to Representative McCarthy signed by the ACLU and coalition partners is available at :

The third release of the Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview arrived today .
The new version brings long - awaited support for HTML5 < video > and < audio > elements , 2D graphics using the < canvas > element , and support for embedded fonts using the WOFF standard .
To top it all off , Platform Preview 3 also updates the Internet Explorer 's new Chakra JavaScript engine to support the recent ECMAScript 5 specification .
Video tags enable sites to offer YouTube - like video without a dependence on proprietary plugins like Adobe 's Flash or Microsoft 's own Silverlight .
With support now found in Firefox , Chrome , Safari , and Opera , Internet Explorer is the odd man out , a flaw that Internet Explorer 9 seeks to remedy .
That video support was included in Platform Preview 3 is no surprise ; support for HTML5 video in Internet Explorer 9 was promised back in March at Microsoft 's MIX event , and the company confirmed that support would be included in the third preview when it released Platform Preview 2 back in May .
WOFF font support is also no surprise , as it was promised back in April .
With WOFF fonts ,
Web developers have a reliable , standard mechanism for using custom fonts in webpages , which enables richer , more varied designs .
Prior to support for embeddable fonts , developers wanting to use custom fonts had little option other than to embed static images of text — which are annoying to edit and invisible to search engines and accessibility software — or resort to clever JavaScript trickery .
What does come as a surprise is canvas support .
Microsoft has been promoting Internet Explorer 9's support of SVG , which provides vector graphics capabilities within the Web browser , but thus far has kept quiet when asked if it would support the canvas bitmap graphics specification .
Not only is canvas being supported , it is also being hardware accelerated , continuing Microsoft 's efforts to give Web applications the ability to exploit the extensive hardware capabilities of modern PCs .
As with previous Platform Preview releases , Microsoft 's IE Test Drive site includes a set of new demos to show off the features of the latest release , along with many dozens of new individual tests for specific features .
Continuing Redmond 's test development policy , these tests are being submitted to W3C for inclusion in the standards body 's test suite .
The new features give a healthy boost to Internet Explorer 9's score on the infamous Acid 3 test ; it leaps from 68 in Platform Preview 2 to a rather more respectable 83 .
Though still some way behind the market leaders , the third preview does fill out most of the major gaps , making it a much more rounded release .
HTML5 video will contain built - in support only for H.264 .
Google 's recently - opened WebM video format will work in Internet Explorer 9 , but only if a suitable codec is manually installed .
This is a bit of a problem , though , because although Google has published a codec for Windows ' older DirectShow framework , Internet Explorer 9 demands codecs using the newer Media Foundation framework .
The big question with Internet Explorer 9 remains unanswered : when will this thing actually ship ?
The current versions of the other major browsers already have good HTML5 support .
Safari has some amount of hardware acceleration already , and similar capabilities are likely to ship with Firefox 4 later in the year .
The Internet Explorer 9 previews certainly show that Microsoft is serious about its commitment to supporting HTML5 , but that 's only half the story .
Developers can't exploit these new features until they 're in end - users ' hands .
When that might be is still , unfortunately , anyone 's guess .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A Japanese space probe has landed in the Australian outback after a seven - year voyage to an asteroid , safely returning a capsule containing a unique sample of dust , Japanese mission controllers said on Monday .
The Hayabusa probe blazed a spectacular trail over Australia before slamming into the desert at around midnight local time , ending a journey to the near - Earth asteroid Itokawa that began in 2003 .
A spokesman for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) told Reuters the first image available indicated the capsule carrying the precious cargo had survived .
After sunrise , Australian defense officials flew local Aboriginal elders to the site by helicopter to verify that no sacred sites had been damaged .
A defense spokesman said the indigenous leaders had cleared the way for the capsule to be recovered later on Monday .
Hayabusa , which means falcon in Japanese , landed on the irregularly shaped asteroid in 2005 and scientists think it managed to pick up a small sample of material .
If successful , it would be the first time a spacecraft has brought such a sample back to Earth , other than from our own Moon .
Scientists hope it could unlock secrets of the solar system ’s formation and shed light on the risk to Earth from asteroid impacts .
NASA scientist Paul Abell , who monitored the return , said Hayabusa was significant from in terms planetary defense , bearing in mind an asteroid impact is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs .

Knowing the physical characteristics of near - Earth asteroids would be useful “ in case we see something coming at us in the future , ” he said .
As leftover matter from the building of the solar system , he added , asteroids could also tell us about its formation and possibly the origins of life .
“ It has actually gone really well .
It is a very significant event , ” he told Reuters .
SAMPLE LOOKS SAFE
JAXA spokesman Makoto Miwada told Reuters on Monday that the first photo of the capsule , with a diameter of just 40 cm ( 15.75 inches ) and a height of just 20 cm ( 7.874 inches ) , was very encouraging .
“ We have only one photo and it looks very safe , ” he said .
Much of the probe burned up spectacularly in the atmosphere , as planned , forming a spectacular fireball and the capsule could clearly be seen separating , witnesses said .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
“ It was like a shooting star with a starburst behind it .
It was fantastic , ” one witness told Reuters .
Teams from NASA were deployed to watch the 500 - kg ( 1,100 - lb ) craft ’s return to the Woomera weapons testing range in South Australia state .
A long stretch of central Australia ’s main north - south Stuart Highway was closed for safety reasons .
The asteroid Itokawa is an irregularly shaped object measuring just over 500 metres ( yards ) at its longest .
Planetary scientist Trevor Ireland told Reuters the dust sample could shed light on the “ missing link ” between asteroids and meteorites that fall to Earth .
Analysis of the capsule ’s contents will be carried out in Japan and is expected to take at least six months .

In short , the Poppers argued that most of the Great Plains were not suitable for sustainable farming , that irrigation was sucking dry water resources such as those from the Ogallalla Aquifer , that the human population of the region was scarcely more dense than it had been a century earlier and that rural areas were depopulating even more .
They said native prairie grasses should be planted , bison and the ecology they made possible reintroduced .
Ranchers and farmers would be gradually bought out ( with the option of keeping small homesteads ) .
To say that their view was controversial vastly understates how they were greeted , not least among farmers and ranchers whose use of cheap government grazing land would have to be shared with free - ranging bison .
The typical take on this was that the bison should remain in the same category as the wolves that were once the herds ' main predator : dead and gone .
But the Poppers ' idea , or at least some version of it , has gained ground over the past two decades .
Among those who have taken it up are 57 tribes who now participate in the InterTribal Bison Cooperative , a non-profit dedicated to restoring herds " in a manner that promotes cultural enhancement , spiritual revitalization , ecological restoration , and economic development . "
Currently , the ITBC counts about 15,000 animals in its herds .
You can donate to the cooperative here .
In addition , there is the Great Plains Restoration Council .
This organization seeks to develop leaders of ecological health among youth , including at - risk youth .
The work includes restoring bison herds .
You can contribute to their efforts here .
As Oke points out in the commentary below about " hazing " the 3000 - animal purebred herd at Yellowstone each spring , restoring bison to parts of their old range still has plenty of foes .
The ranchers fear brucellosis will spread from bison to their cattle .
Even though there is no proven case this has occurred – elk , which graze the region in the tens of thousands also carry the disease – the consequences are severe .
If one cow catches brucellosis , the whole herd must be killed .
As always , money could very well make a difference in this continuing stand - off .
And money is something that Ted Turner has in considerable amounts .
As Kim Murphy wrote in Making Wild Bison at home on the range , the billionaire owns 55,000 bison of his own .
Under an experimental program getting underway this spring , Turner is housing a quarantined test group of 87 Yellowstone bison at his ranch near Bozeman , Mont .
The program , under sponsorship by the Montana Department of Fish , Wildlife and Parks , is an attempt to see whether a brucellosis - free stock of Yellowstone bison can be nurtured , a landmark step toward repopulating the West with truly wild buffalo — not the bison mixed with cattle genes that are typical of the many fenced herds around the country .
...
The 87 bison were culled disease - free from the Yellowstone herd more than four years ago .
They will spend an additional five years locked away on Turner 's ranch , after which he is free to take 75 % of their offspring — possibly 188 new bison — to improve the genetics of his conservation herd of 1,000 wild bison in New Mexico .
Hazing the Bison at Yellowstone
By Oke
Hazing of bison herds in Yellowstone National Park , which has been going on for a decade under an Interagency Bison Management Plan , continued last week .
" Hazing " is the process of forcing bison that have wandered outside the park 's boundaries back into the park through the use of helicopters , all - terrain vehicles and horseback riders .
The goal is to prevent the spread of disease — mainly brucellosis — to the herds of cattle on ranches bordering the park .
Trib.com , a Casper , Wyo. , publication , says that hazing may be unnecessary in some cases :
particularly in areas where cattle no longer graze
but :
[...] facing pressure from the ranching industry , Montana officials said they plan to remove all bison from public and private lands around West Yellowstone by Saturday .
That 's about a month before cattle will return to their summer grazing plots .
However , as reported by the Yellowstone Insider :
Bison advocates and outside experts disagree with that prognosis -- elk are much more likely to transmit the disease to cattle -- to no avail , and so the buffalo are not allowed to roam .
This year there is , at least , a delay in this process , which has been compared to a bloody ground war :
" It had a real Vietnam look to it , " he [ John Varley , now retired from his job as Yellowstone 's chief of research ] said at the time .
" A lot of helicopters , a lot of rifles .
After that started getting televised , I think every school in America wrote their congressmen . "
The delay was caused by the weather :
Limited bison hazing operations were launched in the West Yellowstone area on May 4 , but were frustrated by a spring storm .
" They 're always trying to fight mother nature instead of working in harmony with it , " said Mike Mease with the Buffalo Field Campaign , a group opposed to the hazing .
" As long as the cattle industry is still not giving an inch on their drop dead date , we 're going to continue running into problems . "
The local cattle ranchers are having none of this , however :
The Department of Livestock returned to a definitive May 15 deadline two years ago in response to a lawsuit filed by Yellowstone area cattle ranchers backed by the Montana Stockgrowers Association .
The suit seeks to strip state and federal agencies of flexibility in deciding when bison need to be moved .
It remains pending before state District Judge John Brown in Gallatin County .
Nice to know that this " needs to be done " to protect the profits of the beef industry .
Eco-Justice in the Congo
by rb137
Regulating conflict minerals as an environmental issue .
There is a war between paramilitary groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and it is centered around a corrupt mining operation .
Militias compete to control the mines , and they each commit grisly acts of terror in the villages to intimidate civilians .
Among the militia are the Interahamwe , the group that perpetrated the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
They set the standard for terrorism in the neighborhood .
The conflict is near Goma and Bukavu , not far from the Rwandan border .
There are 20 or more militias in the region , and only the most brutal control the mines .
The war persists because of the mines , as the ore buys weapons and lines warlords ' pockets .
Regulating conflict minerals is an issue of concern to environmental advocates because the metals coming from the mines are used throughout green technology .
The organizing theme is that the conflict is in your cell phone , but the fact is that some conflict metals are used throughout industry .
Tantalum is found in camera lenses and surgical appliances , fuel cells , jet engines and industrial process instruments .
It withstands high heat and corrosive environments , and it machines like a dream .
It 's everywhere , and this conflict will never end until we stop using the ore that comes from the DRC .
Regulating the mines in the DRC has long been a green issue because of the bushmeat trade , which is responsible for damaging the region 's gorilla populations .
This killing is also exacerbated by the mining ; the map to the right shows that at risk populations live near the mines .
Ore gets traded for bushmeat regularly , so the metals are directly connected to the gorilla deaths .
The Dian Fossey Foundation was quick to criticize the illicit mineral trade , and they deserve recognition for shedding international light on the connection between the mines and the conflict .
There is growing bipartisan awareness about this metal trade in Congress , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has taken an interest in trying to regulate conflict minerals from the DRC .
There are two bills currently : S.891 and HR 4128 .
Please call your Representative and Senators and ask them to support this important legislation .
You can learn about conflict mineral legislation and active regulation campaigns at Enough .
While you are asking your legislators to support S.891 and HR.4128 , please ask congress to support The International Violence Against Women Act , HR.4594 and S.2982 .
Enough has a list of reasons why this bill will help .

Holding BP Accountable
By Patriot Daily News Clearinghouse
The Obama Administration has vowed to " keep a boot on the throat " of BP until BP stops the oil gusher , cleans up the mess and pays for the claims of those who suffered loss .
President Obama will need our support to ensure this is one heavy boot .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) has a petition for you to show your support to Help President Obama Hold BP Accountable .
There is also a message box should you wish to tell President Obama why you stand with him to hold BP accountable .
This is an easy way for us to express our support and define accountability broadly to include : economic damages , debarment , criminal prosecution , and Clean Water Act civil fines .
Moving forward with multiple penalties will also shine a public light on why we need to make this climate bill more focused on alternatives and why we need to ban offshore drilling .
Lawsuits filed by environmental groups are extremely important .
Defenders of Wildlife is suing BP for violating the Endangered Species Act by harming and killing endangered species by the oil gusher and the use of dispersants .
Defenders of Wildlife also filed a suit to challenge the Minerals Management Service 's " continued lax oversight of oil drilling operations . "
You can help keep these lawsuits coming by supporting Defenders of Wildlife with donations .
An additional action to hold BP accountable is to Tell EPA : Take away BP 's billions in federal contracts : Credo action has a petition asking the EPA to " immediately take steps to impose discretionary debarment and ban BP from all future federal contracts . "
Of course , BP is not the only culprit .
President Obama also needs to hear from us to rescind drilling leases to stop Shell Oil from drilling in the Arctic as early as this summer :
Here is an email message you can send Obama , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke to stop Shell Oil from drilling in the Arctic that could devastate their coasts and kill whales , polar bears and other wildlife .
Greenpeace also has an email message : Tell Secretary Salazar to Just Say " No " to Shell 's Alaska Drilling .

I ’ve been a Reddit member for the past 3 years now , but only recently did I discover the /r/ StarTrek subreddit .
I came across a comment about how “ bearing 310 mark 215 ” came up unusually often throughout the different Star Trek series .
“ Oh , really ? ” I wondered .
Lately I ’ve been trying to learn to write Android apps but I quickly found that I needed a refresher in Java .
I learned C++ and Java in college , like many CS students , but aside from a short stint with C# at work , my knowledge of the language has waned over the years .
When I revisited that post on Reddit a few days later , I came up with an idea to bring everything together :
Find a set of scripts from the different Star Trek series .
Write a program in Java to read the scripts and pull out phrases that mention course , heading , etc .
Analyze the results .
Finding Scripts
This was pretty easy .
A quick Google search led me to TWIZ TV where I found scripts for every episode of every season of Star Trek : The Next Generation and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine conveniently bundled into ZIPs .
Unfortunately , they did n’t have anywhere near as thorough collections of The Original Series , Voyager , or Enterprise .
But this is a good start .
Writing the Java Program
This took more time than I expected , but it was well worth the trouble .
Thanks to a good Java book , and a bit of googling , I wrote my first arguably useful Java program in years .
From a given starting folder , the code iterates through all its sub-folders and analyzes all the text files within .
Each time a keyword shows up — course , heading , mark , range , or distance — a line is output that contains the filename ( indicating the series , season , and episode ) , the line number ( to verify using Notepad + + ) , which keyword was detected , and any numbers ( spelled out in the scripts ) that immediately follow the keyword .
Output is written to console which can be easily piped to a CSV file .
From there , the CSV can be exported to a database or spreadsheet for analysis .
Some caveats :
If there is any text between the keyword and the number sequence , it does not register as a “ hit ” in my code .
So if the script reads “ Heading of three - two - one ” it will be missed because of the word “ of ” in the middle .
The “ Is the next word after the keyword a number ? ” function tries to cover all types of numeric text ( one , two , … , nine , zero , oh , ten , eleven , … twenty , thirty , … hundred , thousand , million , but I ’m sure something slipped detection .
I got lazy near the end , so I just hard - coded parameters like the path to the files and the keywords to search for .
Results
The following results were the result of passing the CSV output into OpenOffice Base , where I could run a few simple SQL queries :
First , let ’s look at the phrase that started this mad journey .
“ Bearing three - one - zero ” appears once ( DS9 Rocks and Shoals ) .
For what it ’s worth , “ Mark three - one - zero ” appears twice ( TNG All Good Things and DS9 Valiant ) “ Mark two - one - five ” is mentioned eleven times , but it is not the most frequent “ mark . ”
“ Bearing two - one - five ” appears twice ( TNG All Good Things and DS9 Destiny )
The most common bearing is one - eight - seven with four instances — four different episodes , two are TNG and two are DS9 .
Tied for second place are a half dozen values with two instances each .
The most popular sector is zero - zero - one with seven instances — six of those were from the TNG Best of Both Worlds two - parter , and the other instance was from DS9 ’s first episode whose opening scene takes place at the same time as Best of Both Worlds .
The second most popular “ sector ” was twenty - one - five - oh - five — five hits , all from TNG episode The Wounded .
The top five “ marks ” were : four ( 12 ) , two - one - five ( 11 ) , three ( 8 ) , zero ( 7 ) , and seven ( 6 ) .
There were no “ heading ” or “ range ” values that stood out statistically .
I ’ve provided the CSV below , which you can view in your favorite spreadsheet or database software and make your own observations .
I ’ve also provided the source code , so others may continue where I leave off .

Translated Monday 21 June 2010 , by
For decades on end this African country has been confronted with oil slick after oil slick without anything being done to put an end to them , or even to clean up the mess .
Oil spills do not provoke the same sense of outrage everywhere .
On May 1st , as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico mobilized the whole planet , an oil pipe broke off the Nigerian coast , and four million litres of crude oil leaked out in one week , spelling disaster for the local population whose shores are devastated .
Yet , for the Niger delta , this was only one in a continuous series .
In fact , last July Amnesty International published a report in which the disaster was called a “ tragedy for human rights ” .
“ The estimate is that every year now and for fifty years as much oil as leaked from the Exxon Valdez has been spilt over the delta , ” the report noted , adding that “ the pollution is there for all to see . ”
Thirty one million people “ squelch about in the oil while air and water are polluted by flaring [ 1 ] , and fishermen catch fish poisoned by heavy metals . ”
N’Nimo Bassey , president of Friends of the Earth ( Nigeria ) , is furious : “ We are getting new oil spills practically on a daily basis , ” he explains .
“ Some have been going on for several months without anything being done to stop them or to clean the coasts . ”
The largest maritime reserve on the African continent , the Niger delta is also one of the three largest offshore drilling areas in the world .
Total , Exxon , Chevron , and above all , Shell , all jostle for a share ; but these oil companies put the blame for the spills on sabotage and attacks by local rebel groups .
To Amnesty , this poor version only serves to hide the fact that corroded oil pipes are generally to blame for the leaks , and that safety regulations are not observed .
As the report also pointed out , “ oil companies take advantage of the lack of adequate regulations in Nigeria . ”
Indeed , there are no international regulations for offshore drilling .
“ While the transport of oil is subject to a convention set up by the International Maritime Organization , ” Yann Rabuteau , a specialist lawyer explains , “ legal instruments for regulating offshore operations are almost non-existent . ”
It belongs to each state to lay down its rules and enforce them and the same is true as concerns the repair of damages .
“ Thirty years ago , a convention ( called the Clee convention ) was drafted by the IMO , ” but never got finalized , owing to the persistence of conflicting interests .
Kosher Slaughter Outlawed In New Zealand – Jews Insist It Is Humane
New Zealand has become the fourth country to outlaw Jewish ritual slaughtering , authorities said Sunday , after Iceland , Norway , and Sweden took similar measures in the past .
Under the newly instated Animal Welfare Commercial Slaughter Code , announced by David Carter , New Zealand ’s Agriculture Minister , commercially killed animals would have to be stunned before slaughter , making kosher slaughter , or shchita , illegal , according to the Jewish Australian News service .
According to the report , while the new regulations are to take immediate effect ,
kosher beef will be able to be imported into New Zealand .
Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence , the former leader of the Auckland Hebrew Congregation , told the Jewish Australian News that “ there is a strong body of veterinary and animal welfare research which continues to confirm shechita as a humane method of slaughter of the highest standard . ”
Minister Cater reached the contentious decision , despite the fact that the report compiled by The National Animal Welfare Advisory Council , on which Carter based his decision , stated that “ that the rights of the New Zealand Jewish community to practice its religious beliefs accorded by the Bill of Rights Act must be balanced against animal welfare considerations . ”
The Australian news agency added that the report also said that other alternatives short of an outright ban on shechita could be made available to the government .
Kosher foods are those that conform to the rules of the Jewish religion .
These rules form the main aspect of kashrut , Jewish dietary laws .
Reasons for food being non-kosher include the presence of ingredients derived from non-kosher animals or from kosher animals that were not properly slaughtered , a mixture of meat and milk , wine or grape juice ( or their derivatives ) produced without supervision , the use of produce from Israel that has not been tithed , or even the use of cooking utensils and machinery which had previously been used for non-kosher food .
These might include utensils and machines used for making pork or other non-kosher products .

Obama will use Memorial weekend for a trip home to Chicago
By Anne E. Kornblut
With the long Memorial Day weekend on the horizon , President Obama is finally addressing one of the great broken promises of his administration : his early pledge to return home to Chicago every six weeks or so .
In 16 months at the White House , the Obamas have been back home just once - in February of 2009 .
But they plan to make the trip over Memorial Day weekend , an official said .
After arriving on Thursday night , they will visit with friends and participate in private events .
On Monday , Obama will make remarks at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery , south of Chicago - missing the usual tradition of presidents speaking at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day .
Vice President Biden and his wife will appear in Obama 's place , laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , as well as holding a breakfast for Gold Star families -- families whose loved ones died in military service -- at the White House earlier that day .

When lists of the best horror films are made , the same movies always float to the top .
Everybody knows Psycho .
Everybody ’s seen The Silence of the Lambs .
And , despite the mixed opinions , Jaws is generally recognized as an important film in the genre .
With thousands of horror films having been made over the last ( believe it or not ) hundred years , surely there are more gems out there , are n’t there ?
Of course there are !
Here are some of the treasures that have been overlooked by the box office and the repetitive lists .
[ Some text is courtesy of IMDB ]
10 Dead End 2003
For the past 20 years , Frank Harrington has grudgingly driven his family to celebrate Christmas with his mother - in - law .
This year , he takes a shortcut .
It ’s the biggest mistake of his life :
The nightmare begins .
A mysterious woman in white wanders through the forest , leaving death in her wake .
A terrifying black car – its driver invisible – carries the victims into the heart of the night .
Every road sign points to a destination they never reach .
The survivors succumb to panic , to madness ; deeply buried secrets burst to the surface , and Christmas turns into a living hell .
This is an excellent low budget film with very few actors .
Despite that , it manages to keep your attention .
Well worth a look .
9 Tenebrae 1986
WARNING : trailer contains brief nudity .
1986 was a good year for horror ( as you will see as you read further down this list ) .
With Argento ’s trademark visual style , linked with one of his more coherent plots , Tenebrae follows a writer who arrives to Rome , only to find somebody is using his novels as the inspiration ( and , occasionally , the means ) of committing murder .
As the death toll mounts the police are ever baffled , and the writer becomes more closely linked to the case than is comfortable .
Luciano Tovoli ’s camera - work / cinematography is brilliant , especially the luma crane shot ( which goes up one side of a building , over the roof and down the other side in one unbroken taken ) .
There ’s also an extremely well - photographed and directed sequence featuring a girl being pursued by a rabid Doberman .
Now they would do those two scenes with computers , and I think that obliterates the charm of the hands - on film - making process .
This film puts Hollywood thrillers like “ Copycat ” “ The Bone Collector , ” and “ Se7en ” to shame , and it ’s apparent all three films stole ideas from this one ( and from other films in Argento ’s oeuvre ) .
8 Black Christmas 1974
This 98 - minute film is a stark and stylish horror / thriller that turns everyone ’s favorite time of the year inside out .
Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star among an ill - fated houseful of sorority sisters celebrating the holiday season .
Festivities turn fatal when obscene phone calls break the serenity and it becomes clear that a psychopath is stalking the house .
This is clearly the inspiration for many horrors that followed .
One reviewer put it most aptly :
It ’s not often that you find a film in the thriller / horror genre that has something “ new ” to say , so it ’s even more exciting to find that one of the original films in the “ slasher ” genre is actually still one of the freshest , most unique and utterly entertaining of them all .
This is the kind of movie you ca n’t wait to tell your friends about , knowing full well they ’ve probably never seen it , but they ’ve heard of it .
7 The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKT36jY47e8
Another Italian film , the Bird with the Crystal Plumage , was Dario Argento ’s first film and it made him a hot property .
The synopsis : Sam , an American writer in Rome , witnesses a murder attempt on the wife of the owner of an art gallery by a sinister man in a raincoat and black leather gloves .
However , Sam is powerless to do anything , as he gets trapped between a double set of glass doors in going to her aid .
The woman survives , and the police say that she is the first surviving victim of a notorious serial killer .
But when they fail to make any progress with the case , Sam decides to investigate on his own , turning up several clues that point in the direction of just one possible suspect – assuming that he really knows who he ’s looking for .
There is something about these dark old Italian films that really adds to the horror they portray .
6 Jacob ’s Ladder 1990
In this film , a traumatized Vietnam war veteran finds out that his post - war life is n’t what he believes it to be , when he ’s attacked by horned creatures in the subway and his dead son comes to visit him .
It stars Tim Robbins , of whom I am not a fan , but it is nevertheless a very good film .
I am surprised it is n’t more widely known , as those who see it typically rank it as a brilliant film .
5 Alice , Sweet Alice 1976
Creepy kids make for some of the best scares in horror , from Patty McCormack ’s 1954 portrayal of a psychopath in pigtails in The Bad Seed , to the later trend of demonic darlings in The Exorcist and The Omen .
Despite a spate of poor imitations in the ’70s , Alice , Sweet Alice belongs with the better horror films featuring pint - sized leads .
Named by Fangoria magazine as one of the “ best films you ’ve never seen , ” the thriller continues to disturb modern viewers , who are surprised to learn that its thrills still hold up .
The film begins with two sisters , the younger of whom is about to have her first communion .
Twelve - year - old Alice ( Paula Sheppard ) is jealous of the attention that little sis Karen ( nine - year - old Brooke Shields in her first screen role ) is receiving .
On the day of Karen ’s communion , she is murdered in the church , strangled by a candle .
Alice immediately falls under suspicion , and here the movie becomes a twisted murder movie that could compete with modern slasher flicks for chills .
Alice takes to wearing a yellow rain slicker and a transparent plastic mask , pre-cursors to the masks and costumes of more modern movie slashers .
The body count increases with the murder of a perverted slob of a landlord who tries to take advantage of Karen .
For a low budget movie of its day , Alice , Sweet Alice looks amazingly good .
The scenes are well - executed , and despite having the killer revealed partway through the movie ( just as in Hitchcock ’s Vertigo ) , the tension just never lets up .
The murder scenes are gruesome rather than cheesy , and the ending … well , let ’s just say that Hitchcock would be proud .
Super editing and a notable soundtrack add up to one tense nailbiter that is still watchable today .
4 Night of the Creeps 1986
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc6lxaVyBNY
This movie went by without a ripple of interest when it was originally released , but it now has a loyal cult following of horror fans .
Night of the Creeps is a comedy horror film that makes use of every opportunity to spoof the entire genre .
However , unlike modern groaners like Scary Movie , it has an edge to it .
The film was clearly made by horror movie lovers , which is probably why fans love it so much .
It shows .
The characters names are nods to the genre ; the main characters are Chris Romero and Cynthia Cronenberg who attend Corman University .
Officers who appear later in the film are Detective Landis and Sergeant Raimi .
If you ’re a horror buff , you ’ll recognize the significance of those names .
The chaos begins when two campus nerds accidentally defrost the corpse of a dead jock , who has been infected by an alien virus , resulting in zombie havoc .
The film manages to cram in every possible movie stereotype , including kids in the woods and lunatics escaped from asylums .
While this sounds like a trite B movie , it ’s handled with care and manages to be self - deprecating in just the right amount .
If all comedy horror movies were like this , we ’d have more Shaun of the Deads and less Scary Movies .
With all the humor , though , the movie still manages to deliver ( as the title suggests ) the creeps .
3 Nomads 1986
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqwb1LB0QbY
This is a thinking person ’s horror film , which sadly there are n’t enough of .
Hollywood seems to think all viewers are twelve - year - old boys , and writes accordingly .
Another film you ’re unlikely to have seen , Nomads was a sleeper hit which has all but been forgotten .
The cast features Pierce Brosnan ( fresh from his Remington Steele gig ) , Lesley - Ann Down and post - punker Adam Ant , with a soundtrack ( uncredited ) by Ted Nugent .
The movie was the directorial debut for John McTiernan , who would go on to fame the next year with Predator and then Die Hard .
It ’s an unusual film that begins with the death of the main character ( Brosnan ) , but his doctor ( Down ) becomes possessed with his memories , reliving each experience on his last day leading up to his death .
As an anthropologist , he had uncovered the remains of an extinct tribe of Inuits who have now tracked him across the planet to exact revenge .
We see what happens when they hunt and terrorize him through his doctor ’s eyes .
This is an unforgettable , well - made thriller with a shocking ending .
If you enjoy intelligent thrillers and this one flew under your radar , rent it soon .
2 The Asphyx 1973
The Asphyx suffered only from a case of bad timing .
If it had been released just a few years previously , it would n’t have gone so unnoticed .
Unfortunately , the movie was released at a time when horror movies were starting to include lots of sex , which this film does n’t have .
It was also closely followed by The Exorcist , which eclipsed everything in its path .
In the context of its era , though , the Asphyx was one of the better horror films made in the early part of the ’70s and is worth a re-examination .
Set in Victorian England , the movie stars Robert Stephens ( who had recently starred in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes ) as a scientist experimenting with early photographic and moving picture equipment .
He discovers that he has captured on film the actual soul leaving the body , the asphyx , and realizes that if he could trap it at the moment of his death , he could be immortal .
He embarks upon a series of experiments to test this idea , but seeing as this is a horror film , it does n’t go as planned .
The Asphyx is dramatic and sophisticated –both unusual traits for a movie of the time .
It lacks the campy , trashy factor of the ’70s .
It is also genuinely eerie at times .
The Asphyx deserved more credit than it received when it …asphyxiated .
1 Paperhouse 1988
This may be one of the most underrated horror movies of all time .
Most people , it seems , have n’t even heard of it , but the ones who have always say , “ Man , that was creepy ! ” .
Paperhouse is more than just creepy ; it ’s fascinating .
When the main character , Anna , discovers that the things she draws become real in her dreams , she adds to her drawings in an attempt to help a disabled boy .
The results are not necessarily helpful , but dangerous .
You ’ll have to watch to see what happens when Anna erases or marks out her pictures .
This is a rare horror film that requires you to simply suspend your disbelief and go along with some fantasy .
What you ’re seeing does n’t always make sense , but the result is beautiful and frightening .
Perhaps some audiences wanted Paperhouse to follow conventions and be something that it ’s not .
That may account for its failure at the box office .
If you have a strong attraction to fantasy , though ; if , like Fox Mulder , you “ want to believe , ” this is a find .
Do n’t feel like you have to be stuck in a horror rut .
Just because a movie has n’t made the top ten lists of critics and horror snobs does n’t mean it does n’t have anything to offer .
These movies are perfect proof of that .
Buy or rent one , and see if you ’re just as confused as to why these films were overlooked and underrated .

The Old Spice body wash audition was like any other except ...
Mustafa talked to the Ministry from the set of the ABC series " Castle , " where his FBI agent character was soon to be put to work " sweeping the building . "
It was a job he booked right before the ad hit -- though since then , he says , he 's been getting a lot more opportunities for work .
" But he really just wants to help . "
" I just tried to create this lovable , oblivious [ buffoon ] , who 's a little bit smug , " he said .
( OK , Isaiah did n't really say " buffoon . "
Nobody says " buffoon " except maybe for the guy on the horse .
You get the idea , though .
In a lovable way , of course . )
He , of course , is actor Isaiah Mustafa , otherwise known as " the guy who stars in that Old Spice commercial " -- a spot that 's been cracking folks up for a couple of weeks now .
We looked at him .
We looked away .
We looked back at him .
And dangit if we could n't stop looking at him .
Seriously , he 's on a horse .
... the night before , he called a college buddy , quarterback Jake Plummer , most recently of the NFL's Denver Broncos , to shoot the breeze .
Jake was n't home , but Jake 's answering machine was -- so Isaiah , schooled in improvisation , did an over - the - top mini performance of the script he had in hand .
It was over the top in a way that wound up striking the fancy of the public , as it caught the wave of uber ad - awareness that follows Super Bowl Sunday .
Playing in theaters while couples hit " Valentine 's Day " and " Avatar " last weekend has n't hurt either .
" I just did it for him , and I did it extra big , and then when I hung up , I thought , ' Maybe I should try it that way and see if they like it . ' "
They did .
( They are n't alone . )
It then took three days of shooting , many dozens of takes and an astonishingly tiny amount of digital special effects to capture a spot that takes Mustafa from a shower to a boat to a horse on the beach in one flowing shot .
Yes , the horse is real .
If you 're interested in such things , a " making of " video interview by tech guru Leo LaPorte with creative guys Craig Allen and Eric Kallman is embedded below .
It 's long , but do n't be afraid -- the man on the horse would n't be afraid .
Nor would the man on the horse backward .
Along with the secrets of the shoot , it includes plenty of praise for Mustafa 's powers of concentration and sense of humor , and , surprise , we learn the spot was aimed at women as well as men .
The commercial went up on YouTube on Feb. 4 , and before Super Bowl Sunday , the official clip had about 30,000 views , Mustafa said .
But the Monday after Super Bowl XLIV -- Feb. 8 was actually the first day the spot was broadcast -- the views climbed to about 250,000 .
" Then it got crazy , " he says , " and it was like 100,000 more every couple of hours .
My daily thing was to go look in the morning and go , ' Whoa !
No way ! ' " ( At last check , this " manmercial " was pushing toward 2 milllion views , not counting about that number of views on unofficial versions as well ; Mustafa can also be seen as the smoking - jacket - clad host of Old Spice 's website . )
What more should you know about Isaiah Mustafa ?
Studied history at Arizona State .
Played four years in the NFL as a wide receiver .
In his mid-20s , he opened a barbecue place that taught him that even though his mom enjoyed running a restaurant , he absolutely did not .
What else ?
Oh , yes !
Ladies ( and a select few of you gents ) : Isaiah does indeed have a girlfriend .
She 's a dancer -- " professional , not pole , " he is quick to note -- whom he says is fantastic and funny .
And if that " he 's taken " thing is n't made very clear ?
" She will kill me , she will be after me , high heels in hand , " he says in mock terror , adding a good - natured chuckle .
" Let that be known , I have a girlfriend ! "
( Oddly , as he says this , his manliness quotient increases .
Hmm . )
Thanks in part to her , Mustafa experienced what he says has been his only in - real - life fan recognition so far .
Running at the last minute the day before Valentine 's Day , he said , he hit up Burke Williams to snag her a gift certificate for a spa package .
" There was a couple standing behind me , and as I 'm leaving , the guy stops me , " Mustafa said .
Are you that guy in the commercial ?
Getting a " yep , that 's me " in reply , " He said , ' Dude , that 's some funny stuff , keep it coming ! ' "
So what 's most likely to keep it coming from the Man Who Smells Like the Man Your Man Could Smell Like ?
Mustafa pointed it out to the folks who follow him on Twitter .
Hint :
It would fit easily on the shelf in your medicine cabinet .
Ah , commerce .
-- Christie D'Zurilla
P.S. Do n't miss the video below -- it 's awesome .
Almost as awesome as the commercial .
The video , however , is not on a horse .

When a duo of right - wing provocateurs posing as a pimp and prostitute released selectively - edited videos trying to impugn the community activist group ACORN , both Democrats and Republicans condemned the organization .
Congress then voted to cut off federal funding for the group ( a decision that was later ruled unconstitutional ) .
Following negative press and Congress ’ vote , ACORN effectively disbanded Apr. 1 and reorganized under new names .
ADVERTISEMENT
But a just - issued report by the Government Accountability Office that reviewed ACORN ’s federal funding at the behest of CongressÃ‚Â found little grist for the mill for politicians or right - wing bloggers looking to bash the now - defunct advocacy group for the poor .
The 38 - page report surveyed over 31 federal agencies , probing how ACORN used federal funds and whether adequate controls on spending existed .
The report found no evidence of fraud , lax oversight or misuse of federal funds .
In fact , the report discovered that ACORN had adequately accounted for spending $ 40 million worth of major and minor grants awarded by the federal government to the group since 2005 to combat a variety of problems afflicting poor Americans , including lead poisoning , housing discrimination and lack of adequate job training .
The preliminary report on the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s funding also found that of the grants that warranted audits no irregularities in spending were found .
Ã‚Â Smaller grantees said that oversight was adequate as well .
ADVERTISEMENT
Of eight major grants awarded ACORN by the federal government the report found fault with one , a grant by Neighbor Works .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Neighbor Works determined that ACORN Housing Corporation had not provided a description of what it planned to accomplish under the grant , as required .
After Neighbor Works brought this to the attention of ACORN Housing Corporation officials , these officials subsequently provided the documentation .
Oversight of sub-awards is generally delegated to grantees , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the report states .
Of fifteen sub -grants awarded ACORN by a variety of federal agencies , the report did not find any irregularities .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ EPA , Treasury , NEA , and Neighbor Works grantees provided a total of 15 sub- awards to ACORN or potentially related organizations , ” it said .
“ EPA reviewed the granteesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ work plans which included sub - award information , finding no problem with the sub-awards .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The report noted that six of nine agencies that reported grants to ACORN still had ongoing audits of the programs that had not yet been completed , including an audit of Investment Recovery
Act funds given to the organization .
ADVERTISEMENT
The report also found that 29 out of 31 federal Inspector GeneralÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s offices do not have any ongoing investigations into ACORN .
The IGÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s office of the Internal Revenue Service and the Housing and Urban Development Department declined to report if there were ongoing investigations into ACORN .
Along with the preliminary finding , the federal agency did a comprehensive review of all criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and federal Inspector GeneralÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s since 2005 .
The agency also found the Federal Election Commission had closed all investigations into voter fraud by the group .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The FEC identified four closed matters that involved allegations that ACORN or potentially related organizations violated the Federal Election Campaign Act.28 . Ã‚Â
For each of these matters , the FEC determined that there was no evidence that such violations occurred .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The GAO report said that of six FBI investigations into ACORN - related voter fraud all had been dropped because of lack of evidence .
Only cases against individuals working for ACORN were prosecuted .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ However , only ACORN employees were the subjects of the prosecutions .
According to ACORN and Project vote officials , the organizations provided information to local election officials that helped initiate prosecutions against their employees who may have been involved in voter registration fraud .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The report gives brief mention of the now - infamous video that brought down the organization , noting that the actions depicted in the recordings did not result in any criminal prosecutions .
ADVERTISEMENT
The reportÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conclusions cast doubt on the near - universal condemnation of ACORN that proceeded from the release of video tapes made during visits to several branches in different cities by right - wing activists James OÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢Keefe and Hannah Giles .
Posing as a college student and a prostitute , the duo solicited advice from ACORN workers , many of whom can be seen allegedly counseling the couple on ways to evade taxes and how to run a brothel .
Critics said the video clips were taken out of context and highlighted only those parts that looked disparaging .
As executives from the three companies responsible for the oil - spewing rig in the Gulf of Mexico testified before congress yesterday — essentially , they all blamed each other for the mess — a group of protestors took to BP 's fancy , curvaceous and company - touted " green " Arco gas station at Olympic and Robertson .
The group of residents , somewhat affiliated with the Sierra Club 's offshore drilling initiative , used black plastic and yellow caution tape to stage a mock oil spill it show why they think we need a moratorium on drilling off our coasts .
Residents shouted and waved signs read “ Clean it Up : Our Gulf Coast , Our Energy ” and “ No More Drilling ” , “ Clean Energy Now ” and “ Honk for Clean Energy . ”
Another protest will occur today at the same location during evening rush hour .
It will be one of the many across the country in what is being called Seize BP National Day of Action .
The discovery of an underwater mountain ridge could help solve the mystery of why Antarctica ’s Pine Island glacier is vanishing so rapidly .
A robot submarine sent beneath the glacier ’s floating ice sheet has shown that there is a ridge rising 400 metres from the sea floor .
Until recently , the glacier would have rested on this ridge , preventing warm seawater from reaching the ice and melting it from underneath .
But the submarine has shown that the glacier no longer rests on the ridge – it has thinned and now floats above it ( Nature Geoscience , DOI : 10.1038/ngeo890 ) .
“ Once you tip the glacier off the ridge , it continues to …
THE family of British BP chief Tony Hayward is under police protection because of hate mail and threatening telephone calls .
Mr Hayward 's wife Maureen said the mail and calls had made her and her two children feel ' ' rather uncomfortable ' ' at their home in Kent .
There has been growing hostility to the company in America in response to the spill , which has so far leaked about 1 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
'' Members of my family have had nasty phone calls and we have also had mail from groups , '' Mrs Hayward said .
'' Tony is obviously away and we are miles away from him , so it 's upsetting . ''
Kent police sources confirmed there was an operation involving Mr Hayward 's family home , but did not disclose details .
The home is protected by a four - metre hedge and has a private access road .
As they walk in hooded robes to the strains of “ Pomp and Circumstance , ” many students getting their doctorates this spring dream of heading to another university to begin their careers as tenure - track professors .
But when Elena Stover finished her doctorate in September , she headed to the poker tables .
Frustrated with the limited opportunities and grueling lifestyle of academia , Stover , 29 , decided to eschew a career in cognitive neuroscience for one playing online poker .
She got the idea from a UCLA career counselor , who was trying to help her find employment .
“ The job market is abysmal , especially within the academic system , ” said Stover , who spent six years getting her doctorate at UCLA .
It has never been easy to find a tenure - track teaching job .
But this year , dwindling endowments and shrinking state budgets — especially in California — have made that goal more elusive than ever .
Now , many graduates with doctoral degrees are finding themselves looking for jobs outside universities — jobs they probably could have gotten without five to six years of intense schooling and tens of thousands of dollars of education debt .

“ That ’s one of the weird things — after all this training , you should really have these career options , but in reality , it ’s really scarce , ” said Stover , who moved to Oakland , got a poker coach and says she ’s making enough to pay the bills .
Budget cuts are plaguing California ’s once - admired higher education system .
The California State University system lost 10 % of its teaching force over the last year , which is the equivalent of 1,230 full - time posts .
The University of California ’s share of state general fund revenue of $ 2.6 billion in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year was 20 % less than it was two years earlier .
Many universities are cutting costs by reducing full - time staff and hiring adjunct or part - time professors .
The number of full - time faculty members at universities was around 51 % in 2007 , down from 78 % in 1970 , said Jack Schuster , a senior research fellow at Claremont Graduate University .
That leaves many doctoral degree candidates stuck with adjunct work , which can pay as little as $ 2,000 a semester .
Graduates with humanities doctorates are particular vulnerable to the downturn in university hiring .
In 2008 , 86 % of humanities doctoral recipients ended up in academia , whereas only 15 % of engineering doctoral recipients did .

The number of jobs listed in the Modern Language Assn.'s Job Information List , a clearinghouse for English and foreign literature doctoral students , is down more than 40 % over two years , the steepest decline since the association began keeping count .
But doctoral recipients in all disciplines are having a tough time landing teaching gigs , said William Pannapacker , a columnist for the Chronicle of Higher Education and an associate professor of English at Hope College in Michigan .
For example , university job openings requiring a math doctorate declined 40 % in the 2009 - 10 academic year from the year before , according to the American Mathematical Society .
At the same time , schools keep producing doctoral recipients .
The number of doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities reached an all - time high in 2008 at 48,802 , nearly double the number awarded in 1970 .
People holding doctoral degrees do , on average , make more money than workers with less education .
The 2009 median weekly earnings for someone with a doctorate was $ 1,532 , 50 % higher than the median weekly earnings for someone with a bachelor ’s degree , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

But the highest - paid doctorate holders tend to be those with degrees in the hard sciences working in the private sector .
Nearly three - quarters of engineering doctoral recipients in 2008 found work in industry or business , according to the National Science Foundation , while only 3 % of humanities recipients did .
And there are still plenty of opportunities for those with doctorates in math in corporate America , said Mike Breen , public awareness officer for the American Mathematical Society .
It ’s a different story for doctoral recipients in the humanities .
Those looking to jump to the private sector now are competing with recent college graduates whose skills typically are better targeted to the corporate world , Pannapacker said .
Mia McIver dreamed of finding an academic job , even though her undergraduate advisors warned her there were n’t many to be had .
She has been seeking a tenure - track position in English literature for the last three years .
“ It ’s been pretty miserable — a real slog , ” said the 32 - year old UC Irvine grad .
She ’s supplemented her income by teaching test preparation , but is now considering working for a consulting firm or a nonprofit .

Those who have already transitioned out of academia are more emphatic .
“ If you ’re thinking about going to graduate school , do n’t do it , do n’t do it , do n’t do it , ” said Erin Williams Hyman .
After receiving a doctorate in comparative literature from UCLA in 2005 , she looked three years for a job as a professor but was unsuccessful .
Now she works as a consultant at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art .
Those who do get doctoral degrees do n’t have to be tied to academic careers , said Alexandra Lord , the founder of Beyond Academe , a website that educates historians about opportunities outside the ivory tower .
Lord , who has a doctorate in history , works for the National Park Service .
She spent four years as a professor before deciding to leave .
“ You can graduate and actually find a job that will give you full - time pay , benefits and healthcare , ” said Lord , who lives in Washington , D.C.
“ And you have great options choosing where you want to live . ”

Stover , the graduate - turned - poker - player , is n’t bitter about switching careers .
She said she was sick of the long hours and “ soul - sucking ” world of academia .
She still has friends who hold low - paying academic jobs who want out .
“ In retrospect , doing a PhD was not worth putting in six years of my life , ” she said .
“ But going through that whole process taught me a lot about how to work hard . ”

The basic formula for these cakes was developed by the wife of a mayonnaise salesman in an effort to help him out .
I did a bit of research , and have found many variations .
Early variants generally involve using less cocoa , which I cannot recommend .
Later variants involve using cold water instead of boiling , adding salt , and additional leaveners .
I personally do not feel that any additional salt is needed , as mayonnaise and that famous , tangy brand of salad dressing ( sometimes the label just says ' Dressing ' ) both contain a fair amount of salt .
If you are using homemade mayonnaise or a low sodium product , an eighth teaspoon of salt may boost the flavor a bit .
And , of course , somewhere along the way fans who prefer a certain salad dressing over mayonnaise started using it to make this cake .
Nowadays , the Hellman 's website has a different formula - one with added eggs and baking powder .
I have not tried this newer formulation .
Some versions of this recipe specify sifted cake flour .
This will result in a very light cake with virtually no structural integrity , due to the paucity of eggs in this recipe compared to a regular cake .
Cupcakes made this way give beautifully light results .
However , every time I try to make a traditional 8 " double layer cake with cake flour , I experience collapse .
I recommend AP flour or at least a mix of cake and pastry flour .
I have never made this with a gluten - free flour replacer .
This recipe does not have very much structural integrity and as such does not make a good candidate for a gluten - free cake .
I have made this cake many times , the type of sandwich spread you choose will affect the outcome .
Made with mayonnaise , the cake has a good chocolate flavor and moistness .
Made with that famous , tangy , off - white salad dressing that gets used as a sandwich spread , the cake has a subtle bit of extra brightness to the flavor .
If one chooses to use a vegan mayonnaise , the result is tasty but lacking a little in structure ; I would bake this in a square pan and frost and serve from the pan .
The cocoa you use will also affect the flavor .
For a classic , homey flavor use a supermarket brand of cocoa .
To add a little sophistication , use better , artisan type cocoa and use chocolate extract instead of the vanilla extract .
Supposedly , the traditional frosting for this cake should have a caramel flavor .
Look for one where you actually caramelize some sugar first .
Modern recipes for the icing seem like weak imitations to me ; using brown sugar as the main flavor instead of true caramel .
Chocolate Mayonnaise or Salad Dressing Cake
makes enough for two 8 " round pans , or a 9 " square ( about 7 cups of batter )
2 ounces /56g unsweetened , non-alkalized cocoa
1 cup /236g boiling water
1 teaspoon / 4g regular strength vanilla extract
3/4 cup /162g mayonnaise , vegan mayonnaise , or salad dressing ( the tangy , off - white , sandwich spread type dressing )
10.5ounces /300g all - purpose flour
7 ounces /200g sugar
0.35ounce/10g baking soda
Preheat your oven to 350° .
Grease or spray two 8 " round pans or an equivalent volume square or rectangle .
Place the cocoa in a medium ( 4 - 5 cup ) bowl .
Add the hot water and stir with a fork to break up any clumps .
Allow to cool down a little , then add the vanilla extract and the mayonnaise or salad dressing spread .
Beat well to eliminate lumps .
In the bowl of an electric mixer or larger regular bowl if making by hand , sift in the flour and add the sugar and baking soda .
Mix the dry ingredients to distribute evenly .
Slowly beat in the cocoa mixture .
Mix until the batter has an even color .
Pour immediately into the pans .
If making two 8 " rounds , weigh them to ensure they contain equal amounts .
Bake for approximately 20 minutes , or until the center of the top springs back when touched lightly .
( The toothpick test does NOT work well on this moist cake ! )
Allow the cake to cool a little and shrink from the sides of the pan before removing .
Removal is easier while still a little warm .
Good with or without frosting .
Good beginner cake for kids to make .

Pat Robertson ’s advice to wife of flirty husband : “ You need to make yourself as attractive as possible and do n’t hassle him about it . ” ( Found at http://j-walkblog.com)
Overheard at YAPC last night :
Person one : I can't find Try : : Tiny exciting .
Person two :
Is n't promoting that admitting that Perl 5's exception handling is broken ?
( Perl 5.13.1 introduced improvements to Perl 5 exception handling .
They need more testing on existing code , but the Perl 5.14 release next year will likely include them .
The existence of Try :: Tiny has directly produced language improvements ; in this case the cycle works . )
I like Try :: Tiny ; it simplifies exception handling in Perl 5 .
Handling exceptions correctly ( even in 5.12 ) is difficult .
That 's primarily a syntax issue .
You can handle exceptions correctly — Perl 5 provides all of the tools necessary to do so — but it 's not simple to read or to write .
Similarly , runtime type reflection is difficult : ref is unreliable and the standard hacks for abusing UNIVERSAL :: isa are far too often wrong .
Try :: Tiny is nice because it offers good syntax which hides all of the internal complexity Perl 5 exposes .
A world with T : : T is better than a world without it .
Even so , Try :: Tiny is only useful to people who know that it exists , who can install it , and who make use of it pervasively .
Try :: Tiny is n't useful for people who do n't know it exists .
In other words , Try : : Tiny is n't useful for novices .
It could be and it should be , but novices are n't going to hear about it .
( Some will , but how many novice Perl developers know about the CPAN ?
How many novices have joined the Perl community sufficiently that they can learn from the hard - won wisdom of Perl adepts ?
Vanishingly few , as they do not remain novices for long . )
Here 's the virtuous dilemma : is n't it nice to have a language with a working and well maintained extension mechanism ?
Is n't it nice to be able to modify our own languages in our own lexical scopes ?
Yet when our language modifications improve basic language features — instead of adding new language features — should we praise them as victories instead of acknowledging them for the patches and bugfixes that they are ?
Yes , changing how exception handling works in Perl 5 now , especially if it requires semantic changes , may cause some pain .
( It may also fix undiscovered bugs in existing programs , which is a virtue of its own . )
Yet is n't the ability to modify the language for your own purposes sometimes akin to running a patched version of the language itself ?
Yes , it 's safer and more composable , and less permanent than running a patched binary , but still ....
> Semantic Web Use Cases and Case Studies
Case Study : A Digital Music Archive ( DMA ) for the Norwegian National Broadcaster ( NRK ) using Semantic Web techniques Dr. Robert H.P. Engels , ESIS , and Jon Roar Tønnesen , NRK , Norway
General Description
Introduction
Digitizing the complete radio and television broadcasting production process is a major undertaking in many public and commercial broadcasters .
Many public broadcasters possess enormous archives often ranging back 60 + years to include pre-WWII sound assets on bakelite , wax and even ( ! ) chocolate .
Whereas the older assets show a remarkable resistance against the tooth of time , more modern storage formats like digital video tape , certain CD ’s , tapes etc. are not that robust .
At NRK ( Norwegian National Broadcaster ) it is expected that many tapes recorded in the late 80’s and early 90 ’s cannot be recovered within 5 years if no immediate action is taken and digitzing the assets is considered a correct way of action for preserving assets for the future .
Another effect of digitizing , besides the preservation argument , is that the assets become more easily available , with many manual or labor - intensive steps in a production process eliminated .
At NRK it is estimated that during a year of broadcasting a maximum of 5 % of all in - house available assets are really used in broadcasting .
Semantic
Web technology is primarily used for enclosing the enormous amounts of metadata on music tracks available within the archives so that a larger amount of the “ hidden treasures ” will be used in broadcasting , potentially providing the broadcaster with an advantage over the competition , being better informed and more interesting .
System objectives and components
Metadata for all registered music in NRK has been handled by a group of librarians from the archiving department .
From 1962 to 1982 all registrations for incoming records where made on paper , from 1981 until 2007 all registrations where made in a simple , file - based and non-relational database .
Objectives of the system are to :
significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the production process in public broadcasting
increase competitive advantage by make visible the “ hidden assets ” that are possessed by the broadcaster ( you do not own what you cannot find )
implement a solution capable of integration and alignment with several other production archives for radio , TV , movies , stills , etc. available within the organization .
digitize all music tracks in a high - resolution format for usage in production allowing for multi-channel output
digitalization of all qualified metadata available within the organization
representation of all metadata using Semantic Web priniciples ( graph - like , semantic network structure )
make unexpected and potentially interesting relations visible to the users ( journalists and program makers )
allowing easy access to the archives and one - click ordering of relevant material streamed directly into TV and Radio production .
The complete system has been taken into production during summer 2007 .
Modeling the repository
An important principle for design was the wish to use Semantic Web technology for the solution as to bring a Semantic Web scenario to end users in a commercial environment .
The designed solution is business critical as well as a real - world production environment .
During initial tests , some drawbacks were identified , as well as potential opportunities for expanding the solution :
Available metadata : despite of mainly being available in analogue format , the data kept a high - quality and was rather well - structured .
This does not make “ translation ” an easy task , but was a good help .
Paper archives where scanned and post - processed with linguistic technologies to enhance results as much as possible .
Authority lists on authors , composers and groups were generated from several sources for quality enhancement .
The available electronic cards where augmented with relations and object types using manually defined business rules which could be automatically run on the data set available .

Administration & Maintenance : Since a specialized tool for registration and maintenance of metadata in a broadcaster ’s music archive was not available , a tool was implemented for this very goal .
The Archivist Module ( as it is called ) has web extraction capabilities and automated ( linguistic - based ) support for internet based information extraction ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Some screenshots of the actual Digital Music Archive User Interface
Conclusion and future work
During design time , RDF stores and repositories seemed not to be able yet to store and reason with the sheer amount of triples needed for a proper representation of the archive assets ( estimation in 2006 : 150 + Million triples for the complete database ) .
The evaluation showed that at that time not the whole stack could be served by proper Semantic Web technology .
Therefore it was decided to do a production ready in - house development where objects , properties and relations are stored in a scalable RDBM mapped up to a Semantic Web based publication layer .
This approach allowed for a production system while being able to show the benefits of using Semantic Web technology in Search & Navigation scenarios .
Part of the solution is an export layer , where all metadata can be exported to a variety of formats , including XML / OWL .
Tests are currently conducted with parts of the archive and currently available technology in order to evaluate scalability of available systems to date .
As soon as SPARQL end - points for internet resources with metadata in the field of music become available , such connectors will be added to the administration module of the Digital Music Archive .
Key Benefits of Using Semantic Web Technology
Significantly enhance and facilitate archive access
Navigation and Discovery of new , potentially interesting facts « hidden » in the repository
Highly efficient music archive , combining multi-channel access with a fully automized ordering and production flow
enhanced metadata representation , including multiple file formats ( not only music files with flat metadata , but including pictures , links , interviews and many other resources ) helping journalists to faster produce better trailers and talk - throughs
Ease of integration across multiple archives and resources in the nearby future .

Northern Irish Nobel peace laureate Máiread Corrigan - Maguire and Denis Halliday , a former senior United Nations diplomat , and several other Irish citizens have boarded the MV Rachel Corrie and have set off for Gaza to deliver aid .
MV Rachel Corrie .
“ Israel ’s Navy is ready to stop another aid ship headed to Gaza , a commander said on Tuesday , playing down the prospect of his men shying from confrontation after their bloody seizure of a Turkish vessel a day earlier , ” reports Conservative American News .
“ Israel ’s Army Radio reported that the MV Rachel Corrie , a converted merchant ship , would reach Gazan waters by Wednesday .
A Marine lieutenant who was not named told Army Radio that he expected an easy takeover of the ship . ”
Rachel Corrie was an American member of the International Solidarity Movement killed by an Israeli bulldozer in 2003 .
Corrie was attempting to prevent IDF forces from demolishing a Palestinian home when she was crushed to death .
Máiread Corrigan - Maguire is a Northern Irish peace activist who co-founded the Community of Peace People , an organization which attempts to encourage a peaceful resolution of the Troubles in Northern Ireland .
Corrigan - Maguire received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 .
Denis Halliday was the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq from September 1 , 1997 , until 1998 .
Halliday was presented in 2003 with the Gandhi International Peace Award in recognition of his efforts to draw attention to the plight of Iraqis .
He spoke out against the “ disproportionate and murderous consequences ” of the United Nations embargo against Iraq that resulted in the death of more than 500,000 Iraqi children .
If Corrigan - Maguire and Halliday receive the same treatment as Greek activist Michalis Grigoropoulos and others at the hands of the Israelis , it will undoubtedly result in more negative media coverage of Israel .
Israel has received intense criticism for its raid on the Gaza - bound Mavi Marmara that resulted in the death of 19 activists , most of them Turkish .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Grigoropoulos was aboard the Eleftheri Mesogeio , a ship that accompanied the Mavi Marmara on Monday .
“ Israeli troops jumped onto the boat around 0530 on Monday , ” Middle East Online reports today .
“ They fired rubber coated bullets , tear gas and then used electroshock weapons on some activists , ” he told Skai television shortly after Israel deported him and five compatriots to Athens .
“ An hour beforehand , at 0430 local time , we heard gunfire on the Turkish boat Mavi Marmara , the Israelis jumped from helicopters onto the boat , ” he said .
Pro-Palestinian activists returning to Europe confirmed Grigoropoulos ’ account .
“ Israeli commandos used stun guns on passengers and beat them during the deadly raid , ” the Winnipeg Sun reports .
Greek activist Dimitris Gielalis told the newspaper the boat ’s captain was beaten for refusing to leave the wheel and a cameraman filming the raid was hit with a rifle butt in the eye by Israeli soldiers .
Steve Watson , writing for Prison Planet , reports today that Israel had planned to kill a large number of activists .
Hanin Zoabi , who currently serves as a member of the Knesset representing the Balad party , told a press gathering that it “ was clear from the size of the force that boarded the ship that the purpose was not only to stop this sail , but to cause the largest possible number of fatalities in order to stop such initiatives in the future . ”
Ms. Zoabi has diplomatic immunity from prosecution and was one of the first passengers freed .
She said she watched what was happening from below deck and saw no provocation from those on board , according to ABC in Australia .
Reports seem to confirm an effort by passengers to fight off the commandos as they descended on the ship .
A group of German witnesses who experienced the assault first hand before being detained and deported denied anyone on board was armed with more than a few wooden sticks , reports the AFP .
Israel claims the activists had a cache of weapons .
“ Personally I saw two and a half wooden batons that were used …
There was really nothing else .
We never saw any knives , ” said Norman Paech , a 72 - year - old former member of the German parliament .
“ The Israeli Government justifies the raid because they were attacked .
This is absolutely not the case . ”
Israel has released photographs purporting to show an array of knives and large wooden batons they claim were used on the soldiers .
Israel is holding nearly 700 passengers from the ship .
Grigoropoulos said the commandeered ship was taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod where he was kept incommunicado , denied access to a lawyer and made to sign papers he did not understand .
Grigoropoulos described “ the wretched detention conditions at Ashdod ( where ) 500 people were packed in together ” and said that at least “ two Greek activists were beaten up ” by Israeli police .
“ They made me sign papers on my expulsion , without me knowing what was on the papers because I did not have the right to a translator , a lawyer or to communicate with my family , ” he said .
Activists “ were kept in a detention facility in the port of the town of Ashdod in southern Israel .
The port area was declared a closed military zone , ” reports the Ethiopian Review , “ therefore , lawyers were not allowed to access the activists yesterday .
According to the most recent information , the majority of the activists are being held in ‘ Ella ’ prison facility in the town of Beer Sheva . ”
“ A day after the Israeli raid on the aid flotilla bound for Gaza , nearly 500 passengers remain locked up in an Israeli jail , at least 9 bodies are lying in a morgue , and dozens of wounded activists are getting treated in hospitals , ” the Palestine Video blog reports , citing Aljazeera .
It appears Israel had planned to hold detainees for a period of time .
On Tuesday , however , the state buckled to international pressure to immediately release and deport the activists .
“ The Jewish state caved in as world leaders demanded an investigation into Monday ’s commando assault in international waters and the swift release of the detainees , ” reports AFP .
“ All foreign nationals who were on board the fleet and were arrested will be deported from Tuesday night , ” the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement .
If the Israeli military arrests and detains Corrigan - Maguire and Halliday it may end up experiencing more international pressure and condemnation .
A popular Swedish author , Henning Mankell , was detained by Israel after the raid and subsequently released .
“ Rumors swirled yesterday that Mankell had been shot during an Israeli raid that lead to the death of nine protestors .
However , the Expressen , a Swedish newspaper , reported today that the writer was on a plane back to Stockholm , ” the National Post reports today .

It 's not enough to make a power - efficient server or processor anymore ; no , you also have to package it as being for " the Cloud . "
In this respect , AMD 's announcement today is similar to the recent Tilera and SeaMicro news ; the chipmaker is talking cloud , cloud cloud .
By now , I 've seen essentially the same pitch deck at least half a dozen times — only the company - and technology - specific slides are new in each case .
In the case of today 's Opteron 4000 series ( " Lisbon " platform ) and Firestream coprocessor launch , AMD has a particularly good slide that summarizes most of the other slides in most of the other " here 's our new cloud datacenter product " decks that I 've seen in the past few weeks .
This slide is worth staring at for a moment
As a 4 - and 6 - core server part for one - and two - socket systems , Lisbon is definitely more traditional than the more exotic cloud - specific products that have been mooted recently .
The latter have been aimed at Intel 's Xeon as the epitome of the traditional , performance - oriented , chronically underutilized server processor , while AMD hopes to slot Lisbon in right beneath Xeon in the price / performance ladder .
What AMD offers with Lisbon is a lower performance , lower power , and lower cost alternative for x86 customers who still want the fairly wide range of dynamic performance / watt scaling that the emerging class of radically different " physicalized " designs can offer .
The one - and two - socket - capable 4000 series chips are priced to be competitive with Intel 's single - socket - only Xeons , while AMD 's two - and four - socket - capable Opteron 6000 series is priced to compete with Intel 's two - socket Xeons .
This pricing strategy will probably benefit AMD in the cost - sensitive datacenter market .
The 4000 series is AMD 's first server processor family to target the 32W , 50W , and 75W per node power bands , and AMD claims that the 32 W 4162EE and 4164EE have the lowest power per core of any server processor on the market as of launch .
This low per-core power puts the 1.8GHz 4164 EE at the top of the 4000 series price range , at $ 698 .
At the bottom of the series price range is the 75W , 2.2GHz , four - core 4122 , for $ 99 .
Clearly , AMD is not pricing these parts on anything like raw performance , but on efficiency .
The new Opterons are based on pretty much the same microarchitecture that AMD has been using for some time now , so there 's nothing new there .
AMD has focused most of its efforts for Lisbon on getting the platform 's overall power down and its scalability up .
For instance , Lisbon 's BIOS offers users very fine - grained control over which parts of the computer are active .
You can turn off the PCIe slots for a savings of 2.4W , or the USB ports for a savings of 1W , or a number of other components for a total of 62W per motherboard in potential savings .
Across a large datacenter , saving a watt for each node adds up quickly , so this kind of feature makes plenty of sense for AMD 's target market .
Lisbon also brings the Direct Connect Architecture 2.0 that debuted with Magny - Cours down into the lower end of the server space , which includes AMD - V ( plus virtualized I/O ) , HyperTransport 3.0 , and support for DDR3 1333 .
Firestream looks to the datacenter
The other big news from AMD today is the launch of the ATI Firestream 9350 and 9370 products , which are ATI 's answer to NVIDIA 's Tesla .
The new Firestream parts are essentially the " Cypress " GPU from the Radeon 5870 , but repackaged ( and marked up ) with more memory as an add - in board for high - performance computing .
The new parts have full hardware support for OpenCL 1.0 and DirectX 11 , and they come with passive heatsinks for higher reliability in server environments .
Both Firestream products will launch in the third quarter of this year .
Real integration will wait for Fusion
One of the things that I had been expecting to see by now was some sort of deep , platform - level CPU + GPU integration — basically a product with a GPU in a coprocessor socket , instead of on a PCIe daughterboard .
This never really happened , probably because the combination of PCIe and GDDR5 is good enough , and now it 's clear that it wo n't happen .
AMD has focused its CPU + GPU efforts entirely on wedding the two devices in silicon on the same die , and is skipping the deeper , non-commodity platform integration step entirely .
I asked AMD about this issue , and they confirmed that it 's reasonable to expect a Fusion server part for high performance computing ; they also reiterated that , until such a part arrives , they 're focusing on getting the software side of the integration picture ( OpenCL and DirectCompute ) in shape .

Updated , June 16 , 9:00 p.m. | Patience Andersen Faulkner of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council joins the discussion .
As much as 60,000 barrels of oil a day could be gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from the damaged BP well , a flow rate equal to an Exxon Valdez being spilled every four days .
BP , which says it has spent $ 1.5 billion in response to the spill , has tentatively agreed to place $ 20 billion into an escrow account to pay victims .
The economic and environmental damage can linger for decades , as was the case with the Exxon Valdez , and even much smaller spills , like the one off Cape Cod in 1969 .
How do we calculate the full costs of the BP blowout , which may not be understood for 20 or 30 years ?
How might we ensure that the public does n’t end up paying for future damages and recovery , as it has with Superfund sites ?
The Public Tab
Zygmunt Plater , a professor at Boston College Law School , was chairman of the State of Alaska Oil Spill Commission ’s Legal Task Force over a two - year period after the wreck of the Exxon - Valdez .
The frustration for those of us who worked on the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago is that it did not need to be this way .
The Alaska spill revealed the extreme problems of a complex mega-system for extraction and transport of oil .
The risks are great , hence great vigilance is necessary in every sector of the sprawling enterprise .
The payout in the Exxon Valdez spill missed perhaps 90 percent of the hard - to - monetize injuries to the human and ecological communities .
Instead , then , and still now , we have seen “ complacency , collusion , and neglect ” from the agencies that were supposed to regulate the industry , and the corporations that promised safety along with profit .
Twenty years later , we still do n’t have the liability and accountability structures needed to rectify and deter the harms that are imposed upon the public by risky private actions .
Read more …
As more facts come out , the bases for BP ’s liability will probably mushroom ; I predict that total liability will readily exceed $ 25 billion .
The affected coastal population of Alaska is somewhat less than 40,000 ; Exxon paid out a total of about $ 4.5 billion to individuals and governments .
An oft - quoted statement in Alaska is that the payout missed 90 percent of the real but hard - to - monetize injuries to the human and ecological communities hit by oil .
The population of potentially impacted communities along the Gulf of Mexico is between 4 and 6 million people .
You do the math .
Claimants will have a wide range of choices of statutory and nonstatutory civil liability processes ( in addition to major corporate criminal liability as in the Exxon Valdez precedent ) .
Whatever the settlements reached with BP and other actors at fault , one precedent from the Exxon Valdez case is likely to be expansively applied : “ re-opener ” provisions .
Such provisions subject the responsible companies to a new round of liability if new types of residual harm and damage are discovered over time .
To a sad extent , most of the harm produced by the BP Deepwater blowout is essentially non-remediable , only slowly to be dispersed and detoxified by natural processes .
Beyond money compensation for the victims , what Congress and the president need to look at is how to manage the mega - system of oil extraction while avoiding or mitigating such incidents .
This probably means that all deepwater oil wells will have their permits and operations intensively scrutinized , with increased surety bonds to cover environmental and economic hazards .
The days of laxity and collusion between the companies and the regulators are probably over .
The price of gas will increase , along with safety .
And painful though it may be , the need to rethink energy and climate policy inevitably becomes one big step harder to deny .
File for Bankruptcy
Alice Schroeder , a former regulator at the Financial Accounting Standards Board , is the author of “ The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life . ”
Right now nobody knows what BP owes .
Claims will arise for years in amounts to be determined later .
BP says it will place $ 20 billion into an escrow account , but that may not be enough .
The best way to balance today ’s obligations against tomorrow ’s is through a prepackaged bankruptcy .
We must find a way to treat claimants fairly without putting U.S. taxpayers at risk if an escrow fund is insufficient .
That requires putting a price on the unquantifiable , never an easy task .
Just ask the insurance industry .
When insurers faced unquantifiable risks from asbestos and terrorism , they asked Congress to create similar escrow funds .
Implicitly , taxpayers pay if these funds are exhausted .
The proposals died amid arguments over the funds ’ size and objections to bailing out the industry .
Read more …
An escrow fund for BP could easily be depleted and turn into a bailout .
To prevent that we will need a permanent uncapped fund to ensure claimants are treated fairly and American taxpayers are protected .
It ’s unlikely that a BP besieged with competing claims on its earnings and assets will agree to that .
The damaged well is not contained .
Hundreds of lawsuits against the company have been filed by everyone from souvenir vendors to condominium operators .
The National Guard and workers from more than half a dozen government agencies are laboring to contain the damage ; taxpayers should be reimbursed for this .
BP also has obligations to its creditors .
And the company , remarkably , is still considering a dividend to its shareholders .
The best way to sort out these competing claims is through a prepackaged bankruptcy .
Bankruptcy has lost much of its stigma .
It is a proven way of sorting out claims with fairness and certainty while balancing today ’s obligations against tomorrow’s .
In a bankruptcy , BP ’s earnings — $ 16 billion last year alone — would first go to pay Deepwater Horizon claims .
Creditors ’ rights would be preserved , and BP would continue to operate as an independent company , saving jobs .
Any earnings not paid out immediately could accumulate , ensuring fair treatment of claimants for years to come .
Eventually , the bankruptcy court could separate BP from a new ongoing restitution fund to become a public company again .
Nobody wants to send a company into bankruptcy , but using an escrow fund is signing taxpayers up for another bailout .
We ’ve had too many of those already .
High Risk , High Profits
Kate Gordon is the vice president of Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress .
In 1989 , the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaskan waters .
Today , despite a massive cleanup effort , 16,000 gallons remain on the shoreline .
The current BP disaster is bigger and infinitely harder to contain .
Just as tobacco farmers were paid to grow new crops , some portion of oil profits should be invested in a new economic development plan for the gulf .
Who pays the costs of these spills decades later , when the media and politicians have gone home ?
Not the spiller in question : companies like BP are shielded by liability limits and fuzzy definitions of “ legitimate claims . ”
Under current law , companies like BP are responsible only for cleanup costs , plus up to $ 75 million in environmental and economic damages .
The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund covers costs above the cap , but only up to $ 1 billion .
In the long run , it is the fishermen and hunters , hotel and restaurant owners , workers and tourists who pay .
And they pay dearly , with their health , livelihoods and sometimes even their lives .
Read more …
We need a better plan based on two simple truths :
First , offshore drilling is an inherently risky activity performed by a highly profitable industry .
There is no reason the industry cannot better internalize that risk through stricter regulation , to avoid these disasters completely , and through higher liability caps in the event disaster does strike .
Even with higher liability caps , companies should be required to set up escrow funds to cover damages as soon as a spill or gusher occurs , much as BP has just agreed to do .
With better regulation leading to better safety standards , the most responsible and well - financed companies — the companies best able to deal with the consequences of their actions — will still be able to drill .
Second , oil is not oxygen .
There are alternatives for the gulf region , and alternatives for the nation .
Just as tobacco settlement funds were paid to farmers to grow new crops , so should some portion of oil profits be invested in a new economic development plan for the Gulf , so that future disasters do not take such an enormous toll .
There are alternatives for the nation , as well .
It is time for Congress to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that moves America toward cleaner energy and fuel sources , so that we can stop looking in increasingly remote and risky places for a steadily declining supply of oil .
Create a Compensation Fund
Richard Nagareda is a professor of law and director of the Cecil D. Branstetter Litigation and Dispute Resolution Program at Vanderbilt University Law School .
He is the author of “ Mass Torts in a World of Settlement . ”
President Obama asked BP to set aside a multibillion - dollar escrow account — “ administered by an independent , third party ” — to compensate “ workers and business owners ” along the Gulf Coast .
Develop clear criteria for determining actual losses and limit lawyers ’ fees .
Three lessons emerge from compensation funds created in mass product liability lawsuits in the past .
The challenge is to balance expeditious payouts today with the preservation of funds for claims years or decades into the future .
First , the fund administrator should develop a system to determine who will be compensated , under what conditions , and in what dollar sums .
A compensation grid will necessarily make distinctions in a rough , back - of - the - envelope way .
But that is precisely the attraction : an administrative grid holds the promise of getting money to the injured much more swiftly than litigation .
Read more …
Second , the administrator has to avoid rapid dissipation of the escrow account through the payment of excessive or fraudulent claims .
This goal is especially important here , with speculation about “ dead zones ” in the Gulf Coast decades hence .
Like all streamlined compensation funds , the BP account has the potential to become a Field of Dreams : “ If you build it , they will come . ”
It is crucial for the administrator to develop clear - cut economic , medical and other criteria to distinguish plausible claims from unfounded ones .
Third , the administrator should limit the contingency fees for lawyers paid from the escrow account .
There are no indications thus far that the escrow account would cap the funds available for compensation .
BP , after all , remains in business .
But with the uncertainty of litigation substantially reduced with a compensation grid , there is no justification for lawyers to garner the overhead of 33 - 40 percent that they otherwise would charge to move the money around .
This , too , can help to ensure that escrow funds will go to the people of the Gulf Coast with real injuries , both now and in the future .
Carbon Taxes
Alex Tabarrok is associate professor of economics at George Mason University and director of research for the Independent Institute .
He writes regularly at the economics blog , Marginal Revolution .
President Obama lost his cool last week when — sounding like the old president — he said he was looking for some “ ass to kick . ”
He did n’t regain any lost cool in Tuesday ’s oil speech , which also made him sound like his predecessor : “ Make no mistake : we will fight this spill with everything we ’ve got for as long it takes , ” he said , emphasizing “ We will make BP pay … . ”
Call it President ’s Obama ’s war on error .
A tax on oil — and carbon more generally — would make the price of oil better reflect its true costs .
Turning to energy , the president called for innovation and hard choices but offered little new or courageous thinking of his own .
Instead , he went back to the same well he has drawn from repeatedly ; blame the previous administration and their “ failed philosophy . ”
Whether justified or not , this refrain is getting old .
Even the president ’s appeals to America ’s greatness sounded old .
Can his speechwriters really do no better than remember when we won World War II and put a man on the moon ?

Most important , nowhere did the president mention two hard ideas that the public must accept if we are to move to a cleaner energy future : nuclear power and carbon taxes .
Nuclear power is among the cleanest sources of energy , power plants can be built when and where needed and the combination of nuclear - generated electricity and hydrogen can serve virtually all of our energy needs .
Is nuclear power safe ?
Oil spills and coal - mine disasters should remind us that safety is always relative .
The oil spill is n’t really a new event .
It ’s simply another reminder that not all of the costs of oil are reflected in the price ; whether it ’s climate change , environmental disaster or the financing of anti-American governments , cheap oil is a lot more expensive than it appears at the pump .
A tax on oil — and carbon more generally — would make the price of oil better reflect its true costs thus making our choices more realistic and rational .
Moreover , a carbon tax would do more than any other policy to spur energy conservation and innovation .
No one likes taxes but Al Gore was right when he said we should tax burning not earning .
A tax shift — not a tax increase — away from labor and toward carbon would increase the incentive to create jobs and to use less carbon .
Both changes would be welcome at the present time .
We needed bold but unfortunately the president mostly gave us old .
Beyond the Blame Game
Noah Hall is an environmental law professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit .
He is the founder and former executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center and author of the blog , Great Lakes Law .
Lawyers love to play the blame game and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil blowout and resulting environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico gives us plenty of blame to play with .
The solution to oil disasters is to break our dependence on oil .
Most obvious is BP , the deep - pocket corporation that makes billions of dollars a year while evidently cutting corners on safety and environmental regulations .
The federal government is another obvious target , with years of lax oversight and corruption at Minerals Management Service , the agency that should be protecting the public and the environment from the risks of offshore oil drilling .
Many politicians and commentators have their own targets to blame , conveniently fitting with their respective agendas — blame the environmentalists for pushing oil companies to drill in dangerous deepwater locations , blame the oil industry for ignoring environmental risks — the list goes on and on .
Read more …
If it were simply a matter of placing blame , we could easily solve this problem and prevent future disasters by filing lawsuits , firing government officials and passing popular sounding new laws like the “ Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act ” being debated in Congress .
We should be doing all of these things , and the measures proposed by President Obama in his Oval Office speech are steps in the right direction – having BP create a fund for victims , putting a new sheriff in charge at the federal Minerals Management Service and increasing the tax on oil production to pay for clean - up efforts .
But the catch with the blame game is that it focuses our attention on immediate problems and not fundamental solutions .
The fundamental solution to oil disasters is not compensating victims , improving government agencies and enacting tougher safety regulations — worthy as they are .
The fundamental solution is breaking our country ’s dependence on oil .
It wo n’t be cheap and it wo n’t be easy .
But if we do n’t do it now , we ’ll have no one to blame but ourselves .
Keep BP Viable
Samuel Thernstrom is a resident fellow and the co-director of the Geoengineering Project at the American Enterprise Institute .
By now , the enormity of the spill , long underestimated by both BP and federal officials , has become clear , but its ultimate environmental and economic effects will not be felt for many years , and are likely to be hotly contested by all parties .
The $ 20 billion is a substantial sum but it is unlikely to be enough to cover all costs .
BP has insisted that it will pay “ all legitimate claims ” — but Americans increasingly wonder what that means , and how we can be sure the company will stand by that pledge in the years ahead .
Andrew Ross Sorkin noted in the Times last week that the company has only $ 12 billion in cash and investments on hand ; cleanup cost estimates range from $ 15 billion to $ 40 billion , but juries could add tens of billions to BP ’s tab .
Even for a company with robust revenues , those are daunting figures .
Bankruptcy would not free BP from its liabilities — but it could provide a measure of protection , raising concerns that taxpayers may yet shoulder some of these costs .
Read more …
Today , BP said it would reserve $ 20 billion to compensate workers and businesses , but some crucial details remain murky .
The company reportedly will be allowed to pay into the account over time , alleviating the cash crunch it would have faced if it had been forced to fully fund it immediately .
In theory , this approach is appealing .
The money will be escrowed to pay for future claims , protecting it from the possibility of the company ’s demise , and it would give an independent arbiter control over its disbursement .
Problem solved ?
Not quite .
The $ 20 billion is a substantial sum but it is unlikely to be enough to cover all costs .
Hamstrung by a crisis of investor confidence that has cut its value in half and dramatically raised the cost of credit , BP may still struggle when confronted with the expansive Gulf Coast Restoration Plan that federal and local officials will demand .
Also unresolved , apparently , is the question of how far to extend compensation .
The president ’s insistence that BP bear the cost of his decision to idle thousands of oil rig workers is reportedly a point of particular contention with the company , which might fear that such a concession would expose it to claims from companies such as Shell that are now saddled with regulatory obstacles inspired by BP ’s negligence .
Where do BP ’s obligations end ?
Paradoxically , the best way to ensure that resources will be available for environmental restoration and economic revitalization work far in the future would be keeping BP viable under its current ownership .
If Obama pushes BP into bankruptcy , he may be left with a partially - funded escrow account that can’t cover the full cost of cleanup .
The administration has been at pains to hold itself at arm ’s length from BP , but in crucial respects , the nation ’s long - term recovery may require a continuing partnership with BP .
Ways to Measure Harm
Michael Greenstone is the 3M Professor of environmental economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the director of The Hamilton Project , and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
The livelihoods of many people including fishermen , restaurant owners , and hotel workers are being harmed and will continue to be harmed over many years .
And , the damage to the wetlands and the birds , sea turtles , dolphins and is only beginning to come into focus .
What is the value that people place on knowing that some types of wildlife are healthy and thriving ?
How can the cost of this damage be calculated ?
Over several decades of research , economists have developed tools to help answer this problem .
But it is important to underscore that these tools may fail to capture many people ’s feelings about the spill .
They likely fail to quantify the public ’s disappointment , grief , and even rage about the spill ’s harm to the livelihoods and lifestyles of Gulf Coast residents .
And they almost certainly fail to adequately capture the American people ’s feeling about the polluted waters , tar balls on beaches , and suffering wildlife .
The easiest category of damages to calculate is those that can readily be connected to an economic activity .
One especially powerful approach is to use property markets .
Read more …
It is reasonable to expect housing prices to decline to reflect restrictions on swimming , reduced opportunities for sport fishing , and less scenic views .
In principle , a decline in these qualities will reduce the price of homes , which will capture the damages no matter how long they last .
Damages that are not reflected in property values are more difficult to measure , especially over several years .
Fishermen are a good example .
It is straightforward to measure their income loss this year .
But if fishing is banned for two years , what is the loss in the second year ?
It might seem that it should be the loss in fishing income .
But this is not correct because some people will inevitably find new jobs ( perhaps in new areas of the country ) .
For these folks , the economic loss is the difference between their former income as a fisherman and in their new profession .
To make them whole , any expenses associated with switching professions should be added in — including moving costs , licensing fees , tuition for retraining , etc .
The most difficult type of damages to measure is those that are not easily connected to an economic activity .
And for many Americans — particularly the majority who live outside of the gulf region — these are the very damages that have created a public outcry .
One classic example is the value that people place on knowing that some types of wildlife are healthy and thriving , which economists refer to as non-use values .
Consider the pictures of the brown pelicans coated in oil that many people , including myself , find heartbreaking .
How much would they be willing to pay for this not to have happened to the pelicans or other wildlife ( even if they have no intention of going to the gulf ) ?
There is no market - based way to measure this loss , so some economists have turned to surveys that directly ask people how much they would hypothetically be willing to pay .
The appeal of these surveys is that they provide a value to total up damages , but there are many skeptics who argue that such responses are not reliable .
This is an active area of research in economics and there has been important progress in recent years .
The damages from the Deepwater Horizon spill will prove to be substantial , of that there is little doubt .
While methods do exist for calculating some of the direct economic costs to local economies , the potentially bigger question remains as to how to best measure the broader non-use value of the environment .
For the time being , we will have to muddle along with the imperfect techniques that economics has developed .
In the longer run , researchers need to develop better tools .
Of course , it would be even better if the absence of future oil spills rendered such tools unnecessary .
The Price of a Sea Otter
Patience Andersen Faulkner , an Alaska Native living in Cordova , Alaska , worked with the class action attorneys on processing the claims for all the classes .
She represents the fishermen on the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council and subsistence users on the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council Public Advisory Committee .
It will be a huge challenge to calculate present damages and future losses from the gulf spill .
In Prince William Sound after the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill , we found that some fisheries will take decades to recover while others will recover slowly and need to be protected until a harvestable amount returns .
The damage is long - term .
The lesson from Alaska : let the public have a say in the allocation of funds and the restoration process .
In Alaska , the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council ( EVOSTC ) was formed to oversee restoration of the damaged ecosystem through the use of the $ 900 million civil settlement .
The council has also purchased Alaska Native corporation / village lands as part of its efforts .
We found that it ’s crucial to have a strong public advisory committee representing land owners , village / tribal governments , science , city governments , the subsistence community ( my seat ) so that the public at large and the principal communities can have a say in the allocation of funds and the restoration process .
The Prince William Sound Science Center , which has a great team of scientists on board , has also been important to educating the public and promoting the sound ’s ecological recovery .
In response to mounting concern from users and the media , as well as a member of the Senate , Facebook unveiled simpler privacy options yesterday .
Mashable Founder and CEO Pete Cashmore appeared on PBS today to discuss Facebook 's response to user backlash .

Israel must send Turkey a clear message that if Turkish warships are sent to accompany the next flotilla trying to break the embargo on Gaza , these will be considered acts of war by Israel , Uzi Dayan , former deputy Chief of General Staff , told Army Radio Monday morning .
"
If the Turkish prime minister joins such a flotilla , ” Dayan said , “ we should make clear beforehand this would be an act of war , and we would not try to take over the ship he was on , but would sink it .
”
“ If Israel does n't make this clear beforehand , the Turks will grow increasingly self - assured , and we may indeed find ourselves facing such a scenario , which could have been averted .
” Uzi Dayan attacked a letter sent by Navy veterans calling for a commission of inquiry as confused and irresponsible .

The American animated science fiction sitcom Futurama , created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company , aired on Fox from March 28 , 1999 , to August 10 , 2003 ; Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim aired reruns of the show from 2003 through 2007 .
Following a commitment from 20th Century Fox Television to produce four straight - to - DVD Futurama films , Comedy Central announced on June 23 , 2006 that they were resurrecting the show and would air the films as new Futurama episodes ( reconfiguring each film into four episodes ) after each film 's DVD release . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Comedy Central began airing Futurama reruns in January 2008 and broadcast the first film on March 23 , 2008 .
[3 ]
Following the four films ( considered the fifth season of the show ) , Comedy Central has broadcast a sixth season of twenty - six episodes , split over 2010 and 2011 . [ 4 ]
A seventh season was announced in March 2011 and debuted in the summer of 2012 . [ 5 ]
The original 72 - episode run of Futurama was produced as four seasons ;
Fox broadcast the episodes out of the intended order , resulting in five aired seasons . [ 6 ]
As consequence , the show 's canon is disrupted by the broadcast order .
For example , Fox showed an episode featuring Cubert Farnsworth before the episode where he is first introduced and released from stasis .
This was not intended by the show 's creators .
More , different regions and networks use different ordering for the episodes .
Some countries broadcast Futurama in the intended four - season order .
In the UK , the first 13 episodes of the series ' second run were released on DVD / BD as " season five " , which is entirely different to the " season five " shown by Fox .
This list features the episodes in original production order , as featured on the DVD box sets .
The show aired its final episode on September 4 , 2013 . [ 7 ]
During the course of the series , 140 episodes of Futurama aired over seven seasons .
Series overview [ edit ]
Fox Broadcasting Company broadcast many episodes of the original four production seasons of Futurama out of order ( though the first season was aired completely in order ) , resulting in five broadcast seasons .
Comedy Central also chose to air the parts of season 6 and 7 out of order as well .
This list follows the season box sets , which feature the episodes in the original , intended production season order , ignoring the order of broadcast .

Now Steve Ells , founder of Chipotle , is a panelist on America 's Next Great Restaurant , joining chefs Bobby Flay , Curtis Stone ( The Biggest Loser ) and Lorena Garcia .
They 'll be the judges as potential restaurateurs vie for what 's being billed by Magic Elves , the production team , as arguably the biggest prize in reality show history -- " the opportunity to see their ideas turned into a new restaurant chain in three cities across America . "
Had this competition existed two decades ago , would Ells have competed ?
" When he opened the first Chipotle , it was never about developing a chain restaurant , " Chris Arnold , Chipotle 's director of public relations , says of Ells 's first venture , the Chipotle he opened at 1644 East Evans Avenue in 1993 .
" It was creating a cash cow to pay for a ' real ' restaurant .
His goal was to own his own fine - dining restaurant .
Chipotle was a means to that end . "
After all , Ells had cooked at Stars in San Francisco after graduating the Culinary Institute of America in 1990 .
But that first Chipotle was such a big hit that Ells opened a second , at Eighth and Colorado Boulevard , and then a third .
" Now we 're closing in on a thousand restaurants , " Arnold says .
" He was definitely on to something . "
And how .
One of those restaurants is in London , where Chipotle made its debut this spring ; the company is now looking at other spots in London , as well as Paris and a few cities in Germany .
But before Chipotle continues its march toward global domination , Ells will have to finish filming .
He 's in Los Angeles right now , working on the ten Great Restaurant segments that will be part of NBC 's new season this fall .
" He 's a big fan of restaurants , " Arnold says .
" So when he had the opportunity to do this project , he thought it would be a great way to work with would - be restaurateurs and help them understand what makes a great restaurant .
It 's a good platform for Steve and his vision . "

Home of the most dispiriting news Hollywood has to offer , Pajiba is reporting that Mattel is currently developing a movie based on Rock ’ Em Sock ’ Em Robots , the plunger - based pugilism game that briefly captured the world ’s fancy in the ’60s , ’70s , and ' 80s , before your dumb stepbrother lost a match then , like a big baby , smashed the button on his joystick too hard and broke it forever .
Of course , this project is only said to be “ in development , ” but reportedly Wolfgang Petersen is already attached as a possible director , with screenwriter Kurt Wimmer ( Salt , Law Abiding Citizens ) also potentially taking first crack at a story described as “ Gladiator meets Iron Man … the human story of one robot that becomes part human , part robot . ”
Oh , so it ’s a think piece .
Of course , as Pajiba points out , there ’s already a giant boxin ’ robots movie in the works : Shawn Levy ’s Real Steel , which puts Hugh Jackman in a “ boxing drama set in the near - future where 2,000 - pound robots that look like humans do battle . ”
And because of the timing , Pajiba is sticking to the belief that this project will likely die in development , given the similarities between the two .
But then , we do n’t recall anyone over at Real Steel balking because of Robot Jox .

A quick explanation of the revision history .
I lost the original Open Office files for â€ œImpatient Perlâ€ .
To recover , I had to take the PDF , copy and paste the text , and then manually reformat the document to resemble its original layout .
It was painfully tedious , but the revision on 17 February 2009 is that reconstructed version .
One of the problems with that version is that the text had hard - returns coded into it from the cut / paste .
It might look like there 's a four - line paragraph on some page , but it 's really four lines with hard - coded â€ œ
â€ at the end of each line .
The January 2010 version attempts to remove all the hard - coded returns in the paragraph text and allow the word processor to determine where to wrap the text .
While I was working on that rev , I fixed a couple of typos and tweaked a sentence or two .
Enjoy !

1 The Impatient Introduction to Perl
This document is for people who either want to learn perl or are already programming in perl and just do not have the patience to scrounge for information to learn and use perl .
This document should also find use as a handy desk reference for some of the more
common perl related questions .
1.1
The history of perl in 100 words or less
In the mid 1980s , Larry Wall was working as a sys - admin and found that he needed to do a number of common , yet oddball functions over and over again .
And he did not like any of the scripting languages that were around at the time , so he invented Perl.
Version 1 was released circa 1987 .
A few changes have occurred between then and now .
The current version of Perl has exceeded 5.8.3 and is a highly recommended upgrade .
Perl 6 is on the drawing board as a fundamental rewrite of the language .
It is not available yet , and probably will not be available for some time .
1.2 Basic Formatting for this Document
This document is formatted into text sections , code sections , and shell sections .
This sentence is part of a text section .
Text sections will extend to the far left margin and will use a non-monospaced font .
Text sections contain descriptive text .
Code sections are indented .
They also use a monospaced font .
This is a code section , which represents
code to type into a script .
You will need to use a TEXT EDITOR ,
not a WORD PROCESSOR to create these files .
Generally , the code is contained in one file ,
and is executed via a shell command .
If the code section covers multiple files ,
each file will be labeled .
###filename:MyFile.pm
This code will be placed in a
file called MyFile.pm
#!/usr/local/env perl
###filename:myscript.pl
This code will be placed in a file
called myscript.pl
The first line of myscript.pl will be the
line with #!/usr/local/env perl
> shell sections are indented like code sections
> shell sections also use monospaced fonts .
> shell sections differ from code sections in
> that shell sections start with a ' >' character
> which represents a shell prompt .
> shell sections show commands to type on
> the command line .
> shell sections also show the output of a script ,
> if any exists .
> In simple examples , the code is shown in a
> code section , immediately followed by the output
> from running the script .
The command to run
> the script is dropped to save space .
As an example , the code for a simple " Hello World " script is shown here .
It can be typed into a file of any name .
The name of the file is not important .
The command to execute the script is not important either .
In this example , the code is important , and the output is important , so they are they only things shown .
print " Hello World
" ;
> Hello World
THIS DOCUMENT REFERS TO ( LI/U ) NIX PERL ONLY .
Much of this will translate to Mac Perl and Windows Perl , but the exact translation will be left as an exercise to the reader .
1.3 Do You Have Perl Installed
To find out if you have perl installed and its version :
> perl -v
You should have at least version 5.8.3 .
If you have an older version or if you have no perl installed at all , you can download it for free from
http://www.cpan.org
CPAN is an acronym for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network .
The CPAN site contains the latest perl for download and installation , as well as a TON of perl modules for your use .
If you are a beginner , get your sys - admin to install perl for you .
Even if you are not a beginner , get your sys - admin to install perl for you .
1.4 Your First Perl Script , EVER
Create a file called hello.pl using your favorite text editor .
Type in the following :
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings ;
use strict ; # comment
print " Hello World
" ;
( The # ! on the first line is sometimes pronounced " shebang " )
( The .pl extension is simply a standard accepted extension for perl scripts . )
Run the script :
> perl hello.pl
Hello World
This calls perl and passes it the name of the script to execute .
You can save yourself a little typing if you make the file executable :
> chmod +x hello.pl
And then run the script directly .
> hello.pl
Hello World
If " . " is not in your PATH variable , you will have to run the script by typing :
> ./hello.pl
HOORAY !
Now go update your resume .
Anything from a # character to the end of the line is a comment .
1.5 Default Script Header
All the code examples in this document are assumed to have the following script header , unless otherwise stated .
It uses your PATH environment variable to determine which perl executable to run .
If you need to have different versions of perl installed on your system , you can control which version of perl they will run by changing your PATH variable without having to change your script .
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings ;
use strict ;
use Data :: Dumper ;
Note that Data : : Dumpertakes some time to load and you would n't want to use Data : : Dumperon some timing - critical project .
But for learning perl with simple scripts , the execution speed is n't that high of a priority .
If you 're writing a â€œrealâ€ script ( i.e. one where time - to - run and memory - usage are issues to be considered ) , then do n't use Data : : Dumperby default , only use it if you really need it .

1.7 Cheap Reference Material
" Programming Perl " by Larry Wall , Tom Christiansen , and Jon Orwant .
Highly recommended book to have handy at all times .
It is sometimes referred to as the " Camel Book " by way of the camel drawing on its cover .
The publisher , O'Reilly , has printed enough computer books to choke a , well , camel , and each one has a different animal on its cover .
Therefore if you hear reference to some animal book , it is probably an O'Reilly book .
Well , unless its the " Dragon Book " , because that refers to a book called " Compilers " by Aho , Sethi , and Ullman .
1.8 Acronyms and Terms
Perl : Originally , " Pearl " shortened to " Perl " to gain status as a 4 - letter word .
Now considered an acronym for Practical Extraction and Report Language , as well as Petty Eclectic Rubbish Lister .
The name was invented first .
The acronyms followed .
Note that this is " Perl " with a capital " P " .
The " perl " with a lower case " p " refers to the executable found somewhere near /usr / local / bin / perl
CPAN : Comprehensive Perl Archive Network .
See http://www.cpan.org for more .
DWIM : Do What I Mean .
Once upon a time , the standard mantra for computer inflexibility was this : " I really hate this darn machine , I wish that they would sell it .
It never does what I want , but only what I tell it . "
DWIM - iness is an attempt to embed perl with telepathic powers such that it can understand what you wanted to write in your code even though you forgot to actually type it .
Well , alright , DWIM is just a way of saying the language was designed by some really lazy programmers so that you could be even lazier than they were .
( They had to write perl in C , so they could not be TOO lazy . )
AUTOVIVIFY : " auto " meaning " self " .
" vivify " meaning " alive " .
To bring oneself to life .
Generally applies to perl variables that can grant themselves into being without an explicit declaration from the programmer .
Part of perl 's DWIM - ness .
" Autovivify " is a verb .
The noun form is " autovivification " .
Sometimes , autovivification is not what you meant your code to do , and for some reason , when " do what I mean " meets autovivification in perl , autovivification wins .
And now , a Haiku :
Do What I Mean and
Autovivification
sometimes unwanted
TMTOWTDI : There is More Than One Way To Do It .
An acknowledgment that any programming problem has more than one solution .
Rather than have perl decide which solution is best , it gives you all the tools and lets you choose .
This allows a programmer to select the tool that will let him get his job done .
Sometimes , it gives a perl newbie just enough rope to hang himself .
Foo Fighters : A phrase used around the time of WWII by radar operators to describe a signal that could not be explained .
Later became known as a UFO .
This has nothing to do with perl , except that " foo " is a common variable name used in perl .
Fubar : Another WWII phrase used to indicate that a mission had gone seriously awry or that a piece of equipment was inoperative .
An acronym for Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition and similar interpretations .
This has nothing to do with perl either , except that fubar somehow got mangled into foobar , and perl is often awash in variables named " foo " and " bar " , especially if the programmer wishes to hide the fact that he did not understand his code well enough to come up with better names .
If you use a $ foo variable in your code , you deserve to maintain it .
2 Storage
Perl has three basic storage types : Scalars , Arrays , and Hashes .
The most basic storage type is a Scalar .
Arrays and Hashes use Scalars to build more complex data types .
2.1 Scalars
Scalars are preceded with a dollar sign sigil .
A " $ " is a stylized " S " .
sigil : A symbol .
In Perl a sigil refers to the symbol in front of a variable .
Scalars can store Strings , Numbers ( integers and floats ) , References , and Filehandles .
Perl is smart enough to know which type you are putting into a scalar and handle it .
my $ diameter = 42 ; # The â€œmyâ€ keyword declares a lexical
my $ pi = 3.1415 ; # variable .
If you do n't know what
my $ initial = ' g ' ; # that means , do n't worry about it ,
my $ name = ' John Doe ' ; # it will be explained later .
my $ ref_to_name = \ $name # Specifically , in section 4
Without " use strict ; " and without declaring a variable with a " my " , using a variable causes perl to create one and initialize it to undef .
This undef value will stringify to " " or numify to 0 , depending how the undefined variable is used .
This is called autovivication .
( Stringification and Numification are covered later . )
Autovivify : to bring oneself to life .
In some situations , autovivication is handy .
However , in certain situations , autovivification can be an unholy monster .
my $ circumference = $ pie * $ diameter ;
# oops , $ pie does n't exist .
Autovivified to undef ,
# numified to 0 , therefore $ circumference is zero .
Without use warnings ; use strict ; perl will autovivify a new variable called " pie " , initialize it to zero , and assume that is what you meant to do .
There is no reason that warnings and strictness should not be turned on in your scripts .
2.1.1 Scalar Strings
Scalars can store strings .
You do not have to declare the length of the string , perl just handles it for you automatically .
2.1.1.1 String Literals
String literals must be in single or double quotes or you will get an error .
print hello ;
Error : Unquoted string " hello " may clash with
reserved word
You can use single quotes or double quotes to set off a string literal :
my $ name = ' mud ' ;
my $ greeting = " hello , $ name
" ;
print $ greeting ;
> hello , mud
You can also create a list of string literals using the qw ( ) function .
my ( $ first , $last ) =qw ( John Doe ) ;
print " first is '$ first '
" ;
print " last is ' $ last '
" ;
> first is ' John '
> last is ' Doe '
2.1.1.2 Single quotes versus Double quotes
Single quoted strings are a " what you see is what you get " kind of thing .
my $ name = ' mud ' ;
print ' hello $ name ' ;
> hello $ name
Double quotes means that you get SOME variable interpolation during string evaluation .
Complex variables , such as a hash lookup , will not be interpolated properly in double quotes .
my $ name = ' mud ' ;
print " hello $ name
" ;
> hello mud
Note : a double - quoted "
" is a new - line character .
2.1.1.3 chomp
You may get rid of a newline character at the end of a string by chomp-ing the string .
The chomp function removes one new line from the end of the string even if there are multiple newlines at the end .
If there are no newlines , chomp leaves the string alone .
The return value of chomp is what was chomped ( seldom used ) .
My $ string = " hello world
" ;
chomp ( $string ) ;
warn " string is ' $ string '
"
> string is ' hello world ' ...
2.1.1.4 concatenation
String concatenation uses the period character " . "
my $ fullname = ' mud ' . " bath " ;
2.1.1.5 repetition
Repeat a string with the " x " operator .
my $ line = ' -' x 80 ; # $ line is eighty hypens
2.1.1.6 length
Find out how many characters are in a string with length ( ) .
my $ len = length ( $ line ) ; # $ len is 80
2.1.1.7 substr
substr ( STRING_EXPRESSION , OFFSET , LENGTH ) ;
Spin , fold , and mutilate strings using substr ( ) .
The substr function gives you fast access to get and modify chunks of a string .
You can quickly get a chunk of LENGTH characters starting at OFFSET from the beginning or end of the string ( negative offsets go from the end ) .
The substr function then returns the chunk .
my $ chunk = substr ( ' the rain in spain ' , 9 , 2 ) ;
warn " chunk is ' $ chunk ' " ;
> chunk is ' in ' ...
The substr function can also be assigned to , replacing the chunk as well .
You need a string contained in a variable that can be modified , rather than using a constant literal in the example above .
my $ string = ' the rain in spain ' ;
substr ( $ string , 9 , 2 ) = ' beyond ' ;
warn " string is ' $ string ' " ;
> string is ' the rain beyond spain ' ...
2.1.1.8 split
split(/ PATTERN / , STRING_EXPRESSION,LIMIT ) ;
Use the split function to break a string expression into components when the components are separated by a common substring pattern .
For example , tab separated data in a single string can be split into separate strings .
my $ tab_sep_data = " John\tDoe\tmale\t42 " ;
my ( $ first , $last , $gender , $age )
= split(/\t/ , $ tab_sep_data ) ;
You can break a string into individual characters by calling split with an empty string pattern " " .
The / PATTERN / in split ( ) is a Regular Expression , which is complicated enough to get its own chapter .
However , some common regular expression PATTERNS for split are :
\t tab - separated data
\s+ whitespace - separated data
\s* , \s* comma-separated data
2.1.1.9 join
join( ' SEPARATOR STRING ' , STRING1 , STRING2 , ... ) ;
Use join to stitch a list of strings into a single string .
my $ string = join ( " and " ,
' apples ' , ' bananas ' , ' peaches ' ) ;
warn " string is ' $ string ' " ;
> string is ' apples and bananas and peaches '...
2.1.1.10 qw
The qw ( ) function takes a list of barewords and quotes them for you .
my $ string =
join ( " and " , qw ( apples bananas peaches ) ) ;
warn " string is ' $ string ' " ;
> string is ' apples and bananas and peaches '...
2.1.1.11 Multi-Line Strings , HERE Documents
Perl allows you to place a multi- line string in your code by using what it calls a " here documentâ€ .
My $ string = << â€ENDOFDOCUMENTâ€ ;
Do What I Mean and
Autovivification
sometimes unwanted
ENDOFDOCUMENT
warn " string is ' $ string'â€ ;
> string is ' Do What I Mean and
> Autovivification
> sometimes unwanted ' at ...
The ' < < ' indicates a HERE document , followed by the name of the label indicating the end of the here document .
Enclosing the label in double quotes means that perl variables in the document will get interpolated as strings .
Enclosing the label in single quotes means that no string interpolation occurs .
Perl then reads the lines after the ' < < ' as string literal content until it sees the end of string label positioned at the beginning of a line .
2.1.2 Scalar Numbers
Perl generally uses floats internally to store numbers .
If you specify something that is obviously an integer , it will use an integer .
Either way , you simply use it as a scalar .
my $ days_in_week = 7 ; # scalar => integer
my $ temperature = 98.6 ; # scalar => float
2.1.2.1 Numeric Literals
Perl allows several different formats for numeric literals , including integer , floating point , and scientific notation , as well as decimal , octal , and hexadecimal .
Binary numbers begin with " 0 b "
hexadecimal numbers begin with " 0 x "
Octal number begin with a " 0 "
All other numeric literals are assumed to be decimal .
my $ solar_temp_c = 1.5e7 ; # centigrade
my $ solar_temp_f = 27_000_000.0 ; # Fahrenheit
my $ base_address = 01234567 ; # octal
my $ high_address = 0xfa94 ; # hexadecimal
my $ low_address = 0b100101 ; # binary
2.1.2.2 Numeric Functions
2.1.2.3 abs
Use abs to get the absolute value of a number .
my $ var1 = abs ( - 3.4 ) ; # var1 is 3.4
my $ var2 = abs ( 5.9 ) ; # var2 is 5.9
2.1.2.4 int
Use " int " to convert a floating point number to an integer .
Note that this truncates everything after the decimal point , which means you do NOT get rounding .
Truncating means that positive numbers always get smaller and negative numbers always get bigger .
my $ price = 9.95 ;
my $ dollars = int ( $ price ) ;
# dollars is 9 , not 10 ! false advertising !
my $ y_pos = - 5.9 ;
my $ y_int = int ( $y_pos ) ;
# y_int is - 5 ( - 5 is " bigger " than - 5.9 )
If you want to round a float to the nearest integer , you will need to write a bit of code .
One way to accomplish it is to use sprintf :
my $ price = 9.95 ;
my $ dollars = sprintf ( " %.0f " , $ price ) ;
# dollars is 10
2.1.2.5 trigonometry ( sin , cos , tan )
The sin , cos , and tan functions return the sine , cosine , and tangent of a value given in RADIANS .
If you have a value in DEGREES , multiply it by ( pi/180 ) first .
my $ angle = 45 ; # 45 deg
my $radians = $ angle * ( 3.14 / 180 ) ; # .785 rad
my $ sine_deg = sin( $ angle ) ; # 0.707
my $ sine_rad = sin( $radians ) ; # 0.707
If you need inverse sine , cosine , or tangent , then use the Math : : Trig module on CPAN .
2.1.2.6 exponentiation
Use the " ** " operator to raise a number to some power .
my $ seven_squared = 7 ** 2 ; # 49
my $ five_cubed = 5 ** 3 ; # 125
my $ three_to_the_fourth = 3 ** 4 ; # 81
Use fractional powers to take a root of a number :
my $ square_root_of_49 = 49 ** ( 1/2 ) ; # 7
my $ cube_root_of_125 = 125 ** ( 1/3 ) ; # 5
my $ fourth_root_of_81 = 81 ** ( 1/4 ) ; # 3
Standard perl cannot handle imaginary numbers .
Use the Math : : Complex module on CPAN .
2.1.2.7 sqrt
Use sqrt to take the square root of a positive number .
my $ square_root_of_123 = sqrt ( 123 ) ; # 11.0905
2.1.2.8 natural logarithms ( exp , log )
The exp function returns eto the power of the value given .
To get e , call exp ( 1 ) ;
my $ value_of_e = exp ( 1 ) ; # 2.7183
my $ big_num= exp ( 42 ) ; # 2.7183 ** 42 = 1.7e18
The log function returns the inverse exp ( ) function , which is to say , log returns the number to which you would have to raise e to get the value passed in .
my $ inv_exp = log ( $ big_num ) ; # inv_exp = 42
If you want another base , then use this subroutine :
sub log_x_base_b { return log ( $ _ [ 0 ] ) / log ( $ _ [ 1 ] ) ; }
# want the log base 10 of 12345
# i.e. to what power do we need to raise the
# number 10 to get the value of 12345 ?
my $ answer = log_x_base_b( 12345,10 ) ; # answer = 4.1
Note that inverse natural logs can be done with exponentiation , you just need to know the value of the magic number e ( ~ 2.718281828 ) .
The exp function is straightforward exponentiation :
# big_num = 2.7183 ** 42 = 1.7e18
my $ big_num = $ value_of_e ** 42 ;
Natural logarithms simply use the inverse of the value ( i.e. 1/value ) with exponentiation .
# inv_exp = 2.7183 ** ( 1/1.7e18 ) = 42
my $ inv_exp = $ value_of_e ** ( 1/ $ big_num ) ;
2.1.2.9 random numbers ( rand , srand )
The rand function is a pseudorandom number generator ( PRNG ) .
If a value is passed in , rand returns a number that satisfies ( 0 <= return <= input )
If no value is passed in , rand returns a number in the range ( 0 <= return < 1 )
The srand function will seed the PRNG with the value passed in .
If no value is passed in , srand will seed the PRNG with something from the system that will give it decent randomness .
You can pass in a fixed value to guarantee the values returned by rand will always follow the same sequence ( and therefore are predictable ) .
You should only need to seed the PRNG once .
If you have a version of perl greater than or equal to 5.004 , you should not need to call it at all , because perl will call srand at startup .
2.1.3 Converting Between Strings and Numbers
Many languages require the programmer to explicitly convert numbers to strings before printing them out and to convert strings to numbers before performing arithmetic on them .
Perl is not one of these languages .
Perl will attempt to apply Do What I Mean to your code and just Do The Right Thing .
There are two basic conversions that can occur : stringification and numification .
2.1.3.1 Stringify
Stringify : Converting something other than a string to a string form .
Perl will automatically convert a number ( integer or floating point ) to a string format before printing it out .
my $ mass = 7.3 ;
my $ volume = 4 ;
warn " mass is ' $ mass '
" ;
warn " volume is ' $ volume '
" ;
> mass is ' 7.3 ' ...
> volume is ' 4 ' ...
Even though $ mass is stored internally as a floating point number and $ volume is stored internally as an integer , the code did not have to explicitly convert these numbers to string format before printing them out .
Perl will attempt to convert the numbers into the appropriate string representation .
If you do not want the default format , use sprintf .
If you want to force stringification , simply concatenate a null string onto the end of the value .
my $ mass = 7.3 ; # 7.3
my $ string_mass = $ mass .= '' ; # ' 7.3 '
2.1.3.1.1 sprintf
Use sprintf to control exactly how perl will convert a number into string format .
sprintf ( FORMAT_STRING , LIST_OF_VALUES ) ;
For example :
my $ pi = 3.1415 ;
my $ str = sprintf ( " %06.2f " , $pi ) ;
warn " str is ' $ str ' " ;
> str is ' 003.14 ' ...
Decoding the above format string :
% => format
0 => fill leading spaces with zero
6 => total length , including decimal point
. 2 => put two places after the decimal point
f => floating point notation
To convert a number to a hexadecimal , octal , binary , or decimal formated string , use the following FORMAT_STRINGS :
hexadecimal " %lx " The letter 'l ' ( L )
octal " %lo " indicates the input is
binary " %lb " an integer , possibly
decimal integer " %ld " a Long integer .
decimal float " % f "
scientific " % e "
2.1.3.2 Numify
Numify : Converting something other than a number to a numeric form .
Sometimes you have string information that actually represents a number .
For example , a user might enter the string " 19.95 " which must be converted to a float before perl can perform any arithmetic on it .
You can force numification of a value by adding integer zero to it .
my $ user_input = ' 19.95 ' ; # ' 19.95 '
my $ price = $ user_input+0 ; # 19.95
If the string is NOT in base ten format , then use oct ( ) or hex ( )
2.1.3.2.1 oct
The octfunction can take a string that fits the octal , hexadecimal , or binary format and
convert it to an integer .
binary formatted strings must start with " 0 b "
hexadecimal formatted strings must start with " 0 x "
All other numbers are assumed to be octal strings .
Note : even though the string might not start with a zero ( as required by octal literals ) , oct will assume the string is octal .
This means calling oct ( ) on a decimal number could be a bad thing .
To handle a string that could contain octal , hexadecimal , binary , OR decimal strings , you could assume that octal strings must start with " 0 " .
Then , if the string starts with zero , call oct on it , else assume it 's decimal .
This example uses regular expressions and the conditional operator .
my $ num = ( $ str=~m{ ^0} ) ? oct ( $str ) : $ str + 0 ;
2.1.3.2.2 hex
The hex ( ) function takes a string in hex format and converts it to integer .
The hex ( ) function is like oct ( ) except that hex ( ) only handles hex base strings , and it does not require a " 0 x " prefix .
2.1.3.2.3 Base Conversion Overview
Given a decimal number :
my $ decimal=12 ;
Convert from decimal to another base using sprintf :
my $ hex = sprintf ( " % lx " , $ decimal ) ;
my $ oct = sprintf ( " % lo " , $ decimal ) ;
my $ bin = sprintf ( " %lb " , $ decimal ) ;
If you want to pad the most significant bits with zeroes and you know the width , use this :
# 08 assumes width is 8 characters
my $ p_hex = sprintf ( " %08lx " , $ decimal ) ;
my $ p_oct = sprintf ( " %08lo " , $ decimal ) ;
my $ p_bin = sprintf ( " %08lb " , $ decimal ) ;
If you have a string and you want to convert it to decimal , use the conditional operator and oct ( ) .
sub convert_to_decimal {
( $ _ [ 0 ] =~m{^0} ) ?
Oct ( $ _ [ 0 ] ) : $ _ [ 0 ] + 0 ;
}
warn convert_to_decimal ( ' 42 ' ) ; # dec
warn convert_to_decimal ( '032 ' ) ; # oct
warn convert_to_decimal ( '0xff ' ) ; # hex
warn convert_to_decimal ( '0b1001011 ' ) ; # bin
If you want to know how many bits it would take to store a number , convert it to binary using sprintf ( do n't pad with zeros ) and then call length ( ) on it .
warn length ( sprintf ( " %lb " , 255 ) ) ; # 8
2.1.4 Undefined and Uninitialized Scalars
All the examples above initialized the scalars to some known value before using them .
You can declare a variable but not initialize it , in which case , the variable is undefined .
If you use a scalar that is undefined , perl will stringify or numify it based on how you are using the variable .
An undefined scalar stringifies to an empty string : " "
An undefined scalar numifies to zero : 0
Without warnings or strict turned on , this conversion is silent .
With warnings / strict on , the conversion still takes place , but a warning is emitted .
Since perl automatically performs this conversion no matter what , there is no string or numeric operation that will tell you if the scalar is undefined or not .
Use the defined ( ) function to test whether a scalar is defined or not .
If the scalar is defined , the function returns a boolean " true " ( 1 )
If the scalar is NOT defined , the function returns a boolean " false " ( " " ) .
If you have a scalar with a defined value in it , and you want to return it to its uninitialized state , assign undef to it .
This will be exactly as if you declared the variable with no initial value .
my $var ; # undef
print " test 1 : " ;
if ( defined ( $var ) ) {print " defined
" ;}
else {print " undefined
" ;}
$ var = 42 ; # defined
print " test 2 : " ;
if ( defined ( $var ) ) {print " defined
" ;}
else {print " undefined
" ;}
$ var = undef ; # undef as if never initialized
print " test 3 : " ;
if ( defined ( $var ) ) {print " defined
" ;}
else {print " undefined
" ;}
> test 1 : undefined
> test 2 : defined
> test 3 : undefined
2.1.5 Booleans
Perl does not have a boolean " type " per se .
Instead , perl interprets scalar strings and numbers as " true " or " false " based on some rules :
1 ) Strings " " and " 0 " are FALSE ,
any other string or stringification is TRUE
2 ) Number 0 is FALSE , any other number is TRUE
3 ) all references are TRUE
4 ) undef is FALSE
Note that these are SCALARS .
Any variable that is not a SCALAR is first evaluated in scalar context , and then treated as a string or number by the above rules .
The scalar context of an ARRAY is its size .
An array with one undef value has a scalar ( ) value of 1 and is therefore evaluated as TRUE .
A subroutine returns a scalar or a list depending on the context in which it is called .
To explicitly return FALSE in a subroutine , use this :
return wantarray ( ) ? ( ) : 0 ; # FALSE
This is sufficiently troublesome to type for such a common thing that an empty return statement within a subroutine will do the same thing :
return ; # FALSE
2.1.5.1 FALSE
The following scalars are interpreted as FALSE :
integer 0 # false
float 0.0 # false
string ' 0 ' # false
string '' # false
undef # false
2.1.5.2 TRUE
ALL other values are interpreted as TRUE , which means the following scalars are considered TRUE , even though you might not have expected them to be false .
string ' 0.0 ' # true
string ' 00 ' # true
string ' false ' # true
float 3.1415 # true
integer 11 # true
string ' yowser ' # true
If you are doing a lot of work with numbers on a variable , you may wish to force numification on that variable ( $ var+0 ) before it gets boolean tested , just in case you end up with a string " 0.0 " instead of a float 0.0 and get some seriously hard to find bugs .
Note that the string ' 0.0 ' is TRUE , but ( ' 0.0 '+0 ) will get numified to 0 , which is FALSE .
If you are processing a number as a string and want to evaluate it as a BOOLEAN , make sure you explicitly NUMIFY it before testing its BOOLEANNESS .
Built in Perl functions that return a boolean will return an integer one ( 1 ) for TRUE and an empty string ( " " ) for FALSE .
2.1.5.3 Comparators
Comparison operators return booleans , specifically an integer 1 for true and a null string " " for false .
The " Comparison " operator ( " <= > " and " cmp " ) return a - 1 , 0 , or +1 , indicating the compared values are less than , equal to , or greater than .
Distinct comparison operators exist for comparing strings and for comparing numbers .
Function String Numeric
First column : function ; second column - the string - related operator ; third column - the numeric oeprator Function String Numeric equal to eq == not equal to ne != less than lt < greater than gt > less than or equal to le <= greater than or equal to ge >= comparison ( lt= - 1 , eq=0 , gt=+1 ) cmp <=>
equal to
Note that if you use a string operator to compare two numbers , you will get their alphabetical string comparison .
Perl will stringify the numbers and then perform the compare .
This will occur silently ; perl will emit no warning .
And if you wanted the numbers compared numerically but used string comparison , then you will get the wrong result when you compare the strings ( " 9 " lt " 100 " ) .
String " 9 " is greater than ( gt ) string " 100 " .
Number 9 is less than ( < = ) number 100 .
If you use a numeric operator to compare two strings , perl will attempt to numify the strings and then compare them numerically .
Comparing " John " <= " Jacob " will cause perl to convert " John " into a number and fail miserably .
However , if warnings / strict is not on , it will fail miserably and SILENTLY , assigning the numification of " John " to integer zero .
The numeric comparison operator ' < = >' is sometimes called the " spaceship operator " .
2.1.5.4 Logical Operators
Perl has two sets of operators to perform logical AND , OR , NOT functions .
The difference between the two is that one set has a higher precedence than the other set .
The higher precedence logical operators are the ' && ' , ' || ' , and '!' operators .
function , operator , usage , and return value of the operators function operator usage return value AND && $ one && $ two if ( $ one is false ) $ one else $ two OR || $ one || $ two if ( $ one is true ) $ one else $ two NOT ! !
$ one if ( $ one is false ) true else false
The lower precedence logical operators are the ' and ' , ' or ' , ' not ' , and ' xor ' operators .
function , operator , usage , and return value of the operators function operator usage return value AND and $ one and $ two if ( $ one is false ) $ one else $ two OR or $ one or $ two if ( $ one is true ) $ one else $ two NOT not not $ one if ( $ one is false ) true else false XOR xor $ one xor $ two if ( ( $ one true and $ two false ) or ( $ one false and $ two true ) ) then return true else false
Both sets of operators are very common in perl code , so it is useful to learn how precedence affects their behavior .
But first , some examples of how to use them .
2.1.5.4.1 Default Values
This subroutine has two input parameters ( $ left and $ right ) with default values ( 1.0 and 2.0 ) .
If the user calls the subroutine with missing arguments , the undefined parameters will instead receive their default values .
sub mysub {
my ( $ left , $ right ) =@_ ;
$ left ||= 1.0 ;
$ right ||= 2.0 ;
# deal with $ left and $ right here .
}
The ' ||= ' operator is a fancy shorthand .
This :
$ left ||= 1.0 ;
is exactly the same as this :
$ left = $ left || 1.0 ;
2.1.5.4.2 Flow Control
The open ( ) function here will attempt to open $ filename for reading and attach $ filehandle to it .
If open ( ) fails in any way , it returns FALSE , and FALSE OR 'ed with die ( ) means that perl will evaluate the die ( ) function to finish the logical evaluation .
It wo n't complete because execution will die , but the end result is code that is actually quite readable .
open ( my $ filehandle , $ filename )
or die " cant open " ;
2.1.5.4.3 Precedence
The reason we used ' || ' in the first example and ' or ' in the second example is because the operators have different precedence , and we used the one with the precedence we needed .
2.1.5.4.4 Assignment Precedence
When working with an assignment , use ' || ' and ' && ' , because they have a higher precedence than ( and are evaluated before ) the assignment '= ' .
The ' or ' and ' and ' operators have a precedence that is LOWER than an assignment , meaning the assignment would occur first , followed by any remaining ' and ' and ' or ' operators .
Right :
my $ default = 0 || 1 ;
# default is 1
Wrong :
my $ default = 0 or 1 ;
# default is 0
The second ( wrong ) example is equivalent to this :
( my $ default = 0 ) or 1 ;
which will ALWAYS assign $ default to the first value and discard the second value .
2.1.5.4.5 Flow Control Precedence
When using logical operators to perform flow control , use ' or ' and ' and ' operators , because they have lower precedence than functions and other statements that form the boolean inputs to the ' or ' or ' and ' operator .
The ' || ' and ' && ' have higher precedence than functions and may execute before the first function call .
Right :
close $ fh or die " Error : could not close " ;
Wrong :
close $ fh || die " Error : could not close " ;
The second ( wrong ) example is equivalent to this :
close ( $ fh || die " Error " ) ;
which will ALWAYS evaluate $ fh as true , NEVER die , and close $ fh .
If close ( ) fails , the return value is discarded , and the program continues on its merry way .
It is always possible to override precedence with parentheses , but it is probably better to get in the habit of using the right operator for the right job .
2.1.5.4.6 Conditional Operator
The conditional operator mimics the conditional testing of an if - else block .
The conditional operator uses three operands , and is also called a trinary operator .
As it happens , the conditional operator is perl 's ONLY trinary operator , so people sometimes call it the trinary or ternary operator when they mean conditional operator .
As long as perl does n't add another trinary operator , its not a problem .
It is even more rarely called the ? : operator .
The conditional operator has this form :
my $ RESULT = $ BOOLEAN1 ?
$ VALUE1 : $ VALUE2 ;
This can be rewritten as an if - else block like this :
my $ RESULT ;
if($ BOOLEAN1 ) {
$ RESULT = $ VALUE1
} else {
$ RESULT = $ VALUE2
}
The conditional operator allows you to declare the variable and perform the assignment all in one short line of code .
Note that $ BOOLEAN1 , $ VALUE1 and $ VALUE2 can be replaced by any normal perl expression , rather than being limited to a simple scalar value .
One interesting expression that you could replace $ VALUE2 with is another conditional operator , effectively allowing you to create a chain of if - elsif - elsif - else statements .
For example :
my $ RESULT =
$ BOOLEAN1 ?
$ VALUE1
: $ BOOLEAN2 ?
$ VALUE2
: $ BOOLEAN3 ?
$ VALUE3
: $ BOOLEAN4 ?
$ VALUE4
: $ VALUE5 ;
The above example is equivalent to this mouthful :
my $ RESULT ;
if($ BOOLEAN1 ) { $ RESULT = $ VALUE1 }
elsif( $ BOOLEAN2 ) { $ RESULT = $ VALUE2 }
elsif( $ BOOLEAN3 ) { $ RESULT = $ VALUE3 }
elsif( $ BOOLEAN4 ) { $ RESULT = $ VALUE4 }
eles { $ RESULT = $ VALUE5 }
2.1.6 References
A reference points to the variable to which it refers .
It is kind of like a pointer in C , which says " the data I want is at this address " .
Unlike C , you cannot manually alter the address of a perl reference .
You can only create a reference to a variable that is visible from your current scope .
Create a reference by placing a " \ " in front of the variable :
my $ name = ' John ' ;
my $ age = 42 ;
my $ name_ref = \$name ;
my $ age_ref = \$age ;
Perl will stringify a reference so that you can print it and see what it is .
warn " age_ref is ' $ age_ref ' " ;
> age_ref is ' SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) ' ...
This tells you that $ age_ref is a reference to a SCALAR ( which we know is called $ age ) .
It also tells you the address of the variable to which we are referring is 0x812e6ec .
You can not referencify a string .
I.E. you cannot give perl a string , such as " SCALAR ( 0x83938949 ) " and have perl give you a reference to whatever is at that address .
Perl is pretty loosy goosey about what it will let you do , but not even perl is so crazy as to give people complete access to the system memory .
You can dereference a reference by putting an extra sigil ( of the appropriate type ) in front of the reference variable .
my $ name = ' John ' ;
my $ ref_to_name = \$name ;
my $ deref_name = $ $ ref_to_name ;
warn $ deref_name ;
> John ...
References are interesting enough that they get their own section .
But I introduce them here so that I can introduce a really cool module that uses references : Data :: Dumper .
Data :: Dumper will take a reference to ANYTHING and print out the thing to which it refers in a human readable form .
This does not seem very impressive with a reference to a scalar :
my $ name = ' John ' ;
my $ ref_to_name = \$name ;
warn Dumper \$ref_to_name ;
> $ VAR1 = \' John ' ;
But this will be absolutely essential when working with Arrays and Hashes .
2.1.7 Filehandles
Scalars can store a filehandle .
File IO gets its own section , but I introduce it here to give a complete picture of what scalars can hold .
Given a scalar that is undefined ( uninitialized ) , calling open ( ) on that scalar and a string filename will tell perl to open the file specified by the string , and store the handle to that file in the scalar .
open ( my $ fh , '> out.txt ' ) ;
print $fh " hello world
" ;
print $fh " this is simple file writing
" ;
close ( $fh ) ;
The scalar $ fh in the example above holds the filehandle to " out.txt " .
Printing to the filehandle actually outputs the string to the file .
There is some magic going on there that I have not explained , but that is a quick intro to scalar filehandles .
2.1.8 Scalar Review
Scalars can store STRINGS , NUMBERS ( floats and ints ) , REFERENCES , and FILEHANDLES .
Stringify : to convert something to a string format
Numify : to convert something to a numeric format
The following scalars are interpreted as boolean FALSE :
integer 0 , float 0.0 , string " 0 " , string " " , undef
All other scalar values are interpreted as boolean TRUE .
2.2 Arrays
Arrays are preceded with an " at " sigil .
The " @ " is a stylized " a " .
An array stores a bunch of scalars that are accessed via an integer index .
Perl arrays are ONE - DIMENSIONAL ONLY .
( Do Not Panic . )
The first element of an array always starts at ZERO ( 0 ) .
When you refer to an entire array , use the " @ " sigil .
my @numbers = qw ( zero one two three ) ;
When you index into the array , the " @ " character changes to a " $ " and the numeric index is placed in square brackets .
my @numbers = qw ( zero one two three ) ;
my $ string = $ numbers [ 2 ] ;
warn $ string ;
> two ...
The length of an array is not pre-declared .
Perl autovivifies whatever space it needs .
my @months ;
$ months [ 1 ] =' January ' ;
$ months [ 5 ] =' May ' ;
# $ months [ 0 ] and $ months [ 2..4 ] are autovivified
# and initialized to undef
print Dumper \@months ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> undef , # index 0 is undefined
> ' January ' , # $ months [ 1 ]
> $ { \$ VAR1 ->[ 0 ] } , # this is same as undef
> $ { \$ VAR1 ->[ 0 ]} , # undef
> $ { \$ VAR1 ->[ 0 ]} , # undef
> ' May ' # $ months [ 5 ]
> ] ;
If you want to see if you can blow your memory , try running this piece of code :
my @mem_hog ;
$ mem_hog [ 10000000000000000000000 ] =1 ;
# the array is filled with undefs
# except the last entry , which is initialized to 1
Arrays can store ANYTHING that can be stored in a scalar
my @junk_drawer = ( ' pliers ' , 1,1,1 , '*' , '//',
3.14 , 9*11 , ' yaba ' , ' daba ' ) ;
Negative indexes start from the end of the array and work backwards .
my @colors = qw ( red green blue ) ;
my $ last=$colors [ - 1 ] ;
warn " last is ' $ last ' " ;
> last is ' blue ' ...
2.2.1 scalar ( @array )
To get how many elements are in the array , use " scalar "
my @phonetic = qw ( alpha bravo charlie delta ) ;
my $ quantity = scalar ( @phonetic ) ;
warn $ quantity ;
> 4 ...
When you assign an entire array into a scalar variable , you will get the same thing , but calling scalar ( ) is much more clear .
my @phonetic = qw ( alpha bravo charlie ) ;
my $ quant = @phonetic ;
warn $ quant ;
> 3 ...
This is explained later in the " list context " section .
2.2.2 push ( @array , LIST )
Use push ( ) to add elements onto the end of the array ( the highest index ) .
This will increase the length of the array by the number of items added .
my @groceries = qw ( milk bread ) ;
push ( @groceries , qw ( eggs bacon cheese ) ) ;
print Dumper \@groceries ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' milk ' ,
> ' bread ' ,
> 'eggs ' ,
> ' bacon ' ,
> ' cheese '
> ] ;
2.2.3 pop( @array )
Use pop ( ) to get the last element off of the end of the array ( the highest index ) .
This will shorten the array by one .
The return value of pop( ) is the value popped off of the array .
my @names = qw ( alice bob charlie ) ;
my $ last_name = pop(@names ) ;
warn " popped = $ last_name " ;
print Dumper \@names ;
> popped = charlie ...
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' alice ' ,
> ' bob '
> ] ;
2.2.4 shift ( @array )
Use shift ( ) to remove one element from the beginning / bottom of an array ( i.e. at index zero ) .
All elements will be shifted DOWN one index .
The array will be shorted by one .
The return value is the value removed from the array .
my @curses = qw ( fee fie foe fum ) ;
my $ start = shift ( @curses ) ;
warn $ start ;
warn Dumper \@curses ;
> fee
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' fie ' ,
> ' foe ' ,
> ' fum '
> ] ;
2.2.5 unshift ( @array , LIST )
use unshift ( ) to add elements to the BEGINNING / BOTTOM of an array ( i.e. at index ZERO ) .
All the other elements in the array will be shifted up to make room .
This will length the array by the number of elements in LIST .
my @trees = qw ( pine maple oak ) ;
unshift ( @trees , ' birch ' ) ;
warn Dumper \@trees ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' birch ' , # index 0
> ' pine ' , # old index 0 , now 1
> ' maple ' , # 2
> ' oak ' # 3
> ] ;
2.2.6 foreach ( @array )
Use foreach to iterate through all the elements of a list .
Its formal definition is :
LABEL foreach VAR ( LIST ) BLOCK
This is a control flow structure that is covered in more detail in the " control flow " section .
The foreach structure supports last , next , and redo statements .
Use a simple foreach loop to do something to each element in an array :
my @fruits = qw ( apples oranges lemons pears ) ;
foreach my $ fruit ( @fruits ) {
print " fruit is '$ fruit '
" ;
}
> fruit is ' apples '
> fruit is ' oranges '
> fruit is ' lemons '
> fruit is ' pears '
DO NOT ADD OR DELETE ELEMENTS TO AN ARRAY BEING PROCESSED IN A
FOREACH LOOP .
my @numbers = qw ( zero one two three ) ;
foreach my $ num ( @numbers ) {
shift ( @numbers ) if ( $ num eq ' one ' ) ;
print " num is ' $ num '
" ;
}
> num is ' zero '
> num is ' one '
> num is ' three '
# note : I deleted ' zero ' , but I failed to
# print out ' two ' , which is still part of array .
# BAD !!
VAR acts as an alias to the element of the array itself .
Changes to VAR propagate to changing the array .
my @integers = ( 23 , 142 , 9384 , 83948 ) ;
foreach my $ num ( @integers ) {
$ num +=100 ;
}
print Dumper \@integers ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 123 ,
> 242 ,
> 9484 ,
> 84048
> ] ;
2.2.7 sort( @array )
Use sort ( ) to sort an array alphabetically .
The return value is the sorted version of the array .
The array passed in is left untouched .
my @fruit = qw ( pears apples bananas oranges ) ;
my @sorted_array = sort ( @fruit ) ;
print Dumper \@sorted_array ;
>$ VAR1 = [
> ' apples ' ,
> ' bananas ' ,
> ' oranges ' ,
> ' pears '
> ] ;
Sorting a list of numbers will sort them alphabetically as well , which probably is not what you want .
my @scores = ( 1000 , 13 , 27 , 200 , 76 , 150 ) ;
my @sorted_array = sort ( @scores ) ;
print Dumper \@sorted_array ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 1000 , # 1's
> 13 , # 1's
> 150 , # 1's
> 200 ,
> 27 ,
> 76
> ] ;
The sort ( ) function can also take a code block ( any piece of code between curly braces ) which defines how to perform the sort if given any two elements from the array .
The code block uses two global variables , $ a and $b , and defines how to compare the two entries .
This is how you would sort an array numerically .
my @scores = ( 1000 , 13 , 27 , 200 , 76 , 150 ) ;
my @sorted_array = sort { $a <= > $ b} ( @scores ) ;
print Dumper \@sorted_array ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 13 ,
> 27 ,
> 76 ,
> 150 ,
> 200 ,
> 1000
> ] ;
2.2.8 reverse( @array )
The reverse ( ) function takes a list and returns an array in reverse order .
The last element becomes the first element .
The first element becomes the last element .
my @numbers = reverse ( 1000,13,27,200,76,150 ) ;
print Dumper \@numbers ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 150 ,
> 76 ,
> 200 ,
> 27 ,
> 13 ,
> 1000
> ] ;
2.2.9 splice ( @array )
Use splice ( ) to add or remove elements into or out of any index range of an array .
splice ( ARRAY , OFFSET , LENGTH , LIST ) ;
The elements in ARRAY starting at OFFSET and going for LENGTH indexes will be removed from ARRAY .
Any elements from LIST will be inserted at OFFSET into ARRAY .
my @words = qw ( hello there ) ;
splice ( @words , 1 , 0 , ' out ' ) ;
warn join ( " " , @words ) ;
> hello out there ...
2.2.10 Undefined and Uninitialized Arrays
An array is initialized as having no entries .
Therefore you can test to see if an array is initialized by calling scalar ( ) on it .
This is equivalent to calling defined ( ) on a scalar variable .
If scalar ( ) returns false ( i.e. integer 0 ) , then the array is uninitialized .
If you want to uninitialize an array that contains data , then you do NOT want to assign it undef like you would a scalar .
This would fill the array with one element at index zero with a value of undefined .
my @array = undef ; # WRONG
To clear an array to its original uninitialized state , assign an empty list to it .
This will clear out any entries , and leave you with a completely empty array .
my @array = ( ) ; # RIGHT
2.3 Hashes
Hashes are preceded with a percent sign sigil .
The " % " is a stylized " key / value " pair .
A hash stores a bunch of scalars that are accessed via a string index called a " key "
Perl hashes are ONE - DIMENSIONAL ONLY .
( Do Not Panic . )
There is no order to the elements in a hash .
( Well , there is , but you should not use a hash with an assumption about what order the data will come out . )
You can assign any even number of scalars to a hash .
Perl will extract them in pairs .
The first item will be treated as the key , and the second item will be treated as the value .
When you refer to an entire hash , use the " % " sigil .
my %info = qw ( name John age 42 ) ;
When you look up a key in the hash , the " % " character changes to a " $ " and the key is placed in curly braces .
my %info = qw ( name John age 42 ) ;
my $ data = $ info{name} ;
warn $ data ;
> John ...
The keys of a hash are not pre-declared .
If the key does not exist during an ASSIGNMENT , the key is created and given the assigned value .
my %inventory ;
$ inventory{apples}=42 ;
$ inventory{pears}=17 ;
$ inventory{bananas}=5 ;
print Dumper \%inventory ;
>$ VAR1 = {
> ' bananas ' => 5 ,
> ' apples ' => 42 ,
> ' pears ' => 17
> } ;
If the key does not exist during a FETCH , the key is NOT created , and undef is returned .
my %inventory ;
$ inventory{apples}=42 ;
my $ peaches = $ inventory {peaches} ;
warn " peaches is ' $ peaches ' " ;
print Dumper \%inventory ;
> Use of uninitialized value in concatenation
> peaches is '' at ./test.pl line 13 .
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' apples ' => 42
> } ;
2.3.1 exists ( $ hash {$ key} )
Use exists ( ) to see if a key exists in a hash .
You can not simply test the value of a key , since a key might exist but store a value of FALSE
my %pets = ( cats= > 2 , dogs = > 1 ) ;
unless ( exists ( $ pets{fish} ) ) {
print " No fish here
" ;
}
Warning : during multi- key lookup , all the lower level keys are autovivified , and only the last key has exists ( ) tested on it .
This only happens if you have a hash of hash references .
References are covered later , but this is a " feature " specific to exists ( ) that can lead to very subtle bugs .
Note in the following example , we explicitly create the key " Florida " , but we only test for the existence of { Maine} - > { StateBird} , which has the side effect of creating the key { Maine} in the hash .
my %stateinfo ;
$ stateinfo { Florida} ->{ Abbreviation}='FL ' ;
if ( exists ( $stateinfo {Maine} ->{ StateBird} ) ) {
warn " it exists " ;
}
print Dumper \%stateinfo ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' Florida ' => {
> ' Abbreviation ' => ' FL '
> } ,
> ' Maine ' => {}
> } ;
You must test each level of key individually , and build your way up to the final key lookup if you do not want to autovivify the lower level keys .
my %stateinfo ;
$ stateinfo { Florida} ->{ Abbreviation}='FL ' ;
if ( exists ( $stateinfo { Maine} ) ) {
if ( exists ( $stateinfo { Maine} - >{ StateBird} ) )
{ warn " it exists " ; }
}
print Dumper \%stateinfo ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' Florida ' => {
> ' Abbreviation ' => ' FL '
> }
> } ;
2.3.2 delete ( $ hash{key} )
Use delete to delete a key / value pair from a hash .
Once a key is created in a hash , assigning undef to it will keep the key in the hash and will only assign the value to undef .
The only way to remove a key / value pair from a hash is with delete ( ) .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs= >1 ,
) ;
$ pets{cats}=undef ;
delete ( $ pets{fish} ) ;
print Dumper \%pets ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' cats ' => undef ,
> ' dogs ' => 1
> } ;
2.3.3 keys ( % hash )
Use keys ( ) to return a list of all the keys in a hash .
The order of the keys will be based on the internal hashing algorithm used , and should not be something your program depends upon .
Note in the example below that the order of assignment is different from the order printed out .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs= >1 ,
) ;
foreach my $ pet ( keys ( % pets ) ) {
print " pet is ' $ pet '
" ;
}
> pet is ' cats '
> pet is ' dogs '
> pet is ' fish '
If the hash is very large , then you may wish to use the each ( ) function described below .
2.3.4 values ( % hash )
Use values ( ) to return a list of all the values in a hash .
The order of the values will match the order of the keys return in keys ( ) .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs=>1 ,
) ;
my @pet_keys = keys ( % pets ) ;
my @pet_vals = values ( % pets ) ;
print Dumper \@pet_keys ;
print Dumper \@pet_vals ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' cats ' ,
> ' dogs ' ,
> ' fish '
> ] ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 2 ,
> 1 ,
> 3
> ] ;
If the hash is very large , then you may wish to use the each ( ) function described below .
2.3.5 each ( % hash )
Use each ( ) to iterate through each key / value pair in a hash , one at a time .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs=>1 ,
) ;
while ( my ( $ pet , $qty ) =each ( % pets ) ) {
print " pet= '$ pet ' , qty= ' $qty '
" ;
}
> pet='cats ' , qty ='2 '
> pet='dogs ' , qty='1 '
> pet=' fish ' , qty ='3 '
Every call to each ( ) returns the next key / value pair in the hash .
After the last key / value pair is returned , the next call to each ( ) will return an empty list , which is boolean false .
This is how the while loop is able to loop through each key / value and then exit when done .
Every hash has one " each iterator " attached to it .
This iterator is used by perl to remember where it is in the hash for the next call to each ( ) .
Calling keys ( ) on the hash will reset the iterator .
The list returned by keys ( ) can be discarded .
keys ( %hash ) ;
Do not add keys while iterating a hash with each ( ) .
You can delete keys while iterating a hash with each ( ) .
The each ( ) function does not have to be used inside a while loop .
This example uses a subroutine to call each ( ) once and print out the result .
The subroutine is called multiple times without using a while ( ) loop .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs=>1 ,
) ;
sub one_time {
my ( $ pet , $qty ) =each ( % pets ) ;
# if key is not defined ,
# then each ( ) must have hit end of hash
if ( defined ( $ pet ) ) {
print " pet= '$ pet ' , qty= ' $qty '
" ;
} else {
print " end of hash
" ;
}
}
one_time ; # cats
one_time ; # dogs
keys ( % pets ) ; # reset the hash iterator
one_time ; # cats
one_time ; # dogs
one_time ; # fish
one_time ; # end of hash
one_time ; # cats
one_time ; # dogs
> pet='cats ' , qty ='2 '
> pet='dogs ' , qty='1 '
> pet='cats ' , qty ='2 '
> pet='dogs ' , qty='1 '
> pet=' fish ' , qty ='3 '
> end of hash
> pet='cats ' , qty ='2 '
> pet='dogs ' , qty='1 '
There is only one iterator variable connected with each hash , which means calling each ( ) on a hash in a loop that then calls each ( ) on the same hash another loop will cause problems .
The example below goes through the % pets hash and attempts to compare the quantity of different pets and print out their comparison .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs=>1 ,
) ;
while ( my ( $orig_pet , $orig_qty ) =each ( %pets ) ) {
while ( my ( $ cmp_pet , $cmp_qty ) =each ( %pets ) ) {
if ( $orig_qty > $ cmp_qty ) {
print " there are more $ orig_pet "
. " than $ cmp_pet
" ;
} else {
print " there are less $ orig_pet "
. " than $ cmp_pet
" ;
}
}
}
> there are more cats than dogs
> there are less cats than fish
> there are more cats than dogs
> there are less cats than fish
> there are more cats than dogs
> there are less cats than fish
> there are more cats than dogs
> there are less cats than fish
> ...
The outside loop calls each ( ) and gets " cats " .
The inside loop calls each ( ) and gets " dogs " .
The inside loop continues , calls each ( ) again , and gets " fish " .
The inside loop calls each ( ) one more time and gets an empty list .
The inside loop exits .
The outside loop calls each ( ) which continues where the inside loop left off , namely at the end of the list , and returns " cats " .
The code then enters the inside loop , and the process repeats itself indefinitely .
One solution for this each ( ) limitation is shown below .
The inner loop continues to call each ( ) until it gets the key that matches the outer loop key .
The inner loop must skip the end of the hash ( an undefined key ) and continue the inner loop .
This also fixes a problem in the above example in that we probably do not want to compare a key to itself .
my %pets = (
fish=>3 ,
cats=>2 ,
dogs=>1 ,
) ;
while ( my ( $orig_pet , $orig_qty ) =each ( %pets ) ) {
while ( 1 ) {
my ( $cmp_pet , $cmp_qty ) =each ( % pets ) ;
next unless ( defined ( $cmp_pet ) ) ;
last if ( $cmp_pet eq $ orig_pet ) ;
if ( $orig_qty > $ cmp_qty ) {
print " there are more $ orig_pet "
. " than $ cmp_pet
" ;
} else {
print " there are less $ orig_pet "
. " than $ cmp_pet
" ;
}
}
}
> there are more cats than dogs
> there are less cats than fish
> there are less dogs than fish
> there are less dogs than cats
> there are more fish than cats
> there are more fish than dogs
If you do not know the outer loop key , either because its in someone else 's code and they do not pass it to you , or some similar problem , then the only other solution is to call keys on the hash for all inner loops , store the keys in an array , and loop through the array of keys using foreach .
The inner loop will then not rely on the internal hash iterator value .
2.4 List Context
List context is a concept built into the grammar of perl .
You can not declare a " list context " in perl the way you might declare an @array or %hash .
List context affects how perl executes your source code .
Here is an example .
my @cart1=qw ( milk bread butter ) ;
my @cart2=qw ( eggs bacon juice ) ;
my @checkout_counter = ( @cart1 , @cart2 ) ;
print Dumper \@checkout_counter ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> ' milk ' ,
> ' bread ' ,
> ' butter ' ,
> 'eggs ' ,
> ' bacon ' ,
> ' juice '
> ] ;
Basically , two people with grocery carts , @cart1 and @cart2 , pulled up to the @checkout_counter and unloaded their carts without putting one of those separator bars in between them .
The person behind the @checkout_counter has no idea whose groceries are whose .
Everything in list context gets reduced to an ordered series of scalars .
The original container that held the scalars is forgotten .
In the above example the order of scalars is retained : milk , bread , butter is the order of scalars in @cart1 and the order of the scalars at the beginning of @checkout_counter .
However , looking at just @checkout_counter , there is no way to know where the contents of @cart1 end and the contents of @cart2 begin .
In fact , @cart1 might have been empty , and all the contents of @checkout_counter could belong to @cart2 , but there is no way to know .
Sometimes , list context can be extremely handy .
We have used list context repeatedly to initialize arrays and hashes and it worked as we would intuitively expect :
my %pets = ( fish= > 3 , cats = > 2 , dogs = > 1 ) ;
my @cart1 = qw ( milk bread eggs ) ;
The initial values for the hash get converted into an ordered list of scalars
( ' fish ' , 3 , ' cats ' , 2 , ' dogs ' , 1 )
These scalars are then used in list context to initialize the hash , using the first scalar as a key and the following scalar as its value , and so on throughout the list .
List context applies anytime data is passed around in perl .
Scalars , arrays , and hashes are all affected by list context .
In the example below , @house is intended to contain a list of all the items in the house .
However , because the % pets hash was reduced to scalars in list context , the values 3,2,1 are disassociated from their keys .
The @house variable is not very useful .
my %pets = ( fish= > 3 , cats = > 2 , dogs = > 1 ) ;
my @refrigerator=qw ( milk bread eggs ) ;
my @house= ( ' couch ' , %pets , @refrigerator , 'chair ' ) ;
print Dumper \@house ;
>$ VAR1 = [
> ' couch ' ,
> ' cats ' ,
> 2 ,
> ' dogs ' ,
> 1 ,
> ' fish ' ,
> 3 ,
> ' milk ' ,
> ' bread ' ,
> 'eggs ' ,
> ' chair '
> ] ;
There are times when list context on a hash does make sense .
my %encrypt= ( tank= >' turtle ' , bomber= > ' eagle ' ) ;
my % decrypt=reverse(%encrypt ) ;
print Dumper \%decrypt ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' eagle ' => ' bomber ' ,
> ' turtle ' => ' tank '
> } ;
The %encrypt hash contains a hash look up to encrypt plaintext into cyphertext .
Anytime you want to use the word " bomber " , you actually send the word " eagle " .
The decryption is the opposite .
Anytime you receive the word " eagle " you need to translate that to the word " bomber " .
Using the % encrypt hash to perform decryption would require a loop that called each ( ) on the %encrypt hash , looping until it found the value that matched the word received over the radio .
This could take too long .
Instead , because there is no overlap between keys and values , ( two different words do n't encrypt to the same word ) , we can simply treat the % encrypt hash as a list , call the array reverse ( ) function on it , which flips the list around from end to end , and then store that reversed list into a % decrypt hash .
2.5 References
References are a thing that refer ( point ) to something else .
The " something else " is called the " referent " , the thing being pointed to .
Taking a reference and using it to access the referent is called " dereferencing " .
A good real - world example is a driver 's license .
Your license " points " to where you live because it lists your home address .
Your license is a " reference " .
The " referent " is your home .
And if you have forgotten where you live , you can take your license and " dereferencing " it to get yourself home .
It is possible that you have roommates , which would mean multiple references exist to point to the same home .
But there can only be one home per address .
In perl , references are stored in scalars .
You can create a reference by creating some data ( scalar , array , hash ) and putting a " \ " in front of it .
my %home= (
fish= > 3 , cats=>2, dogs=>1 ,
milk= > 1 , bread= >2,eggs=>12 ,
) ;
my $ license_for_alice = \ %home ;
my $ license_for_bob = \ %home ;
Alice and Bob are roommates and their licenses are references to the same %home .
This means that Alice could bring in a bunch of new pets and Bob could eat the bread out of the refrigerator even though Alice might have been the one to put it there .
To do this , Alice and Bob need to dereference their licenses and get into the original %home hash .
$ {$license_for_alice} {dogs} += 5 ;
delete ( $ { $license_for_bob} { milk} ) ;
print Dumper \ %home ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' eggs ' =>
12 ,
> ' cats ' =>
2 ,
> ' bread ' => 2 ,
> ' dogs ' =>
6 ,
> ' fish ' => 3
> } ;
2.5.1 Named Referents
A referent is any original data structure : a scalar , array , or hash .
Below , we declare some named referents : age , colors , and pets .
my $ age = 42 ;
my @colors = qw ( red green blue ) ;
my %pets=( fish= > 3 , cats= >2,dogs = > 1 ) ;
2.5.2 References to Named Referents
A reference points to the referent .
To take a reference to a named referent , put a " \ " in front of the named referent .
my $ ref_to_age = \$age ;
my $ r_2_colors = \@colors ;
my $r_pets = \%pets ;
2.5.3 Dereferencing
To dereference , place the reference in curly braces and prefix it with the sigil of the appropriate type .
This will give access to the entire original referent .
$ {$ref_to_age} + + ; # happy birthday
pop(@{$r_2_colors} ) ;
my %copy_of_pets = % {$r_pets} ;
print " age is ' $age '
" ;
> age is ' 43 '
If there is no ambiguity in dereferencing , the curly braces are not needed .
$ $ref_to_age ++ ; # another birthday
print " age is ' $age '
" ;
> age is ' 44 '
It is also possible to dereference into an array or hash with a specific index or key .
my @colors = qw ( red green blue ) ;
my %pets=( fish= > 3 , cats= >2,dogs = > 1 ) ;
my $ r_colors = \@colors ; my $ r_pets = \%pets ;
$ {$r_pets} {dogs} += 5 ;
$ {$r_colors } [ 1 ] = ' yellow ' ;
print Dumper \@colors ; print Dumper \%pets ;
> $ VAR1 = [
' red ' ,
' yellow ' , # green turned to yellow
' blue '
] ;
$ VAR1 = {
' cats ' => 2 ,
' dogs ' => 6 , # 5 new dogs
' fish ' => 3
} ;
Because array and hash referents are so common , perl has a shorthand notation for indexing into an array or looking up a key in a hash using a reference .
Take the reference , follow it by " -> " , and then follow that by either " [ index ] " or " {key} " .
This :
$ {$r_pets} {dogs} += 5 ;
$ {$r_colors } [ 1 ] = ' yellow ' ;
is exactly the same as this :
$ r_pets ->{dogs} += 5 ;
$ r_colors - > [ 1 ] = ' yellow ' ;
2.5.4 Anonymous Referents
Here are some referents named age , colors , and pets .
Each named referent has a reference to it as well .
my $ age = 42 ;
my @colors = qw ( red green blue ) ;
my %pets=( fish= > 3 , cats= >2,dogs = > 1 ) ;
my $ r_age = \$age ;
my $ r_colors = \@colors ;
my $r_pets = \%pets ;
It is also possible in perl to create an ANONYMOUS REFERENT .
An anonymous referent has no name for the underlying data structure and can only be accessed through the reference .
To create an anonymous array referent , put the contents of the array in square brackets .
The square brackets will create the underlying array with no name , and return a reference to that unnamed array .
my $ colors_ref = [ ' red ' , ' green ' , ' blue ' ] ;
print Dumper $ colors_ref ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 'red ' ,
> ' green ' ,
> ' blue '
> ] ;
To create an anonymous hash referent , put the contents of the hash in curly braces .
The curly braces will create the underlying hash with no name , and return a reference to that unnamed hash .
my $ pets_ref = { fish= > 3 , cats= >2, dogs = >1 } ;
print Dumper $ pets_ref ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' cats ' =>
2 ,
> ' dogs ' => 1 ,
> ' fish ' => 3
> } ;
Note that $ colors_ref is a reference to an array , but that array has no name to directly access its data .
You must use $ colors_ref to access the data in the array .
Likewise , $ pets_ref is a reference to a hash , but that hash has no name to directly access its data .
You must use $ pets_ref to access the data in the hash .
2.5.5 Complex Data Structures
Arrays and hashes can only store scalar values .
But because scalars can hold references , complex data structures are now possible .
Using references is one way to avoid the problems associated with list context .
Here is another look at the house example , but now using references .
my %pets = ( fish= > 3 , cats = > 2 , dogs = > 1 ) ;
my @refrigerator=qw ( milk bread eggs ) ;
my $ house= {
pets= >\%pets ,
refrigerator=>\@refrigerator
} ;
print Dumper $ house ;
> $ VAR1 = {
> ' pets ' => {
> ' cats ' =>
2 ,
> ' dogs ' => 1 ,
> ' fish ' => 3
> } ,
> ' refrigerator ' => [
> ' milk ' ,
> ' bread ' ,
> 'eggs '
> ]
> } ;
The $ house variable is a reference to an anonymous hash , which contains two keys , " pets " and " refrigerator " .
These keys are associated with values that are references as well , one a hash reference and the other an array reference .
Dereferencing a complex data structure can be done with the arrow notation or by enclosing the reference in curly braces and prefixing it with the appropriate sigil .
# Alice added more canines
$ house ->{pets}->{dogs}+=5 ;
# Bob drank all the milk
shift ( @{$house ->{refrigerator}} ) ;
2.5.5.1 Autovivification
Perl autovivifies any structure needed when assigning or fetching from a reference .
The autovivified referents are anonymous .
Perl will assume you know what you are doing with your structures .
In the example below , we start out with an undefined scalar called $ scal .
We then fetch from this undefined scalar , as if it were a reference to an array of a hash of an array of a hash of an array .
Perl autovivifies everything under the assumption that that is what you wanted to do .
my $ scal ;
my $val =
$ scal - >[ 2 ]->{ somekey} ->[ 1 ]->{otherkey} ->[ 1 ] ;
print Dumper $ scal ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> undef ,
> $ { \$ VAR1 ->[ 0 ] } ,
> {
> ' somekey ' => [
> $ { \$ VAR1 ->[ 0 ] } ,
> {
> ' otherkey ' => [ ]
> }
> ]
> }
> ] ;
If this is NOT what you want to do , check for the existence of each hash key and check that the array contains at least enough array entries to handle the given index .
2.5.5.2 Multidimensional Arrays
Perl implements multidimensional arrays using one - dimensional arrays and references .
my $ mda ;
for ( my $ i=0 ; $ i < 2 ; $i++ ) {
for ( my $ j=0 ; $ j < 2 ; $ j++ ) {
for ( my $ k=0 ; $ k < 2 ; $ k++ ) {
$ mda - > [ $ i ] ->[ $j ] ->[ $ k ] =
" row=$i , col=$j , depth=$k " ;
}
}
}
print Dumper $ mda ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> [
> [
> ' row=0 , col=0 , depth=0 ' ,
> ' row=0 , col=0 , depth=1 '
> ] ,
> [
> ' row=0 , col=1 , depth=0 ' ,
> ' row=0 , col=1 , depth=1 '
> ]
> ] ,
> [
> [
> ' row=1 , col=0 , depth=0 ' ,
> ' row=1 , col=0 , depth=1 '
> ] ,
> [
> ' row=1 , col=1 , depth=0 ' ,
> ' row=1 , col=1 , depth=1 '
> ]
> ]
> ] ;
2.5.5.3 Deep Cloning , Deep Copy
If you need to create an entirely separate but identical clone of a complex data structure , use the Storable . pm perl module .
Storable comes standard with perl 5.8 .
If you do n't have 5.8 installed , consider an upgrade .
Otherwise , read the section about CPAN later in this document , download Storable from CPAN , and install .
Then use Storable in your perl code , indicating you want to import the ' nstore ' , ' dclone ' , and ' retrieve ' subroutines .
The 'use ' statement is explained later in this document as well , for now , it is n't that important .
The ' dclone ' subroutine takes a reference to any kind of data structure and returns a reference to a deep cloned version of that data structure .
use Storable qw( nstore dclone retrieve ) ;
my $ scal ;
$ scal - >[ 2 ]->{ somekey} ->[ 1 ]->{otherkey} ->[ 1 ] ;
# $ twin is an identical clone of $ scal
my $ twin = dclone $ scal ;
2.5.5.4 Data Persistence
The Storable .pm module also contains two subroutines for storing the contents of any perl data structure to a file and retrieving it later .
use Storable qw( nstore dclone retrieve ) ;
my $ scal ;
$ scal - >[ 2 ]->{ somekey} ->[ 1 ]->{otherkey} ->[ 1 ] ;
nstore ( $ scal , ' filename ' ) ;
# exit , reboot computer , and restart script
my $ revived = retrieve ( ' filename ' ) ;
2.5.6 Stringification of References
Perl will stringify a reference if you try to do anything string - like with it , such as print it .
my $ referent = 42 ;
my $ reference = \$referent ;
warn " reference is ' $ reference ' " ;
> reference is ' SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) ' ...
But perl will not allow you to create a string and attempt to turn it into a reference .
my $ reference = ' SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) ' ;
my $ value = $ $reference ;
> Ca n't use string ( " SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) " ) as
> a SCALAR ref while " strict refs " in use
Turning strict off only gives you undef .
no strict ;
my $ reference = ' SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) ' ;
my $ value = $ $reference ;
warn " value not defined " unless ( defined ( $ value ) ) ;
warn " value is ' $ value '
" ;
> value not defined
> Use of uninitialized value in concatenation
Because a reference is always a string that looks something like " SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) " , it will evaluate true when treated as a boolean , even if the value to which it points is false .
2.5.7 The ref ( ) function
The ref ( ) function takes a scalar and returns a string indicating what kind of referent the scalar is referencing .
If the scalar is not a reference , ref ( ) returns false ( an empty string ) .
my $ temp = \ 42 ;
my $ string = ref( $temp ) ;
warn " string is ' $ string ' " ;
> string is ' SCALAR '
Here we call ref ( ) on several types of variable :
sub what_is_it {
my ( $ scalar ) =@_ ;
my $ string = ref( $scalar ) ;
print " string is ' $ string '
" ;
}
what_is_it( \' hello ' ) ;
what_is_it( [ 1,2,3 ] ) ;
what_is_it( {cats =>2} ) ;
what_is_it( 42 ) ;
> string is ' SCALAR '
> string is ' ARRAY '
> string is ' HASH '
> string is ''
Note that this is like stringification of a reference except without the address being part of the string .
Instead of SCALAR ( 0x812e6ec ) , its just SCALAR .
Also note that if you stringify a non-reference , you get the scalar value .
But if you call ref ( ) on a nonreference , you get an empty string , which is always false .
3 Control Flow
Standard statements get executed in sequential order in perl .
my $ name = ' John Smith ' ;
my $ greeting = " Hello , $ name
" ;
print $ greeting ;
Control flow statements allow you to alter the order of execution while the program is running .
if ( $ price == 0 ) {
print " Free Beer !
" ;
}
Perl supports the following control flow structures :
##
LABEL is an optional name that identifies the
# control flow structure .
# It is a bareword identifier followed by a colon .
# example== > MY_NAME :
##
SINGLE_STATEMENT
== > a single perl statement
# NOT including the semicolon .
# print " hello
"
##
BLOCK == > zero or more statements contained
# in curly braces { print " hi " ; }
LABEL BLOCK
LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK
# BOOL == > boolean ( see boolean section above )
SINGLE_STATEMENT if ( BOOL ) ;
if ( BOOL ) BLOCK
if ( BOOL ) BLOCK else BLOCK
if ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( ) ...
if ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( BOOL ) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
unless ( BOOL ) BLOCK
unless ( BOOL ) BLOCK else BLOCK
unless ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( ) ...
unless ( BOOL ) BLOCK elsif ( BOOL ) BLOCK ... else
BLOCK
LABEL while ( BOOL ) BLOCK
LABEL while ( BOOL ) BLOCK continue BLOCK
LABEL until ( BOOL ) BLOCK
LABEL until ( BOOL ) BLOCK continue BLOCK
# INIT , TEST , CONT are all expressions
# INIT is an initialization expression
# INIT is evaluated once prior to loop entry
# TEST is BOOLEAN expression that controls loop exit
# TEST is evaluated each time after
# BLOCK is executed
# CONT is a continuation expression
# CONT is evaluated each time TEST is evaluated TRUE
LABEL for ( INIT ; TEST ; CONT ) BLOCK
# LIST is a list of scalars , see arrays and
# list context sections later in text
LABEL foreach ( LIST ) BLOCK
LABEL foreach VAR ( LIST ) BLOCK
LABEL foreach VAR ( LIST ) BLOCK continue BLOCK
3.1 Labels
Labels are always optional .
A label is an identifier followed by a colon .
A label is used to give its associated control flow structure a name .
Inside a BLOCK of a control flow structure , you can call
next ;
last ;
redo ;
If the structure has a LABEL , you can call
next LABEL ;
last LABEL ;
redo LABEL ;
If no label is given to next , last , or redo , then the command will operate on the inner-most control structure .
If a label is given , then the command will operate on the control structure given .
3.2 last LABEL ;
The last command goes to the end of the entire control structure .
It does not execute any continue block if one exists .
3.3 next LABEL ;
The next command skips the remaining BLOCK .
if there is a continue block , execution resumes there .
After the continue block finishes , or if no continue block exists , execution starts the next iteration of the control construct if it is a loop construct .
3.4 redo LABEL ;
The redo command skips the remaining BLOCK .
It does not execute any continue block ( even if it exists ) .
Execution then resumes at the start of the control structure without evaluating the conditional again .
4 Packages and Namespaces and Lexical Scoping
4.1 Package Declaration
Perl has a package declaration statement that looks like this :
package NAMESPACE ;
This package declaration indicates that the rest of the enclosing block , subroutine , eval , or file belongs to the namespace given by NAMESPACE .
The standard warnings , strictness , and Data : : Dumper are attached to the namespace in which they were turned on with " use warnings ; " etc .
Anytime you declare a new package namespace , you will want to " use " these again .
package SomeOtherPackage ;
use warnings ; use strict ; use Data : : Dumper ;
All perl scripts start with an implied declaration of :
package main ;
You can access package variables with the appropriate sigil , followed by the package name , followed by a double colon , followed by the variable name .
This is called a package QUALIFIED variable meaning the package name is explicitly stated .
$ package_this : : age ;
@other_package::refrigerator ;
% package_that :: pets ;
If you use an UNQUALIFIED variable in your code , perl assumes it is in the the most recently declared package namespace that was declared .
When you have strict - ness turned on , there are two ways to create and use package variables :
1 ) Use the fully package qualified name everywhere in your code :
# can use variable without declaring it with 'my '
$ some_package ::answer=42 ;
warn
" The value is ' $ some_package : : answer '
" ;
4.2 Declaring Package Variables
With our
2) Use " our " to declare the variable .
package this _package ;
our $ name = ' John ' ;
warn " name is ' $ name ' " ;
Using " our " is the preferred method .
You must have perl 5.6.0 or later for " our " declarations .
The difference between the two methods is that always using package qualified variable names means you do NOT have to declare the package you are in .
You can create variables in ANY namespace you want , without ever having to declare the namespace explicitly .
You can even declare variables in someone else 's package namespace .
There is no restrictions in perl that prevent you from doing this .
To encourage programmers to play nice with each other 's namespaces , the " our " function was created .
Declaring a variable with " our " will create the variable in the current namespace .
If the namespace is other than " main " , then you will need to declare the package namespace explicitly .
However , once a package variable is declared with " our " , the fully package qualified name is NOT required , and you can refer to the variable just on its variable name , as example ( 2 ) above refers to the $ name package variable .
We do not HAVE to use the " our " shortcut even if we used it to declare it .
The " our " declaration is a shorthand for declaring a package variable .
Once the package variable exists , we can access it any way we wish .
package Hogs ;
our $ speak = ' oink ' ;
warn " Hogs : : speak is ' $ Hogs : : speak ' " ;
> Hogs :: speak is ' oink ' ...
4.3 Package Variables inside a Lexical Scope
When you declare a package inside a code block , that package namespace declaration remains in effect until the end of the block , at which time , the package namespace reverts to the previous namespace .
package Hogs ;
our $ speak = ' oink ' ;
{ # START OF CODE BLOCK
package Heifers ;
our $ speak = ' moo ' ;
} # END OF CODE BLOCK
warn " speak is ' $ speak ' " ;
> speak is ' oink ' ...
The Heifers namespace still exists , as does all the variables that were declared in that namespace .
Its just that outside the code block , the " our Heifers ; " declaration has worn off , and we now have to use a fully package qualified name to get to the variables in Heifers package .
This " wearing off " is a function of the code block being a " lexical scope " and a package declaration only lasts to the end of the current lexical scope .
The package variables declared inside the code block " survive " after the code block ends .
{
package Heifers ;
our $ speak = ' moo ' ;
}
print " Heifers : : speak is '$ Heifers : : speak '
" ;
> Heifers : : speak is ' moo '
4.4 Lexical Scope
Lexical refers to words or text .
A lexical scope exists while execution takes place inside of a particular chunk of source code .
In the above examples , the " package Heifers ; " only exists inside the curly braces of the source code .
Outside those curly braces , the package declaration has gone out of scope , which is a technical way of saying its " worn off " .
Scope refers to vision , as in telescope .
Within a lexical scope , things that have lexical limitations ( such as a package declaration ) are only " visible " inside that lexical space .
So " lexical scope " refers to anything that is visible or has an effect only withing a certain boundary of the source text or source code .
The easiest way to demonstrate lexical scoping is lexical variables , and to show how lexical variables differ from " our " variables .
4.5 Lexical Variables
Lexical variables are declared with the â€œmyâ€ keyword .
Lexical variables declared inside a lexical scope do not survive outside the lexical scope .
no warnings ;
no strict ;
{
my $ speak = ' moo ' ;
}
warn " speak is ' $ speak '
" ;
> speak is ''
The lexical variable " $ speak " goes out of scope at the end of the code block ( at the " } " character ) , so it does not exist when we try to print it out after the block .
We had to turn warnings and strict off just to get it to compile because with warnings and strict on , perl will know $ speak does not exist when you attempt to print it , so it will throw an exception and quit .
Lexically scoped variables have three main features :
1 ) Lexical variables do not belong to any package namespace , so you cannot prefix them with a package name .
The example below shows that â€œmy $ cntâ€ is not the same as the â€œmain : : cntâ€ :
no warnings ;
package main ;
my $ cnt = ' I am just a lexical ' ;
warn " main : : cnt is ' $ main : : cnt ' " ;
> main :: cnt is ''
2 ) Lexical variables are only directly accessible from the point where they are declared to the end of the nearest enclosing block , subroutine , eval , or file .
no strict ;
{
my $ some_lex = ' I am lex ' ;
}
warn " some_lex is ' $ some_lex ' " ;
> some_lex is ''
3 ) Lexical variables are subject to " garbage collection " at the end of scope .
If nothing is using a lexical variable at the end of scope , perl will remove it from its memory .
Every time a variable is declared with " my " , it is created dynamically , during execution .
The location of the variable will change each time .
Note in the example below , we create a new $ lex_var each time through the loop , and $ lex_var is at a different address each time .
my @cupboard ;
for ( 1 .. 5 ) {
my $ lex_var =' canned goods ' ;
my $ lex_ref = \$lex_var ;
push ( @cupboard , $ lex_ref ) ;
print " $ lex_ref
" ;
}
> SCALAR ( 0x812e770 )
> SCALAR ( 0x812e6c8 )
> SCALAR ( 0x812e6e0 )
> SCALAR ( 0x81624c8 )
> SCALAR ( 0x814cf64 )
Lexical variables are just plain good .
They generally keep you from stepping on someone else 's toes .
They also keep your data more private than a package variable .
Package variables are permanent , never go out of scope , never get garbage collected , and are accessible from anyone 's script .
4.6 Garbage Collection
When a lexical variable goes out of scope , perl will check to see if anyone is using that variable , and if no one is using it , perl will delete that variable and free up memory .
The freed up memory is not returned to the system , rather the freed up memory is used for possible declarations of new lexically scoped variables that could be declared later in the program .
This means that your program will never get smaller because of lexical variables going of of scope .
Once the memory is allocated for perl , it remains under perl 's jurisdiction .
But perl can use garbage collected space for other lexical variables .
If a lexical variable is a referent of another variable , then the lexical will not be garbage collected when it goes out of scope .
no strict ;
my $ referring_var ;
{
my $ some_lex = ' I am lex ' ;
$ referring_var= \$some_lex ;
}
warn " some_lex is ' $ some_lex ' " ;
warn " referring var refers to ' $ $ referring_var ' " ;
> some_lex is ''
> referring var refers to ' I am lex '
When the lexical $ some_lex went out of scope , we could no longer access it directly .
But since $ referring_var is a reference to $ some_lex , then $ some_lex was never garbage collected , and it retained its value of " I am lex " .
The data in $ some_lex was still accessible through referring_var .
Note that the named variable $ some_lex went out of scope at the end of the code block and could not be accessed by name .
4.6.1 Reference Count Garbage Collection
Perl uses reference count based garbage collection .
It is rudimentary reference counting , so circular references will not get collected even if nothing points to the circle .
The example below shows two variables that refer to each other but nothing refers to the two variables .
Perl will not garbage collect these variables even though they are completely inaccessible by the end of the code block .
{
my ( $ first , $last ) ;
( $ first , $last ) =( \$ last , \$ first ) ;
}
4.6.2 Garbage Collection and Subroutines
Garbage collection does not rely strictly on references to a variable to determine if it should be garbage collected .
If a subroutine uses a lexical variable , then that variable will not be garbage collected as long as the subroutine exists .
Subroutines that use a lexical variable declared outside of the subroutine declaration are called " CLOSURES " .
In the example below , the lexical variable , $ cnt , is declared inside a code block and would normally get garbage collected at the end of the block .
However , two subroutines are declared in that same code block that use $ cnt , so $ cnt is not garbage collected .
Since $ cnt goes out of scope , the only things that can access it after the code block are the subroutines .
Note that a reference to $ cnt is never taken , however perl knows that $ cnt is needed by the subroutines and therefore keeps it around .
The inc and dec subroutines are subroutine closures .
{
my $ cnt=0 ;
sub inc{$cnt ++ ; print " cnt is ' $ cnt '
" ;}
sub dec{$cnt --; print " cnt is ' $ cnt '
" ;}
}
inc ;
inc ;
inc ;
dec ;
dec ;
inc ;
> cnt is ' 1 '
> cnt is ' 2 '
> cnt is ' 3 '
> cnt is ' 2 '
> cnt is ' 1 '
> cnt is ' 2 '
Subroutine names are like names of package variables .
The subroutine gets placed in the current declared package namespace .
Therefore , named subroutines are like package variables in that , once declared , they never go out of scope or get garbage collected .
4.7 Package Variables Revisited
Package variables are not evil , they are just global variables , and they inherit all the possible problems associated with using global variables in your code .
In the event you DO end up using a package variable in your code , they do have some advantages .
They are global , which means they can be a convenient way for several different blocks of perl code to talk amongst themselves using an agreed upon global variable as their channel .
Imagine several subroutines across several files that all want to check a global variable : $ Development : : Verbose .
If this variable is true , these subroutines print detailed information .
If it is false , these subroutines print little or no information .
package Development ;
our $ Verbose=1 ;
sub Compile {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " compiling
" ; }
}
sub Link {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " linking
" ;
}
}
sub Run {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " running
" ;
}
}
Compile ;
Link ;
Run ;
> compiling
> linking
> running
The three subroutines could be in different files , in different package namespaces , and they could all access the $ Development : : Verbose variable and act accordingly .
4.8 Calling local( ) on Package Variables
When working with global variables , there are times when you want to save the current value of the global variable , set it to a new and temporary value , execute some foreign code that will access this global , and then set the global back to what it was .
Continuing the previous example , say we wish to create a RunSilent subroutine that stores $ Development : : Verbose in a temp variable , calls the original Run routine , and then sets $ Development : : Verbose back to its original value .
package Development ;
our $ Verbose=1 ;
sub Compile {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " compiling
" ;
}
}
sub Link {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " linking
" ;
}
}
sub Run {
if ( $ Development : : Verbose ) {
print " running
" ;
}
}
sub RunSilent {
my $ temp = $ Development : : Verbose ;
$ Development : : Verbose=0 ;
Run ;
$ Development : : Verbose=$temp ;
}
Compile ;
Link ;
RunSilent ;
> compiling
> linking
This can also be accomplished with the " local ( ) " function .
The local function takes a package variable , saves off the original value , allows you to assign a temp value to it .
That new value is seen by anyone accessing the variable .
And at the end of the lexical scope in which local ( ) was called , the original value for the variable is returned .
The RunSilent subroutine could be written like this :
sub RunSilent {
local ( $ Development :: Verbose ) =0 ;
Run ;
}
Perl originally started with nothing but package variables .
The " my " lexical variables were not introduced until perl version 4 .
So to deal with all the package variables , perl was given the local ( ) function .
Local is also a good way to create a temporary variable and make sure you do n't step on someone else 's variable of the same name .
5 Subroutines
Perl allows you to declare named subroutines and anonymous subroutines , similar to the way you can declare named variables and anonymous variables .
5.1 Subroutine Sigil
Subroutines use the ampersand ( & ) as their sigil .
But while the sigils for scalars , arrays , and hashes are mandatory , the sigil for subroutines is optional .
5.2 Named Subroutines
Below is the named subroutine declaration syntax :
sub NAME BLOCK
NAME can be any valid perl identifier .
BLOCK is a code block enclosed in parenthesis .
The NAME of the subroutine is placed in the current package namespace , in the same way " our " variables go into the current package namespace .
So once a named subroutine is declared , you may access it with just NAME if you are in the correct package , or with a fully package qualified name if you are outside the package .
And you can use the optional ampersand sigil in either case .
package MyArea ;
sub Ping {print " ping
" ;}
Ping ;
& Ping ;
MyArea :: Ping ;
& MyArea : : Ping ;
> ping
> ping
> ping
> ping
Once the current package declaration changes , you MUST use a fully package qualified subroutine name to call the subroutine .
package MyArea ;
sub Ping {print " ping
" ;}
package YourArea ;
MyArea :: Ping ;
& MyArea : : Ping ;
& Ping ; # error , looking in current package YourArea
> ping
> ping
> Undefined subroutine & YourArea :: Ping
5.3 Anonymous Subroutines
Below is the anonymous subroutine declaration syntax :
sub BLOCK
This will return a code reference , similar to how [ ] returns an array reference , and similar to how {} returns a hash reference .
sub what_is_it {
my ( $ scalar ) =@_ ;
my $ string = ref( $scalar ) ;
print " ref returned ' $ string '
" ;
}
my $ temp = sub {print " Hello
" ;} ;
what_is_it( $temp ) ;
> ref returned ' CODE '
5.4 Data :: Dumper and subroutines
The contents of the code block are invisible to anything outside the code block .
For this reason , things like Data : : Dumper cannot look inside the code block and show you the actual code .
Instead Data :: Dumper does not even try and just gives you a place holder that returns a dummy string .
my $ temp = sub {print " Hello
" ;} ;
print Dumper $ temp ;
> $ VAR1 = sub { " DUMMY " } ;
5.5 Passing Arguments to / from a Subroutine
Any values you want to pass to a subroutine get put in the parenthesis at the subroutine call .
For normal subroutines , all arguments go through the list context crushing machine and get reduced to a list of scalars .
The original containers are not known inside the subroutine .
The subroutine will not know if the list of scalars it receives came from scalars , arrays , or hashes .
To avoid some of the list context crushing , a subroutine can be declared with a prototype , which are discussed later .
5.6 Accessing Arguments inside Subroutines via @_
Inside the subroutine , the arguments are accessed via a special array called @_ , since all the arguments passed in were reduced to list context , these arguments fit nicely into an array .
The @_ array can be processed just like any other regular array .
If the arguments are fixed and known , the preferred way to extract them is to assign @_ to a list of scalars with meaningful names .
sub compare {
my ( $ left , $right ) =@_ ;
return $ left <= > $ right ;
}
The @_ array is " magical " in that it is really a list of aliases for the original arguments passed in .
Therefore , assigning a value to an element in @_ will change the value in the original variable that was passed into the subroutine call .
Subroutine parameters are effectively IN / OUT .
sub swap { ( @_ ) = reverse ( @_ ) ; }
my $ one = " I am one " ;
my $ two = " I am two " ;
swap ( $ one , $two ) ;
warn " one is ' $ one ' " ;
warn " two is ' $ two ' " ;
> one is ' I am two '
> two is ' I am one '
Assigning to the entire @_ array does not work , you have to assign to the individual elements .
If swap were defined like this , the variables $ one and $ two would remain unchanged .
sub swap {
my ( $ left , $right ) =@_ ;
@_ = ( $ right , $left ) ; #WRONG
}
5.7 Dereferencing Code References
Dereferencing a code reference causes the subroutine to be called .
A code reference can be dereferenced by preceding it with an ampersand sigil or by using the arrow operator and parenthesis " - > ( ) " .
The preferred way is to use the arrow operator with parens .
my $ temp = sub {print " Hello
" ;} ;
&{$temp} ;
&$temp ;
$ temp - > ( ) ; # preferred
> Hello
> Hello
> Hello
5.8 Implied Arguments
When calling a subroutine with the " & " sigil prefix and no parenthesis , the current @_ array gets implicitly passed to the subroutine being called .
This can cause subtly odd behavior if you are not expecting it .
sub second_level {
print Dumper \@_ ;
}
sub first_level {
# using '& ' sigil and no parens .
# does n't look like I 'm passing any params
# but perl will pass @_ implicitly .
& second_level ;
}
first_level ( 1,2,3 ) ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 1 ,
> 2 ,
> 3
> ] ;
This generally is not a problem with named subroutines because you probably will not use the " & " sigil .
However , when using code references , dereferencing using the " & " may cause implied arguments to be passed to the new subroutine .
For this reason , the arrow operator is the preferred way to dereference a code reference .
$ code_ref - > ( ) ; # pass nothing , no implicit @_
$ code_ref - >( @_ ) ; # explicitly pass @_
$ code_ref - > ( ' one ' , ' two ' ) ; # pass new parameters
5.9 Subroutine Return Value
Subroutines can return a single value or a list of values .
The return value can be explicit , or it can be implied to be the last statement of the subroutine .
An explicit return statement is the preferred approach if any return value is desired .
# return a single scalar
sub ret_scal {
return " boo " ;
}
my $ scal_var = ret_scal ;
print Dumper \$scal_var ;
# return a list of values
sub ret_arr {
return ( 1,2,3 ) ;
}
my @arr_var =ret_arr ;
print Dumper \@arr_var ;
> $ VAR1 = \'boo ' ;
> $ VAR1 = [
> 1 ,
> 2 ,
> 3
> ] ;
5.10 Returning False
The return value of a subroutine is often used within a boolean test .
The problem is that the subroutine needs to know if it is called in scalar context
Here ’s some palace intrigue from the White House — well , from across the pond , technically , via the U.K. ’s Daily Telegraph : Chief of staff Rahm “ Rahmbo ” Emanuel might be preparing to leave his post after this fall ’s midterm elections .
— KA
The Daily Telegraph :
Washington insiders say he will quit within six to eight months in frustration at [ the president ’s inner circle ’s ] unwillingness to “ bang heads together ” to get policy pushed through .
Mr Emanuel , 50 , enjoys a good working relationship with Mr Obama but they are understood to have reached an understanding that differences over style mean he will serve only half the full four - year term .
Friends say he is also worried about burnout and losing touch with his young family due to the pressure of one of most high profile jobs in US politics .
“ I would bet he will go after the midterms , ” said a leading Democratic consultant in Washington .

The ancient Greeks were obsessed with sculpting the perfect male form .
But when their civilization died out , bodybuilding died with it .
It took a Prussian strongman named Eugen Sandow to bring it back .
During the Victorian era , a bulging waistline was a sign of a bulging wallet , and fashion - conscious men were n't embarrassed to carry around some excess pounds .
Even strongmen — who dazzled circus - goers by lifting enormous weights and large animals — were big - bellied .
But all of that changed with Eugen Sandow .
Sandow did more than simply shock and titillate audiences with his tiny waist and ripped muscles ; he pioneered the notion of working out for the sake of aesthetics .
He also launched the sport of competitive bodybuilding and inspired the concept of personal fitness .
Today , that 's a multibillion - dollar industry in the United States alone .
Cut Like a Statue
Sandow liked to tell his fans that he started perfecting his body at the age of 10 , after his father took him to Italy to see the statues of the gods .
The sculpted abdomens and chiseled biceps inspired him , and when he returned home , he became obsessed with developing his muscles .
Of course , none of this is true .
A master of creating his own legend , Sandow 's biography tends to be a patchwork of great marketing and tall tales .
What 's known for certain is that he was a Prussian acrobat who toured with small - time circuses across Europe during the 1880s , until he landed in Brussels without a penny to his name .
There , he stumbled across an educator in the nascent world of physical fitness named Louis Durlacher , better known as Professor Attila .
At the time , it was thought that lifting more than 5 lbs .
at once could cause muscles to cramp and lock , eventually leading to paralysis .
Attila , however , decided to buck popular opinion .
A former strongman himself , he 'd developed a system of progressive weight training in which muscles are strengthened by gradually increasing the weight lifted over time .
Today , it 's the cornerstone of bodybuilding .
When Attila met Sandow , he knew he'd found the perfect specimen to test his system .
In 1889 , the pair moved to London to secure a strongman show for Sandow .
In order to grab people 's attention , they set their sights on the city 's reigning brawny duo , Sampson and Cyclops .
Sampson was known for lifting " imperial tons "  ( 2,240 lbs. ) , Cyclops for tearing coins in half .
Sandow began by challenging Cyclops to a feat of strength .
On the night of their competition , he walked out in a foppish , tailored suit .
Once at center stage , he tore off the outfit in one pull , revealing only Roman sandals , a pair of tights , and a physique the likes of which no one in the audience had seen before .
The crowd went wild and quickly took the side of the handsome , mysterious challenger .
Sandow soundly defeated Cyclops in a series of barbell lifts .
One week later , Sandow returned to the stage to face Sampson and matched him stunt for stunt .
Then came the final challenge — chain - breaking , in which both contestants had to break free only by flexing their muscles .
Sampson had never been defeated in this competition , but then again , he 'd always cheated ; his chains were rigged to fall apart .
Sandow had discovered Sampson 's trick weeks earlier and tracked down the blacksmith , who made him a set of his own fake chains .
On the night of the contest , the chains burst off Sandow 's body in record time , and Sampson stormed off stage .
London had a new king of strength .
Touch My Muscles
Throughout the 1890s , Sandow headlined a strongman show that brought in the masses .
But audiences were n't lining up just to see how much Sandow could lift ; they were also intrigued by his body .
Taking a cue from the ancient statues he loved , Sandow augmented his performance with a series of classical poses that highlighted his perfectly proportioned form .
Men cheered , and women swooned .
Today , his poses are the basis of modern bodybuilding competitions .
Public displays were only half the secret of Sandow 's success .
To promote his show , Sandow had himself photographed wearing nothing but a well - placed fig leaf .
As the images spread across Europe , the crowds grew .
Sandow also supplemented his income with private exhibitions , where patrons paid an extra fee after the show to touch his muscles while he described them in detail .
Smelling salts were kept on hand to rouse the women who fainted .
When the show moved to New York in 1893 , it caught the attention of a young Florenz Ziegfeld , Jr. , later known for his Ziegfeld Follies theater shows .
Ziegfeld decided to produce a massive show with Sandow as headliner , and together they crisscrossed the country multiple times .
Along the way , Sandow became a notorious womanizer .
Ziegfeld , who did n't believe in bad publicity , let word of Sandow 's escapades fly .
He even spread a rumor that the muscleman was tomcatting about with sexpot actress Lillian Russell , which caused a major stir in gossip columns .
Pumping Up
By the turn of the century , Sandow 's name had become synonymous with strength , good looks , and fortune .
Phrases like " strong as a Sandow "  were commonly used around the world , and he was quick to capitalize on the name recognition .
One of the first celebrities to endorse sporting goods , Sandow's " combined developer " — a chest expander with dumbbell handles — was so ubiquitous that , today , any type of rubber cord is known in French as un sandow .
In 1901 , the muscleman expanded his business by hosting The Great Competition , the first modern contest in which participants were evaluated solely on the appearance of their bodies .
Sandow asked his friend Arthur Conan Doyle , author of the popular Sherlock Holmes stories , to judge the event .
But Sandow 's contributions to bodybuilding and personal fitness did n't end there .
He also wrote some of the first major books on weight training and established dozens of gyms around England .
By the outbreak of World War I , Sandow had all but retired from the stage .
A new wave of American and European strongmen had emerged , inspired by his success .
From then on , Sandow focused exclusively on his role as a businessman and innovator .
And though he was far from a feminist , he promoted weight training for women , which set him apart from his peers .
He also promoted exercise as a way to improve people 's health , claiming that his workouts could cure conditions such as gout .
Although many of his ideas turned out to be untrue , Sandow was instrumental in providing a link between exercise and health .
In an era predating professional sports leagues , Eugen Sandow was arguably the most famous athlete in the world .
While his name is rarely heard these days , his legacy still exists in training gyms , muscle magazines , vitamin shops , and sporting - goods stores across the globe .
The idea that humans can do something to combat nature 's design for their bodies was once a laughable concept .
Today , it 's the foundation of a multibillion - dollar industry .
Perhaps most fittingly , Sandow lives on in one other way ; he 's now the sculpture he always wanted to become .
At the Mr. Olympia Competition each year , the award handed to the winner is a gilded statuette of Eugen Sandow .

EXCLUSIVE : When Modern Family star Ed O’Neill submits himself this week for Emmy Awards consideration , he will do it in the Supporting Actor category , despite being the biggest name star on the hit ABC sitcom .
Insiders said that O’Neill ’s move will be emulated by all of the principal cast members .
While this might cost the show some trophies , sources said O’Neill is making the surprising move because he felt that nobody is bigger than anybody else in a show that is evolving into a true ensemble hit .
When shows start out anchored by stars like O’Neill and then evolve into ensembles , egos often get bruised — remember when Rob Lowe left The West Wing ?
In a final note on Modern Family , I am also hearing that the entire principal cast will be brought to New York next month for ABC ’s upfront presentation , the only cast making the trip for the network .
What about human resources in the workplace and where does the American worker stand in this nation now ?
Is anyone even tracking the deregulation death toll ?
As another Sundays passes and the media is still all about BP , Michael Conrad posted A Matter of Life and Death at Progressive Blue .
So far 50 people have seen this two day old video on YouTube that covers oil refinery deaths in 2009 and this year .
Can you watch it ?
Because 19 oil and refinery workers have died during April and May of this year unions are demanding action to elevate worker 's lives over profit but is anyone even noticing ?
Capitol Hill ’s own gourmet hot dog purveyor Po Dog announced today that they will establish a second location at 4736 University Way NE , taking over the space formerly occupied by Sunney ’s Cafe .
This second location will be in business mid-April .
Here are the details from the press release :
Po Dog , a gourmet - chic wiener eatery known for unique creations and fresh toppings , announced plans to open a second location today .
The Seattle based restaurant will now have a home in the University District ( 4736 University Way NE ) .
Laura Olson , 26 , founder of Po Dog on Capitol Hill announced today plans to open the second location .
Po Dog is a unique Gourmet Hot Dog restaurant known for their over the top creations .
These include a deep fried wasabi egg - roll dog , a homemade macaroni & Cheese dog and the deep fried danger dog ( a hot dog wrapped in pepper bacon , deep fried , covered in chili sauce and sauteed onions ) .
All offerings available in 100 % all beef , Field Roast Veggie , or a rotating selection of locally made sausages .
The new location will open mid-April on “ the Ave ” in the University District .
Po Dog will carve out a 635 sqft space adjacent to Rudy ’s barbershop .

Beneath the sheep be lithium
NYT story via Michael Smith and David Damast and HuskerInLA .
I know the temptation for crowing here is intense , but I would suggest going very easy on the cascading assumptions .
There are a lot of reasons why this news has remained unknown this deep into globalization 's expansion .
The " shocker " here is that U.S. geologists have confirmed what has been long suspected : Afghanistan 's mineral riches are significant .
Just like with Iraq , once outside experts got some free range , a lot more reserves were found .
Frankly , that 'd be true for any Gap nation that 's remained largely cut - off from the outside world for reasons of too much dictatorship or not enough law .
Hell , it was true for Russia on oil .
This is being presented as a game - changer , but I think the overselling is premature .
First off , understand that the mining world does n't exactly get turned upside down on this basis .
This is great news and potentially game - changing for Afghanistan if a lot of things go right -- for a long time , but it will not alter any larger realities in the global marketplace ( where China is the demand center of the global mining industry ) , except to end this nonsense notion that somehow Bolivia controls the bulk of the world 's lithium ( Whew !
Dodged that would - be superpower ! ) .
There is lithium being found in plenty of places , trust me .
The same discounting can now be applied to China 's alleged cornering of the entire rare earth market -- also a vastly oversold fear .
Mineral riches in the range of $ 1T certainly shove Afghanistan into the big-boy category ( past estimates said Afghanistan was Syria - sized in oil and had just enough minerals to qualify as resource - cursed - - a line I 've used to very ho - hum effect in the brief for two years now , suggesting that no American audience I 've ever come across would suddenly jump and say , " Yeah baby , this changes everything ! " ) , but the primary reason why the place has never been sufficiently checked out before now has been the security situation / lack of governance , and that does n't exactly change overnight on the basis of this information .
Nor will it change -- I suspect -- the Obama administration 's unwillingness to sign up for a significant combat presence that drags into the next election at anywhere near the level to maintain enough security to get balls seriously rolling .
" Blood for lithium " does n't exactly ring the average American citizen 's bell .
It also wo n't likely make the Taliban any less fierce in their fighting -- anything but .
If you do n't believe me , then please remember that the Naxalite Maoists in India do best in areas where mining deals strikes the local as inequitable .
Most importantly ( and this is what Enterra learned in our Development - in - a - Box work in Kurdish Iraq ) , the discovery does n't change but only reveals the lack of counterparty capacity in Afghanistan -- as in , plenty of outside parties willing to engage in the transaction , but Afghanistan 's government is nowhere near capable of playing the counterparty .
And yeah , it takes two to tango .
Remember the first thing Jed Clampett did after he moved to Beverly Hills : he got himself a Mr. Drysdale .
There will be a lot of entities vying for that role in Afghanistan , and in many ways , it would be better if that role was n't hogged by the Americans .
Finally , do n't assume any of this is a big surprise to the Chinese , whose overly - generous 30 - year deal on the Anyak copper mine now looks like the start of a beautiful and logically far larger relationship .
China , after all , has a border with Afghanistan ( 76 clicks long ) ; we do n't .
The basic pattern long cited here of Americans doing the Leviathan heavy - lifting while the Chinese reap the SysAdmin winnings is n't exactly snapped by this news -- anything but .
So as before , I think the key remains getting a whole lot more rising great powers deeply -- and I mean DEEPLY -- interested in helping secure Afghanistan for the long haul .
Mining is n't a slam - dunk but years upon years upon years of stability required for the riches to flow , and then they have to flow with some transparency and positive popular impact , otherwise you can find yourself in an endemic conflict situation that 's just Afghanistan - the - failed - state - as - we 've - known - it now supercharged by a fungible source of funding for any side willing to kill enough to control its resulting wealth .
Before anybody gets the idea that somehow the West is the winner here , understand that we 're not the big draw on most of these minerals -- that would be Asia and China in particular .
What no one should expect is that the discovery suddenly makes it imperative that NATO do whatever it takes to stay and win and somehow control the mineral outcomes , because - - again - - that 's now how it works in most Gap situations like Africa .
We can talk all we want about China not " dominating " the situation , but their demand will drive the process either directly or indirectly .
There is no one in the world of mining that 's looking to make an enemy out of China over this , and one way or another , most of this stuff ends up going East - - not West .
If anything , this news should be used to leverage more of a security contribution out of regional great powers -- to include China .
So less of a game changer than perhaps a very welcome game accelerator -- as in , China is a lot better positioned to reap the mineral rewards that is Afghanistan , with the question being , " How long does it take for China to step up security - wise and stop low - balling its effort there ? "
Certainly , the notion that we turn Afghanistan and all its minerals over to Karzai 's cronies , Pakistan 's ISI and the Taliban strikes me as truly cracked , but the truth remains : we and our Western allies are n't enough to make the security situation happen on our own -- not for the long timelines required .
If it were that easy , these discoveries would have been made decades ago .
I 'm not trying to diminish the importance of the findings here ( although , again , whenever an isolated place like this finally gets checked over , the " stunning " surprise is the same -- as in , there 's lots more than anybody knew previously ) ;
I 'm just saying the macro dynamics are n't all that altered .
So again , less a game - changer than potentially a tremendous game - accelerator .
China is now that much more incentivized to accelerate its penetration , and it would be nice to see that happen on a timetable that helps us while effectively drawing Beijing into more explicit partnership .
Or we can pretend this is going to remain a NATO - dominated show that somehow achieves Afghanistan 's potential as a long - term supplier of important minerals to the global economy .
If I 've said once in the brief , I 've said it a thousand times ( literally ! ) :
Americans cannot integrate a nation - state on the other side of the planet into the global economy all on our own .
Our Leviathan can rule any battlespace , but the SysAdmin 's victory is necessarily a multilateral one .
Here 's the simplest reality test I can offer you : if we 're just at the initial discovery phase now , we 're talking upwards of a decade before there will be mature mines .
Fast - forward a decade in your mind and try to imagine the US having a bigger presence in Afghanistan than China .
I myself cannot .
Start with that realization and move backward , because exploring any other pathway will likely expose you to a whole lotta hype .
My project .
This post assumes that the reader has read my last post .
I started the change in the line representation .
Instead of a single linked list of free lines , it ’s better to work with line groups , to avoid fragmentation inside lines in allocation .
I ’ve create a struct to represent this line group , with a pointer to the next group , and the size , in lines , of the group .
It is stored in includes / rts / storage / GC.h currently , but I ’m not sure if this is the best place to put it , and I ’m thinking about changing it latter .
#include " rts/OSThreads.h " typedef struct line_ { struct line_ * next ; StgWord size ; } line ; /*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then we need to change the code of liberation of lines in rts / sm / Sweep.c .
else if (!( bd-> flags & BF_MEDIUM ) ) { StgBool sequence ; sequence = 0 ; for( i = 1 ; i < BLOCK_SIZE_W / BITS_IN ( W_ ) ; i++) { StgPtr start ; start = bd-> start + BITS_IN ( W_ ) * i ; if ( bd->u.bitmap[i ] == 0 && bd->u.bitmap [ i - 1 ] == 0 && start + BITS_IN ( W_ ) <= bd -> free ) { printf ( " DEBUG : line_found ( %
p )
" , start ) ; fflush ( stdout ) ; if ( gen -> first_line == NULL ) { gen -> first_line = ( line *) start ; } if ( sequence ) { last_line -> size ++ ; } else { if ( last_line != NULL ) { last_line -> next = ( line *) start ; } last_line = ( line *) start ; last_line -> next = NULL ; last_line -> size = 1 ; } sequence = 1 ; } else { sequence = 0 ; }
I ’ve tested this code using the same technique as before , checking the produced list trasversing it after it ’s done .
The list obtained showed the correct lines .
Now I ’m back to the allocation code , which never worked .
The changes in rts / sm / Evac.c are straightfoward .
if ( gen-> first_line != NULL && size <= BITS_IN ( W_ ) * gen->first_line -> size ) { ws -> todo_free = ( StgPtr ) gen-> first_line ; ws->todo_lim = ws-> todo_free + BITS_IN ( W_ ) * gen -> first_line ->size ; gen -> first_line = gen -> first_line ->next ; to = ws-> todo_free ; }
This cause the same kind of errors I was getting before .
I should go back to debugging .
My co-supervisor in my Oriented Project in Computer Science suggested me using valgrind .
I ’ll try it .
Last week I forgot to mention I ’ve presented my final presentation about my Oriented Project in Computer Science .
This week I finished writing my monograph .

* Infrastructure mostly unscathed by 6.2 magnitude quake
* People nervous following quakes in Haiti and Chile ( Updates with one casualty , changes dateline , pvs MEXICO CITY )
OAXACA , Mexico , June 30 ( Reuters ) - A strong 6.2 - magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico early on Wednesday , leaving one man dead and shaking buildings as far away as Mexico City but sparing infrastructure from serious damage .
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck near the town of Pinotepa Nacional , around 80 miles ( 125 km ) southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca , Police patrols checking surrounding towns did not report fallen buildings .
In the small coastal village of San Andres Huaxpaltepec near the epicenter a falling beam crushed a 46 - year - old man as he slept at home , said Luis Zarate , head of the emergency services service in the state of Oaxaca .
“ It woke me up , I was scared too , ” said Gilberto Mateo , another civil protection official in Oaxaca .
In the historic center of the city of Oaxaca people felt the tremor strongly and several hotels were evacuated briefly .
“ It was pretty strong , ” said Jorge Cervantes , a security guard at Hotel Las Gaviotas in Pinotepa Nacional .
“ Some guests went downstairs but the building is fine and nobody is hurt . ”
The USGS reported the quake as magnitude 6.5 but later revised the figure to 6.2 , also moving the epicenter slightly .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had no warning or advisory in place and hotels in beach resorts like Puerto Angel also reported no damage .
Tremors awoke residents in Mexico City nearly 300 miles ( 470 km ) to the north , and cut power in some districts .
Some people filed onto the street in their pajamas , but there were no reports of casualties in the city , where many have grim memories of a devastating earthquake in 1985 .
Power and phone connections were still working .
Mexico is regularly shaken by tremors and nerves are strained since devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile earlier this year .

PASADENA , Calif. , May 20 ( UPI ) --
A NASA - led study has determined the upper layer of Earth 's global ocean has warmed since 1993 , indicating a strong climate change signal .
The international study , co-authored by Josh Willis of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , determined the energy currently stored in the ocean is enough to power nearly 500 100 - watt light bulbs for each of the roughly 6.7 billion people on the planet .

" We are seeing the global ocean store more heat than it gives off , " said John Lyman , an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research .
Lyman led the study that analyzed nine different estimates of heat content in the upper ocean from 1993 to 2008 .
" The ocean is the biggest reservoir for heat in the climate system , " Willis said .
" So as the planet warms , we 're finding that 80 to 90 percent of the increased heat ends up in the ocean . "
The researchers explained a warming ocean is a direct cause of global sea level rise , since seawater expands and takes up more space as it heats .
The researchers said that expansion accounts for about one - third to one - half of global sea level rise .
The team that included scientists from Britain 's Headley Center for Climate Prediction and Research , the University of Hamburg in Germany and the Meteorological Research Institute in Japan reports its findings in the journal Nature .
This is now going out of Apple ’s hands .
After the EPIC story of pre-release iPhone 4G landing into the hands of Gizmodo for a goodly sum of $ 5000 ( reportedly ) and then we saw a video showing the external assembly of iPhone 4G and now : A VIETNAMESE website has got hold on pre-release iPhone 4G and it ’s definitely not a prank , the thing is original .
100 %
The iPhone 4G they have managed to acquire through whatever means is definitely a pre-release because it does not has any OS at the moment and there is XXX placeholders on the backside stamp .
This device is reportedly 16GB version of the next iPhone .
This device looks exactly same as the one that was leaked before .
What Gizmodo failed to reveal in it ’s leak was the Chipset that Apple has used for the next iPhone and probably these guys have a thick chance of revealing this and the world would know 1 month before exactly what the next iPhone 4G / HD looks and feels like .
Here see the front and back of this iPhone 4G leak :
Update :
Here is the complete hardware assembly of iPhone 4G .
We could not read the numbers written on the main chip in the picture though .
We cannot make up the material used for the case but it seems to be either Glass or Ceramic as has been reported before .

Gulf species face unprecedented disaster
By Dan Brennan
22 June 2010
The ultimate ecological impact of the oil spill on wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico is unknown , and will likely remain so for years to come .
Still , two months into the worst oil spill in US history , indications are that the ecological impact will be nothing less than disastrous .
This was a key message from a group of scientists and officials testifying earlier this month before the US House of Representatives Oceans and Wildlife subcommittee .
The testimony came as thousands of dead or oiled organisms are washing ashore and found floating at sea .
By the latest count , nearly 1,600 birds , 500 turtles and dozens of mammals suspected of oil contamination have been collected , most of which were dead or died .
This represents a tiny fraction of the real mortality to date , since the spill area is so vast and much of the damage occurs under water and out of sight .
Even after two months , the disaster is in its early stages .
“ In all likelihood , we will see the consequences of the Gulf spill for decades , ” Dr. Michael Fry , an avian toxicologist with the American Bird Conservancy , told the committee .
He explained that oil is still present today in mussel beds and other sensitive habitats in Alaska ’s Prince William Sound , 21 years after the Exxon Valdez spill .
Robert Barham of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries raised the truly frightening prospect that this time around the effects could linger even longer , since the deepwater dispersed oil is subject to extreme pressure and cold .
“ The transfer rate for mutually buoyant particles to surface is 300 years , ” he stated .
On a more immediate level , the spill is currently proving lethal to wildlife in a number of ways .
The most visible manner is through direct contact with oil , as oil - coated animals often die from hypothermia , drowning or suffocation .
Oil is also lethal to many organisms when ingested ( directly or through consuming contaminated food ) or when inhaling the fumes .
The dispersants used to break up the surface slick and prevent oil from reaching the surface are themselves toxic and can lead to death in some organisms .
In addition , Dr. Carys Mitchelmore , an assistant professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science , described potentially devastating sub-lethal effects from the dispersed oil , including reduced growth rate , mutations , behavioural changes and impaired reproductive ability .
“ These more subtle endpoints than death can nonetheless have huge consequences for populations , ” he told the committee .
Several scientists have begun raising alarms about the impact of the oil and chemical dispersants on species low in the food chain , such as plankton .
If these populations are severely affected , it will have untold consequences for the entire ecosystem .
The area affected by the spill is extremely rich in biodiversity .
Scientists have documented over 8,000 species in the region of the spill .
Many more remain undiscovered , particularly in the deep sea .
For some , the ongoing disaster poses the threat of annihilation for the entire species .
The House committee heard testimony on the potential impacts on a wide variety of wildlife threatened by the spill , several of which are highlighted here .
Marine mammals
Sperm whales
An underwater canyon near the spill site is the primary feeding area for a subpopulation of the endangered sperm whales , which may be exposed to oil when breathing at the surface or from dispersed plumes underwater as they dive to hunt .
The Gulf population of sperm whales is extremely fragile , a point underscored by Aaron Viles of the Gulf Restoration Network in his testimony .
“ Current research suggests that if human - caused mortality exceeds three whales annually , then recovery of the Gulf sperm whale pod will be negatively impacted , ” he noted .
Sperm whales can live to be 100 years old , but only reproduce every 15 years or so .
The total impact on sperm whales is exceedingly difficult to assess , since finding carcasses is unlikely due to the expanse of their marine habitat .
Nonetheless , a lifeless 25 - foot juvenile was found last week floating just south of the spill site .
Though scientists have yet to conclusively link the death to the oil spill , the observation is ominous .
Dolphins
Bottlenose dolphins are another celebrated species facing severe harm from the spill .
Playful by nature , dolphins have been seen following response boats into contaminated water .
Rather than avoiding contact with oil , their behaviour tends to increase the likelihood of contact .
To make matters worse , dolphins are also currently calving in shallow water near the extent of the surface oil .
Aaron Viles reported to the committee that 30 dead dolphins have been counted by the response team .
Dozens more have surfaced elsewhere in the spill region , representing a significant spike in dolphin mortality .
Less - than - fatal impacts are also prevalent , as apparent inhalation of oil vapour triggers a confused response that can lead to stranding .
Birds
Brown pelicans
The state bird of Louisiana has become the most recognized symbol of the spill , due to the many disheartening images of oil soaked pelicans .
The brown pelican was just removed from the endangered species list , after decades of conservation efforts restored population levels from a localized extinction in the 1960s .
Brown pelicans nest in colonies on barrier beaches and marsh islands , where they have already encountered an onslaught of oil washing ashore .
It is not only in their nesting grounds .
Brown pelicans hunt for fish by diving into the sea .
They may even be attracted to the oil slick , which makes the water look calmer .
Dr. Fry explained how the oil affects birds such as the brown pelican .
“ Oil , either fresh , weathered or chemically dispersed , destroys the insulation properties of feathers , and allows water to penetrate to the skin of birds . ”
He continued , “ This causes loss of stored fat followed by muscle wasting , so that the birds are severely weakened , cannot fly , cannot feed , and rapidly deteriorate .
If not recovered by rescue teams within a few days , they will starve to death .
If oiled birds are far out to sea , many will drown and sink without ever being detected . ”
Terns
Along with pelicans , terns also nest on barrier beaches and islands .
Terns are exposed to oil when foraging for food in the coastal waters .
Some species of tern , for example the endangered least tern , have low reproductive rates , making them particularly vulnerable to collapse .
The risk is especially acute for tern chicks , which are susceptible to severe impacts from all levels of oil contamination , whether through direct contact in the nest or through consuming tainted seafood .
Migrating songbirds
Millions of migrant songbirds use the Gulf Coast as the last stopover before embarking on the 1000 kilometer sea crossing to Central America .
These songbirds depend on a rich stock of healthy food and sufficient resting grounds prior to and after their crossing .
Jane Lyder of the Interior Department laid out the likely long - term impacts : “ We expect the oil to persist long - term in the food chain .
When these migratory birds return to the Gulf Coast in the fall , they will likely be exposed to oil as they forage , or possibly face starvation as a result of depleted insect , marine and plant life due to oil incursion . ”
Turtles
The spill occurred during peak breeding season for all five species of sea turtles present in the Gulf : the green , hawksbill , Kemp ’s ridley , leatherback and loggerhead .
All are listed as either threatened or endangered .
Nearly 400 dead turtles have been found in the impact area since the explosion on April 20 .
Over 100 have been collected alive , most of them visibly oiled .
The largest number of sea turtles found so far is among juvenile Kemp ’s ridleys , the most endangered of the five species .
Unlike other turtles , they typically remain in the Gulf year round .
The mouth of the Mississippi , a heavily impacted area , is a vital foraging area for them .
Kemp ’s ridleys typically feed on whatever food is available , and , like other sea turtles , show no signs of avoiding oil contaminated waters .
Fish and shellfish
Bluefin tuna
The Gulf of Mexico is one of two spawning grounds in the world for bluefin tuna , a species that has been decimated by overfishing in recent decades .
Scientists estimate that since 1970 , the bluefin population has declined by roughly 80 percent .
Mr. Viles explained the acute risk posed by the huge amounts of dispersed oil in the water column , particularly related to the reproductive capacity of the species .
“ April and May are the peak spawning time for this species , and researchers have found significant amounts of larvae in what is now BP ’s impact area .
This is troubling as fish eggs and larvae are highly sensitive to oil and dispersants .
As a result , ” he continued , “ this year ’s age - class of bluefin tuna , as well as many of the 42 federally managed species in the Gulf of Mexico , may suffer significant decreases to population size , which will in turn effect the commercial and recreational fisheries of the Gulf . ”
Shellfish
Oil can be toxic to shellfish , both to those living on the seabed ( such as crabs ) and those residing in intertidal zones ( such as oysters ) .
With these species , BP ’s decision to apply dispersants may prove disastrous .
Dispersed oil droplets are comparable in size with the plankton consumed by oysters and other filter feeders .
As such , they will likely consume oil droplets with which they come in contact .
For those oysters that survive , the chemicals tend to persist and accumulate , thereby also harming their predators .
For crabs , which are higher up on the food chain , the risk comes primarily from consuming other organisms in which the toxins have already accumulated .
Both crabs and oysters are important components of Louisiana ’s fishing industry , which accounts for 20 percent of the entire US catch .
A federally unregulated industrial chemical considered by consumer advocates to be dangerous to human health has been found in 90 % of canned foods sold in the United States .
A study by the National Work Group for Safe Markets randomly examined 50 cans from 19 states ( and one province in Canada ) and discovered virtually all of the foods contained bisphenol A ( BPA ) , which has been tied to cancer , reproductive abnormalities , diabetes and birth defects in laboratory animals .
One can in particular — of Del Monte French Style Green Beans from a store in Wisconsin — had the highest level of BPA ever recorded : 1,140 parts per billion .
Other canned foods with unusually high levels of BPA were Walmart ’s Great Value Green Peas , purchased in Kentucky ; and Healthy Choice Old Fashioned Chicken Noodle Soup bought in Montana .
But the group conducting the study could not say how bad 1,140 parts per billion was , because the federal government has n’t established federal standards for BPA .
Environmentalists thought Lisa Jackson , head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , would go about setting safe limits for BPA in food .
But after chemical industry lobbyists met with officials at the White House in December , the EPA decided to wait at least another two years before regulating the chemical .

Last week , gaming developer Rare changed that golden logo we remember so well from Donkey Kong Country and Goldeneye to a new , more ‘ modern ’ logo in commemoration of its 25th anniversary and its newfound focus on Project Natal .
It ’s always a bit of a shock when a brand we know well radically changes its look , like a friend getting a new haircut that we do n’t know what to think about , but Rare ’s redesign reminds us that a lot of the gaming logos that greet us on the sides of boxes and on startup screens have n’t been around forever .
Below , Geekosystem has put 15 video game companies ’ old - school logos side - by - side with their modern counterparts .
Which do you like better ?
1. Rare
Rare chief : “ we felt now was the time to have a new image more in keeping with an innovative and creative entertainment company which aspires to be around for at least the next 25 years ! ”
But oh , how we pine for their N64 days .
2. Sega
Before they made video games , Sega made mechanical arcade cabinets , although their old logo looks more like something you ’d see hanging on a banner over a medieval great hall .
3. LucasArts
Back when LucasArts was called “ LucasFilm Games , ” it had yet another logo , but the golden sunshine man that you remember from the side of your Rebel Assault game back in the day has persevered since 1991 .
At that , he got a facelift with a less crunchy look in 2005 .
4. Valve
Which is creepier : A red valve in a thinly moustached man ’s eye , as we saw in the first Half - Life , or a red valve plugged into the brainstem of a scary bald wrestler man ?
The jury ’s out .
5. Square - Enix
When Square and Enix merged in ’03 , Square ’s color scheme won the day .
Here ’s hoping the castle in the background is some sort of EarthBound revival clue that no one ’s yet decoded .
6. Namco -Bandai
Without getting into how Namco ’s pre-merger gaming legacy was vastly superior to Bandai ’s ( sorry , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers for SNES , but Pac - Man and Galaga got you beat ) , how oh how did two red - and - white logos merge into a freakish , ugly love story between a red and a yellow amoeba ?
7. Blizzard
Yes , Blizzard used to be called “ Silicon & Synapse ” and have a grumpy , anthropomorphic brain wearing shoes as its mascot .
But its current logo is still pretty old - school :
It ’s been basically unchanged since 1994 .
8. Funcom
Age of Conan developer Funcom traded its kooky ’90s trapezoid for a red circle that vaguely reminds us of LG .
9. EA
Apparently , EA ’s old logo confused people .
Wikipedia : “ Many customers mistook the square / circle / triangle logo for a stylized “ EOA . ”
Though they thought the “ E ” stood for “ Electronic ” and “ A ” for “ Arts ” , they had no idea what the “ O ” could stand for , except perhaps the o in “ Electronic . ”
An early newsletter of EA , Farther , even jokingly discussed the topic in one issue , claiming that the square and triangle indeed stood for “ E ” and “ A ” , but that the circle was merely “ a Nerf ball that got stuck in a floppy drive and has been popping up on our splash screens ever since . ”
It ’s still enough to induce waves of nostalgia in anyone who ’s played Starflight .
10 . Epic Games
Back when it was called “ Epic MegaGames , ” Epic ’s logo definitely had swagger , declaring itself “ the new name in computer entertainment ” with a decidedly ’90s box array ; today , it rocks a badge that is n’t out of place alongside the shooters and action games that are its trademark .
11 . THQ
As much as I would like to objectively compare these , the presence of Ren and Stimpy in the logo to the left shifts my allegiances irreversibly in that direction .
12 . SNK
Since the modern SNK ’s removal of serifs is not particularly earth - shattering , here , have a cool , possibly true story about the origins of SNK vs.
Capcom , the fighting game which took the maybe - too - bold - but - still - fruitful step of assuming that rank - and - file gamers had any idea what “ SNK ” was .
Street Fighter Wikia :
“ The supposed origin behind this series was an issue of Arcadia magazine in which there were articles covering both The King of Fighters ’98 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 , both of which were released at around the same time .
Readers had misread the cover , which said KOF vs. SF , to mean that there was a fighting game that would pit characters from the Street Fighter and The King of Fighters series . ”
13 . Bethesda
Ca n’t say I ’m crazy about the current logo for the company behind The Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3 , but it beats something that looks like it was designed by the Terminator himself .
14 . Ubisoft
Left : ’90s overload .
Right : ’00s overload .
( It was rolled out in 2003 . )
What will the dawn of the new decade bring ?
15 . Nintendo
As you may well be aware , before Nintendo did video games , they did playing cards .
One translation of the original kanji is “ work hard , but it remains in the hands of heaven at last ” ; accurate or no , that seems like a pretty apt description of the gaming experience in more than one Nintendo game .
Have a tip we should know ?

The other day Stephen Maher published a piece on Electronic Intifada saying that American thirst for hegemony in the region , and not the Israel lobby , is the prime motivator of US policy in Israel and Palestine .
What follows is an excerpt of a private email exchange responding to Maher ’s post , reprinted by permission of the author , Chas Freeman , a former assistant secretary of defense .
Maher ’s account is far from novel on any score but he is describing Japan ’s , the UK ’s , or Qatar ’s role in US strategy , not Israel’s .
A few facts to ponder when considering his assertion that Israel is a huge and essential asset for US global and regional strategy :
— the US has no bases or troop presence in Israel and stores only minimal military supplies in the country ( and these under terms that allow these supplies to be used essentially at will by the IDF ) .
— Israeli bases are not available for US use .
— none of Israel ’s neighbors will facilitate overflight for military aircraft transiting Israeli territory , let alone taking off from there .
Israel is useless for purposes of strategic logistics or power projection .
— Israel is worse than irrelevant to the defense of Middle Eastern energy supplies ; the US relationship with Israel has jeopardized these supplies ( as in 1973 ) , not contributed to securing them .
— US relations with Israel do not bolster US prestige in Middle Eastern oil - producing countries or assist the US to " dominate " them , they complicate and weaken US influence ; they have at times resulted in the suspension of US relations with such countries .
— Israel does not have the diplomatic prestige or capacity to marshal support for US interests or policies globally or in its own region and does not do so ; on the contrary , it requires constant American defense against political condemnation and sanctions by the international community .
— Israel does not fund aid programs in third countries to complement and support US foreign or military policy as other allies and strategic partners do .
Japan provides multiple bases and pays " host nation support " for the US presence ( though that presence as well as the fact that Japan is paying for a good deal of it are growing political issues in Japan ) .
The air base in Qatar from which the US directs air operations throughout the region ( including in both Iraq and Afghanistan ) was built and is maintained at host nation expense .
So too the ground force and naval facilities we use elsewhere in the Gulf .
The US is paid for the weapons and military services it provides to its European and Asian allies as well as its Arab strategic partners .
Washington has never had to exercise a veto or pay a similar political price to protect any of them from condemnation or sanctions by the international community .
Japan and various Arab countries , as well as European nations , have often paid for US foreign assistance and military programs in third countries or designed their own programs specifically to supplement US activities .
Washington has made Israel our largest recipient of foreign aid , encouraged private transfers to it through unique tax breaks , transferred huge quantities of weapons and munitions to it gratis , directly and indirectly subsidized the Israeli defense industry , allocated military R&D to Israeli rather than US institutions , offered Israeli armaments manufacturers the same status as US manufacturers for purposes of US defense procurement , etc. .
Almost all US vetoes at the United Nations and decisions to boycott international conferences and meetings have been on behalf of Israel .
Israel treats its ability to command support from Washington as a major tool of diplomatic influence in third countries ; it does not exercise its very limited influence abroad in support of US as opposed to its own objectives .
As others have said with greater indirection than I have here , one must look elsewhere than Israel ’s strategic utility to the United States for the explanation of its privileged status in US foreign policy , iniquitous as Maher considers that policy to be .
( CNN ) --
The no-fly list is supposed to help keep terrorists off planes , so when the Times Square car bombing suspect was able to board a flight anyway , it put the process under immense scrutiny .
The government has already made changes to the system .
On Wednesday , it began telling airlines to check updated no - fly lists within two hours of the time they are issued , not within 24 hours , as under the previous directive .
It happened after Faisal Shahzad , a 30 - year - old naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan , was arrested at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport late Monday after boarding a flight bound for Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
His name had been put on an updated no - fly list , which identifies people who pose a credible threat to aviation security , earlier in the day .
Shahzad made his reservation by phone as he drove to the airport just hours before the flight , investigators said .
When he paid for his ticket in cash at the ticket counter , the airline had not refreshed its no - fly information , so his name did not raise any red flags , a senior counterterrorism official said .
Emirates , the airline that sold Shahzad the ticket , said it followed all the rules .
" Emirates is in full compliance with all passenger check - in procedures in the U.S. and works closely with both the Transport Security Administration ( TSA ) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) agencies to update security watch lists on a regular and timely basis , " the airline said in a statement .
The incident appeared to be " the quirk of time " for which backup measures exist , said Frances Townsend , a CNN national security contributor and homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush .
For such cases , the system was designed to include " necessary and built - in redundancy , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during a briefing .
If a name is added to the no-fly list and an airline misses it , U.S. Customs and Border Protection can look at a flight 's final passenger manifest and identify anything that a carrier may have overlooked , Gibbs said .
To understand how the process works , air travelers should know that there are actually several lists airlines check , some of which may overlap .
There is the main no - fly list , whose purpose is straightforward : to keep known terrorists off planes , according to the Transportation Security Administration .
The no-fly list , maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center , contains thousands of names , and it ballooned after the failed bombing of a U.S. - bound jetliner December 25 , Townsend said .
There are also several much larger watch lists maintained by various government agencies that may focus on people who have overstayed their U.S. visas or are flagged because there 's concern about their affiliations , Townsend said .
Some of those lists may have hundreds of thousands of names .
When you buy a seat on a plane in advance using a credit card , which is how most people purchase their tickets , your name will be put " through a scrub " -- checked against the lists -- 24 hours before your flight , Townsend said .
There 's another check when you get your boarding pass , which may alert the gate agent to a possible problem .
Then , about an hour or so before the plane takes off , the National Targeting Center , run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection , gets the final passenger list .
This is how Shahzad 's name was finally flagged .
" That 's why you have a secondary system with the National Targeting Center , so if something like that should happen , there 's a second opportunity for the government to catch this , which is exactly what did happen , " Townsend said .
" They now have that manifest of the actual people who not only bought with credit cards but have walked up and bought [ a ticket ] at the last minute .
They have all those names , and they do a second scrub , " she said .
The National Targeting Center was established in October 2001 in direct response to the September 11 terrorist attacks , according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website .
Meanwhile , there have been questions about why it 's up to the airlines , not the government , to check the no-fly list .
The main issue is that the airlines have all the necessary passenger data , so they either have to perform the check themselves or send the data to the government , a costly proposition , Townsend said .
She believes that the government will ultimately end up doing the checks in the long run .

Obama administration helped BP quash environmental challenges to Gulf drilling
By Tom Eley
11 May 2010
The Obama administration intervened in court to ensure that BP ’s Gulf drilling operations would go forward , even in the absence of serious environmental and safety studies , a World Socialist Web Site analysis of 2009 legal documents reveals .
The administration ’s efforts applied not only to deep sea drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico , but specifically to the site that would be used by BP ’s Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which on April 20 exploded , killing 11 workers and generating an oil slick that is inflicting an unprecedented environmental and economic disaster on the Gulf Coast .
A May 11 , 2009 legal brief written on behalf of Obama ’s secretary of the interior , Ken Salazar , requested that the Washington , DC federal court of appeals overturn or amend an earlier decision blocking new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico ’s outer continental shelf .
The petition referred specifically in several instances to site “ 206 ” — the same area where the Deepwater Horizon would explode in a blowout less than one year later .
In July of last year , the court of appeals partially approved Salazar ’s petition , under the condition that the administration would produce an environmental impact study for Gulf of Mexico drilling operations .
The study has not yet been completed .
The court of appeals had earlier ruled that expanded deep sea drilling related to the Bush administration ’s “ Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program , 2007 - 2012 ” violated the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( OCSLA ) because it failed to adequately analyze the “ relative environmental sensitivity ” of impacted areas .
That decision came on April 17 , 2009 , only 11 days after the Obama administration granted BP a “ categorical exemption ” from producing a legally required environmental impact study and approving its exploration plan for site 206 , the future location of Deepwater Horizon .
In appealing this ruling , the Department of the Interior argued that the Center for Biological Diversity , which had brought the suit , had “ ‘ not identified any injury arising from the mere existence of these [ drilling ] leases , nor from further exploration and development activity on the Gulf of Mexico leases . ”
Referring to “ leases 204-207 , ” the Obama administration argued that exploration had already begun , and that “ attempting to restore the status quo ante would therefore be extraordinarily difficult . ”
It went on to note the substantial amounts of money that oil firms had already wagered on the exploitation of the deposits .
“ Salazar approved BP ’s exploration plan without any environmental analysis on April 6 , 2009 , knowing that the lease could get struck down by an active lawsuit , ” said Kieran Suckling of the Center for Biological Diversity .
“ When it was struck down 11 days later , he went back to court to get the BP exploration drilling ( and other areas ) removed from the vacature .
His success in this legal maneuver allowed BP ’s exploration drilling to take place , resulting in the April 20 , 2010 catastrophic disaster . ”
The Department of the Interior did not return calls for comment on the story .
The lawyer for the Department of Justice who litigated the case , Sambhav Sankar , said he could not discuss the matter .
A call to his superior in the Justice Department , Andrew Ames , was not returned at the time of writing .
The Obama administration ’s legal intervention to continue deep sea Gulf drilling shows that it not merely shares with the Bush administration indirect responsibility for the disaster through its failure to adequately regulate the industry .
It actively intervened to release BP from legally required environmental assessments for the very drill site that would produce the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Even since the explosion on the rig , the Obama administration has continued to grant “ categorical exemptions ” for deep sea oil drilling — 27 in all , according to the Center for Biological Diversity .
On March 31 , Obama issued his own “ Five - Year Program ” for offshore and deep sea drilling , The plan surpasses even that of the Bush administration , calling for opening up areas for drilling stretching from Delaware to Florida on the Atlantic Coast as well as along Florida ’s Gulf Coast .
The media has largely ignored the growing evidence that implicates the Obama administration in the disaster .
Coverage of the oil spill , already one of the worst ecological catastrophes in history , has been eclipsed for more than a week by media focus on the failed Times Square bombing attempt .
Where the media has addressed the Obama administration ’s role in the disaster , it has attempted to fashion a “ new narrative ” for the explosion , in which the administration ’s early indifference is replaced by supposedly quick action .
Over the weekend , an Associated Press news analysis attempted , with limited success , to portray an energetic response to the crisis .
The story simply overlooked all the evidence to the contrary , including the multiple press briefings given by press secretary Robert Gibbs beginning the day after the explosion .
Quotes from Gibbs , in which he at first expressed only dim awareness of the disaster and later used it as a chance to play up Obama ’s call for increased drilling , are freely available on the White House web site .
( See “ Obama seeks to contain anger over BP oil spill ” )
Obama ’s allies in the liberal and “ left ” media , meanwhile , have sought to pin blame for the spill entirely on the Bush administration , disregarding the fact that Obama has carried on the same policies unchanged .
This is the thrust of a Monday column in the New York Times by liberal columnist Paul Krugman , “ Sex & Lies & the Spill , ” which attributes the disaster to “ the collapse in government competence and effectiveness that took place during the Bush years . ”
Krugman notes that under Bush federal regulators “ minimized the environmental risks of drilling , ” “ failed to require a backup shutdown system that is standard in much of the rest of the world , ” “ exempted many offshore drillers from the requirement that they file plans to deal with major oil spills , ” and “ specifically allowed BP to drill Deepwater Horizon without a detailed environmental analysis . ”
While the Bush administration is certainly culpable for the disaster , all of the regulatory inaction cited by Krugman in fact continued under Obama .
This includes , as Krugman is forced to acknowledge , the exemption given for the Deepwater Horizon site .
But Krugman exculpates Obama by lamely noting that “ the administration had n’t yet had time to put its stamp on ” the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
Krugman concludes by arguing that the spill shows the need for a new “ attitude toward government , ” citing as good examples of this attitude a recent speech by Obama and “ the Clinton years . ”
Similarly , the Nation magazine declares the spill “ an opportunity ” that could be used “ to put all politicians , including President Obama , on the spot and to demand that we move in a fundamentally new direction . ”
If the spill shows anything , it is that there is no means of challenging the stranglehold of the corporate oligarchy through supporting the Democratic Party .
Since the Carter administration , Democratic presidents have advanced deregulation every bit as much as their Republican counterparts .
Indeed , in explaining their lack of regulatory enforcement on oil rigs , MMS officials have cited a law passed during the Clinton years that required all federal agencies to adopt industry standards .
BP employees handed over $ 71,000 to Barack Obama in the 2008 elections — more than to any other candidate — and the corporation has spent tens of millions in lobbying over the past three years , in the process purchasing the support of such powerful politicians as former Democratic Party lobbyists John and Tony Podesta , former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle , former Republican Senator Alan Simpson , former Bush Environmental Protection Agency head Christine Todd Whitman , and Leon Panetta , until he was installed as Obama ’s CIA director .
A Monday report from the Los Angeles Times points out that two members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , which will investigate the explosion and spill , received the third and fourth most campaign funding from BP in 2008 : Republican Senator John McCain ( $ 37,700 ) and Democrat Marry Landrieu of Louisiana ( $ 16,000 ) .
BP gave about 40 percent of all campaign contributions to Democrats in the last election cycle , and 60 percent to Republicans .
Behind the political decisions that created the conditions for the Deepwater Horizon disaster are enormous financial interests .
BP , the world ’s fourth largest corporation , was part of a large - scale oil industry push out into the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico .
Until the last decade , oil industry workers referred to the Gulf as “ the dead sea , ” owing to the stagnation in its output .
But the sharp increase in oil prices in recent years whetted the appetite of the industry for fields once considered unprofitable — including those one mile beneath the sea .
When the lease sale opened for site 206 in a New Orleans auction conducted by the MMS , “ bidders went on the mother of all shopping sprees , ” industry journal Upstream Review wrote in March of 2008 , “ doling out a record $ 3.67 billion in ... bids on oil and gas exploration tracts . ”
The bidding , so high that it “ left jaws hanging in The Big Easy , ” was driven by “ insatiable appetites for the emerging Lower Tertiary oil play in deeper waters of the Gulf and ‘ ultra - deep ’ natural gas plays beneath shallower waters of the Gulf ’s Outer Continental Shelf . ”
“ It ’s the price of oil and gas right now that ’s providing a lot of money and a lot of interest in the Gulf of Mexico , ” said Lars Herbst , regional director for the MMS , who continues to hold the same position under Obama .
Come October , we wo n’t have Kyle Rae to kick us around any more .
After 19 years as downtown councillor , he ’s decided not to run this fall .
Though he ’s tired of fighting , he wo n’t go gentle into that good night .
“ The only way we ’ll ever change , ” he declares , “ is by revolution .
That ’s a dangerous thing to say .
But we ’ve locked ourselves into a 19th - centuty governance model that has failed .
The electoral system of Ontario reflects the rural character of the province , not the urban .
It ’s even worse at the federal level . ”
As for municipal governance , Rae ’s equally unimpressed : “ Council spends hours debating a bicycle lane , whether a tree should be cut down , or front - yard parking , and two minutes on an important policy issue .
Councillors spend more time grandstanding in front of the camera than going to committee meetings and asking tough questions of staff .
“ What Toronto needs is a level of governance that weds the city to the region .
We do not co-ordinate .
We should have councillors on some sort of regional authority , and it should be about more than transit .
“ We have members of council and bureaucracy that do great work , but too many are only working for their pension .
They ’re sleep - walking through it . ”
Still , the 56 - year - old veteran admits that progress has been made since he was elected in 1991 , Toronto ’s first openly gay councillor .
Back then , his priority was to stop police “ harassment ” of gays .
“ Treatment of the queer community has changed radically , ” Rae says .
“ David Boothby was the police chief I worked with and he supported what I was doing .
But I remember talking to those old sergeants who would ask me , ‘ Why do you people have to have sex in the park ? ’
“ What , ” Rae answered , “ straights do n’t ? ”
Though many expected him to be nothing more than the gay councillor , he quickly moved on to other issues , none more controversial than development .
Unlike most of his colleagues , Rae has encouraged developers , while insisting on architectural excellence .
He stepped on more than a few toes along the way , many belonging to local residents .
“ You do n’t need to make everyone happy , ” he argues .
“ That would be nice but it ’s a false political economy .
In Toronto , we always want to reach consensus .
The result is that it takes years to get anything done . ”
As for the city ’s phobia about tall buildings , Rae dismisses it out of hand : “ I find the fear of height is an uneducated and emotional response .
I have spent much time fighting with neighbourhoods .
Where most cities look forward in the hope that their best decades lie ahead , we look backwards thinking our best decade was the ’70s .
But that was another century ; Toronto ’s a different city today .
“ In ’91 , Toronto was pockmarked with parking lots .
We were n’t that far off from Buffalo .
It was pretty dire downtown .
The condo boom changed all that .
I mean , who wants to spend 90 minutes a day commuting ? ”
Heading into the fall election , Rae admits he ’s not optimistic : “ I ’m worried about continued provincial and federal denial of their responsibility for cities .
And I ’m worried about the lack of vision for Toronto .
We are failing to give people an opportunity to fulfill their potential .
And our treatment of immigrants is a disgrace .
We want to be a great place to quietly raise our children but not make a blip on the pages of history .
Instead of talking about where we ’re going and what kind of city we want , we talk about dogs s--- ing in parks , or dogs off the leash .
“ I ’ll miss people , but I wo n’t miss council . ”

When political leaders start to lose power , it ’s often because voters have come to believe they have grown too arrogant , too uncaring and too obsessed with their own image .
It ’s what happened to Pierre Trudeau , Brian Mulroney and Jean Chrétien , all of whom left office when their support was near all - time lows and their reputations were tarnished .
It ’s now happening to Stephen Harper .
The catalyst for this is the G20 summit June 26 - 27 in Toronto , which has become a political nightmare for Harper and his Tory party .
Indeed , the G20 summit and the accompanying G8 summit a day earlier in Huntsville , which Harper had once hoped would be so successful that he could tout them during his campaign for re-election , may well signal the beginning of the end of Harper ’s reign .
The reasons are obvious .
First , the costs of the two summits will top $ 1.1 billion , a ridiculous sum for which Harper is unapologetic .
He ’s even defending a $ 57,000 “ fake lake ” to be built at the press centre in Toronto to give foreign journalists a Muskoka - like experience .
Second , Harper ’s proposal to fund maternal health programs in poor countries , which was to be his G8 legacy piece , is exploding in his face due to his refusal to allow Canadian funds to be used to provide abortions for women .
For days , Harper has been insisting the $ 1.1 billion price tag for the summits , including $ 930 million for security , is justified .
It ’s a hard sell , though , given that security cost only $ 18 million at the G20 summit last September in Pittsburgh and $ 30 million at the G20 meeting last April in London .
Canadians simply are n’t buying Harper ’s argument .
More than two - thirds of those polled say that playing host to world leaders is a waste of money , according to a new Ipsos Reid online poll .
True , much of the security costs are legitimate .
But it ’s the “ fake lake ” that ’s the tipping point for Harper .
Even western newspapers that historically have been cheerleaders for Harper are angry .
Ottawa “ should gaze into its fake lake and do some reflecting , ” the Calgary Herald said Wednesday in an editorial .
“ It ’s the loopy lake project that will leave the lasting impression of waste . ”
The public is right to be furious — and disillusioned — with Harper .
Throughout his career , Harper has preached restraint , advocating spending cuts , lower taxes and more accountability to taxpayers .
And yet on this key issue Harper believes he is under no obligation to explain why a phony lake was approved or why overall costs for the three days of meetings are so high .
No heads will roll .
No full investigation will be conducted into the soaring costs of the summits , where world leaders will actually meet for barely 10 hours .
In effect , he is thumbing his nose at voters , and they know it .

For them , he is talking out of both sides of his mouth — urging summit leaders to focus on the global economic crisis while lavishing them and their entourages with the most expensive summit of all time .
At the same time , the abortion funding issue has become a major political disaster for Harper .
He announced in April that his government would not allow Canada ’s contribution to a special G8 fund to pay for abortions in poor countries .
It ’s a policy that copied one championed by former U.S. president George Bush .
The Obama administration ripped up the old policy as soon as it took office .
“ You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health and reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal , safe abortions , ” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently .
Harper now finds himself out of step with all other G8 countries on this approach , including the U.S. and Britain .
He also finds himself increasingly out of touch with Canadians on it .
A new Canadian Press - Harris Decima poll conducted in early May and released this week found 58 per cent of those polled opposed his decision on abortion funding to developing countries .
That ’s up significantly from 46 per cent in March .
So strong is the opposition to the Prime Minister on this issue that one of the more popular T - shirts for women in Toronto these days carries the words : “ Abort Harper . ”
Arrogant , uncaring , out of touch on key issues , obsessed with image .
It ’s a recipe for failure for Harper .
Just as it was for Trudeau , Mulroney and Chrétien .
Bob Hepburn 's column appears Thursday .

Byron Sonne recently joked he was the last guy counter - terrorism officials would be prone to investigate .
The 37 - year - old man made the comment about a month ago at a “ Surveillance Club ” meeting , a monthly gathering for academics and activists who enjoy discussing surveillance issues and ideas .
Sonne shared his plans to protest the G20 and mused he was hardly the type to raise security alarm bells — slightly nerdy with a receding hairline , the computer specialist lives in a million - dollar home with his artist wife .
In his spare time , he likes to hang out at HackLab TO , a non-profit group for techies who delight in building everything from LED signs to computer codes .
“ He looks , you know , generic .
Kind of like a geek , ” observed Jesse Hirsh , an Internet specialist and broadcaster who met Sonne at the May 5 meeting .
“ We sort of joked . . . he was this middle - aged white guy , how he did n’t really fit the ( terrorist ) profile . ”
So Hirsh was shocked to read the headlines Wednesday and discover Sonne is at the centre of a G20 terror investigation .
On Tuesday afternoon , police converged on Sonne ’s home on Elderwood Dr. in Forest Hill and arrested him on a slew of charges , the most serious of which is possession of an explosive .
He also faces charges of mischief and intimidating a justice system participant .
While Sonne ’s family would not respond to interview requests , friends and colleagues say they are baffled by the charges .
Police are saying little other than that the charges stem from a G20 - related investigation .
Sonne appeared briefly at a bail hearing Wednesday , dressed in a black T - shirt .
He agreed to adjourn his hearing until Saturday and lawyer Kevin Tilley requested a publication ban , which was granted .
While Sonne looked tired and occasionally worried , when he walked from the courtroom he appeared to wink at some reporters .
For those who know Sonne , it is this tendency for mischief that may have landed him in hot water .
In high school , Sonne reportedly planted a fake bomb that resulted in his school being evacuated , causing classmates to vote him “ most likely to become an international terrorist ” in their yearbook , according to a former schoolmate .
Those who now know Sonne say he is a good guy with strong ethics , the farthest thing from a scheming terrorist .
With the entire city tense in the lead - up to the G20 summit , Julian Dunn wonders if security officials may have over - reacted to the stunts of an “ agent provocateur . ”
“ He ’s not a terrorist or anything like that , ” said Dunn , who worked with Sonne in 2003 .
“ If anything , he ’s what I would term an agent provocateur .
( He likes to ) push buttons and challenge the security apparatus . ”
At the Surveillance Club meeting , Sonne shared his plans to listen in on police scanners during the summit and disseminate information to protesters via Twitter , according to Hirsh and Andrew Clement , a University of Toronto professor who was also at the meeting .
This was the same tactic used by two protesters at last year ’s G20 summit in Pittsburgh , a plan that ultimately led to their arrests .
The charges were dropped .
According to Hirsh , Sonne knew his activities could attract unwanted attention from security officials .
But at the same time , he did not seem like someone bent on causing mayhem and destruction , Hirsh said .
“ He was more critical of the whole circus , as it were , ” Hirsh recalled .
“ I suspect that this may just be a stunt and perhaps a stunt that got out of hand . ”
Sonne may have also been deliberately baiting security officials , Hirsh said , and he mentioned wanting to purchase items online that would “ trigger counter - terror alarms . ”
“ It was part of a larger critique or activist exercise to show the absurdity of what ’s often referred to as security theatre , ” said Hirsh , who did n’t know what items Sonne planned to buy .

Sonne ’s
Twitter account also likely placed him on the radar , as G20 security has been actively monitoring social media .
His recent tweets link to photos and videos of the security fence , as well as a G20 counter - surveillance “ how to ” guide he created and posted on a file - sharing website .
Sonne ’s tweets suggest he has already been listening in on police communications with a radio scanner , a practice that is legal and used by many news outlets to stay abreast of breaking news .
According to Twitter , he has also had two run-ins with G20 police prior to his Tuesday arrest .
“ Some people must be stupid ; I ’ve never been arrested or forced to delete pictures of cops and I ’ve been stopped 2 times now # g20report ” he tweeted on Monday .
His last Twitter update was at 11:10 a.m. Tuesday .
While HackLab TO would n’t respond to interview requests , it released a statement on its website confirming one of its members had been arrested .
“ Byron is innocent until proven guilty , and as a member of the lab and a friend we are concerned for him , ” the statement read .
Colleagues say Sonne is well - respected in his field of computer security and has previously worked for top companies such as nCircle Network Security and FSC Internet Corp .
Today , he runs his own computer security consultancy called Halvdan , which means “ half Danish , ” according to former boss Mike Murray .
Murray has known
Sonne for seven years and said he would never do anything malicious .
“ There ’s something fishy to all this .
He ’s not this kind of person , ” Murray said .
“ Reading all the stuff about explosives — that ’s not Byron . ”

Defining A True Pocket Pistol
Updated : December 31 , 2009
How do YOU define a " pocket gun ? "
Obviously , this is a very subjective thing , and people will have a variety of opinions .
For example , I found this comment on an internet forum :
" For some reason , people like to take compact firearms and try to claim that they are pocket guns .
You want a test : here is one .
Go into a gun store wearing jeans .
Take a gun and put it into your rear pocket .
If it can be totally concealed in your rear pocket , then you have found a pocketgun .
If a little of it peeks out , then you have a small gun , but not a pocketgun ... My personal test as to what is a pocket gun and what is not , is the guns ability to be fully concealed in the rear pocket of a pair of slacks . "
Someone else said : " My definition of a pocket gun is one that can actually be carried in , and drawn from , the pocket effectively in public , not merely being able to fit in one 's pocket . "
There are some who say they are able to conceal a full - size 1911 handgun in their pocket .
I do n't believe it .
On the other hand . , by strict definition , a pocket gun is any gun that will fit in a pocket .
That 's pretty broad and inclusive !
Here 's a link to " flyandscuba 's " collection of pocket pistols ( photos and comments ) .
" Oldgranpa " wrote an interesting " blog " about pocket pistols , their history , and their effectiveness .
I 'm going to copy and paste it right here .
It is good reading !
We are so fortunate in this country that our founding fathers were inspired to include the 2nd Ammendment in our Bill of Rights .
We are fortunate that the Supreme Court of our land chose to uphold the 2nd Ammendment on two occasions recently .
Most of our States include laws protecting the right of honest , God fearing citizens for self defense using firearms if necessary .
Along with that , reliable firearms have been produced by excellent manufacturers .
Quality ammunition has been developed that provides the level of self defense needed against lawless felons .
So why " pocket " pistols ?
The life style of America has changed dramatically .
In our father 's days business men wore suits or a sport coat .
Ladies wore full dresses or business suits .
A full size handgun could be concealed under such clothing easily .
Popular then and somewhat now were the 1911 .45's and Browning or Beretta 9 mm's .
You 're out of style anymore wearing a suit , except in some snob environments .
The shoulder holster wo n't work .
Elliot Ness is no longer the norm .
Sport clothes are the fashion today .
Hanging your shirt out to conceal a IWB pistol is OK while off duty , but most places you go the shirt stays inside the belt .
The only thing left is a deep pocket .
In a few cases an ankle holster is used , which is just plain uncomfortable , to me at least .
Oddly enough , the big pistols were not first on the list .
Before John Browning , handguns were mainly Colt revolvers with the .45 Colt cartridge , 1873 .
Then the Stevens Co. produced the .22LR rimfire with smokless powder , 1887 .
Browning 's first was NOT a .45 .
In 1899 he invented the .32acp .
Followed by the .38 special in 1902 by Smith &Wesson .
In 1903 , Colt started making .32 acp pistols .
The European 9 mm Luger appeared around 1904 .
Then in 1906 , Browning made the .25 acp and .380acp .
Military requirements for a larger caliber saw the Browning .45 in 1910 and it was given the name the " 1911 " in the year that Colt started making the famous Browning .45 .
By then the .380 was the popular police pistol in Europe .
Other calibers started to appear after that .
The .357 magnum in 1935 , Makarov 9x18 in 1950 , the ..44 magnum in 1955 , the .22WMR ( .22 magnum ) by Winchester in 1960 , etc. etc .
The country of Belgium mass produced the Baby Browning .25 acp around 1940 and was available for $ 35 in the USA .
It became the " SaturdayNiteSpecial " responsible for hundreds of homicides until banned around 1968 for import .
Fads , like the " One - Shot - Stop " made it seem a big handgun was the only way to go .
The 1911 .45 was readily available after WWII and became a top choice to get that mythical one - shot - stop .
We all wanted one .
Or a 9 mm , choice of many police departments after Glock came out with his light weight , polymer framed pistol .
Still needs at least a IWB holster to carry , even the smaller G19 model .
A fine , reliable pistol , even today .
Way too big for my pocket .
Then , around 1973 , a little home business produced a tiny pistol , the SeeCamp .32acp .
( The Seecamp .32 could only use SilverTip JHP ammo , worthles ballistics . )
NAA immediately tried to copy it with their Guardian .32 , heavy little clunker .
A Swedish designer by the name of George Kellgren , who had tinkered with firearms like the Grendel brand , wanted to do something like the GLOCK .
In around 1995 he contracted with a CNC machine shop in Cocoa , Florida to produce a polymer framed .32 acp pistol he designed , and Kel - Tec was born .
Lighter than the Seecamp or NAA , it 's sales soared .
None of these .32's had ballistics to even remotely produce a one - shot - stop , but with a full magazine and rapid fire could easily discourage a felon .
When , exactly the small .380 's came on the market , I 'm not sure .
Kel - Tec just up - sized their P32 , left off the slide lock , and had success with the P3AT , 1st gen. model .
Seecamp made one and so did NAA .
Now the market is flooded with 380's , some of them pure junk .
But the pocket gun craze has made sales of all these pistols , many with polymer frames , soar .
In 1986 , the famous Miami Shootout occured , resulting in all kinds of ammo testing , etc. etc .
You can search the web for all kinds of reports , reviews , summaries on this event .
Ammo testing still goes on today on all calibers .
The magic bullet has yet to be found .
But the gelatin testing that came out of it set us on the right track .
Substitute ballistic tests , like my wetpack tests , have also added to the data base .
The bottom line ?
Well , as a result we even have today ammo that makes the little .380 pocket pistol a formidable weapon .
So now we can carry a nice little feather - weight pocket pistol with some degree of confidence .
As civilians , we rarely will have to shoot through barriers or angle shots at a felon .
Face - on at close range we can aim for COM and keep shooting until we get results .
Just be sure your pistol of choice is 100 % reliable , and you 've tested your ammo of choice , and know it fires every time .
My hope is we 'll never need it .
But in today 's world , who knows .
Like my friend Norf says , " have a gun . "
Thanks ,
OG !
My ( Mousegunner 's ) personal definition of a pocket gun ties in with the guns usefulness as a concealed weapon .
Many a large gun can be stuffed into a pocket .
But it will be noticeable , because of its size , thickness and weight .
I define a genuine pocket gun as one that will comfortably fit into a man 's front pants pocket , not be uncomfortably heavy so as to shift around a lot while walking , and not be noticeable to the general public .
I believe these criteria rule out anything that is larger , thicker and heavier than a GLOCK 26 ( 9 mm ) or 27 ( 40S&W ) .
This is just my personal definition , and of course you are welcome to your own opinion !
There is a " thread " on the Keltec Owners Group forum in which P - 11 owners are discussing whether they think the P - 11 is just a tad too much for pocket carry .
Here 's a picture of a Kel - Tec P3AT and P - 11 together .
As you can see , the P - 3AT is quite a bit smaller .
However , the P - 11 CAN work as a pocket pistol .
It is just a little bit smaller than the GLOCK 26 /27 .
Here 's a photo comparing the GLOCK 27 , Kel - Tec P11 , Kel - Tec PF9 , and Kel - Tec P3AT .
And here is another photo with the weights of the fully loaded pistols .
The GLOCK 27 has nine rounds of 165 grain 40 S&W ; the Kel - Tec P11 is loaded with eleven rounds of 115 grain cartridges ; the PF9 has eight rounds of 115 grain each ; the P3AT has seven rounds of FMJ .380 ammo .
The Kel - Tec PF - 9 ( see my review ) is just a bit lighter and thinner than the P - 11 , and works better as a pocket pistol .
However , the capacity of the PF - 9 is only 7 + 1 . The PF - 9 is 5.85 inches long , 4.3 inches high , and .88 inches thin .
It weighs 12.7 ounces empty .
It is said to be the flatest and lightest 9 mm pistol available .
I sometimes carry one in my pocket , and in my opinion it is an excellent pocket pistol .
It is light , thin , and not very expensive ( under $ 300 ) .
If you have plenty of funds , then you may prefer the Kahr PM9 ( $ 650 ) , or the Rohrbaugh 9 mm pistol ( $ 950 ) .
For about $ 500 you can get a GLOCK 26 or 27 .
Here is a page of photos comparing the sizes of the P - 11 and the PF - 9 .
Here is a drawing to illustrate the sizes of a few popular semi-automatic pistols that may be carried as pocket guns .
The measurements are in inches and are not perfectly accurate to the nth degree , but close enough for a visual comparison .
Here 's a photo of my Kel - Tec P - 11 .
If a gun is much larger than a P - 11 , then I do n't see how it can be easily used as a pocket gun .
My P - 11 weighs 21 ounces ( according to my postage scale ) fully loaded with 11 rounds of 9 mm ammo .
You will see from the drawing that the Kahr PM9 , is somewhat smaller ( and a bit thinner ) than the Kel - Tec P - 11 .
This would make it more of a true pocket gun .
I do n't own a PM9 ( yet ! )
The PM9 has a capacity of only 7 rounds , versus 11 rounds for the Kel - Tec P - 11 .
So , subtracting the weight of four rounds of 9 mm ammo , a fully loaded PM9 must weigh in the neighborhood of 19 ounces .
There are a few handguns even smaller than the Kahr PM9 , and here we enter the realm of undeniable pocket pistols .
The Kel - Tec P - 3AT ( .380ACP ) and the Rohrbaugh R - 9 ( 9 mm ) are nearly identical in size .
My 1st generation P - 3AT weighs about eight ounces , and around eleven ounces fully loaded .
I am told that the 2nd generation P - 3AT weighs about an ounce more .
The Rohrbaugh weighs 12.8 ounces , and around 15 ounces fully loaded .
The R - 9 is the most " pocketable " 9 mm pistol in existence , and the extra weight will probably not make it more uncomfortable than the P3AT , if a good pocket holster is used .
The firepower advantage of 9 mm over .380 must not be overlooked .
The Kel - Tec P - 3AT has an older , smaller brother , the P - 32 .
Their sizes are very nearly identical , but the P - 32 weighs about an ounce less , and shoots the smaller , lighter .32ACP caliber round .
Of course , it would be better to use at least a .380 caliber bullet for self - defense .
The smallest .380ACP semi-auto pocket pistol is the Seecamp LWS380 , which is only 4.25 x 3.25 x .9 .
The weight ( 11.45 oz unloaded ) is a bit more than the Kel - Tec P - 3AT , but less than the R9 , and not unmanageable .
With a pistol this small , it is important to have a pocket holster that will fill out your pocket , hide the outline of the gun , and keep the gun from rotating around in your pocket .
You would n't want to reach for your gun in trying circumstances and come up holding the slide instead of the grip !
Speaking of " hiding the outline " of the gun , here 's a photo of my Kel - Tec P - 11 in my pocket .
The " print " of the gun shape should be hidden by whatever you use for a holster .
You can make your own , or buy one of the many brands on the market .
An excellent " holster " for most pocket guns is the half - unzipped gun rug that comes with the Kel - Tec P3AT .
North American
Arms makes some neat little revolvers : the Black Widow , the Mini -Mag , and so on , that are true pocket guns .
These little guns shoot either .22 or .22 magnum cartridges .
Usually they come with two swappable cylinders .
North American Arms also makes the semi-auto Guardian pistols in .32ACP , .380ACP and .32NAA .
These are very nice firearms .
The .32 Guardian is 4.4 inches long , 3.2 inches high , and only .86 inches thick .
It weighs only 13.5 ounces .
The .380 is a bit larger and heavier ( 18.7 ounces ) .
The Beretta Tomcat is a popular .32ACP pistol .
It measures 4.9 inches long , 3.7 inches high , and 1.1 inches thick .
It weighs 16.9 ounces .
There are also those who claim that Smith and Wesson Ultralight J - frame revolvers can be pocket guns .
Some of them are definitely light enough .
For example the 342PD Airlite Titanium weighs only 11 ounces , and carries five .38 special cartridges .
However the 342 PD revolver is 6 5/16 inches long and about 1.3 inches thick .
This is quite a bit larger than a Kel - Tec P - 11 !
By the way , Gunblast.com has a great review of the S & W 342PD , with lots of photos .
Click here to read it .
There are also a number of .25ACP pocket pistols available , such as the Raven , the Baby Browning the NAA Guardian .
Finally , let 's not forget the " Derringers . "
The one or two cartridge pistols that have been around for over 100 years .
They are small and come in all calibers .
My personal choice for the ideal pocket gun has changed over the years .
When I first started carrying a pistol I prefered the Kel - Tec P - 3AT .
Over the years I 've tried Kel - Tec PF - 9 and P - 11 Pistols , and even a GLOCK 27 .
Now I 'm back to the KeKel - Tec P - 3AT .
It is the right size / weight , and affordable .
The others are just too large , too heavy , or too expensive to be comfortable in my front pants pocket .
The year 2009 produced some P - 3AT clones which are probably just as good ( Kahr and Ruger , for example ) .
But the Kel - Tec is a long - proven design , and costs less money than the others .
The Kel - Tec P - 32 is even lighter than the P - 3AT , carries one more round , and would be an excellent choice .
As yet , I have not acquired one .
My present " back up " pistol , in case my P - 3AT should get " lost " or need to return to the Kel - Tec factory for fixing , is a Jimenez J.A. 25 .
It is a very inexpensive gun ( I paid $ 109.99 for mine last year ) .
It shoots .25 ACP ammo , and holds six rounds .
It has proven to be reliable , too .
" Bobo " from " The High Road " and other gun forums has made a fantastic chart featuring 16 different pocket guns with photos and specifications .
Here is the link to the pdf file .
Love can be found at lot of strange places but I do n’t think a bridge is not on top of the list when you are about to jump off to commit suicide .
Andriej Ivanov , 26 , and Maria Petrova , 21 , found love on a bridge in Ufa , central Russia when co-incidentally they were about to jump off it to commit suicide at the same time .
Andriej wanted to end his life after his fiance died in a car crash , a day before their wedding .
Maria intended to jump off after her parents threw her out when they found that she was pregnant .
“ Something in my heart snapped and I could n’t let her do it no matter how broken my own heart was .
“ I shouted , ‘ Stop ’ and ran over to her .
She fell into my arms sobbing and I began crying too .
We held each other and talked , and talked and talked .
That night saved my life – and hers , ” said Andriej .
The couple talked into the night and agreed to help each other mend their broken hearts .
Now they plan to get married after telling their families of their amazing escapes from death .
“ He is my knight and my saviour , ” said Maria .
“ All that pain was worthwhile because it led me to my Andriej , ” she added .

WEAK TEA ….
When the political landscape features a fairly large number of confused , easily - manipulated conservatives , who enjoy the enthusiastic backing of an entire cable news network and corporate - backed lobbying groups , it ’s fair to think their collective efforts will have at least some relevance .
But as far as political movements go , the Tea Party crowd — with no clear agenda , no leadership , no internal structure , and no meaningful connection to reality — is running into some trouble .
The national tea party movement has never had a central organization or single leader ; in fact , it has boasted the opposite .
But Tuesday ’s primary results provided fresh evidence of the amorphous network ’s struggle to convert activist anger and energy into winning results .
Frustrated and lacking agreement on what to do next , self - identified tea party leaders say the movement may be in danger of breaking apart before it ever really comes together .
It certainly does n’t help that the American mainstream is growing less impressed with the nascent right - wing initiative .
The national Washington Post / ABC News poll has asked Americans if they have “ a favorable or unfavorable impression of the political movement known as the Tea Party . ”
Just three months ago , 41 % had a favorable impression , while 39 % had a negative one .
Last week , the same poll found 36 % with a favorable impression , and 50 % with a negative one .
Kevin Drum summarized the problem nicely : “ Who could have predicted that a cranky , leaderless movement with no real goals and driven mostly by an inchoate sense of persecution , aggrievement , and Sarah Palin hero worship would eventually turn in on itself and splinter into a thousand embittered little pieces ? ”
For my money , I still think the Tea Partiers ’ biggest problem is not having an agenda .
I ’m not exactly an expert in the intricacies of political movements , but as I understand it , successful movements tend to have clearly - defined goals .
The Tea Partiers have offered hysterical tirades for well over a year now , and no one can say with any certainty exactly what these folks actually want .
It ’s not too late , I suppose , for the effort to become more coherent and better organized , but infighting and splintering seems to make that kind of progress unlikely .
Facebook took down a profile registered as Usama bin Laden today after it collected more than 1,000 “ fans , ” ABC News reported .
The Facebook profile page for Usama bin Laden , which called him the “ Prince of the Mujahideen , ” listed his location as in “ the mountains of the world , ” the Sun reported Friday .
Postings on the now absent page included speeches and recordings from Islamic extremists .
Most of the postings were in Arabic but messages in English began to appear .
The profile became active on March 25 but on Thursday , security experts urged Facebook ’s U.S. owners to shut down the profile page .
A Facebook spokesman expressed doubt that the page was directly connected to bin Laden or al Qaeda .
“ People often attempt to register fake accounts under the name of famous or infamous people , ” Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes told ABC News
Internet terror expert and author Neil Doyle said , “ Bin Laden , via his supporters , is clearly taunting his pursuers . ”
EU civil servants have taken part in a three hour strike demanding a 3.7 per cent pay rise that they had expected .
Fifteen of the European Union ’s 27 member states want them to do without it .
In the current economic down - turn , diplomats described the action as politically bizarre .
Central and eastern European members who have cut salaries at home are especially opposed to boosting pay in Brussels .
A workers ’ union official , Felix Géradon , said : “ Last year in Europe , civil service salaries were raised in France , Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium and the UK , and it is these adaptations in salary , which exceed inflation and therefore mean gains in purchasing power , that we ’re looking to catch up with this year , because we did not get them last year , like the others did . ”
Since 2004 , EU employees ’ wages have been based on what counterparts in eight of the older , wealthier members earned the year before .
The Commission president has underscored this was agreed as EU law .
Downing Street has told British staff that settlements must be reasonable “ at this time ” .
But in Brussels they say calculating according to year - old conditions is a problem .
There is also the aspect of leaving home countries to come here , said EU Council official Goran Welin :
“ We are more paid of course but that ’s how it always has been to have people coming down from different nationalities because that is very important . ”
The row concerns employees of the European parliament , the commission and the council — some 44,500 people in Brussels and elsewhere .
Their salaries now range from 2,550 euros per month for a secretary to more than 17,000 euros for a departmental head .
Die 30 Aktivisten haben die Zentrale am Wienerberg besetzt , um gegen den Ausbau des Kraftwerks Spullersee in Vorarlberg zu protestieren .
Die Polizei fordert sie auf , das Gebäude zu räumen .
Mit der Besetzung eines ÖBB - Gebäudes am Wienerberg in Wien - Favoriten haben am Montag Aktivisten der Umweltschutzorganisation Greenpeace gegen den geplanten Ausbau des ÖBB - Kraftwerks Spullersee in Vorarlberg protestiert .
Zu Zwischenfällen kam es nach Angaben der Polizei nicht .
Die vom Hausbesitzer , der Immofinanz , gerufene Polizei führte keine Räumung durch , einige Besetzer wollten über Nacht bleiben .
Die ÖBB gaben sich offen für einen Dialog mit den Umweltschützern .
" 15 Greenpeace - Aktivisten sind im Foyer und haben dort Kartoffeln und Salate angepflanzt " , sagte ein Polizeisprecher .
Es erfolge keine Räumung , die gerufenen Polizisten seien bereits wieder abgezogen .
Alles gehe friedlich vor sich .
Zuvor hatten Aktivisten am Dach des sechsstöckigen Gebäudes ein Banner aufgespannt .
Einige Umweltschützer wollten über Nacht im Gebäude ihre Protestaktion fortsetzen , kündigte Niklas Schinerl , Klima - und Energiesprecher von Greenpeace an .
Die ÖBB zeigte sich gelassen :
Es gebe derzeit weder einen Grund noch eine rechtliche Handhabe , gegen die Aktivisten vorzugehen .
Die ÖBB seien außerdem nur einer von mehreren Mietern in dem Gebäude der Immofinanz , erläuterte ÖBB - Sprecherin Bettina Gusenbauer .
Streit um ÖBB - Kraftwerk
Der Stein des Anstoßes liegt in Vorarlberg : Das ÖBB - Kraftwerk Spullersee soll ausgebaut werden , um den wachsenden Strombedarf der Bahn zu befriedigen .
Während die Bundesbahnen darin ein ökologisches Projekt sehen , wird für die Umweltschützer dadurch der Lechfluss massiv gefährdet .
Durch die von der ÖBB - Bau AG beabsichtigte Kraftwerkserweiterung werde einigen Zubringerbächen des Lech das Wasser entzogen , warnte Greenpeace .
Diese Gebirgsbäche sollen das Wasser für den Speicher - Ausbau für das Kraftwerk Spullersee in Vorarlberg liefern .
Werden die Pläne ausgeführt , dann landen 24 Millionen Kubikmeter Wasser nicht mehr im Lech , sondern fließen stattdessen über das Kraftwerk in den Rhein .
" So wird einem der letzten noch weitgehend intakten alpinen Flüsse wortwörtlich das Wasser abgegraben .
Die erzeugte Menge Strom macht hingegen lediglich ein Vierzigstel des ÖBB - Strombedarfs aus .
Die wenigen Kilowattstunden sind es nicht wert , dem letzten wilden Alpenfluss das Wasser zu nehmen " , sagte Schinerl .
Die ÖBB sehen sich hingegen nicht als Umweltsünder : Ein Drittel des Strombedarfs der Bahn werde aus eigener Produktion gedeckt , der Ausbau des bestehenden Kraftwerks Spullersee sei ein Beitrag zum Klimaschutz , erläuterte Gusenbauer .
Alleine der dadurch gewonnene Zusatzstrom ermögliche den Betrieb von 6.000 zusätzlichen Zügen Wien - Innsbruck pro Jahr , der Ausbau des öffentlichen Verkehrs sei ökologisch sinnvoll .
Außerdem werde bei der Wasserentnahme aus dem Lech - Fluss behutsam vorgegangen , wenn der Wasserstand unter einen gewissen Pegel sinke werde die Entnahme gestoppt .
Weil es sich beim Kraftwerk - Ausbau um ein ökologisch sinnvolles Projekt handle , habe auch das Land Tirol bereits die Genehmigung erteilt , so die ÖBB - Sprecherin .
Am Dienstag würden Verhandlungen mit betroffenen Bauern um Grundstücknutzungsrechte sowie Wassernutzungsrechte geführt .
Mit 14 Gemeinden im Lechgebiet sei eine " Allianz für das obere Lechtal " abgeschlossen worden .
Auch mit den Umweltschützern führe die ÖBB das Gespräch .

Numbers versus instinct .
No contest , you might think .
After all , all recent Lib Dem leaders - David Steel , Paddy Ashdown , Charles Kennedy and Menzies Campbell - have all reached political maturity in opposition , if not antagonism , to the Tories
The deputy leader Vince Cable has hinted that he would have stayed in the Labour Party - he once co-wrote a pamphlet with Gordon Brown - if he had n't moved to London where the so - called " loony Left " had taken the party over .
Many of the party 's leading veterans and founders - Baroness ( Shirley ) Williams and Lord ( Tom ) McNally - were senior figures in the last Lib - Lab pact .
Since the party failed to make a northern breakthrough against Labour , more of its MPs and activists see the Conservatives as the enemy .
So , why can you not assume that Nick Clegg will march into Gordon Brown 's cabinet today ?
The answer is his own declared objective to form a " strong and stable " government .
A Lib -Lab coalition would not have a parliamentary majority .
Ah , said Paddy Ashdown this morning , but the Tories would never be able to form a blocking majority with the SNP , Plaid and the Unionists .
They would n't need to .
The thing that defeats , exhausts and depresses minority governments is rebellions on their own side , the insistent demands of their allies and the passion of their opponents to run them ragged .
Ask John Major or any veteran of the Wilson or Callaghan governments and they 'll tell you that .
Now , if there is enough commitment on the Labour side to make this work all those inevitable problems of a minority government could be lived with to build " a progressive alliance " .
That , though , is what Lib Dems are asking themselves this morning .
Do David Blunkett and John Reid speak for many Labour figures who question the legitimacy of this arrangement and would rather go into opposition and fight the Tories .
How many agree with Jack Straw 's private doubts about the wisdom of this coalition ?
Will Ed Balls be more interested in making the new politics work or in securing the leadership of the Labour Party by standing up for his party against their new bedfellows ?
As one Lib Dem put it to me - Gordon Brown going was a key that unlocked the door to a deal but it unlocked another door - to a leadership contest in which some candidates will position themselves as hostile to a deal .
Another senior figure confessed that if you stripped away the party labels we'd have to go with the Conservative offer as it was so much more substantial .
So , the sincerity with which Labour enters their negotiations this morning and the reaction of the wider Labour movement will determine whether by the end of today the Lib Dems follow their hearts and ignore those nagging doubts in their heads .
Update 12:03 : More and more Labour MPs are saying privately that the proposed Lib / Lab deal cannot work .
To understand what this could mean in practice in the Commons , picture the following scene .
It 's an hour before midnight .
A group of Labour MPs is in the Strangers ' Bar in the Commons .
It 's the latest in a long line of late - night sittings forced on them by the guerilla war run by the Tory whips ' office in which they refuse to co-operate with the government .
A Labour whip walks in and tells his colleagues that a vote is imminent on a vital amendment to the home secretary 's cherished Bill .
" You mean Clegg 's daft plan ? " one asks , downing his pint .
" He 's not one of ours , is he ? " another adds sarcastically while ordering another .
" My voters did n't vote for him as far as I can recall , " adds a third bitterly .
The whip runs upstairs to tell his boss .
The chief whip has just seen dozens of Tory MPs returning from long relaxing dinners - after all , none of them has any government responsibilities to worry about .
" I thought you said they 'd all gone home , " he says to one of the junior whips .
" Where are the Nats ? " he asks another , to be told that after the chancellor refused to back the New Scotland Growth fund , Alex Salmond 's boys chose to take early flights to their constituencies .
" What about the Unionists ? " he shouts , only to be told that Nick Clegg has offended them with his latest liberal utterance .
The home secretary 's PPS is called for and is told to pass him a note warning him that sadly the government has n't got the votes for his Bill .
Nick Clegg pulls out of his pocket the dog-eared photocopy of page 120 of his mentor Paddy Ashdown 's diaries .
Underlined in red pen three times is one line he wished he'd paid more attention to : " A hung Parliament would not be a dream .
It would be a nightmare . "
PS : I 'm well aware , of course , that much of what I 've described could also apply to an uncomfortable Tory / Lib - Dem coalition which was resented or rejected by backbenchers of both parties .
The big difference , though , is that it would not be a minority government .
It would have a significant Parliamentary majority .
The Supreme Court ruled Monday the federal government has the power to indefinitely keep some sex offenders behind bars after they have served their sentences , if officials determine those inmates may prove " sexually dangerous " in the future .
" The federal government , as custodian of its prisoners , has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby ( and other ) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose , " Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the 7 - 2 majority .
Monday 's other Supreme Court rulings :
Court : Sentencing juveniles to life without parole ' cruel and unusual '

Urban beekeepers in New York City no longer have to keep the honey of their labors a secret .
The city 's health board voted Tuesday to overturn a longtime ban on beekeeping within city limits .
Previously , the city 's health code had placed honeybees in the same category as about 100 other creatures deemed too hazardous to be kept in town , including ferrets and poisonous snakes .
Bees do sting , after all , and their venom can be dangerous to some people with severe allergies .
Yet , over the years , the ban was both little - known and lightly enforced .
Some New Yorkers have secretly tended hives on rooftops and gardens for years in either defiance or ignorance of the regulations .
[ Click here to read the Monitor 's article on urban beekeeping – City bees are all the buzz – which was published before the ban was lifted . ]
And lately , bees have picked up political cache among a growing number of green - minded folk interested in seeing organic agriculture return to big American cities .
The movement to end the ban picked up after Michelle Obama had a hive installed on the South Lawn of the White House .
" The bees are a great way to start that conversation , " said David Vigil , a coordinator at the urban agriculture group East New York Farms ! , which conducts seminars on beekeeping and has two hives at its youth garden in Brooklyn .
A hive can produce as much as 100 pounds of honey per year , he said , and the bees are useful for pollinating all sorts of crops .
" There are very few instances of people being stung , " he added .
Honeybees " are naturally defensive , but they are not aggressive at all . "
People interested in starting a bee colony will need to register their hives with the city , but no license will be required .
Health officials said the register will mostly be used to help resolve any complaints that may arise .
Previously , the city had investigated a few dozen complaints a year about illegal hives , and issued fines to some violators as high as $ 2,000 .
The city lifted the ban for only one type of bee , the honey - producing Apis mellifera .
Wasps , hornets , and other types of stinging insects are still banned .

Moreover , in his selection of finalists , Mr. Obama effectively framed the choice so that he could seemingly take the middle road by picking Ms. Kagan , who correctly or not was viewed as ideologically between Judge Wood on the left and Judge Garland in the center .
Judge Garland was widely seen as the most likely alternative to Ms. Kagan and the one most likely to win easy confirmation .
Well respected on both sides of the aisle , he had a number of conservatives publicly calling him the best they could hope for from a Democratic president .
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah , a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee , privately made clear to the president that he considered Judge Garland a good choice , according to people briefed on their conversations .
But Mr. Obama ultimately opted to save Judge Garland for when he faces a more hostile Senate and needs a nominee with more Republican support .
Democrats expect to lose seats in this fall ’s election , so if another Supreme Court seat comes open next year and Mr. Obama has a substantially thinner margin in the Senate than he has today , Judge Garland would be an obvious choice .
As for Ms. Kagan , strategists on both sides anticipate a fight over her confirmation but not necessarily an all - out war .
The White House hopes the Senate Judiciary Committee can hold hearings before July 4 , but some Congressional aides were skeptical .
Either way , Democrats want Ms. Kagan confirmed by the August recess so she can join the court for the start of its new term in October .
A New Yorker who grew up in Manhattan , Ms. Kagan earned degrees from Princeton , Oxford and Harvard Law School , worked briefly in private practice , clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , served as a Senate staff member and worked as a White House lawyer and domestic policy aide under President Bill Clinton .
She was nominated for an appeals court judgeship in 1999 , but the Senate never voted on her nomination .
She has been a trailblazer along the way , not only as the first woman to run Harvard Law School but also as the first woman to serve as solicitor general .
Her inexperience as a judge makes her a rarity in modern times , but until the 1970s many Supreme Court justices came from outside the judiciary , including senators , governors , cabinet secretaries and even a former president .
If the Senate confirms Ms. Kagan , who is Jewish , the Supreme Court for the first time will have no Protestant members .
In that case , the court would be composed of six justices who are Catholic and three who are Jewish .
It also would mean that every member of the court had studied law at Harvard or Yale .
Like her former boss , Justice Marshall , who was the last solicitor general to go directly to the Supreme Court , Ms. Kagan may be forced to recuse herself during her early time on the bench because of her participation in a number of cases coming before the justices .
Tom Goldstein , publisher of ScotusBlog , a Web site that follows the court , estimated that she would have to sit out on 13 to 15 matters .
Mr. Whelan argued that it would be significantly more than that .

It is , in essence , an attempt to wake Christians up to the fact that the u201 Cgodu201D of democracy results in a situation where immoral people can force everyone to comply with their edicts .
u201 CGovernment , even when sanctified by a majority vote , cannot turn an otherwise immoral act into a moral act.u201D Amen .
Government under democracy is nothing more than legalized theft on a massive scale , the Kennedy brothers say in their Rothbardian analysis of the state .

Many Christians misread Jesus ’s command , u201 CRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’s , and to God the things that are Gods , u201D they write .
What Jesus said was NOT to obey ALL of Caesar ’s commands , but only to u201 Crender unto Caesar things that belong to the realm of government , obey [ only ] legitimate laws enacted by government . . .u201D For u201 Cthe larger the government the greater harm it will eventually do to society ’s morals . . . . the only way to maintain a moral community is to keep the corrosive power of government at a minimum .
u201D
The Kennedys embrace the Rothbardian principle of self - ownership as u201 Cthe first principle of human liberty .
u201D Liberty u201 Cis based on the principle of self - ownership and personal accountability .
Human liberty is indispensable for the promotion , development , and maintenance of a prosperous , peaceful and moral society .
u201D
The problem with democracy is that human liberty is anathema to it , for u201 Cpoliticians , the ruling elite who control government , do not want people to become self - reliant .
u201D
They want us all to be reliant on them .
They want us to be their tax slaves , cannon fodder , and experimental laboratory rats .
u201C[ C] ommunities composed of strong and self - reliant families pose a significant barrier to the envy and greed of politicians and those closely connected to the political ruling elite .

Nullifying Tyranny lays out the classic case for limited constitutional government : u201CThe primary function of government indeed the only legitimate function for government is to protect citizens ’ property rights .u201D
The authors note that in the 1840s , John C. Calhoun identified the tipping point of where , in a democracy , the u201 Ctax consumersu201D come to outnumber the taxpayers .
At that point , u201 Cgovernment becomes the instrument for legalized looting of the dwindling , law - abiding , moral , productive element .
u201D
We become ACORN Nation , in other words .
Moreover , government is inherently a criminal enterprise , for u201 Cgovernment agents have the ability to do things to citizens that , were the agents not part of the government , they would be seized by the local law enforcement service and thrown into jail .

What Has Government Do ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 1.83 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 08:05 EST - Details )
Unlike almost all conservatives and libertarians who make the case for limited constitutional government , the Kennedy brothers are not so naïve as to believe that the document could ever be self - enforcing .
u201CTime has demonstrated the folly of this argument , u201D they write .
They are Jeffersonians , and believe as Jefferson did that the only way such a document could ever conceivably be enforced is through political communities organized at the state and local level .
Like past generations of Jeffersonians , they understand the absurdity of believing that the federal government could ever be trusted , through its u201 Csupremeu201D court , to faithfully enforce the constitutional limitations on its own powers .
Nullification and secession or the threat of secession are the only possible means of enforcing a written constitution .
Addressing the Lincoln Cult and other champions of centralized federal power , the authors write that u201CSlavery and racial segregation are no longer enforceable by law . . . .
Anyone today who attempts to deride States ’
Rights due to its historical association with slavery or racial segregation should be dismissed as one seeking Federal supremacy in order to force his will upon u2018 we the people ’ of the sovereign community . . .u201D ( emphasis added ) .
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
The Kennedy brothers echo F.A. Hayek ’s dictum from The Road to Serfdom that , under socialism , u201 Cthe worst rise to the top.u201D
This is also true in democracies in general , they say .
In a democracy , u201CSuccessful leaders . . . tend to be those who are not hindered by strong moral principles .
u201D
That is because in a democracy , successful political candidates must do three immoral things : u201 Cpromise to take money away from those who honestly earned it . . . and give it to those who have no legal right to itu201D ; u201 Cmake promises that most likely will not be keptu201D ; and grant financial favors to individuals and groups who merely provide the financing for the winning campaign .
u201COnly an unprincipled person can successfully piece together majority votes in a legislature made up of numerous conflicting special interest groups .
u201D
The final chapter of Nullifying Tyranny makes a case for local citizen activism that can resurrect states ’ rights as a means of implementing nullification .
Most importantly , the chapter answers six major objections to their proposal to amend the Constitution to resurrect state sovereignty .
( In nutshell form , these are : u201CWe ’ll never get three fourths of the states to agreeu201D ; u201CCa n’t we just rely on good , honest people to get elected ?
u201D ; u201 Cthe special interests are too powerfulu201D ; u201CChristians should not mix politics and religionu201D ; u201CCa n’t we just elect u2018good conservatives ’ to Congress ?
u201D ; and u201CYour proposal would weaken the federal government ; who then would protect us ?
u201D
The book ends with four addendums , including a commentary on u201CBoom - Bust Economicsu201D that is based on Murray Rothbard ’s What Has Government Done to Our Money ?
And Tom Woods ’ Meltdown : A Free -Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed , the Economy Tanked , and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse .
Christians who believe that all that needs to be done is to elect good , Bible - believing Republicans are deluding themselves , say the Kennedy brothers , for u201 Cthe Republican Party is just as wedded to the status quo as the Democratic Partyu201D and u201 Cboth parties can be counted on to do whatever it takes to maintain the ruling elite ’s control and parasitic use of Federal power .

Amateur laser construction ( building lasers from raw materials rather than from laser components ) .
Extensive material on getting started in this exciting and challenging pastime ( often a great deal of time ! ) as well as complete descriptions - with diagrams - of the home - built lasers from the Scientific American " Amateur Scientist " columns ( and the collection " Light and its Uses " ) and other sources .
Sam's Laser FAQ was developed to provide a unique resource for experimenters and hobbyists - as well as just plain old basement tinkerers .
To the best of my knowledge , nothing as comprehensive has ever been available anywhere else in the explored universe ( and almost certainly beyond ) .
If this was what you were looking for , your search is over ! :-)

A Word About These Pages Sam's Laser FAQ is declared to be a fluff - free zone !
There will be no unnecessary , superfluous , or useless graphics of any kind - including but not limited to : dancing , gyrating , or other animated icons , colored textured backgrounds that are impossible to read through , or forced downloading of bit intense pictures that may be of no interest to you .
Nor , will I ever expect you to use a particular brand of Web browser to be able to effectively access these pages .
There are and never will be any advertisements , cookies , or other impositions on your time and space .
In the time that it may take wading through a single monstrosity of the professional Web page designers at other sites , you will be able to find out what you want to know , when you want to know it !
What a concept . :-)
( Note , however , that your browser needs to be configured properly to make sense of the many ASCII diagrams , schematics , and tables .
See the document : Suggested Browser Settings for font and other related information . )
In return for this gold mine of information , please make a serious effort to find the answers to your questions before contacting me .
It may take just a wee bit of effort and could stress a few neurons in the process , but there is an excellent chance that what you seek is covered here .
Should you be really stuck - or just want to discuss lasers , I will respond to email in a timely manner .
However , if your questions indicate that you have n't even gotten past the Welcome Page , AND I am in a good mood , you will get a somewhat polite reply to read the appropriate chapter (s ) of the FAQ .
On the other hand , if it is a bad day , and you are really really lucky , you will probably be ignored .
Do n't get me wrong - I enjoy discussing lasers with laser enthusiasts and novices alike , and will be happy to do so at almost any hour of the day or night .
However , if you 're seeking some basic information , I would really really appreciate it if you do at least a bit of your homework first .
In any case , if you do email me , I expect to be able to hit the reply key for my mail program and not get bounced email .
I will not attempt to unjumble any anti-SPAM email addresses !
I have posted over 20,000 articles to the USENET newsgroups using my true email address .
And , you wo n't pick up SPAM via my private email anyhow .
Even computer viruses avoid my address book since it's on a unix system ! )
Yes , SPAM is a pain but I tolerate the small amount I get resulting from postings so others will not be inconvenienced .
However , due to the increasing amount of SPAM via repairfaq.org email addresses , I have decided to require all initial email contact from the FAQs to be via the Feedback Form on the Sci.
Electronics .
Repair FAQ Email Links Page .
( At some point my repairfaq.org email address will cease to function . )
Any reply from me will have a valid email address to use for future correspondance .
My apologies but I 've already made so many millions from all those get rich quick schemes that I 've run out of places to put it all . :)
Note : I NEVER send email attachments without prior contact .
If you receive an unsolicited message supposedly from one of my addresses with any sort of attachment , it is bogus and possibly a virus - someone 's address book includes my address and their computer is infected .
Send me the complete headers and I 'll attempt to check it or just hit the delete key .

A Somewhat Polite Gripe About Professional Web Sites
One of the most time consuming and annoying parts of maintaining the Sci. Electronics .
Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ is attempting to keep the outside links up to date .
Why does it seem that most professional Web site designers are programmed by their genes to rework the directory structure of their Web sites every 26 microseconds ???
Is n't this totally counterproductive from a business point of view ?
Links that people have painstakingly set up stop working with " Error 404 " or " Server not Found " and no hint of where they went or often if the company even still exists .
So countless person millenia are wasted attempting to relocate them ?
How many just give up and take their business elsewhere ?
Does it really make sense to annoy your customers ?
Granted , personal
Web sites that move from one ISP to another due to lower costs or whatever may not have the luxury of being able to retain forwarding links .
But businesses and organizations should not have this issue .
In all fairness , there are a few - but very few compared to what 's out there - who do either provide direct forwarding links , or at least attempt to redirect to an appropriate Web page .
However , the vast majority would seem to take the attitude that the Web site is there to show off the skills of the Web site designer , and not for the users of the information .
But perhaps there may be some hope for it seems that the older a Web site is , the more likely it will be to maintain its structure in the future .

Navigating Sam's Laser FAQ
Under ideal conditions , Sam's Laser FAQ would be in a single file and your access to it would be via a 100 GB /s link .
In a few years , such capabilities may appear primitive but for now , one can only dream of avoiding the World Wide Wait . :)
Therefore , the organization of these pages ends up being a compromise .
If you have the space , installing a local copy of Sam's Laser FAQ on a reasonably fast computer would be best ( though you lose out on automatic updates ) .
See : Sam's Laser FAQ Local Installation for details .
The total size ( V16.50 ) is approximately 141 MB ( about 14 MB of text , the remainder graphics ) .
Sam's Laser FAQ is divided into chapters and sections .
Except for the introductory material including the Table of Contents ( ToC ) , each chapter is a separate file and has its own Sub - Table of Contents ( Sub - ToC )
Anything smaller than a chapter is called a section and has its own header and link from the chapter 's Sub - ToC .
Multiple sections may be grouped where they are related to one topic or related topics .
For the most part , there are no nested text files .
With one or two possible exceptions , the only files below the text files are those for diagrams and photos .
To minimize download time , there are no in - line graphics anywhere except the Laser Equipment Gallery where relaxation is encouraged . :)
Links to return to the ToC are located at the beginning of every chapter and links to return to its Sub - ToC ( top of page ) are located at the end of the chapter as well as between major sections .
There is also a link at the end of every chapter to the next chapter .
Hyperlinks within the text will either be to other chapters or sections of Sam's Laser FAQ ( in which case they will generally be preceded with " chapter : " or " section : " as appropriate ) or to other pages on this Web site or elsewhere .
All local links have complete URLs including the filename so it is possible to tell if the link is to some other page ( if the filename does n't match the one currently being read ) .
All of Sam's Laser FAQ uses the very simplest HTML .
This is partly because I have to maintain it and partly to avoid fluff . :)
I have thought about adding a framed entry point which would include the ToC(s ) down the left edge and would be interested in any opinions you may have on this and other formatting issues .
I realize that a fast search facility would be really nice .
Eventually , I may have one ( I refuse to use free search engines that impose advertising .
They tend to be too slow anyhow . )
In the meantime , realize that you can always use Ctrl - F in your browser to search any single document .
The two special files : Sam's Laser FAQ Expanded ToC and Sam's Laser FAQ Comprehensive Table of Contents provide a means of using this technique to find desired topics with a minimum of effort .
You can also use the search engine on the Drexel S.E.R FAQ Mirror Site .
However , if someone would offer to provide a fast non-commercial search engine that I can just drop in with near zero effort , please contact me me via the Sci.

Computer Resources for FAQ Development
Most of the text / html content for the Sci. Electronics .
Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ is developed in emacs on a unix system via telnet / ssh .
While some people may consider such an arrangement archaic , this allows for rapid creation and editing , accessibility to the original files from anywhere in the Universe via an Internet connection , less need to upload or download files to my PC , and professionally managed system maintenance , upgrades , and backup .
Sounds like the newest Cloud services , huh ?
But I 've been doing it that way for decades .
I currently have access to accounts at the University of Pennsylvania ( UPenn ) , Drexel University ( though this one is temporarily unavailable ) , and a third site that I keep low key for private use .
These are used to create , edit , and test the material in the Sci. Electronics .
Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ .
The primary account I use for FAQ development is at UPenn and this seems to be secure for the moment the situation can change from one year to the next .
The Drexel computer is probably reliable as far as a long term relationship but for some reason , USENET access is limited and posting does n't seem to work at all .
Therefore , while not critical for the near future , I am always looking for access to 1 or 2 additional unix or linux systems , preferably at academic institutions like colleges or universities , but I will also consider other types of not - for - profit organizations .
For obvious reasons , I really do not want to do this in association with anything commercial .
My needs are modest : 5 GB of disk space , telnet or ssh , ftp or sftp , emacs / gnus read / post , muttmail , and publicly accessible Web space .
Most of what I do is editing and email so processing requirements are modest and should n't impact other activities .
However , a reliable supported environment is critical to my sanity so your personal server farm is n't something of much interest . :)
I do not want and will not accept monetary contributions for this effort .
But , a way to help the FAQ development would be to provide stable computer access .
If you know of , or are able to offer such a resource , please contact me via the Sci. Electronics .
Repair FAQ Email Links Page .
However , I really only am interested in something that 's likely to remain stable 10 years out , not an ancient PC running in the crawl space under your back porch . :)
In return , of course , you get a local copy of the absolutely latest and greatest versions of the FAQs ( and space permitting ) , all the associated ancillary material .
And , of course , priority email replies to technical questions !
Thank you ! :)

In need of summer TV , I decided to test out the new ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars .
Hey , it ’s been a Twitter trending topic for the last day .
It must be worth watching , right ?
The Tuesday - night show is based on a series of books by Sara Shepard .
It centers on a group of four very popular high school girls in the wealthy white town of Rosewood .
They spend their time shopping , gossiping , sneaking shots of alcohol and treating less popular girls poorly –normal “ girl ” activities .
Their clique disbands , however , when one of the girls goes missing .
A year later , the four remaining girls rekindle their friendship when they begin receiving mysterious texts and emails threatening to make public their deepest secrets from , it seems , their missing friend .
Except her body has just been found .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03uwFedQbfI
The tag line for the show is , “ Never trust a pretty girl with an ugly secret ” – which begs the immediate question :
Are ugly girls equipped to handle ugly secrets , or are they equally untrustworthy , or are they so invisible nobody at ABC Family knows ?
After surviving the first two episodes , I can say that only morbid curiosity kept me watching , because Pretty Little Liars is as harmfully sexist as its tag line .
The take - away message seems to be that pretty girls should n’t worry themselves with issues bigger than their purses , else there will be consequences .
The “ pretty girls are stupid ” myth is prevalent throughout , along with some other decidedly anti-woman content .
Here are the Top Five Anti-Women Myths espoused by Pretty Little Liars .
1 . A woman ’s primary source of power lies between her legs ; sex is a commodity .
The mother of one of the girls ( Hanna ) promises sex to a cop so her daughter wo n’t be prosecuted for shoplifting tarnish their reputations ( “ In a small town like this , what people think about you matters … I buy you everything you need to be popular . ” )
After delivering on her end , the cop sticks around without , it seems , Mom ’s consent .
For this show , the price of a misdemeanor is the loss of consent and autonomy .
2. Women are vapid , emotional creatures who ca n’t be trusted , young women even more so .
Aria , the show ’s central character , has been harboring her father ’s secret :
He had an affair .
When her mom demands an explanation for her and her father ’s strained relationship , her father ’s response is ,
She ’s a teenaged girl … they ’re all moody and unpredictable .
3. Bisexuality just means you ’re confused .
Emily is questioning her sexuality .
Her plight has the potential to be impactful , but the show employs a male - gaze - centric ‘ girl - on - girl ’ vibe .
Emily will do anything –even engage in excessive PDA with her boyfriend when she ’s uncomfortable with it –to not challenge the status quo .
We are led to believe that Emily is either a lesbian or simply confused ; the show does not ( as of yet ) give space to a narrative of bisexuality .
4 . Bad girls should be punished .
Ali , the ultimate bad girl , the Queen Bee of the school and of her clique , is dead –the ultimate punishment .
The other girls are now haunted for their secrets , all of which involve their own mistakes .
5 . A woman ’s worth is the sum total of her appearance , social status and man on whose arm she hangs .
The opening credits are a montage of lip gloss , nail polish , eye makeup , hair curls and high heels .
The show seems to almost be fearful of a loss of traditional femininity in our society , and it compensates by relegating all the characters to hyper - feminine roles .
Looks like I ’m back to searching for a new summer show .
Any suggestions ?
What do you think of ABC Family ’s “ Pretty Little Liars ? ”
Can you find additional anti-women stereotypes ?
Leave them in the comments below !
Anatomy of a Street Groping
I know what happened and in the broadest sense I know why .
But I do n’t know how .
I ’ll get back to that .
What happened is that my friend Kendall wanted a fucking taco , and what she got was nonconsensually groped by four men she did not know .
Lots of men get very upset when someone points out that women have reasons to treat them all as potential assailants .
Men are not all rapists ; in fact , the vast majority of sexual assault is committed by a small group of repeat offenders .
It would be great if we all could tell who they were just by looking at them .
It would be great for everyone but the predators .
But we can ’t .
And women , for whom the stakes are high , may take the approach that I tell my kids to take towards dogs : if you do n’t know them , you ca n’t trust them .
( Worse , the men who are most dangerous to women are not the strangers , but the ones they know , at least a bit . )
Five * men stood outside a bar on the Lower East Side .
It was late and they had presumably been drinking , so she braced herself for street harrassment : whistles , calls , threats framed as offers .
What she was n’t prepared for was this ( posted with permission ) :
They were just a normal group of dudes standing outside a bar .
As I approached , they started doing the typical catcall bullshit which I pretended to ignore , but when I actually walked through , fucking arms started extending like some weird sci - fi movie and it was like slow - mo where I was thinking “… ooohhhh hellllll noooooooo …..??? ” .
And then , sure as shit , those arms touched me : left arm , left lower hip , right shoulder , right middle back / waist .
I had already had a really shit night and was so annoyed with everything that I just charged on , too angry , in my walking groove , and focused on getting tacos to want to raise a fuss , but now that it ’s the next morning , I totally wish I ’d turned around and gone apeshit on them .
So that ’s what happened .
Kendall is not alone ; probably every woman I know has street harrassment stories .
Recently , Amanda
Hess blogged the NBC local ’s interview with Miss DC Jen Corey , who is speaking out about public sexual assault .
And the why is simple enough .
We live in the culture that frames women as bodies whose purpose is sexual availability to men , or secondarily reproduction .
The Commodity Model ( for those familiar with my Yes Means Yes essay Toward a Performance Model of Sex ) posits that consent is passive so that the absence of no is consent .
That kind of thinking justifies all sorts of aggression and intrusion .
What I do n’t know is how .
Since the research shows that the actual rapists are a narrow proportion , it ’s unlikely that there are four out of five or so standing together on the street .
I have a theory , though .
My theory is that one of them was the ringleader , that he made up his own mind to violate Kendall ’s boundaries .
Because he ’s a bad guy who likes sexually assaulting women .
The other guys are sheep .
They went along with the social cues because they are easily lead and because the prevailing culture creates the conditions where they can convince themselves that going along with a leader on a sexual assault is okay .
Maybe one guy just stood there .
I do n’t know why ; it ’s possible he knew what they were doing was wrong , but lacked the courage to stand up to and get in the way of the developing situation .
I do n’t know for sure that this is how it happened , but that ’s what I think .
And if I ’m right , there are two implications .
First , the broader cultural narrative that permissions men to treat women ’s bodies like property is the overlay that allows this to happen .
Change that , and the go - along guys will not go along .
More immediately , the second thing is that these guys who are easily led need better leaders .
The cis het men who are one of the guys in this situation need to set an example , to stand up and say that what is going on is wrong .
My guess , and it ’s just a guess , is that if the guy who did n’t participate had said , nice and loud , “ That ’s not right !
Leave her alone ! ” then there would have been one asshole groper and not four .
And then Kendall could have called him out on his bullshit with considerably less concern that she ’d get stomped for standing up for her basic human rights .
( We can not change the predators ; we can only isolate them so that their behavior stands out as aberrant , and requiring response . )
For those of us who are cis het men , that ’s our job .
We can not cede leadership to the bad guys .
We have to lead .
* Numbers approximate ; it all happened very fast .
Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have developed a new gene therapy that is safe and effective in reversing advanced heart failure .
SERCA2a ( produced as MYDICAR® ) is a gene therapy designed to stimulate production of an enzyme that enables the failing heart to pump more effectively .
In a Phase II study , SERCA2a injection through a routine minimally invasive cardiac catheterization was safe and showed clinical benefit in treating this patient population and decreasing the severity of heart failure .
The data were presented recently at the Heart Failure Congress of the European Society of Cardiology in Berlin .
" SERCA2a met the primary endpoints and appears to be safe and effective in people with advanced heart failure , " said trial investigator Jill Kalman , MD , Associate Professor , Medicine , Cardiology , Director of the Cardiomyopathy Program , Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
" There is a significant unmet need for treatments in this patient population , and these data indicate that SERCA2a is a promising option for them . "
The CUPID ( Calcium Up- regulation by Percutaneous administration of gene therapy In cardiac Disease ) trial is a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , which enrolled 39 patients with advanced heart failure to study the safety and efficacy of SERCA2a .
Patients were randomized to receive SERCA2a gene delivery in one of three doses or placebo and were evaluated over six months .
The treatment is delivered directly to the patient 's heart during a routine outpatient catheterization procedure .
Patients in the SERCA2a group demonstrated improvement or stabilization in symptoms , heart function , and severity of heart failure .
They also saw an increase in time between cardiovascular events and a decrease in frequency of events .
SERCA2a was found to be safe , with no increases in adverse events , disease - related events , laboratory abnormalities , or arrhythmias compared to placebo .
SERCA2a was developed by a team led by Roger J. Hajjar , MD , Research Director of Mount Sinai 's Wiener Family Cardiovascular Research Laboratories and the Arthur & Janet Ross Professor of Cardiology , Medicine , and Gene and Cell Medicine , Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
The team discovered the landmark potential of the treatment in 1999 and has been pursuing its potential as a gene therapy target in state - of - the - art specially built pre-clinical laboratories at Mount Sinai .
" Mount Sinai Heart is committed to developing ground - breaking therapies and bringing them from bench to bedside , " said Valentin Fuster , MD , Director of Mount Sinai Heart , the Zena and Michael A. Wiener Cardiovascular Institute and the Marie - Josee and Henry R. Kravis Center for Cardiovascular Health , The Mount Sinai Medical Center .
" We look forward to further study of this important treatment . "
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention , about 5.8 million Americans suffer from heart failure , and 670,000 new cases are diagnosed each year .
One in five people who have heart failure die within one year of diagnosis .
In 2010 , heart failure will cost the United States $ 39.2 billion , including the cost of health care services , medications , and lost productivity .
Heart failure is most often treated with aggressive medical and device therapy , but has no cure .
The most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath , feeling tired , and swelling in the ankles , feet , legs , and sometimes the abdomen .
The CUPID Trial is funded by Celladon Corporation , makers of MYDICAR .
The company was co-founded by Dr. Hajjar who has an equity interest in Celladon Corporation and participates on an Advisory Board .
No matter how committed you are to your dream of becoming a triathlete , having the support of your significant other can make a difference in your results –whether they are joining you on your running path or acting as your cheerleader on the sidelines as you cross the finish line .
This week , I am celebrating my wedding anniversary .
One of the cornerstones of my marriage was built early on when we shared our big dreams with each other without judgment .
Having a partner who supports my dreams has been life - changing .
We are partners in all things , regardless of the amount of work involved .
Everything from the mundane daily household tasks like rinsing the dishes and dealing with the cat box , to how to spend or invest the money we make to best support each other ’s dreams .
I am fortunate in finding someone passionate about their dreams , but I honestly believe his passion for dreaming big makes it easy for him to support my dreams .
Honor each other ’s dreams .
Honoring someone ’s dream is the highest form of love .
The support helps you build a strong platform for taking off and a soft place to land when your plans fall apart .
My husband and I have had many conversations over the years about what dream support should look like .
When I think back on how much dream support I ’ve received from my husband over years , I ’m both shocked and grateful .
He has fully supported my decisions to …
Get fit to become a triathlete :
The first time , early in our relationship when I was into weight lifting , and again as I ran to lose the 80 pounds I ’d accumulated over the years of being an entrepreneur .
: The first time , early in our relationship when I was into weight lifting , and again as I ran to lose the 80 pounds I ’d accumulated over the years of being an entrepreneur .
Start my own business :
Anyone who has supported their partner , financially or emotionally , with any business venture knows this can be stressful on even the best relationships .
: Anyone who has supported their partner , financially or emotionally , with any business venture knows this can be stressful on even the best relationships .
Change my dreams :
Even as my big dreams have shifted a few times ( jewelry - making , multiple streams of income , money - making websites ) until it solidified into becoming a triathlete after the age of 40 .
What does triathlete support look like ?
It depends on what you need .
I ’ve had fascinating conversations with women about the ways their partners have supported them in their dreams .
The type of support depends on what they need to have happen to make room for working on their dream .
It could be watching small children for 2 hours on the weekend , to working on the budget to free up money for the things they ’ve needed to move their dream forward .
The key to getting what you need from your partner for your dream ?
Start with asking them .
For some of us , just suggesting we ask for help causes us to stop working on our dreams .
But nothing changes unless you take a chance
8 Ways to Ask for Big Dream Support
1 . Know what you want
Do you know what your goals are to move forward with your dream ?
If you are n’t sure exactly what you want to accomplish , you can start here with 8WD post on Goal Setting .
2 . Be realistic
Start small .
Do n’t overwhelm yourself with big unrealistic goals .
Start small with steps you ’ll feel more comfortable trying .
As you accomplish small goals you ’ll gain the confidence to stretch yourself with bigger goals .
3 . Be prepared
Be prepared to share your passion for why you want to accomplish your dream to help those who will support you understand how important your dream is to you .
Being vulnerable is not being weak ; it shows how strong you are .
4 . Be direct
Ask for what you will need in precise terms .
Do you need dinner made three times a week so you can work on your dream ?
Maybe the kids will need to be taxied around on Saturday morning while you work on a project .
Here ’s the tip :
Ask for precisely what you need , but do n’t micromanage .
If you are willing to ask for the support , be ready to accept however it is delivered .
5 . Open a dialogue
There is never a perfect time to ask for help .
You know that if you wait until the “ right time , ” that time will never come .
Start a conversation today !
You do n’t have to have all the details hammered out the first time you ask for dream support but start the conversation .
If you are at a loss about how to kick it off , try this statement and see how it goes : “ I want to work on my [ name dream ] , and I have an idea of how you can help . ”
6 . Be flexible
I would love to pursue my dream full - time .
I believe most of us do .
I also know that my husband has an expectation that includes my contributing to the household income .
That means that he can offer support in time , energy , understanding for those late nights and early mornings when I need to run , bike or swim , but I still need to bring money into the household .
7 . Pay it forward
Ask your partner questions about their dreams too !
Has your partner put off pursuing a dream ?
This may be the opportunity to truly create a partnership that supports you both .
8 . Give them a chance to help
You ’ve let your partner know your big dream plans , now let them help .
This may mean holding back on judging their willingness or ways they try to help you .
Give time for responses , understand it might not all come together at once , and you may be pleasantly surprised at how their support grows over time .
Ask for help .
Your big dream deserves it .
Your partner may not know the conversations you have with yourself about how you want your dream to come together .
They ca n’t support you unless you ask for the help you need and share your thoughts .
Even today , heading into another year of marriage , I catch myself pausing to wonder if he will be willing to help me with my next goal to compete in a triathlon requiring distance travel and time off from work .
But he loves to travel and the ability to shoot photographs in new environments .
So I asked over coffee and he said yes .

The party of the itchy fingers continues to show that the GOP family values strealing other people ’s money most of all .
Gov. Charlie Crist personally signed off on his former Republican Party chairman ’s confidential fundraising role with the state party , according to Jim Greer ’s attorney , whose allegation contradicts the governor ’s statement that he " did n’t know anything " about the deal now part of a criminal investigation .
State investigators say Greer and the party ’s former executive director , Delmar W. Johnson III , secretly set up a shell company called Victory Strategies to divert party money and enrich themselves .
Greer was charged Wednesday with fraud and money laundering .
But Greer ’s attorney , Damon Chase , said Saturday that the deal giving them a 10 percent cut of party donations was legal .
What ’s more , Chase said Crist ’s former right - hand man , now U.S. Sen .
George LeMieux , first proposed the idea that they earn a fundraising commission to save the party money and replace the $ 30,000 - a- month contract with fundraiser Meredith O’Rourke .
" You guys work hard .
You deserve it , " Chase said Greer was told by the governor as they played pool in February 2009 at a Palm Beach golf tournament .
Crist , an independent candidate for Florida ’s open U.S. Senate seat , said Saturday that he did n’t know about Victory Strategies until after Greer resigned in January .
He said he knew Greer wanted to replace O’Rourke with Johnson , but was unaware that they set up a separate company and that Greer had a stake in it .
" Jim thought a change would be a good idea , and I said , ‘ Whatever you think needs to be done , and if you need to bring in Delmar , that ’s fine , ’ " Crist said .
How could he not have known about Victory Strategies as the head of the party ?
" I ’m the guy in charge of the state , " said Crist , who was in Pensacola on Saturday responding to the Gulf Coast oil spill .
" I ’ve got a state to run , and that ’s my focus . "
LeMieux said it was not true that he came up with the idea for the company .
" I first learned about it when I read about it in the newspapers " earlier this year , he said Saturday .
He said he was only aware that Johnson could earn more money if he met fundraising targets .
For Greer to point a finger at Crist and LeMieux , his political benefactors who stood by him for months amid cries for his ouster , amounts to yet another dramatic twist in a scandal that has tainted the Florida GOP and roiled the 2010 election season … [ emphasis added ]
The first Crackdown was a nice surprise .
It came seemingly out of nowhere and offered up fun , over - the - top , open - world gameplay that was a refreshing change of pace .
You could throw cars and climb to the top of skyscrapers .
It was a game that truly made you feel like an overpowered superhero .
So how do you top that feeling of power and freedom ?
Simple : just add zombies .
The new game takes place in the same fictional Pacific City and you once again take control of a superhuman officer from The Agency .
The city is still overrun with gun-toting gangs , but there is another menace running rampant : mutants .
These genetically altered creatures roam the streets like zombies and add a new dynamic to the gameplay , as they are only affected by certain weapons .
Regular guns still abound and work just fine for taking care of criminals .
But the mutants require special UV weapons that do n't affect normal humans , at least not in the same way .
The UV gun we had the chance to play around with was very effective when it came to taking out mutants , but you could n't kill humans with it .
Instead , it would launch them into the air , temporarily stunning them .
It 's a great tool for giving yourself some breathing room when there 's a large number of enemies surrounding you .
But , of course , the real joy of fighting against zombie - like creatures comes from mowing down the hordes .
And Crackdown 2 lets you do this in spades .
At one point during the demo — which consisted of the first 45 minutes or so of the single - player campaign — we were able to make a detour to an area of town where the streets were literally crammed full of mutants .
This led to a fun - filled few minutes that were very reminiscent of the parking lot segments of Dead Rising and involved nothing more than running over mutant after mutant .
The zombie - esque mutants could easily be nothing more than a gimmick , but they actually seem to fit in the Crackdown universe .
In a world filled with super - powered cops leaping from skyscrapers , throwing in a few failed lab experiments does n't seem like much of a stretch .
But aside from the mutants , Crackdown 2 feels almost exactly like its predecessor .
It looks the same , controls the same , and has basically the same set - up .
Instead of reinventing the wheel , the developers at Ruffian Games have decided to stick with what works .
Crackdown 2 goes the bigger - and - better route , though few of these changes were apparent during the early portions of the game we played .
But the developers have promised more customization , enhanced upgrades that let you run faster and jump higher , and new vehicles to race around in .
The buildings are taller and there is even a subterranean element to Pacific City this time around , so the game will maintain its emphasis on verticality , which should please those with the urge to hunt down every last agility orb .
Surprisingly , Crackdown 2 also has an increased focus on story , at least early on in the game .
The opening sequence is presented as a television news broadcast and feels like a deleted scene from Resident Evil Degeneration .
Of course , in a lot of ways the first Crackdown actually benefited by having a bare - bones narrative that helped put a greater emphasis on the action .
Whether or not the expanded story will be a positive for the sequel remains to be seen .
From what we saw , it looks like Crackdown 2 will deliver exactly what made the first game such a sleeper hit , only more .
And with zombies .
The game will be coming exclusively to the Xbox 360 on July 6 .
Crouch bundled in England 's second at Wembley
By Phil McNulty
Chief football writer at Wembley
England 's countdown to the World Cup in South Africa continued with victory against Mexico at Wembley .
Fabio Capello's reshaped side delivered a patchy - and at times unconvincing - performance as England finalise preparations for their opening World Cup encounter against the United States in Rustenburg on 12 June .
Ledley King marked his first England appearance for three years by heading them into an early lead and Peter Crouch kept up his outstanding international scoring record by scrambling home for his 21st goal in 38 appearances before the interval after Wayne Rooney saw his header turned on to the bar by Mexico keeper Oscar Perez .
Mexico took control in between those goals , with England keeper Robert Green enhancing his World Cup claims with a fine save from Carlos Vela , although he was powerless as Carlos Salcido struck the post from the edge of the area .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
England 's defence , disorganised and nervous , had led a charmed life and it was no surprise when Mexico pulled a goal back on the stroke of half time when Leighton Baines failed to complete a goal - line clearance and Guillermo Franco pounced .
Glen Johnson ended Mexico's bid to mount a revival when he produced a superb finish from 20 yards two minutes after the break , and that was effectively the end of England 's anxious moments .
England now have one final friendly against Japan in Austria on Sunday before the squad is named and heads for South Africa , and Capello will still have questions to ponder before he puts his plans in place .
He will have been concerned by England 's defensive vulnerability , but he was able to see injury - plagued Tottenham defender King complete 90 minutes and his worries will be placed in context by the knowledge he has Chelsea duo John Terry and Ashley Cole to recall .
Frank Lampard was also missed in central midfield , where the starting partnership of James Milner and the very disappointing Michael Carrick failed to fire .
PHIL McNULTY BLOG
There are questions for Capello to ponder before he names his final squad on 1 June - and a compelling case for the Italian to try an extra touch of tactical finesse that has been playing on his mind in recent times
And , despite another goalscoring display from Crouch , it will be intriguing to see if Capello is tempted to use Rooney as a lone striker , supported by Steven Gerrard , against Japan .
It is an option worth exploring .
Capello's side inevitably had an experimental appearance - and how it showed in a first period when England were inferior to Mexico and yet somehow established a lead by the interval .
They went ahead after 17 minutes when Mexico failed to deal with England 's traditional strength from set pieces .
Crouch rose to meet Steven Gerrard 's corner and King was unmarked close in to glance a header past keeper Perez .
Rather than helping England settle to their task , the goal was simply the signal for Mexico to emphasise their superiority in possession and demonstrate a sharpness that exposed Capello 's reshuffled rearguard .
Green did well to twice deny Arsenal forward Vela as he broke through the centre of England 's defence , but he relied on the woodwork to come to his rescue on the half - hour when Salcido 's shot hit the outside of the post with the keeper beaten .
England always had the edge in the aerial battles , however , and so it proved again as they doubled their lead after 35 minutes to produce a scoreline that was flattering in the extreme .
Johnson scored a fantastic third Mexico keeper Perez did superbly to turn Rooney 's header onto the bar when he met another Gerrard cross , but Crouch was able to use his height to bundle the rebound over the line .
The goal Mexico deserved for their enterprise came in first - half injury time - and was a perfect illustration of the defensive disorganisation that had plagued England in the first half .
King lost Rafael Marquez , and when Baines failed to clear convincingly on the line Franco scrambled the loose ball in to give Mexico some reward .
Capello made three changes for the start of the second half , with Jamie Carragher ending his England exile by replacing Rio Ferdinand , while Jermain Defoe and Joe Hart came on for Crouch and Green .
If Mexico 's goal offered them hope of a recovery , it was quickly snuffed out in spectacular fashion as right - back Johnson showed his prowess as an attacking force after 47 minutes .
He cut in from the right before curling a measured left - foot finish into the top corner .
Rooney had been having one of his quieter nights for England , but he almost added a fourth with eight minutes left .
He lofted an effort towards goal with the Mexico keeper stranded out of position , but Francisco Javier Rodriguez was perfectly positioned on the line to clear the danger .
England suffered no further scares and took the applause from the Wembley crowd as they said farewell with a lap on honour in their last appearance on home turf before the big kick - off in South Africa .

The drought that has affected the Murray - Darling basin in south - eastern Australia for several years has not only been a disaster for farming .
The indigenous communities have also seen changes in the environment that endanger their ancestral customs , and though the rain has returned , concern for the future has taken hold .
In a documentary made by Aboriginal youths , trained to use a camera by director Carl Kuddell , the elders of the Ngarrindjeri indigenous community explain their fears for the survival of traditions that are deeply rooted in the land and its rivers .
The film , Nukkan .
Kungun .
Yunnan ( See , Listen , Speak ) : Ngarrindjeri's Being Heard , was shot in 2009 and has been selected for this month 's Human Rights Watch International Film Festival in New York .
For the community , which regards itself as a " freshwater people " and lives on the shores of the Lower Lakes and Coorong area , near Lake Alexandrina , the documentary is a chance to get a hearing .
" By freshwater people we mean that traditionally we find our food in the lakes .
It is still part of our culture .
But the shortage of water is gradually upsetting these habits , " says Edie Carter , a youth worker at Meningie , who took part in the film .
The older people at Camp Coorong have never seen anything like it .
As Tom Trevorrow , the head of the Ngarrindjeri Lands and Progress Association , recalls , they were brought up as children in a semi-traditional lifestyle .
It was still possible to go fishing because the river was alive .
He cannot remember ever seeing a drought like the present one .
The poor rainfall since 2006 has reduced rivers to a mere trickle and made the water at the mouth of the Murray river too saline to drink .
Berries on trees are increasingly scarce .
" Before we used to pick berries , but it 's less and less common , " Carter said .
Cultural practices such as basket weaving are affected too .
" It is no longer possible to obtain the necessary rushes .
Until recently we could find them near Meningie , but now it takes two or three hours , " she added .
The elders are deeply concerned .
" In Ngarrindjeri belief we say that the lands and waters is a living body and that we are a part of its existence .
If our lands and waters die then we will die , " Trevorrow said .
According to Ngarrindjeri lore the land and the rivers were created in the " dreamtime " .
A specific myth explains the birth of each mountain or stream .
When rivers or animals disappear it is part of the infinite spiritual cycle that is lost .

Abstract
The theory we will be concerned with in this paper is Martin - Löf 's polymorphic type theory with intensional equality and the universe of small sets .
We will give a different proof of normalization for this theory .
Editor 's note : David Frum writes a weekly column for CNN.com .
A special assistant to President George W. Bush in 2001 - 02 , he is the author of six books , including " Comeback : Conservatism That Can Win Again , " and is the editor of FrumForum .
Even if he were to serve eight years in office , Barack Obama has likely already made all the most important decisions of his presidency .
That 's the nature of the presidency :
The big decisions almost always come early , and then the president must live with them for better or worse .
A president can sometimes reverse course , as Bill Clinton did after he lost Congress in 1994 .
But while that reversal preserved Clinton 's popularity , it destroyed his leadership .
He spent the next six years presiding over a government whose course was steered from Capitol Hill , not the White House .
But big decisions seldom go right or wrong immediately .
There are often months or even years of waiting for the outcome .
And on four of his big decisions , President Obama is waiting now .
Decision 1 was the president 's stimulus plan : a bet that $ 787 billion in borrowed money would cushion and shorten the worst recession since World War II .
Decision 2 was to let the banking industry recuperate on its own sweet time .
During the Swedish banking crisis of 1993 , the government put troubled banks into receivership at once , then quickly relaunched them with clean balance sheets so that they could resume lending .
Obama has chosen a different course ; less radical , but also with a slower recovery time .
Decision 3 was to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan .
Decision 4 was to " go big " on health care -- to enact a sweeping reform rather than fix problems one by one .
As yet , we cannot deliver a final assessment of any of these decisions , although the early returns on decision 1 do not look very favorable .
Like the president , the nation is waiting , too .
More to the point , Obama is waiting for the electorate 's verdict .
The hardest part of the presidency is the waiting .
Over the course of a presidency , a president will make thousands of decisions .
Only a very few will determine whether a presidency succeeds or fails .
And oftentimes , the interval between the decision and the result is measured in months .
We honor those months of waiting when the decision turns out well : Lincoln pacing as he waited for news from Gettysburg , Vicksburg or Atlanta .
Oblivion closes over the long months of waiting for a less positive result : Lyndon Johnson waiting for light at the end of the tunnel in Vietnam , Richard Nixon waiting for Americans to grow weary of Watergate , Jimmy Carter waiting to hear whether his overtures to the Iranian mullahs would liberate U.S. hostages , George H.W. Bush waiting for an economic recovery to materialize in time to win the 1992 election .
Presidents tend to be men of optimistic temperament .
( Think of Ronald Reagan 's joke about the boy shoveling through a mountain of horse manure : " There has to be a pony in here somewhere ! " )
But well before the final disaster arrives , a president has to sense that things are not trending in his direction .
Nearly 18 months into the Obama presidency , the banking system still staggers under bad debt , jobs are not being created in substantial numbers , the news from Afghanistan continues to be bad , and economists are revising the projected cost of the health care plan up and up .
The stimulus plan has protected public - sector employees from layoffs , but it has not sparked private - sector job creation .
In a speech this past week , Sheila Bair , head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said that 11 million American homes are worth less than the value of their mortgages .
So while ( good news ) " only " 2.4 million American homes are currently in foreclosure , another 8.5 million could follow any time their owners get sick of owing more than their home is worth .
In Afghanistan , it 's fair to say that nobody is an optimist .
The generals and the troops do their work professionally , often heroically , but just ask them if they believe the mission will succeed and listen to them hedge and hem .
As for the health care plan , things are deteriorating before our eyes .
Despite promises that people who like their plans will be able to keep them , the administration 's own regulators acknowledge that 51 percent of workers will discover changes in their health coverage as a result of the health care bill .
It 's too early to pronounce definitively that the big Obama decisions are not working .
Obama defenders will say Reagan was not looking too good at the 18 - month mark either and still persevered to ultimate success .
That 's true .
It 's also true that Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter looked bad at 18 months , only to look even worse at 48 months .
In the wonderful phrase of the novelist David Eddie , " They laughed at the Wright brothers .
Of course , they also laughed at all the people before the Wright brothers , the ones who jumped off cliffs frantically waving their wooden wings or clutching their propeller beanies . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum .
A breakthrough in small , high - powered magnets could lead to handheld magnetic resonance scanners with similar capabilities to those of today 's room - sized medical and scientific instruments .
According to a report in MIT Technology Review , Doctor Federico Casanova and colleagues at the Rheinisch - Westfälische Technische Hochschule ( RWTH ) in Aachen have built a 500 - gramme magnet about the size of a D - cell battery which can generate a 0.7 Tesla field .
This is still substantially less than the multi-Tesla fields required for MRI scans , but Casanova thinks that his design could be enhanced up to 2 Tesla in future .
This could mean that a lot of procedures which nowadays involve sending samples off to labs or patients to hospitals could instead be done in the field using devices no bigger than a Star Trek Tricorder .
Doctors or paramedics could use the new portable magno - scanners to check blood or other samples on the spot .
Small , affordable instruments could check drugs and vaccines for quality as they were made .
Archaeologists and other field researchers would be able to analyse finds immediately , rather than waiting until their return - perhaps as a result being able to direct their efforts much more efficiently .
Small nuclear magnetic resonance components might also be a boon to the brain - hurting field of quantum computing , in which boffins seek to make a computer running on qubits which might have any value rather than regular dull bits which are 1 or 0 .
One method under consideration here is the use of the spin state of a molecule as a qubit , which requires the use of very strong magnets .
IBM boffins have built a small 7 - qubit magno - quantum computer in the past , and if such research leads on to bigger things Casanova - style teeny ultramagnets would potentially reduce the size and cost of tomorrow 's quantum computers substantially .
There would also , perhaps , be applications in other areas such as the " cloaking " of warships ' magnetic signature so as to make them safer from mines , and possibly also in plasma rockets able to carry astronauts to Mars in just months .
Not to mention the possibility of building a brainscanning hat ( able to warn of an imminent mistake made by the wearer ) which would actually be portable , unlike the current model which weighs several tons .
Then , it should also be noted that efforts are underway in the US to deploy magnetic - resonance scanners in airports so as to allow people once again to take copious amounts of liquid aboard aeroplanes .
Good stuff all round then : well done those boffins .
The Tech Review piece is here . ®
FOR over a month , Barack Obama watched the oil spill spread over the Gulf of Mexico with the same powerless horror as other Americans .
Finally , lampooned by his countrymen for his impotence , he was spurred into action .
He attacked the only available target — BP — and , to underline the seriousness with which he takes this problem , he gave his first Oval Office address on the subject .
The address got poor reviews ; the attack on BP better ones .
This week the firm bowed to pressure , and announced that it was , in effect , handing over $ 20 billion to the government to pay for compensation and clean - up , as well as cancelling the payment of any dividends this year and setting up a fund — of a mere $ 100 m — to compensate unemployed oil workers .
This may do Mr Obama some good .
Whether it will benefit America is more doubtful .
Businessmen are already gloomy , depressed by the economy and nervous of their president 's attitude towards them .
This episode will not encourage them .
Booted and spurred
There is good reason for Americans to be furious with BP .
The authorities reckon that the oil may be flowing at a rate of 60,000 barrels a day — far more than the company estimated , and the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez every four days .
Efforts to stem the toxic plume have met with only modest success ( see briefing ) .
A permanent solution may be available in August , but only if the drilling of relief wells to intercept and plug the stricken one goes according to plan .
BP already had a miserable safety record in America .
In 2005 an explosion at one of its refineries in Texas killed 15 people .
In 2006 corrosion in its pipelines led to a sizeable spill on Alaska 's North Slope .
Since then , regulators have often fined it for breaking safety standards .
There are indications that BP 's approach to the drilling of the Macondo well was similarly slapdash .
Engineering measures that might have prevented the calamity were not carried out , tests of safety equipment delayed .
The firm 's emergency - response plan spoke of protecting the area 's walruses — an easy task , since there are n't any — and consulting an ecologist who had died in 2005 .
America has a well - developed system for getting companies to pay for the damage they do ; and BP long ago accepted that it would pay in full .
But that was never going to satisfy the country 's corporate bloodlust .
An outfit called Seize BP has organised demonstrations in favour of the expropriation of BP 's assets in 50 cities .
Over 600,000 people have supported a boycott of the firm on Facebook .
Several of BP 's gas ( petrol ) stations have been vandalised .
The politicians , eager as ever to stay in tune with the nation , joined in .
Ken Salazar , the secretary of the interior , vowed to keep the government 's boot on BP 's neck .
At one of the many recent hearings at which BP executives have been hauled over the coals , a Republican congressman suggested that the chairman of BP 's American arm should commit ritual suicide .
Mr Obama said he was looking for arses to kick .
After the macho rhetoric came the demands for cash .
Mr Obama decided to “ inform ” BP that it must put adequate funds to meet all compensation claims into an escrow account beyond its control , although he has no authority to do so .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives , instructed it not to pay a dividend until all claims tied to the spill are settled .
Her fellow Democrats in Congress are trying to raise BP 's liability retroactively — the sort of move America 's courts rightly frown on .
Mr Salazar , on even thinner legal ice , suggested that the government would hold BP accountable not just for the harm directly done by the spill , but also for the jobs lost in the oil business thanks to the freeze on oil drilling in deep water that he himself has imposed .
Investors seem to be worried that the wrath of American officialdom will ruin BP .
They have driven down its value by $ 89 billion since the well erupted , far in excess of all but the most dire forecasts of the ultimate costs of the spill .
Corporate America , normally quick to resist government intrusion , has kept strangely silent , as though businessmen are afraid of the consequences of sticking their heads above the parapet .
The attack on BP seems to have paid off for the administration , in that the firm has caved in to most of its demands .
Mr Obama 's swipes at the company have lent him an unfamiliar air of forcefulness .
And , as everybody in Washington knows , so long as BP meets its commitments , government attempts to meddle in the firm 's management , much less seize its assets , will be rejected by the courts .
So why not keep going ?
Vladimir Obama
For several reasons .
The vitriol has a xenophobic edge : witness the venomous references to “ British Petroleum ” , a name BP dropped in 1998 ( just as well that it dispensed with the name Anglo - Iranian Oil Company even longer ago ) .
Vilifying BP also gets in the way of identifying other culprits , one of which is the government .
BP operates in one of the most regulated industries on earth with some of the most perverse rules , subsidies and incentives .
Shoddy oversight clearly contributed to the spill , and an energy policy which reduced the demand for oil would do more to avert future environmental horrors than fierce retribution .
Mr Obama is not the socialist the right claims he is ( see article ) .
He went out of his way , meeting BP executives on June 16th , to insist that he has no interest in undermining the company 's financial stability .
But his reaction is cementing business leaders ' impression that he is indifferent to their concerns .
If he sees any impropriety in politicians ordering executives about , upstaging the courts and threatening confiscation , he has not said so .
The collapse in BP 's share price suggests that he has convinced the markets that he is an American version of Vladimir Putin , willing to harry firms into doing his bidding .
Nobody should underestimate the scale of BP 's mistake , nor the damage that it has caused .
But if the president does not stand up for due process , he will frighten investors across the board .
The damage to America 's environment is bad enough .
The president risks damaging its economy too .

The American Civil Liberties Union is publicizing its acquisition of a large volume of data relating to civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan , which it has made available on its Web site .
The files , obtained by Freedom of Information
Act request , detail hundreds of cases in which families of the dead filed for compensation after their loved ones were killed by or as a result of coalition forces .

“ The files made public today comprise over 800 claims for compensation or condolence payments submitted to the U.S. Foreign Claims Commissions and the Commander ’s Emergency Response Program by surviving family members of Afghan and Iraqi civilians said to have been killed or injured or to have suffered property damages due to actions by Coalition Forces , ” the group announced in a media advisory .
“ Many of the claims were denied under the so - called “ combat exemption ” to the Foreign Claims Act ( FCA ) , which provides that harm inflicted on residents of foreign countries by U.S. soldiers during combat cannot be compensated under the FCA , even if the victims had no involvement whatsoever in the combat .
The documents reveal that , due to the claim denials , many innocent civilians were not compensated for their harm or were referred to the Commander ’s Emergency Response Program for a discretionary condolence payment that is subject to an automatic $ 2,500 limit per death . ”

ACLU Releases 13,000 Pages Of Government Files That Underscore Flaws In Compensating Victims ’ Families
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NEW YORK Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The American Civil Liberties Union today made public more than 13,000 pages of documents regarding reports of civilians killed or injured by Coalition Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The documents include more than 800 claims for damages by the family members of those killed , including many that were denied , and reveal new details about the flaws in the system for compensating victims ’ families .
The ACLU received the records in response to its September 2007 Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit , which is part of an effort to make more details about the ongoing wars available to the public .
“ With more U.S. forces being sent into civilian areas in Afghanistan , it is critical that the American public be informed about what is at stake , ” said Nasrina Bargzie , cooperating counsel with the ACLU and an attorney at Boies , Schiller & Flexner LLP in Oakland , CA .
“ These newly released records illustrate that innocent civilian victims and their families are still not being appropriately compensated for their losses .
Now that this problem has been brought to light , we hope the Obama administration will be compelled to reform the broken civilian compensation program . ”
The files made public today comprise over 800 claims for compensation or condolence payments submitted to the U.S. Foreign Claims Commissions and the Commander ’s Emergency Response Program by surviving family members of Afghan and Iraqi civilians said to have been killed or injured or to have suffered property damages due to actions by Coalition Forces .
Many of the claims were denied under the so - called “ combat exemption ” to the Foreign Claims Act ( FCA ) , which provides that harm inflicted on residents of foreign countries by U.S. soldiers during combat cannot be compensated under the FCA , even if the victims had no involvement whatsoever in the combat .
The documents reveal that , due to the claim denials , many innocent civilians were not compensated for their harm or were referred to the Commander ’s Emergency Response Program for a discretionary condolence payment that is subject to an automatic $ 2,500 limit per death .

In related litigation , the ACLU is seeking records relating to the government ’s expanded use of predator drones to conduct targeted killings overseas .
That FOIA lawsuit asks for information about the legal basis for drone strikes , as well as the number and rate of civilian casualties caused by the attacks .
“ These records will help the American people comprehend the impact of war on innocent civilians and will allow the public to participate meaningfully in the ongoing debate about these wars , ” said Ben Wizner , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
“ An informed public is a critical part of any democracy .
Releasing the civilian casualty records is a good step towards increasing government transparency .
The Obama administration should continue releasing documents that could inform the public about the critical issues of war . ”

Afghanistan , already the world 's top opium supplier , is now the world 's biggest producer of cannabis , according to United Nations drug experts .
There is large - scale cultivation of the drug in half of the country , resulting in 3,500 tons of hashish worth an estimated £ 61 m annually , according to the first assessment of cannabis in Afghanistan by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime .
It warns that the threat from the drug needs to be dealt with to deny the Taliban the millions they make in protection taxes paid by farmers and drug smugglers .
The focus on opium has resulted in cannabis being overlooked , according to Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of UNODC .
" A concentration of cultivation in the southern part of Afghanistan shows that the Taliban and those insurgents that control the southern parts of the country are not only funding themselves by trafficking opium but also by trafficking cannabis .
It 's the same area . "
Sporadic government crackdowns have merely resulted in a shift in production to the south of the country , with most cannabis now grown in regions where the insurgency is at its strongest .
There are close links with the heroin trade , with more than 67 per cent of cannabis farmers also growing opium , according to the report , which is based on a survey of more than 1,600 villages across the country .
UN experts estimate that 60,000 households are now growing cannabis .
Although cheaper than opium , cannabis can potentially earn a farmer more because it yields twice the quantity of drug per hectare and is cheaper and less labour - intensive to cultivate .
Farmers can earn £ 2,173 per hectare – more than the £ 1,304 they get from opium .
But since cannabis has a short shelf life and is grown only in the summer , when there is less water available , they continue to cultivate opium as their main drug crop .
A British - backed paramilitary unit is hunting down Afghan drug lords as part of a new strategy against the drug trade .
Four helicopters have already been provided by Britain for airborne assault missions by the Afghan Special Narcotics Force , with another two being made available to an Air Interdiction Unit this year .
Targets are being drawn up by an Interagency Operations Co-ordination Centre in Kabul , led by officers from Britain 's Serious Organised Crime Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration .
But efforts are hampered by high levels of corruption and drug use among police , with 68 per cent testing positive for cannabis .

2010 — Current law : 15 percent ; tax hike raise to 31.3 percent
2011 -2012 — 31.3 percent
2013 and beyond — 38.5 percent
The House “ extenders package ” has a pair of tax increases on investment partnerships ( Sec. 411 and 412 ) .
Investment partnerships consist of a “ general partner ” who makes investment decisions for the partnership .
It also consists of “ limited partners ” who contribute money to the partnership .
Limited partners are usually large investors like defined - benefit pension plans , university endowments , and charities .
The two tax hikes in question each involve the general partner .
A general partner is usually compensated under a system known as “ 2 - and - 20 , ” or a similar arrangement .
Under this system , the general partner receives a taxable salary equal to 2 percent of the assets under management ( like all salary , this is taxed at ordinary income tax rates ) .
He also earns a 20 percent share of the profit he can generate for the partnership .
It ’s important to note that this profit share only becomes available after the limited partners have gotten a set return themselves .
The general partner can also sell his ownership interest in the partnership , and would pay capital gains tax on any profit from that sale .
The extenders bill raises the tax rate the general partner pays on capital gains ( either from the sale of the ownership interest , or the sale of partnership investment assets ) from 15 percent today to 38.5 percent in 2013 .
This is done by requiring three - fourths of the capital gain to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates .
Both the capital gain and ordinary tax rates are scheduled to rise in 2011 under the congressional Democrat and Obama budgets .
Additionally , Obamacare imposes an investment surtax of 3.8 percent in 2013 .
The following are the tax rates on these capital gains for each of the next several years :
What will be the result of this 157 percent tax hike on general partners of investment firms ?
One possibility is that the general partner will demand a higher percentage of profits , in order to make himself whole on an after - tax basis .
For example , a partner with a 20 percent share of the profits today might need to be able to claim 30 percent or 40 percent tomorrow in order to get the same after - tax return .
This , in turn , would leave less profits available for the limited partners — defined benefit pension plans , university endowments , and charities .
This tax hike could easily become a tax hike on them , not general partners .
America ’s trading competitors have no such desire to punish savings .
India has no capital gains tax , and the rate is a low 10 percent in China .
Even in the United Kingdom , the rate is only 18 percent .
The ultimate goal of congressional Democrats is clear : piece by piece , they want to tax all capital gains at ordinary income tax rates .
If that happens , the combined federal - state rate on capital gains could easily approach 50 percent — stifling investment in jobs and growth .
Summary : Writing software alone and in a long term sustainable manner requires a lot of discipline .
Upfront planning and avoidance of feature creep can turn a stressful project into a pleasure .
UPDATE : I originally wrote this piece back in 2010 .
I was recently reminded of it and thought it would be good to revive this article from my old blog .
A guide for the solo programmer
I have created a planning and organization process for developing software .
The process works for me .
I need to organize my work ahead of time or I get stuck working on unimportant details .
I have built minimalism into the process .
I tend to work alone .
Solo programming imposes very real limitations on the scope and completeness of software .
One man can only do so much .
My process includes nothing that cannot be found in Worse is Better , The Cathedral and the Bazaar , Paul Graham ’s writing , and Getting Real .
These are well - written and well - known works .
I thought I understood them when I read them , but I was wrong .
It was n’t until recently , after projects stalled and failed due to feature creep , that I understood the essence of the release early , release often idea .
I have attempted to formalize the idea to be more actionable instead of philosophical .
Here is my hard - earned process for writing software .
Note that this is not a strict algorithm .
Sometimes I will apply filters from Step 2 when I am doing experiments in Step 3 .
Choose a purpose .
The software must serve a single purpose .
Clearly defining it will illuminate the entire software process .
For each release : List features .
List out all of the features you want in the software .
Not all of these will make it into the release , but if it is not on this list , it will not make it into the release .
Apply the following filters and transformations , in any order , repeatedly , until there is nothing further to filter out from the list of features .
Break features into subfeatures .
If a feature can be broken into two features , do it .
All features must be atomic .
For instance , an easy one would be if I want to send messages by email and through a web API , that ’s two features .
Rule of thumb : if it can break , it ’s a separate feature .
Eliminate unnecessary features .
Features that are not essential to the purpose are unnecessary .
Features that can be put off until the next version are unnecessary .
In the above example , maybe email can wait until the next release .
If it can wait , it will wait .
You are trying to make a bee line to release .
Fill in “ hidden features ” .
Remember , if it can break , it ’s a feature .
Sometimes there are features that need to be listed because of the existence of other features .
If you support two different communication channels , you need a way to choose between them .
Whatever mechanism presents that choice is a feature , too .
List it .
Simplify features .
If a feature can be done more simply or more easily than what you originally intended , replace it .
The primary way to release quickly is to simplify the release .
Do you really need it to be customizable ?
Design and carry out experiments .
Within your minimal set of features , there are often questions as to the best means of implementation .
The experiments determine the answers to those questions .
Order the features in order of dependency .
The first feature is the one that does not depend on any others .
Dependency is a complex and sneaky issue .
You might say that a function needs a button to activate it .
But the button is useless without the function .
Which depends on which ?
Personally , dependency means dependent on another feature for usefulness .
If I can activate a function in a very simple way ( like immediately when the program starts ) , then that function does not depend on the button .
The button depends on the function for its usefulness .
Sketch out the first remaining feature on paper .
Sketch out the code .
The experiments should have instructed you in how to implement the feature .
Rewrite the code repeatedly , eliminating fluff and abstraction until the code is minimal and perfect .
Type the code in .
Build it and test it .
Make the code rock solid .
Clean it up .
As a solo programmer , you are never going to come back to this code and clean it up .
You wo n’t have time .
You will never have the time to hunt for bugs in this code .
Make sure it works in every possible case .
The code must catch every exception .
It must handle the null case .
The feature is not done until it is unbreakable .
If you are doubting whether it ’s worth your time to work this much on one feature , maybe you should eliminate the feature .
Loop to Step 5 until you run out of features .
Release .
The essence of this process is to follow the release early , release often philosophy by reducing the amount of development between releases .
I mistakenly thought that release often meant “ write code really fast ” in the past .
Now I understand that it means write less but more important code between releases but write it correctly .
Android - based phones outsold the iPhone in the U.S. for the first time last quarter .
Google 's Android - based smartphones accounted for 28 % of smartphone sales , while the iPhone accounted for 21 % , according to market research firm NPD .
Research
In Motion outsold both of them , and had 36 % of the sales .
In a press release , NPD analyst Ross Rubin attributed the strong sales of RIM and Android phones to Verizon 's buy - one - get - one deals .
Android is now on dozens of handsets on each major carrier , so it makes sense that it leapt passed the iPhone .
This data only reinforces our belief that Apple needs to start selling its phones at Verizon Wireless as soon as possible .

The revised estimates for the flow of oil from the Deepwater Horizon ( DWH ) well have continued to increase .
The volume that is being captured daily has apparently stabilized , at close to the capacity available .
But the doubling of the flow estimates and further increases have caught everyone ’s attention .
Certainly looking at the amount captured on video seemed to show a significant reduction in the amount that was leaking out of the bottom of the cap , but if the vents remain open ( and I have seen one that still was earlier ) then the amount that is not being captured could still be a significant percentage of the flow .
The Department of Energy now has a website that shows a number of documents relating to the DWH site .
They include this graphic that illustrates the relatively tight fit of the cap around the riser .
In this post , I ’ll talk about the BOP pressure measurements and Top Kill .
Oh , and a little bit about money .
DOE illustration of the cap on the riser
The most recent reports of flow from the well are :
On June 19th , total oil recovered was approx .
21,040 barrels :
• approx .
11,050 barrels of oil were collected ,
• approx .
9,990 barrels of oil were flared ,
and approx .
43.4 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared .
Total oil recovered from both the LMRP Cap and Q4000 systems since they were implemented is approx .
249,500 barrels .
As previously reported , volumes were slightly lower on the 19th due to the Enterprise shutdown to clean a flame arrestor and passing of a lightning storm .
I had hoped that would give more of an illustration of the flow path through the BOP but it does n’t show anything that has n’t been posted here on that issue , at least as far as I can see .
What it does have , however , is a table that shows the measured pressures at different heights within the BOP , as of 25th of May .
Pressures along the BOP on May 25th ( DOE )
There are also more details of the steps in the Top Kill Operation .
Test 1 – Pumped 13,100 bbls of 16.4 ppg at 53 bpm . ( May 26 )
Test 2 – Pumped 6,800 bbls of 16.4 ppg , 25 bpm with 15 shots of bridging materials .
( May 27 )
Test 3 – Pumped 9,800 bbls of 16.4 ppg mud at greater than 70 bpm , with 2 shots of bridging materials .
( May 28 )
Which actually raises a couple of questions .
A flow of 17,000 bbl / day is 12 bbl / minute .
If I remember there were at least a couple of statements that implied that they had stopped the well flowing oil , and brought it into some sort of balance .
One wonders if that were true , and for which , if any of these tests that was accurate .
The reason for the question , going back to the post I wrote on why Top Kill might have failed , is that the bottom of the drill pipe is 3,367 ft below the BOP .
While injecting “ junk ” to seal the well might have had some impact on the annulus around the DP , unless they could first carry the sealing particles down to the bottom of the DP , and then have them be carried back up the pipe , they could n’t seal the leak in the crimped BP .
( And that depends in part on the specific gravities they got in the admixture going down the well ) .
The effectiveness also depends on the size consist of the bridging materials .
The higher numbers now being quoted have led the Coastguard to demand a better plan for dealing with the spill .
The Coast Guard has told BP that its proposed plan for containing the runaway Deepwater Horizon well does not take into account new higher estimates of how much oil is gushing into the Gulf of Mexico .
The Coast Guard demanded that the company provide a more aggressive plan within 48 hours .
And that time is about up .
( Should I wonder whatever happened to the team of experts who were coming up with an alternative ? )
He ( President Obama ) said US Energy Secretary Steven Chu was leading a team of " the world 's top scientists , engineers and experts " in devising a contingency plan should the " top kill " attempt fail .
The Administration plan , at the moment , seems to be to get as much cash out of BP as possible , as soon as possible .
In an effort to seize greater control of the gulf oil catastrophe , President Obama is prepared to compel BP executives to set up a multibillion - dollar escrow account to pay damage claims in the region , a senior White House official said Sunday .
. . . . . .
In a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Sunday , 54 senators , nearly the entire Democratic caucus , called on the company to set aside $ 20 billion for cleanup and damages , to be administered by an independent trustee .
But as far as BP coming up with a new plan . . .
Jon Pack , a BP spokesman , said Sunday that the company would respond in a " very timely manner " to the Coast Guard 's demand to come up with a better plan to contain the oil , but he added that the company would not make the plan public .
BP 's board of directors was scheduled to meet Monday , according to Pack , who would not divulge the agenda .
Given that BP has about $ 7 billion in available cash , with a number of other obligations ( the fine for the spill for starters ) there comes a point where even with the best will in the world , BP is going to run out of the cash that more and more folk are demanding .
For example the Administration is now demanding that BP carry all the folk that have been put out of work by the drilling moratorium .
A ban on deep - water drilling is set to continue for six months .
Salazar has said companies will be able to drill in water depths less than 500 feet once they comply with newly issued safeguards and other yet - to - be- unveiled rules for exploration plans and environmental studies .
But it could take weeks — or months — for companies to make the changes and federal regulators to approve them .
You ca n’t comply with “ yet - to - be- unveiled rules ” until they are unveiled .
The impact of this is going to extend well beyond just the drilling companies themselves , BP has drawn a line over paying that at the moment , but we ’ll see what pressure the President can bring to bear this week , when he meets with them .
But I will close by re-iterating the concern that I expressed when I wrote about the Hurricane season approaching .
The way that this is developing does n’t bode well for the ability of the industry to be able to bounce back from any serious damage to Gulf rigs following a Hurricane , of the sort we saw in 2005 .
If the Gulf supply is compromised , and unable to recover because of regulation , this could be a very interesting election season .
And one last thing , for those who wondered what a suction pile is , since one has just been fielded .
Here is a graphic , showing you how it is used .
It would also appear that the Loch Rannoch has made it to the site .
This is one of the transfer tankers that will be used to collect oil from the more permanent risers as they get installed this week .

Summary
These recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) update the previous recommendations on human rabies prevention ( CDC .
Human rabies prevention --- United States , 1999 : recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices .
MMWR 1999 ;48 [ No. RR - 1 ] ) and reflect the status of rabies and antirabies biologics in the United States .
This statement 1 ) provides updated information on human and animal rabies epidemiology ; 2 ) summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness / efficacy , immunogenicity , and safety of rabies biologics ; 3 ) presents new information on the cost - effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis ; 4 ) presents recommendations for rabies postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis ; and 5 ) presents information regarding treatment considerations for human rabies patients .
These recommendations involve no substantial changes to the recommended approach for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis .
ACIP recommends that prophylaxis for the prevention of rabies in humans exposed to rabies virus should include prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by passive rabies immunization with human rabies immune globulin ( HRIG ) and vaccination with a cell culture rabies vaccine .
For persons who have never been vaccinated against rabies , postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody ( HRIG ) and vaccine ( human diploid cell vaccine [ HDCV ] or purified chick embryo cell vaccine [ PCECV ] ) .
Persons who have ever previously received complete vaccination regimens ( pre-exposure or postexposure ) with a cell culture vaccine or persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer should receive only 2 doses of vaccine : one on day 0 ( as soon as the exposure is recognized and administration of vaccine can be arranged ) and the second on day 3 .
HRIG is administered only once ( i.e. , at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis ) to previously unvaccinated persons to provide immediate , passive , rabies virus neutralizing antibody coverage until the patient responds to HDCV or PCECV by actively producing antibodies .
A regimen of 5 1 - mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated persons .
The first dose of the 5 - dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure ( day 0 ) .
Additional doses should then be administered on days 3 , 7 , 14 , and 28 after the first vaccination .
Rabies pre-exposure vaccination should include three 1.0 - mL injections of HDCV or PCECV administered intramuscularly ( one injection per day on days 0 , 7 , and 21 or 28 ) .
Modifications were made to the language of the guidelines to clarify the recommendations and better specify the situations in which rabies post - and pre-exposure prophylaxis should be administered .
No new rabies biologics are presented , and no changes were made to the vaccination schedules .
However , rabies vaccine adsorbed ( RVA , Bioport Corporation ) is no longer available for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis , and intradermal pre-exposure prophylaxis is no longer recommended because it is not available in the United States .
Introduction
Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by RNA viruses in the Family Rhabdoviridae , Genus Lyssavirus ( 1 - - 4 ) .
Virus is typically present in the saliva of clinically ill mammals and is transmitted through a bite .
After entering the central nervous system of the next host , the virus causes an acute , progressive encephalomyelitis that is almost always fatal .
The incubation period in humans is usually several weeks to months , but ranges from days to years .
As a result of improved canine vaccination programs and stray animal control , a marked decrease in domestic animal rabies cases in the United States occurred after World War II .
This decline led to a substantial decrease in indigenously acquired rabies among humans ( 5 ) .
In 1946 , a total of 8,384 indigenous rabies cases were reported among dogs and 33 cases in humans .
In 2006 , a total of 79 cases of rabies were reported in domestic dogs , none of which was attributed to enzootic dog - to - dog transmission , and three cases were reported in humans ( 6 ) .
The infectious sources of the 79 cases in dogs were wildlife reservoirs or dogs that were translocated from localities where canine rabies virus variants still circulate .
None of the 2006 human rabies cases was acquired from indigenous domestic animals ( 6 ) .
Thus , the likelihood of human exposure to a rabid domestic animal in the United States has decreased substantially .
However , one of the three human rabies cases diagnosed in 2006 was associated with a dog bite that occurred in the Philippines , where canine rabies is enzootic .
The risk for reintroduction from abroad remains ( 7 ) .
International travelers to areas where canine rabies remains enzootic are at risk for exposure to rabies from domestic and feral dogs .
Unlike the situation in developing countries , wild animals are the most important potential source of infection for both humans and domestic animals in the United States .
Most reported cases of rabies occur among carnivores , primarily raccoons , skunks , and foxes and various species of bats .
Rabies among insectivorous bats occurs throughout the continental United States .
Hawaii remains consistently rabies - free .
For the past several decades , the majority of naturally acquired , indigenous human rabies cases in the United States have resulted from variants of rabies viruses associated with insectivorous bats ( 5 ) .
The lone human case reported in the United States during 2005 and two of the three human rabies cases in 2006 were attributed to bat exposures ( 6,8 ) .
During 2004 , two of the eight human rabies cases resulted from bat exposures .
One of these rabies patients recovered and remains the only rabies patient to have survived without the administration of rabies vaccination ( 9 ) .
Rabies was not immediately recognized as the cause of death in the other 2004 patient , and organs and a vascular graft from this patient were transplanted into four persons , resulting in clinical rabies and death in all of the recipients ( 10 ) .
Approximately 16,000 - - 39,000 persons come in contact with potentially rabid animals and receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis each year ( 11 ) .
To appropriately manage potential human exposures to rabies , the risk for infection must be accurately assessed .
Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency , not a medical emergency , but decisions must not be delayed .
Prophylaxis is occasionally complicated by adverse reactions , but these reactions are rarely severe ( 12 - - 16 ) .
For these recommendations , data on the safety and efficacy of active and passive rabies vaccination were derived from both human and animal studies .
Because controlled human trials cannot be performed , studies describing extensive field experience and immunogenicity studies from certain areas of the world were reviewed .
These studies indicated that postexposure prophylaxis combining wound treatment , local infiltration of rabies immune globulin ( RIG ) , and vaccination is uniformly effective when appropriately administered ( 17 - - 22 ) .
However , rabies has occasionally developed among humans when key elements of the rabies postexposure prophylaxis regimens were omitted or incorrectly administered .
Timely and appropriate human pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis will prevent human rabies ; however , the number of persons receiving prophylaxis can be reduced if other basic public health and veterinary programs are working to prevent and control rabies .
Practical and accurate health education about rabies , domestic animal vaccination and responsible pet care , modern stray animal control , and prompt diagnosis can minimize unnecessary animal exposures , alleviate inherent natural risks after exposure , and prevent many circumstances that result in the need for rabies prophylaxis .
Methods
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) Rabies Workgroup first met in July 2005 to review previous ACIP recommendations on the prevention of human rabies ( published in 1999 ) and to outline a plan for updating and revising the recommendations to provide clearer , more specific guidance for the administration of rabies pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis .
The workgroup held monthly teleconferences to discuss their review of published and unpublished data on rabies and related biologic products .
Data on the effectiveness , efficacy , immunogenicity , and safety of rabies biologics in both human and animal studies were reviewed using a systematic , evidence - based approach .
Randomized trials or well - conducted cohort studies with untreated comparison groups would provide the best evidence of the direct effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies - associated death .
However , because of the almost universal fatality among untreated persons infected with rabies virus , no such controlled studies exist .
However , studies describing final health outcomes among persons exposed to the rabies virus do exist , including studies using formulations of rabies biologics , timing of vaccine doses , and routes of administration that are not recommended for use in the United States .
These and other studies were identified by reviewing the PubMed database and relevant bibliographies and by consulting subject - matter experts .
The literature review did not identify any studies of the direct effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure vaccination in preventing human rabies cases .
Such studies would be difficult to conduct because rabies pre-exposure vaccination is intended to simplify the postexposure prophylaxis that is required after a recognized rabies exposure .
Rabies pre-exposure vaccination also might afford immunity against an unrecognized rabies exposure , an outcome that would be difficult to measure in controlled studies .
However , rabies cases have occurred among those who received rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis and did not receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis ( 23 ) , indicating that pre-exposure prophylaxis in humans is not universally effective without postexposure prophylaxis .
Because of the paucity of formal studies on the effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure vaccination in humans , the literature was searched for studies that reported clinical outcomes among animals that received pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis with cell culture rabies vaccine and were subsequently challenged with rabies virus .
Evaluation of the effectiveness of antirabies biologics in experimental animal models has been essential to developing successful rabies prevention approaches for exposed humans .
Animal studies investigating the effectiveness of both pre-exposure and posteexposure rabies prophylaxis were reviewed and were used to make inferences about the direct effectiveness of licensed rabies biologics in preventing human rabies .
Data regarding the immunogenicity of rabies biologics also were reviewed .
Assessing protective immunity against rabies is complex .
Virus neutralizing antibodies are believed to have a primary role in preventing rabies virus infection .
However , antibody titers alone do not always directly correlate with absolute protection because of other important immunologic factors .
Nonetheless , the ability of a vaccine to elicit rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in animals and humans and the demonstration of protection in animals is generally viewed as a reasonable surrogate of protection for inferential extension to humans ( 24 ) .
Although a definitive " protective " titer cannot be described for all hosts under all exposure scenarios , two working definitions of adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody reference values have been developed to define an appropriate , intact adaptive host response to vaccination .
The literature review included studies in humans that measured rabies virus neutralizing antibody in response to rabies postexposure prophylaxis consisting of human rabies immune globulin ( HRIG ) and 5 intramuscular ( IM ) doses of cell culture rabies vaccine and the recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen of 3 IM doses of cell culture vaccine .
The outcomes of interest for these studies were antibody titers of 0.5 IU / mL ( used by the World Health Organization [ WHO ] as an indicator of an adequate adaptive immune response ) ( 25 ) or complete virus neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test ( RFFIT ) ( used by ACIP as an indicator of an adequate adaptive immune response ) ( 26 ) .
The literature also was searched for evidence regarding the safety of the licensed rabies biologics available for use in the United States in both pre-exposure and postexposure situations .
ACIP 's charter requires the committee to consider the costs and benefits of potential recommendations when they are deliberating recommendations for vaccine use in the United States .
Few studies exist on the cost - effectiveness of rabies prophylaxis in various potential exposure scenarios .
A challenge in conducting such studies is the lack of data on the probability of rabies transmission under different exposure scenarios , except when the involved animal tests positive for rabies .
To provide information on the cost - effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis , a new analysis was conducted to estimate the cost - effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis in various potential exposure scenarios .
A Delphi methodology was used to estimate the risk for transmission of rabies to a human in each of the scenarios , and this information was used in the cost - effectiveness calculations .
The rabies workgroup reviewed the previous ACIP recommendations on the prevention of human rabies and deliberated on the available evidence .
When definitive research evidence was lacking , the recommendations incorporated expert opinion of the workgroup members .
The workgroup sought input from members of the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians , the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists ( CSTE ) , and state and local public health officials .
The proposed revised recommendations and a draft statement were presented to ACIP in October 2006 .
After deliberations , the recommenda tions were unanimously approved with minor modifications .
Further modifications to the draft statement were made following the CDC and external review process to update and clarify wording in the document .
Rabies Biologics
Three cell culture rabies vaccines are licensed in the United States : human diploid cell vaccine ( HDCV , Imovax ® Rabies , sanofi pasteur ) , purified chick embryo cell vaccine ( PCECV , RabAvert® , Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics ) , and rabies vaccine adsorbed ( RVA , Bioport Corporation ) .
Only HDCV and PCECV are available for use in the United States ( Table 1 ) .
For each of the available vaccines , the potency of 1 dose is greater than or equal to the WHO - recommended standard of 2.5 international units ( IU ) per 1.0 mL of vaccine ( 27 ) .
A full 1.0 - mL IM dose is used for both pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis regimens .
Rabies vaccines induce an active immune response that includes the production of virus neutralizing antibodies .
The active antibody response requires approximately 7 -- 10 days to develop , and detectable rabies virus neutralizing antibodies generally persist for several years .
A vaccination series is initiated and completed usually with one vaccine product .
No clinical trials were identified that document a change in efficacy or the frequency of adverse reactions when the series is initiated with one vaccine product and completed with another .
The passive administration of RIG is intended to provide an immediate supply of virus neutralizing antibodies to bridge the gap until the production of active immunity in response to vaccine administration .
Use of RIG provides a rapid , passive immunity that persists for a short time ( half - life of approximately 21 days ) ( 28 ) .
Two antirabies immune globulin ( IgG ) formulations prepared from hyperimmunized human donors are licensed and available for use in the United States : HyperRab S/D ( Talecris Biotherapeutics ) and Imogam® Rabies - HT ( sanofi pasteur ) .
In all postexposure prophylaxis regimens , except for persons previously vaccinated , HRIG should be administered concurrently with the first dose of vaccine .
Vaccines Licensed for Use in the United States
Human Diploid Cell Vaccine
HDCV is prepared from the Pitman - Moore strain of rabies virus grown on MRC - 5 human diploid cell culture , concentrated by ultrafiltration , and inactivated with beta- propiolactone ( 22 ) .
HDCV is formulated for IM administration in a single - dose vial containing lyophilized vaccine that is reconstituted in the vial with the accompanying sterile diluent to a final volume of 1.0 mL just before administration .
One dose of reconstituted vaccine contains < 150 µg neomycin sulfate , < 100 mg albumin , and 20 µg of phenol red indicator .
It contains no preservative or stabilizer .
Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine
PCECV became available in the United States in 1997 .
The vaccine is prepared from the fixed rabies virus strain Flury LEP grown in primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts ( 29 ) .
The virus is inactivated with betapropiolactone and further processed by zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient .
It is formulated for IM administration in a single - dose vial containing lyophilized vaccine that is reconstituted in the vial with the accompanying sterile diluent to a final volume of 1.0 mL just before administration .
One dose of reconstituted vaccine contains < 12 mg polygeline , < 0.3 mg human serum albumin , 1 mg potassium glutamate , and 0.3 mg sodium EDTA .
No preservatives are added .
Rabies Immune Globulins Licensed for Use in the United States
The two HRIG products , HyperRab S/D and Imogam® Rabies - HT , are IgG preparations concentrated by cold ethanol fractionation from plasma of hyperimmunized human donors .
The HyperRab S/D is formulated through the treatment of the immune globulin fraction with 0.3 % tri-n - butyl phosphate ( a solvent to inactivate potential adventitious viruses ) and 0.2 % sodium cholate ( a detergent to inactivate potential adventitious viruses ) and the application of heat ( 30 °C [ 86 °F ] for 6 hours ) .
After ultrafiltration , the final product is a 15 %-- 18 % protein solution in glycine .
The Imogam® Rabies - HT is prepared from the cold ethanol fraction of pooled venous plasma of donors , stabilized with glycine , and subjected to a heat - treatment process ( 58 °C - - 60 °C [ 136 °F -- 140 °F ] for 10 hours ) to inactivate potential adventitious viruses , with the final formulation consisting of 10 %- - 18 % protein .
Both HRIGs are standardized at an average potency value of 150 IU per mL , and supplied in 2 - mL ( 300 IU ) vials for pediatric use and 10 - mL ( 1,500 IU ) vials for adult use .
The recommended dose is 20 IU / kg ( 0.133 mL / kg ) body weight .
Both HRIG preparations are considered equally efficacious when used as described in these recommendations .
These products are made from the plasma of hyperimmunized human donors that , in theory , might contain infectious agents .
Nevertheless , the risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced substantially by screening plasma donors for previous exposure to certain viruses , by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections , and by inactivating and / or removing certain viruses .
No transmission of adventitious agents has been documented after administration of HRIGs licensed in the United States .
Effectiveness and Immunogenicity of Rabies Biologics
Effectiveness of Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis : Human Studies
A literature search identified 11 studies regarding the direct effectiveness of varying regimens of rabies postexposure prophylaxis in preventing rabies - associated deaths ( 18,30 - - 39 ) .
An additional eight studies were identified from reviews of bibliographies or consultations with subject matter experts ( 19,40 - - 46 ) .
Three large retrospective cohort studies were identified that describe differences in rabies mortality between rabies - exposed persons ( persons who were exposed to proven or suspected rabid animals ) who were vaccinated with older formulations of rabies vaccine compared with similarly exposed persons who were not administered prophylaxis ( 41,44,46 ) .
In one 1923 study of 2,174 persons bitten by " presumably rabid " dogs in India , 2.9 % of persons vaccinated with 1 % Semple nerve tissue rabies vaccine ( NTV ) subcutaneously for 14 days died from rabies compared with 6.2 % of unvaccinated persons ( 41 ) .
Another study of persons bitten by assumed infective rabid animals ( i.e. , one or more other persons bitten by the same animal died from rabies ) during 1946 -- 1951 indicated that 8.3 % of persons " completely treated " with 5 % Semple rabies vaccine , 23.1 % of " incompletely treated " , and 43.2 % of unvaccinated persons died from rabies ( 46 ) .
A third study in Thailand in 1987 documented no deaths among 723 persons bitten by dogs ( 661 of these persons were bitten by confirmed rabid dogs ) who received one of three rabies vaccines : Semple vaccine ( n = 427 ) , HDCV ( n = 257 ) , or duck embryo vaccine ( n = 39 ) ( 44 ) .
However , 45 % ( nine of 20 ) of unvaccinated persons who were bitten by confirmed rabid dogs died from rabies .
All of the persons who died were severely bitten on the face , neck , or arms .
All unvaccinated persons who survived after having been bitten by confirmed rabid dogs were bitten either on the legs or feet .
Although these studies describe outcomes of persons receiving older formulations of rabies vaccines that are not used in the United States , they demonstrate that a majority of persons bitten by known rabid dogs did not acquire rabies and provide historical evidence of a substantial protective effect of rabies vaccination after rabies exposure .
The effectiveness of cell culture rabies vaccine plus rabies IgG in preventing human deaths after rabies exposure has been demonstrated in certain studies ( 18,19,30--32,39,45 ) .
One prospective study described 10 children ( aged < 12 years ) and 32 adults who had been administered HRIG ( Hyperrab® , Cutter Laboratories , Berkeley , CA , USA ) and 5 IM doses of HDCV ( L'Institut Merieux , Lyons , France ) after exposure to suspected or confirmed rabid animals ( brain - tissue positive by fluorescent antibody testing ) ( 30 ) .
All exposed persons remained rabies - free during 5 years of observation .
Another study investigated outcomes for 90 persons with high - risk exposures ( bites or direct exposure to saliva from animals shown to be rabid by fluorescent antibody tests or bites from wild carnivores or bats that were not available for testing ) who were treated with HRIG and 5 IM doses of HDCV ( Wyeth Laboratories , Radnor , PA ) ( 18 ) .
All patients , including 21 who were bitten by proven rabid animals ( brain tissue fluorescent antibody positive ) , were rabies - free after 10 - - 18 months of follow - up .
A third study documented 45 persons severely bitten by confirmed rabid animals ( brain tissue fluorescent antibody positive ) who were administered RIG of mule origin and 5 IM doses of HDCV ( L'Institut Merieux ) ( 19 ) .
No rabies - related deaths were documented 6 - - 12 months after exposure .
A fourth study indicated no human rabies cases in 12 months of follow - up among 45 patients receiving HRIG ( Berirab® ) and 6 IM doses of PCECV ( Behringwerke Research Laboratories , Marburg , West Germany ) after contact with proven rabid animals ( brain tissue fluorescent antibody positive ) ( 32 ) .
Other studies examining outcomes for persons with varying degrees of exposure to confirmed rabid animals who were administered 6 doses of PCECV IM with or without HRIG also reported no rabies deaths in 12 -- 15 months of follow - up ( 39,45 ) .
Several studies also have demonstrated the effectiveness of intradermal ( ID ) administration of cell culture rabies vaccine with or without RIG ( of human or equine origin ) in preventing rabies among exposed humans ( 33--35,37 ) .
Two studies demonstrated the role of RIG administration in conjunction with vaccine in rabies postexposure prophylaxis ( 42,43 ) .
The first described quantitative serologic outcomes in 29 persons severely bitten by a rabid wolf and demonstrated the importance of rabies antiserum administration in the establishment of an early , passive , rabies virus neutralizing antibody level in patients and protection against rabies ( 40,43 ) .
Among five patients treated with 2 doses of rabies antiserum and NTV for 21 days , all had detectable levels of rabies virus neutralizing antibody during the first 5 days and all survived .
Among seven patients treated with 1 dose of antiserum in addition to NTV , all had detectable antibody during the first 5 days , but four of six had low antibody titers by day 21 .
One of the seven failed to develop more than a very low antibody level beyond day 7 and eventually died from rabies .
Among the five persons treated with NTV without antiserum , none had detectable antibody levels before day 19 , and three died from rabies .
In the second study , none of 27 persons severely wounded by rabid animals in China who were treated with purified hamster kidney cell ( PHKC ) rabies vaccine plus horse - origin rabies immune serum died from rabies ( 42 ) .
In contrast , all three severely wounded persons treated with PHKC alone died .
Effectiveness of Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis : Animal Studies
During the preceding four decades , results of experimental studies using various animal species have supported the use of cell culture - based vaccines for protection against rabies after infections .
For example , a postexposure prophylaxis experiment conducted in 1971 in rhesus monkeys using an experimental purified , concentrated tissue - culture vaccine alone , or in combination with homologous antirabies serum , demonstrated that a single administration of tissue - culture vaccine after exposure to rabies virus provided substantial ( seven of eight animals ) protection against the development of rabies .
In addition to demonstrating that homologous or heterologous antirabies serum alone resulted in poor protection from rabies ( 63 % -- 88 % mortality ) , the experimental data suggested that highly concentrated , purified tissue - culture vaccine might be effective for postexposure prophylaxis in humans ( 47 ) .
A study in 1981 documented limited protection against a lethal rabies virus challenge in goats who received ERA vaccine with or without antirabies goat serum ( 48 ) .
In cattle , another livestock species , the superiority of tissue culture vaccine over brain - origin vaccine was demonstrated ( 49 ) .
Similarly , in sheep , vaccine alone provided limited protection , but vaccine in combination with polyclonal IgG provided the best outcome ( 50 ) .
A 1989 evaluation of postexposure prophylaxis administered to dogs demonstrated similar findings .
The combination of serum and vaccine provided nearly complete protection compared with animals receiving vaccine only and nontreated controls ( 51 ) .
Previous animal postexposure research focused primarily on interventions against traditional rabies viruses .
However , new causative agents of rabies continue to emerge , as demonstrated by the recent description of four novel lyssaviruses from bats in Eurasia , Aravan ( ARAV ) , Khujand ( KHUV ) , Irkut ( IRKV ) , and West Caucasian bat virus ( WCBV ) ( 52,53 ) .
The combined effect of RIG and vaccine after exposure to these four new isolates was investigated in a Syrian hamster model , using commercially available human products or an experimental mAb ( 54 ) .
Conventional rabies postexposure prophylaxis provided little or no protection against all four new bat viruses .
In general , protection was inversely related to the genetic distance between the new isolates and traditional rabies viruses , which demonstrated the usefulness of this animal model in estimating the potential impact of these new lyssaviruses on human and domestic animal health .
Immunogenicity of Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis
To assess the ability of rabies postexposure prophylaxis to elicit rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in humans , studies were reviewed that documented antibody responses to rabies postexposure prophylaxis .
Four studies of antibody responses to rabies postexposure prophylaxis with 5 IM doses of HDCV with or without HRIG were identified ( 30,55 - - 57 ) .
Because no studies were identified that examined antibody responses to postexposure or simulated postexposure prophylaxis with 5 IM doses of the licensed PCECV vaccine ( RabAvert® ) plus HRIG , a study reporting antibody responses to 6 IM doses of another PCECV formulation ( Rabipur® , Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics ) administered with or without HRIG was reviewed ( 36 ) .
In a randomized trial , all persons receiving HRIG and 5 IM doses of HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) developed rabies virus antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL lasting up to 42 days after prophylaxis initiation ( 56 ) .
In a 1999 case - series , among 40 persons with diverse histories of exposure to animals suspected of having rabies , all persons who received 5 IM doses of HDCV with or without HRIG seroconverted or had increases in baseline serum antibody titers after the fifth vaccine dose ( geometric mean titer [ GMT ] = 6.22 IU / mL ) ( 57 ) .
Furthermore , a significantly higher mean antibody titer was observed in the group that received HDCV and HRIG ( GMT = 12.3 IU / mL ; standard error [ SE ] = 2.9 ) than in the group that received HDCV alone ( GMT = 8.5 IU / mL ; SE = 1.6 ; p=0.0043 ) .
In a randomized , modified double - blind , multicenter , simulated postexposure trial , 242 healthy adult volunteers were administered HRIG ( Imogam® Rabies - HT ) and 5 IM doses of either HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) or a chromatographically purified Vero - cell rabies vaccine ( CPRV ) ( 55 ) .
All participants had rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL by day 14 and maintained this level through day 42 .
Participants receiving HDCV had higher GMTs on days 14 and 42 than did participants receiving CPRV .
In the prospective study comparing rabies neutralizing antibodies in the serum of children compared with adults following postexposure prophylaxis , all 25 adults and eight children tested on day 14 had rabies virus neutralizing antibody concentrations > 0.5 IU / mL ( 30 ) .
In addition , no differences in antibody titer were observed between adults and children , and all persons remained alive during the 5 years of follow - up .
Effectiveness of Rabies Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis : Animal Studies
Because no studies exist on the effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis in preventing rabies deaths in humans , literature was reviewed on the effectiveness of pre-exposure vaccination in animal models .
The effectiveness of rabies vaccine has been appreciated for most of the 20th century on the basis of animal experiments .
Commercial rabies vaccines are licensed for certain domestic species , all of which entail the direct demonstration of efficacy after the administration of a single pre-exposure dose , and observed protection from rabies virus challenge for a minimum duration of 1 - - 4 years after vaccination of captive animals .
In addition , rabies pre-exposure vaccine research varies typically either by modification of standard regimens of vaccination or the relative antigenic value or potency of vaccine administration to animals .
For example , at least five studies involved animals challenged with rabies viruses ( challenge standard virus [ CVS ] or street rabies virus isolates ) and other lyssaviruses ( European bat lyssavirus [ EBL ] 1 , EBL2 , Australian bat lyssavirus [ ABL ] , and WCBV , IRKV , ARAV , KHUV ) after primary vaccination with PCECV ( 58 ) or HDCV ( 54,58 -- 62 ) .
Two of seven studies reported seroconversion in mice and humans .
Complete protection of animals from rabies virus infection was observed in all experiments that used PCECV or HDCV IM for primary vaccination except in one group that had been challenged by CVS through the intracranial route and experienced 5 % mortality ( 59 ) .
Evaluation of crossprotection of HDCV against WCBV , ARAV , IRKV , KHUV , and ABL through IM challenge showed 44 % , 55 % , 67 % , 89 % and 79 % survival , respectively ( 54 ) .
These studies demonstrated the usefulness of commercial human vaccines when administered to animals , with resulting protection dependent on the relative degree of phylogenetic relatedness between the rabies vaccine strain and the particular lyssavirus isolate .
Immunogenicity of Rabies Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis : Human Studies
Thirteen studies were identified that provide evidence of the effectiveness of pre-exposure rabies vaccination in eliciting an adaptive host immune response in humans .
The outcomes of interest for these studies ( 29,63 - - 74 ) include the two working definitions of adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody reference values that have been developed to define an appropriate , intact adaptive host response to vaccination : antibody titers of 0.5 IU / mL or complete virus neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by RFFIT ( 26 ) .
Multiple studies comparing different pre-exposure prophylaxis regimens provide evidence that vaccination with 3 IM doses of cell culture rabies vaccine ( the recommended pre-exposure regimen ) result in neutralizing antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL by days 14 ( 70,71 ) , 21 ( 63,74 ) , 28 ( 64,69,72 ) , or 49 ( 67,68,75 ) after primary vaccination .
One study in 1987 documented antibody responses in 177 healthy student volunteers aged 18 - - 24 years following primary vaccination with either PCECV ( Behringwerke ) or HDCV ( Behringwerke ) ( 71 ) .
On day 14 after vaccination ( first dose administered on day 0 ) , no significant difference in GMT was observed between participants who received 3 IM doses of PCECV on days 0 , 7 , and 21 ( GMT = 5.9 IU / mL ) compared with persons who received 3 IM doses of HDCV ( GMT = 4.4 IU / mL ) .
On day 42 , the GMT of the HDCV group was significantly higher than that of the PCECV group ( 13.7 IU / mL versus 8.4 IU / mL ; p<0.025 ) .
Another study documented similar antibody responses to primary vaccination with HDCV in healthy veterinary students ( 64 ) .
The GMT of persons receiving 3 IM doses of HDCV on days 0 , 7 , and 28 was 10.2 IU / mL ( range : 0.7-- 51.4 ) on day 28 and 37.7 IU / mL ( range : 5.4--278.0 ) on day 42 .
Another study documented even higher GMTs among 78 volunteers in a randomized trial studying differences between primary vaccination with PCECV ( Behringwerke ) and HDCV ( L'Institut Merieux ) administered IM or ID on days 0 , 7 , and 28 ( 29 ) .
The day 28 GMT among persons receiving HDCV IM ( GMT = 239 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 56--800 ) was significantly higher than the GMT among persons receiving PCECV IM ( GMT = 138 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 45--280 ) .
On days 50 and 92 , no significant difference in GMT was observed between the two groups in which vaccine was administered IM , and the GMTs of the IM groups were significantly higher than the ID groups .
Another study also observed higher antibody titers on days 49 and 90 and 26 months after primary vaccination with HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) when the vaccine was administered IM compared with ID on days 0 , 7 , and 28 ( 68 ) .
A randomized trial was conducted to determine the equivalence and interchangeability of PCECV ( RabAvert® ) and HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) administered IM on days 0 , 7 , and 28 for rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis to 165 healthy , rabies vaccine naïve veterinary students ( 66 ) .
No significant difference in GMT was observed among the HDCV and PCECV groups on days 28 and 42 .
Although the 3 - dose rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis series has been the standard regimen recommended by WHO ( 17 ) and ACIP ( 26 ) , a 2 - dose pre-exposure series has been used previously in some countries ( 76 ) .
One study compared antibody responses in persons receiving 2 ( days 0 and 28 ) versus 3 ( days 0 , 7 , and 28 ) IM doses of either HDCV ( Pasteur Merieux Connaught , Lyon , France ) or purified Vero cell rabies vaccine ( PVRV ) ( Pasteur Merieux Connaught ) and indicated that the cohort seroconversion rate decreased more rapidly among persons receiving 2 doses compared with those receiving 3 doses ( p<0.001 ) , indicating superior longer term immunogenicity when 3 vaccine doses were administered ( 73 ) .
In addition to the rapidity of the immune response resulting from rabies pre-exposure vaccination , another important consideration is the length of duration or persistence of the immune response .
One study reported rapid declines in GMT at 4 months after initial vaccination among persons receiving 3 - dose primary vaccination with HDCV ( L'Institut Merieux ) or PVRV ( L'Institut Merieux ) on days 0 , 7 , and 21 followed by stabilization of the antibody level through 21 months ( 63 ) .
Another study observed persistent GMTs among persons receiving 3 - dose ( days 0 , 7 , and 28 ) primary vaccination with PCECV ( Behringwerke ) and HDCV ( L'Institut Merieux ) IM on day 365 ( PCECV GMT = 189 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 53--1400 ; HDCV GMT = 101 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 11--1400 ) and day 756 ( PCECV GMT = 168 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 50--3600 ; HDCV GMT = 92 RFFIT titer / mL ; range : 11--480 ) after initial vaccination ( 29 ) .
On day 387 post vaccination , another study indicated that the GMT among persons receiving PCECV ( RabAvert® ) IM on days 0 , 7 , and 28 ( GMT = 2.9 IU / mL ) was significantly higher than the GMT in the HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) group ( GMT = 1.5 IU / mL ; p<0.05 ) ( 66 ) .
All persons vaccinated with PCECV had antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL on days 387 , as did 95.7 % of persons vaccinated with HDCV .
Another study indicated that all persons receiving PCECV ( Behringwerke ) IM on days 0 , 7 , and 21 maintained antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL 2 years after primary vaccination ( 71 ) .
In summary , rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL were observed in all persons at 180 days and 96.8 % at 365 days after initial vaccination ( 72 ) , 94 % of persons at 21 months after initial vaccination ( 63 ) , and all persons tested at 26 months after primary vaccination ( 77 ) .
An important use of rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis is to prime the immune response to enable a rapid anamnestic response to postexposure booster vaccination and simplify the postexposure prophylaxis requirements for previously vaccinated persons .
One study observed antibody responses to 1 - or 2 - dose ( days 0 and 3 ) IM booster vaccinations with PCECV ( RabAvert® ) in persons who had received primary vaccination with either PCECV IM or HDCV IM 1 year earlier ( 66 ) .
All participants who had initially received PCECV primary vaccination and 66 of 69 ( 96 % ) who had initially received HDCV primary vaccination had titers > 0.5 IU / mL before booster vaccination .
No significant differences in GMT were observed between 1 - and 2 - dose booster groups on days 3 ( 2 - dose GMT = 2.07 IU / mL ; 1 - dose GMT = 2.87 IU / mL ) , seven ( 2 - dose GMT = 51.67 IU / mL ; 1 - dose GMT = 51.23 IU / mL ) and 365 ( 2- dose GMT = 30.60 IU / mL ; 1 - dose GMT = 26.10 IU / mL ) ( 66 ) .
However , a significantly higher GMT was observed on day 21 for persons receiving 2 - dose boosters ( GMT = 151.63 IU / mL ) compared with 1 - dose boosters ( GMT = 120.91 IU / mL ) .
All persons tested at day 365 post - booster dose in both 1 - and 2 - dose booster groups had rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL regardless of whether PCECV or HDCV was used for primary vaccination .
Another study documented rapid antibody responses to a single booster dose of HDCV ( Imovax ® Rabies ) or CPRV ( Pasteur Merieux Connaught ) , with all persons in both groups exhibiting antibody titers > 0.5 IU / mL on days 7 and 14 post - booster dose ( 72 ) .
Safety of Rabies Biologics
Eight studies regarding the safety of rabies biologics used in postexposure or simulated postexposure settings ( 36,55 --57,78--81 ) and eight studies of safety in pre-exposure settings were identified ( 63--65,68,71,72,82 ) .
Three identified studies investigated reports of adverse events in both postexposure and pre-exposure settings ( 14,83,84 ) .
Reviews of relevant bibliographies identified one additional study examining the safety of PCECV when used without HRIG for postexposure prophylaxis in children ( 85 ) .
HDCV
Studies of the use of HDCV reported local reactions ( e.g. , pain at the injection site , redness , swelling , and induration ) among 60.0 % -- 89.5 % of recipients ( 63--65,68,72 ) .
Local reactions were more common than systemic reactions .
Most local reactions were mild and resolved spontaneously within a few days .
Local pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported adverse reaction occurring in 21%-- 77 % of vaccinees ( 24,63,68,71,72,80 ) .
Mild systemic reactions ( e.g. , fever , headache , dizziness , and gastrointestinal symptoms ) were reported in 6.8 %-- 55.6 % of recipients ( 63,64,68,72 ) .
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in up to 6 % of persons receiving booster vaccination with HDCV following primary rabies prophylaxis , 3 % occurring within 1 day of receiving boosters , and 3 % occurring 6 - - 14 days after boosters ( 82 ) .
In one study , hypersensitivity reactions ( e.g. , urticaria , pruritic rash , and angioedema ) were reported in 5.6 % ( 11 of 99 ) of schoolchildren aged 5 -- 13 years following pre-exposure prophylaxis with IM HDCV ( 72 ) .
Angioedema was observed in 1.2 % of these school children after booster doses of HDCV 1 year after primary vaccination with HDCV .
In 46 months of surveillance for adverse events following HDCV administration during 1980 -- 1984 , CDC received reports of 108 systemic allergic reactions ( ranging from hives to anaphylaxis ) following HDCV ( 11 per 10,000 vaccinees ) ( 14 ) .
These included nine cases of presumed Type I immediate hypersensitivity ( one of 10,000 ) , 87 cases of presumed Type III hypersensitivity ( nine of 10,000 ) , and 12 cases of hypersensitivity of indeterminate type .
All nine of the presumed immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred during either primary pre-exposure or postexposure vaccination .
Most ( 93 % ) of the Type III hypersensitivity reactions were observed following booster vaccination .
Systemic allergic reactions have been associated with the presence of betapropiolactone - altered human albumin in HDCV and the development of immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) antibodies to this allergen ( 82,86 ) .
No deaths resulting from these reactions were reported .
In four studies investigating the safety of rabies postexposure prophylaxis with both HRIG and HDCV , no serious adverse events were observed ( 55 -- 57,78 ) .
Local reactions were common , and pain at the injection site was reported by 7%-- 92 % of participants ( 55 - - 57 ) .
Studies of the frequency of systemic adverse reactions following rabies vaccination are limited by small sample sizes .
Systemic adverse reactions were not observed in any of the participants in one study with a relatively small sample size ( 78 ) .
In two other studies in which adverse events were collected using patient self - monitoring forms and investigator interviews at each visit , systemic reactions were reported by 76%-- 100 % of participants ( 55,56 ) .
However , none of these reported systemic adverse events was considered to be serious .
Rare , individual case reports of neurologic adverse events following rabies vaccination have been reported , but in none of the cases has causality been established .
Four cases of neurologic illness resembling Guillain - Barré syndrome occurring after treatment with HDCV were identified ( 13,87-- 89 ) .
One case of acute neurologic syndrome involving seizure activity was reported following the administration of HDCV and HRIG ( 90 ) .
Other central and peripheral nervous system disorders have been temporally associated with HDCV vaccine ( 91 ) .
PCECV
In studies of PCECV use , local reactions ( e.g. , pain at the injection site , redness , swelling , and induration ) were reported among 11%-- 57 % of recipients ( 29,79,84 ) .
Local pain at the injection site , the most common local reaction , was reported in 2 %-- 23 % of vaccinees ( 29,71,79,81,83,85 ) .
Systemic reactions were less common and have been reported in 0-- 31 % of vaccine recipients ( 79,83,84 ) .
One study investigated adverse events among 271 children in India who received rabies postexposure prophylaxis with PCECV IM without HRIG following bites from suspected or confirmed rabid dogs ( 85 ) .
Overall , 7 % of the children experienced mild to moderate clinical reactions .
The most frequently reported reaction was local pain after the first or second dose ( 4 % ) .
Another study documented clinical reactions in 29 persons administered 6 IM doses of PCECV with ( n = four ) or without HRIG following bites by suspected rabid stray dogs .
No serious adverse events were observed during the course of or after prophylaxis ( 36 ) .
Another case report documented one case of neurologic illness resembling Guillain - Barré syndrome after vaccination with PCECV in India ( 92 ) .
A retrospective review of adverse events following administration of PCECV was conducted using data from the United States Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) ( 93 ) .
During 1997 -- 2005 , approximately 1.1 million doses of PCECV were distributed in the United States and 336 reports describing adverse events following PCECV administration were received by VAERS ( 30 events per 100,000 doses distributed and three serious events per 100,000 doses distributed ) .
A total of 199 reported adverse events ( 4 % serious [ i.e. , adverse events that involve hospitalization , life - threatening illness , disability , or death ] ) occurred following administration of PCECV alone , and 137 ( 12 % serious ) occurred following PCECV administered concomitantly with another vaccine or following postexposure prophylaxis ( PCECV co-administered with HRIG ) .
Among the 312 nonserious adverse events , the most frequently reported were headache , fever , myalgia , nausea , and weakness .
A limitation of VAERS is that causality between vaccine administration and reported adverse events cannot be established ( 94 ) .
No deaths or rabies cases were reported following administration of PCECV .
HRIG
In a clinical trial involving 16 volunteers in each group , participants receiving HRIG plus placebo ( administered to mimic vaccine ) commonly reported local reactions ( 100 % in conventionally produced HRIG group , 75 % in heat - treated HRIG group ) , including pain / tenderness ( 100 % conventional HRIG , 50 % heat - treated HRIG ) , erythema ( 63 % conventional , 25 % heat - treated ) , and induration ( 50 % conventional , 31 % heat - treated ) ( 56 ) .
Systemic reactions were reported in 75 % of participants in the conventional HRIG group and 81 % in the heat - treated group .
Headache was the most commonly reported systemic reaction ( 50 % conventional , 69 % heat - treated ) .
The majority of the reported local and systemic reactions were mild , and no significant differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events between treatment groups .
No serious adverse events , including immediate hypersensitivity reactions or immune - complex - like disease , were reported .
Cost - Effectiveness of Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis
ACIP 's charter requires the committee , when deliberating recommendations for vaccine use in the United States , to consider the cost and benefits of potential recommendations .
Cost - effectiveness studies combine different types of data ( e.g. , epidemiologic , clinical , cost , and vaccine effectiveness ) , and the results from such studies allow public health officials , medical practitioners , and the public to make more informed decisions when evaluating the risk for disease against the cost of the vaccine , including vaccine - related side effects .
CDC analyzed the cost - effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis for each of eight contact ( risk of transmission ) scenarios , with the outcome being the net cost ( in dollars ) per life saved ( in 2004 dollars ) .
The perspective was societal , which means that all costs and all benefits were included , regardless of who pays and who benefits .
For each risk - of - transmission scenario , three cost - effectiveness ratios were calculated : average , most , and least cost - effective .
Average cost - effective ratios were calculated using median transmission risk values ( Table 2 ) and average cost of postexposure prophylaxis .
Most cost - effective ratios were calculated using greatest ( largest ) transmission risk values and least cost of postexposure prophylaxis .
Least cost - effective ratios were calculated using lowest transmission risk and greatest cost of postexposure prophylaxis .
The analysis assumed that the direct medical costs associated with postexposure prophylaxis included 1 dose of HRIG ( $ 326 --$ 1,434 ) , 5 doses of HDCV ( $ 113 - -$ 679 each ) , hospital charges ( $ 289 - -$ 624 ) , and physician charges ( $ 295 --$ 641 ) ( 95 ) .
Indirect costs included travel , lost wages , alternative medicine , and other costs ( $ 161 - -$ 2,161 ) ( 96 ) .
A societal perspective requires the valuation of the loss of productivity to society caused by premature death .
Therefore , human life lost was valued using the average present value , in 2004 dollars , of expected future lifetime earnings and housekeeping services ( $ 1,109,920 ) ( 97 ) .
All costs were adjusted to 2004 dollars using the medical care price index .
The study also assumed that rabies postexposure prophylaxis , when administered according to these recommendations , was essentially 100 % effective in preventing a clinical case of human rabies .
The probabilities of rabies transmission to a human following possible contact with different species of potentially rabid animals was assessed by a panel of experts using the Delphi methodology , except for " animal tests positive for rabies " when probabilities were obtained from a previous study ( 98 ) ( Table 2 ) .
Under all three cost - effectiveness scenarios , the analysis determined that it is always cost saving to administer postexposure prophylaxis if a patient is bitten by a rabid animal that has tested positive for rabies or if a patient is bitten by a reservoir or vector species ( e.g. skunk , raccoon , bat , or fox bite in the United States or dog bite in countries with dog variant rabies ) , even if the animal is not available for testing .
For all other transmission risk situations , the average net cost effectiveness ratio was always a net cost per life saved ( range : $ 2.9 million per life saved following a bite from an untested cat to $ 4 billion per life saved following a lick from an untested dog ) .
The wide range of probabilities of risk for transmission for the bat bite scenario resulted in the widest range of cost - effectiveness ratios ( Table 2 ) .
Until more precise estimates of risk for transmission are obtained , these estimates illustrate the difficulty clinicians and public health officials will continue to encounter in unequivocally determining the cost - effectiveness of providing PEP .
Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis
Rationale for Prophylaxis
ACIP ( 26 ) and WHO ( 25 ) recommend that prophylaxis for the prevention of rabies in humans exposed to rabies virus should include prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by passive vaccination with HRIG and vaccination with cell culture rabies vaccines .
Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency , not a medical emergency .
Because rabies biologics are valuable resources that are periodically in short supply , a risk assessment weighing potential adverse consequences associated with administering postexposure prophylaxis along with their severity and likelihood versus the actual risk for the person acquiring rabies should be conducted in each situation involving a possible rabies exposure .
Because the balance of benefit and harm will differ among exposed persons on the basis of the risk for infection , recommendations regarding rabies postexposure prophylaxis are dependent upon associated risks including 1 ) type of exposure , 2 ) epidemiology of animal rabies in the area where the contact occurred and species of animal involved , and 3 ) circumstances of the exposure incident .
The reliability of this information should be assessed for each incident .
The decision of whether to initiate rabies postexposure prophylaxis also depends on the availability of the exposing animal for observation or rabies testing ( Table 3 ) .
Because the epidemiology and pathogenesis of rabies are complex , these recommendations cannot be specific for every possible circumstance .
Clinicians should seek assistance from local or state public health officials for evaluating exposures or determining the need for postexposure management in situations that are not routine .
State and local officials have access to CDC rabies experts for particularly rare situations or difficult decisions .
Types of Exposure
When an exposure has occurred , the likelihood of rabies infection varies with the nature and extent of that exposure .
Under most circumstances , two categories of exposure ( bite and nonbite ) should be considered .
The most dangerous and common route of rabies exposure is from the bite of a rabid mammal .
An exposure to rabies also might occur when the virus , from saliva or other potentially infectious material ( e.g. , neural tissue ) , is introduced into fresh , open cuts in skin or onto mucous membranes ( nonbite exposure ) .
Indirect contact and activities ( e.g. , petting or handling an animal , contact with blood , urine or feces , and contact of saliva with intact skin ) do not constitute exposures ; therefore , postexposure prophylaxis should not be administered in these situations .
Exposures to bats deserve special assessment because bats can pose a greater risk for infecting humans under certain circumstances that might be considered inconsequential from a human perspective ( i.e. , a minor bite or lesion ) .
Human - to - human transmission occurs almost exclusively as a result of organ or tissue transplantation .
Clinicians should contact local or state public health officials for assistance in determining the likelihood of a rabies exposure in a specific situation .
Bite exposures .
Any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure .
All bites , regardless of body site or evidence of gross trauma , represent a potential risk .
The risk for transmission varies in part with the species of biting animal , the anatomic site of the bite , and the severity of the wound ( 98 ) .
Although risk for transmission might increase with wound severity , rabies transmission also occurs from bites by some animals ( e.g. , bats ) that inflict rather minor injury compared with larger - bodied carnivores , resulting in lesions that are difficult to detect under certain circumstances ( 8,99 -- 103 ) .
Nonbite exposures .
Nonbite exposures from animals very rarely cause rabies .
However , occasional reports of nonbite transmission suggest that such exposures require assessment to determine if sufficient reasons exist to consider postexposure prophylaxis ( 104 ) .
The nonbite exposures of highest risk appear to be among surgical recipients of corneas , solid organs , and vascular tissue transplanted from patients who died of rabies and persons exposed to large amounts of aerosolized rabies virus .
Two cases of rabies have been attributed to probable aerosol exposures in laboratories , and two cases of rabies have been attributed to possible airborne exposures in caves containing millions of free - tailed bats ( Tadarida brasiliensis ) in the Southwest .
However , alternative infection routes can not be discounted ( 105--109 ) .
Similar airborne incidents have not occurred in approximately 25 years , probably because of elevated awareness of such risks resulting in increased use of appropriate preventive measures .
The contamination of open wounds or abrasions ( including scratches ) or mucous membranes with saliva or other potentially infectious material ( e.g. , neural tissue ) from a rabid animal also constitutes a nonbite exposure .
Rabies virus is inactivated by desiccation , ultraviolet irradiation , and other factors and does not persist in the environment .
In general , if the suspect material is dry , the virus can be considered noninfectious .
Nonbite exposures other than organ or tissue transplants have almost never been proven to cause rabies , and postexposure prophylaxis is not indicated unless the nonbite exposure met the definition of saliva or other potentially infectious material being introduced into fresh , open cuts in skin or onto mucous membranes .
Bat Exposures .
The most common rabies virus variants responsible for human rabies in the United States are bat - related ; therefore , any potential exposure to a bat requires a thorough evaluation .
If possible , bats involved in potential human exposures should be safely collected and submitted for rabies diagnosis .
Most submitted bats ( approximately 94 % ) ( 110 ) will not be rabid and such timely diagnostic assessments rule out the need for large investments in risk assessments and unnecessary prophylaxis .
The risk for rabies resulting from an encounter with a bat might be difficult to determine because of the limited injury inflicted by a bat bite ( compared with more obvious wounds caused by the bite of terrestrial carnivores ) , an inaccurate recall of a bat encounter that might have occurred several weeks or months earlier , and evidence that some bat - related rabies viruses might be more likely to result in infection after inoculation into superficial epidermal layers ( 111 ) .
For these reasons , any direct contact between a human and a bat should be evaluated for an exposure .
If the person can be reasonably certain a bite , scratch , or mucous membrane exposure did not occur , or if the bat is available for testing and is negative for presence of rabies virus , postexposure prophylaxis is not necessary .
Other situations that might qualify as exposures include finding a bat in the same room as a person who might be unaware that a bite or direct contact had occurred ( e.g. , a deeply sleeping person awakens to find a bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat in the room with a previously unattended child , mentally disabled person , or intoxicated person ) .
These situations should not be considered exposures if rabies is ruled out by diagnostic testing of the bat , or circumstances suggest it is unlikely that an exposure took place .
Other household members who did not have direct contact with the bat or were awake and aware when in the same room as the bat should not be considered as having been exposed to rabies .
Circumstances that make it less likely that an undetected exposure occurred include the observation of bats roosting or flying in a room open to the outdoors , the observation of bats outdoors or in a setting where bats might normally be present , or situations in which the use of protective covers ( e.g. , mosquito netting ) would reasonably be expected to preclude unnoticed contact .
Because of the complexity of some of these situations , consultation with state and local health departments should always be sought .
If necessary , further guidance can be sought from CDC and experts in bat ecology .
During 1990 -- 2007 , a total of 34 naturally acquired bat - associated human cases of rabies was reported in the United States .
In six cases , a bite was reported ; in two cases , contact with a bat and a probable bite were reported ; in 15 cases , physical contact was reported ( e.g. , the removal of a bat from the home or workplace or the presence of a bat in the room where the person had been sleeping ) , but no bite was documented ; and in 11 cases , no bat encounter was reported .
In these cases , an unreported or undetected bat bite remains the most plausible hypothesis because the genetic sequences of the human rabies viruses closely matched those of specific species of bats .
Clustering of human cases associated with bat exposures has never been reported in the United States ( e.g. , within the same household or among a group of campers where bats were observed during their activities ) ( 8,101,110 ) .
Human - to - Human Exposures .
Human - to - human transmission can occur in the same way as animal - to - human transmission ( i.e. , the virus is introduced into fresh open cuts in skin or onto mucous membranes from saliva or other potentially infectious material such as neural tissue ) .
Organ and tissue transplantation resulting in rabies transmission has occurred among 16 transplant recipients from corneas ( n = eight ) , solid organs ( n = seven ) , and vascular tissue ( n = one ) .
Each of the donors died of an illness compatible with or proven to be rabies ( 10,112--123 ) .
The 16 cases occurred in five countries : the United States ( five cases : one corneal transplant transmission , three solid organ transmissions , and one vascular graft transmission ) , Germany ( four cases ) , Thailand ( two cases ) , India ( two cases ) , Iran ( two cases ) , and France ( one case ) .
No documented laboratory - diagnosed cases of human - to - human rabies transmission have been documented from a bite or nonbite exposure other than the transplant cases ( 124 ) .
At least two cases of human - to - human rabies transmission in Ethiopia have been suggested , but rabies as the cause of death was not confirmed by laboratory testing ( 125 ) .
The reported route of exposure in both cases was direct salivary contact from another human ( i.e. , a bite and a kiss ) .
Routine delivery of health care to a patient with rabies is not an indication for postexposure prophylaxis unless the health - care worker is reasonably certain that he or she was bitten by the patient or that his or her mucous membranes or nonintact skin was exposed directly to potentially infectious saliva or neural tissue .
Adherence to standard precautions for all hospitalized patients as outlined by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee will minimize the need for postexposure prophylaxis in such situations ( 126 ) .
Staff should wear gowns , goggles , masks , and gloves , particularly during intubation and suctioning ( 25 ) .
Animal Rabies Epidemiology
Bats .
Rabid bats have been documented in the 49 continental states , and bats are increasingly implicated as important wildlife reservoirs for variants of rabies virus transmitted to humans ( 5,101,102,110 ) .
Transmission of rabies virus can occur from minor , seemingly underappreciated or unrecognized bites from bats ( 8,99 -- 103 ) .
Laboratory data support a hypothesis that bat rabies virus variants associated with silver - haired bats ( Lasionycteris noctivagans ) and eastern pipistrelles ( Pipistrellus subflavus ) have biologic characteristics that might allow a higher likelihood of infection after superficial inoculation , such as into cells of epidermal origin ( 127 ) .
Human and domestic animal contact with bats should be minimized , and bats should never be handled by untrained and unvaccinated persons or be kept as pets ( 128 ) .
Wild Terrestrial Carnivores .
Raccoons , skunks , and foxes are the terrestrial carnivores most often infected with rabies in the United States ( 5 ) .
Suggestive clinical signs of rabies among wildlife cannot be interpreted reliably .
All bites by such wildlife should be considered possible exposures to rabies virus .
Postexposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible following exposure to such wildlife , unless the animal is available for diagnosis and public health authorities are facilitating expeditious laboratory testing , or if the brain tissue from the animal has already tested negative .
Wild terrestrial carnivores that are available for diagnostic testing should be euthanized as soon as possible ( without unnecessary damage to the head ) , and the brain should be submitted for rabies diagnosis ( 129,130 ) .
If the results of testing are negative by immunofluorescence , human rabies postexposure prophylaxis is not necessary .
Other factors that might influence the urgency of decision - making regarding the initiation of postexposure prophylaxis before diagnostic results are known include the species of the animal , the general appearance and behavior of the animal , whether the encounter was provoked by the presence of a human , and the severity and location of bites .
Other Wild Animals .
Rodents are not reservoirs of rabies virus .
Small rodents ( e.g. , squirrels , chipmunks , rats , mice , hamsters , guinea pigs , and gerbils ) and lagomorphs ( including rabbits and hares ) are rarely infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans ( 131,132 ) .
During 1990 -- 1996 , in areas of the country where raccoon rabies was enzootic , woodchucks accounted for 93 % of the 371 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC ( 5,133,134 ) .
In all cases involving rodents , the state or local health department should be consulted before a decision is made to initiate postexposure prophylaxis ( 135 ) .
The offspring of wild animals crossbred to domestic dogs and cats ( wild animal hybrids ) are considered wild animals by the National Association of State and Public Health Veterinarians and CSTE .
Because the period of rabies virus shedding in wild animal hybrids is unknown , when such animals bite humans euthanasia and rabies testing of the hybrid animal is the safest course of action .
Vaccination should be discontinued if diagnostic tests of the involved animal are negative for rabies infection .
However , because wolves and dogs have very similar genetic makeup and many animals that are advertised as " wolf - dogs " might actually be dogs , each wolf hybrid bite situation should be evaluated individually , taking into account the likelihood that it is a hybrid , the severity of the wound , and the assessment by the bite victim and his or her health - care provider .
State or local health departments should be consulted before a decision is made to euthanize and test an animal .
Wild animals and wild animal hybrids should not be kept as pets ( 128 ) or be publicly accessible .
Humans who work with wild animals maintained in United States Department of Agriculture - licensed research facilities or accredited zoological parks should be educated on preventing bites and should receive rabies pre-exposure vaccinations .
Rabies exposures of these animal handlers might require booster postexposure vaccinations in lieu of euthanasia and testing of the animal depending on employment requirements .
Domestic Dogs , Cats , and Ferrets .
The likelihood of rabies in a domestic animal varies regionally , and the need for postexposure prophylaxis also varies on the basis of regional epidemiology .
The number of reported cases of rabies in domestic dogs has decreased substantially in the United States , primarily because of improved canine vaccination and stray animal control programs ( 5 ) .
In the continental United States , rabies among dogs has been reported sporadically along the United States - Mexico border and in areas of the United States with enzootic wildlife rabies ( 5 ) .
During 2000 -- 2006 , more cats than dogs were reported rabid in the United States ( 6 ) .
The majority of these cases were associated with the epizootic of rabies among raccoons in the eastern United States .
The large number of rabid cats compared with other domestic animals might be attributed to a lower vaccination rate among cats because of less stringent cat vaccination laws ; fewer confinement or leash laws ; and the nocturnal activity patterns of cats placing them at greater risk for exposure to infected raccoons , skunks , foxes , and bats .
In certain developing countries , dogs remain the major reservoir and vector of rabies and represent an increased risk for rabies exposure in such countries ( 136 ) .
A healthy domestic dog , cat , or ferret that bites a person should be confined and observed for 10 days ( 128,137,138 ) .
Those that remain alive and healthy 10 days after a bite would not have been shedding rabies virus in their saliva and would not have been infectious at the time of the bite ( 25 ) .
All domestic dogs , cats , and ferrets kept as pets should be vaccinated against rabies .
Even if they are not , such animals might still be confined and observed for 10 days after a bite to reliably determine the risk for rabies exposure for the person who was bitten .
Any illness in the animal during the confinement period before release should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported immediately to the local public health department .
If signs suggestive of rabies develop , postexposure prophylaxis of the bite victim should be initiated .
The animal should be euthanized and its head removed and shipped , under refrigeration , for examination by a qualified laboratory .
If the biting animal is stray or unwanted , it should either be confined and observed for 10 days or euthanized immediately and submitted for rabies diagnosis ( 128 ) .
Other Domestic Animals .
In all instances of exposure to other domestic animal species , local or state health department should be consulted before a decision is made to euthanize and test the animal or initiate postexposure prophylaxis ( 128 ) .
Circumstances of Biting Incident and Vaccination Status of Exposing Animal
An unprovoked attack by an animal might be more likely than a provoked attack to indicate that the animal is rabid .
Bites inflicted on a person attempting to feed or handle an apparently healthy animal should generally be regarded as provoked .
Other factors to consider when evaluating a potential rabies exposure include the epidemiology of rabies in the area , the biting animal 's history and health status ( e.g. , abnormal behavior and signs of illness ) , and the potential for the animal to be exposed to rabies ( e.g. , presence of an unexplained wound or history of exposure to a rabid animal ) .
A dog , cat , or ferret with a history of continuously current vaccination ( i.e. , no substantial gaps in vaccination coverage ) is unlikely to become infected with rabies ( 128,137,139--141 ) .
Even after an initial rabies vaccination , young or naïve animals remain at risk for rabies because of the potential exposures preceding vaccination or before adequate induction of immunity during the 28 days after primary vaccination ( 128 ) .
Treatment of Wounds and Vaccination
The essential components of rabies postexposure prophylaxis are wound treatment and , for previously unvaccinated persons , the administration of both HRIG and vaccine ( Table 4 ) ( 142 ) .
Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency , not a medical emergency , but decisions must not be delayed .
Incubation periods of more than 1 year have been reported in humans ( 143 ) .
Therefore , when a documented or likely exposure has occurred , postexposure prophylaxis should be administered regardless of the length of the delay , provided that compatible clinical signs of rabies are not present in the exposed person .
The administration of postexposure prophylaxis to a clinically rabid human patient has demonstrated consistent ineffectiveness ( 25 ) .
In 1977 , WHO recommended a regimen of RIG and 6 doses of HDCV over a 90 - day period .
This recommendation was based on studies in Germany and Iran ( 19,21 ) .
When used in this manner , the vaccine was safe and effective in persons bitten by animals proven to be rabid and induced an adequate antibody response in all recipients ( 19 ) .
Studies conducted in the United States by CDC have documented that a regimen of 1 dose of HRIG and 5 doses of HDCV over a 28 - day period was safe and induced an adequate antibody response in all recipients ( 18 ) .
Clinical trials with PCECV have demonstrated immunogenicity equivalent to that of HDCV ( 144 ) .
Cell culture vaccines have been used effectively with HRIG or RIG of equine origin ( ERIG ) worldwide to prevent rabies in persons bitten by various rabid animals ( 18,19 ) .
Worldwide , WHO estimates that postexposure prophylaxis is initiated on 10 - - 12 million persons annually ( 144 ) .
An estimated 16,000 - - 39,000 persons in the United States receive a full postexposure course each year ( 11 ) .
Although postexposure prophylaxis has not always been properly administered in the United States , no failures have been documented since current biologics have been licensed .
Treatment of Wounds
Regardless of the risk for rabies , the optimal medical treatment of animal bite wounds includes the recognition and treatment of serious injury ( e.g. , nerve or tendon laceration ) , avoidance or management of infection ( both local and systemic ) , and approaches that will yield the best possible cosmetic results ( 145 ) .
For many types of bite wounds , immediate gentle irrigation with water or a dilute water povidone - iodine solution markedly decrease the risk for bacterial infection ( 146 ) .
Care should be taken not to damage skin or tissues .
Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention because thorough wound cleansing alone without other postexposure prophylaxis markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies in animal studies ( 147,148 ) .
Consideration should be given to the need for a booster dose of tetanus vaccine ( 149,150 ) .
Decisions regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis ( 151 ) and primary wound closure ( 152 ) should be individualized on the basis of the exposing animal species , size and location of the wound (s ) , and time interval since the bite .
Suturing should be avoided , when possible .
Vaccination
Postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine , with the exception of persons who have ever previously received complete vaccination regimens ( pre-exposure or postexposure ) with a cell culture vaccine or persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer .
These persons should receive only vaccine ( i.e. , postexposure for a person previously vaccinated ) .
The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite exposures reported by persons who have never been previously vaccinated for rabies , regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of prophylaxis .
If postexposure prophylaxis has been initiated and appropriate laboratory diagnostic testing ( i.e. , the direct fluorescent antibody test ) indicates that the exposing animal was not rabid , postexposure prophylaxis can be discontinued .
Rabies IgG Use .
HRIG is administered only once ( i.e. , at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis ) to previously unvaccinated persons to provide immediate , passive , rabies virus - neutralizing antibody coverage until the patient responds to HDCV or PCECV by actively producing antibodies .
If HRIG was not administered when vaccination was begun ( i.e. , day 0 ) , it can be administered up to and including day 7 of the postexposure prophylaxis series ( 153 ) .
Beyond the seventh day , HRIG is not indicated because an antibody response to cell culture vaccine is presumed to have occurred .
Because HRIG can partially suppress active production of antibody , the dose administered should not exceed the recommended dose ( 154 ) .
The recommended dose of HRIG is 20 IU / kg ( 0.133 mL / kg ) body weight .
This formula is applicable to all age groups , including children .
If anatomically feasible , the full dose of HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around and into the wounds .
Any remaining volume should be injected IM at a site distant from vaccine administration .
This recommendation for HRIG administration is based on reports of rare failures of postexposure prophylaxis when less than the full amount of HRIG was infiltrated at the exposure sites ( 155 ) .
HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or in the same anatomical site as the first vaccine dose .
However , subsequent doses of vaccine in the 5 - dose series can be administered in the same anatomic location where the HRIG dose was administered , if this is the preferable site for vaccine administration ( i.e. , deltoid for adults or anterolateral thigh for infants and small children ) .
Vaccine Use .
Two rabies vaccines are available for use in the United States ( Table 1 ) ; either can be administered in conjunction with HRIG at the beginning of postexposure prophylaxis .
A regimen of 5 one - mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered IM to previously unvaccinated persons .
The first dose of the 5 - dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure .
This date is then considered day 0 of the postexposure prophylaxis series .
Additional doses should then be administered on days 3 , 7 , 14 , and 28 after the first vaccination .
For adults , the vaccination should always be administered IM in the deltoid area .
For children , the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is also acceptable .
The gluteal area should never be used for HDCV or PCECV injections because administration of HDCV in this area results in lower neutralizing antibody titers ( 156 ) .
Deviations from Recommended Postexposure Vaccination Schedules
Every attempt should be made to adhere to the recommended vaccination schedules .
Once vaccination is initiated , delays of a few days for individual doses are unimportant , but the effect of longer lapses of weeks or more is unknown ( 157 ) .
Most interruptions in the vaccine schedule do not require reinitiation of the entire series ( 158 ) .
For most minor deviations from the schedule , vaccination can be resumed as though the patient were on schedule .
For example , if a patient misses the dose scheduled for day 7 and presents for vaccination on day 10 , the day 7 dose should be administered that day and the schedule resumed , maintaining the same interval between doses .
In this scenario , the remaining doses would be administered on days 17 and 31 .
When substantial deviations from the schedule occur , immune status should be assessed by performing serologic testing 7 -- 14 days after administration of the final dose in the series .
Postexposure Prophylaxis Outside the United States
Persons exposed to rabies outside the United States in countries where rabies is enzootic might receive postexposure prophylaxis with regimens or biologics that are not used in the United States , including purified vero cell rabies vaccine ( Verorab , Imovax -- Rabies vero , TRC Verorab ) , purified duck embryo vaccine ( Lyssavac N ) , and different formulations of PCECV ( Rabipur® ) or HDCV ( Rabivac ) .
This information is provided to familiarize physicians with some of the regimens used more widely abroad .
These regimens have not been submitted for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for use in the United States ( 37,74,159--168 ) .
If postexposure prophylaxis is initiated outside the United States using one of these regimens or vaccines of nerve tissue origin , additional prophylaxis might be necessary when the patient presents for care in the United States .
State or local health departments should be contacted for specific advice in such cases .
Rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers from specimens collected 1 - - 2 weeks after pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis would be considered adequate if complete neutralization of challenge virus at a 1:5 serum dilution by RFFIT occurs .
Purified ERIG or fractions of ERIG have been used in developing countries where HRIG might not have been available .
The incidence of adverse reactions after ERIG administration has been low ( 0.8 % -- 6.0 % ) , and most of those that occurred were minor ( 169 -- 171 ) .
In addition , unpurified antirabies serum of equine origin might still be used in some countries where neither HRIG nor ERIG are available .
The use of this antirabies serum is associated with higher rates of serious adverse reactions , including anaphylaxis ( 172 ) .
Although no postexposure prophylaxis failures have occurred in the United States since cell culture vaccines and HRIG have been routinely used , failures have occurred abroad when less than potent biologics were used , if some deviation was made from the recommended postexposure prophylaxis protocol , or when less than the recommended amount of RIG was administered ( 155,173--175 ) .
Specifically , patients who contracted rabies after postexposure prophylaxis might not have had adequate local wound cleansing , might not have received rabies vaccine injections in the deltoid area ( i.e. , vaccine was administered in the gluteal area ) , or might not have received appropriate infiltration of RIG around the wound site .
Substantial delays between exposure and initiation of prophylaxis are of concern , especially with severe wounds to the face and head , which might provide access to the central nervous system through rapid viral neurotropism .
Rabies Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis
Pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis is administered for several reasons .
First , although pre-exposure vaccination does not eliminate the need for additional medical evaluation after a rabies exposure , it simplifies management by eliminating the need for RIG and decreasing the number of doses of vaccine needed .
This is particularly important for persons at high risk for being exposed to rabies in areas where modern immunizing products might not be available or where cruder , less safe biologics might be used , placing the exposed person at increased risk for adverse events .
Second , pre-exposure prophylaxis might offer partial immunity to persons whose postexposure prophylaxis is delayed .
Finally , pre-exposure prophylaxis might provide some protection to persons at risk for unrecognized exposures to rabies .
Pre-exposure vaccination should be offered to persons in high - risk groups , such as veterinarians and their staff , animal handlers , rabies researchers , and certain laboratory workers .
Pre -exposure vaccination also should be considered for persons whose activities bring them into frequent contact with rabies virus or potentially rabid bats , raccoons , skunks , cats , dogs , or other species at risk for having rabies .
In addition , some international travelers might be candidates for pre-exposure vaccination if they are likely to come in contact with animals in areas where dog or other animal rabies is enzootic and immediate access to appropriate medical care , including rabies vaccine and immune globulin , might be limited .
Routine pre-exposure prophylaxis for the general U.S. population or routine travelers to areas where rabies is not enzootic is not recommended ( 176,177 ) .
Primary Vaccination
Three 1.0 - mL injections of HDCV or PCECV should be administered IM ( deltoid area ) , one injection per day on days 0 , 7 , and 21 or 28 ( Table 5 ) .
The immunogenicity of IM primary vaccination with PCECV and HDCV has been reviewed .
Vaccine preparations for ID administration are no longer available in the United States .
Pre-Exposure Booster Doses of Vaccine
Persons who work with rabies virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities ( continuous risk category [ Table 6 ] ) ( 178 ) are at the highest risk for inapparent exposures .
Such persons should have a serum sample tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 6 months .
An IM booster dose ( Table 5 ) of vaccine should be administered if the serum titer falls to maintain a serum titer corresponding to a value of at least complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT .
The frequent - risk category includes other laboratory workers ( e.g. , those performing rabies diagnostic testing ) , cavers , veterinarians and staff , and animal - control and wildlife officers in areas where animal rabies is enzootic .
The frequent - risk category also includes persons who frequently handle bats , regardless of location in the United States or throughout the world , because of the existence of lyssaviruses on all continents except Antarctica .
Persons in the frequent - risk group should have a serum sample tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 2 years .
If the titer is less than complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT , the person also should receive a single booster dose of vaccine .
Veterinarians , veterinary students , and terrestrial animal - control and wildlife officers working in areas where rabies is uncommon to rare ( infrequent exposure group ) and certain at - risk international travelers who have completed a full pre-exposure vaccination series with licensed vaccines and according to schedule do not require routine serologic verification of detectable antibody titers or routine pre-exposure booster doses of vaccine .
If they are exposed to rabies in the future , they are considered immunologically primed against rabies and simply require postexposure prophylaxis for a person previously vaccinated ( i.e. , days 0 and 3 vaccination ) .
Postexposure Prophylaxis for Previously Vaccinated Persons
If a person is exposed to rabies , local wound care remains an important part of postexposure prophylaxis , even for previously vaccinated persons .
Previously vaccinated persons are those who have received one of the recommended pre-exposure or postexposure regimens of HDCV , PCECV , or RVA or those who received another vaccine and had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer .
These persons should receive 2 IM doses ( 1.0 mL each in the deltoid ) of vaccine , one immediately and one 3 days later .
Administration of RIG is unnecessary and should not be administered to previously vaccinated persons because the administration of passive antibody might inhibit the relative strength or rapidity of an expected anamnestic response ( 77 ) .
For previously vaccinated persons who are exposed to rabies , determining the rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer for decision - making about prophylaxis is inappropriate for at least three reasons .
First , several days will be required to collect the serum and determine the test result .
Second , no " protective " titer is known .
Finally , although rabies virus neutralizing antibodies are important components , other immune effectors also are operative in disease prevention .
Vaccination and Serologic Testing
Post - Vaccination Serologic Testing
In CDC studies , all healthy persons tested 2 - - 4 weeks after completion of pre-exposure and postexposure rabies prophylaxis in accordance with ACIP guidelines demonstrated an adequate antibody response to rabies ( 18,73,179,180 ) .
Therefore , no testing of patients completing pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis is necessary to document seroconversion unless the person is immunosuppressed .
Patients who are immunosuppressed by disease or medications should postpone pre-exposure vaccinations and consider avoiding activities for which rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated .
When that is not possible , immunosuppressed persons who are at risk for exposure to rabies should be vaccinated and their virus neutralizing antibody titers checked .
In these cases , failures to seroconvert after the third dose should be managed in consultation with appropriate public health officials .
When titers are obtained , specimens collected 1 - - 2 weeks after pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis should completely neutralize challenge virus at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT .
Antibody titers might decline over time since the last vaccination .
Small differences ( i.e. , within one dilution of sera ) in the reported values of rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer ( most properly reported according to a standard as IU / mL ) might occur among laboratories that provide antibody determination using the recommended RFFIT .
Rabies antibody titer determination tests that are not approved by FDA are not appropriate for use as a substitute for RFFIT in suspect human rabies antemortem testing because discrepant results between such tests and measures of actual virus neutralizing activity by RFFIT have been observed ( 181 ) .
Serologic Response and Pre-Exposure Booster Doses of Vaccine
Although virus neutralizing antibody levels might not definitively determine a person 's susceptibility or protection from a rabies virus exposure , titers in persons at risk for exposure are used to monitor the relative rabies immune status over time ( 182 ) .
To ensure the presence of a primed immune response over time among persons at higher than normal risk for exposure , titers should be checked periodically , with booster doses administered only as needed .
Two years after primary pre-exposure vaccination , a complete neutralization of challenge virus at a dilution of 1:5 ( by the RFFIT ) was observed among 93%-- 98 % of persons who received the 3 - dose pre-exposure series intramuscularly and 83%-- 95 % of persons who received the 3 - dose series intradermally ( 68 ) .
If the titer falls below the minimum acceptable antibody level of complete neutralization at a serum dilution of 1:5 , a single pre-exposure booster dose of vaccine is recommended for persons at continuous or frequent risk for exposure to rabies ( Table 6 ) .
The following guidelines are recommended for determining when serum testing should be performed after primary pre-exposure vaccination :
A person in the continuous - risk category should have a serum sample tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 6 months ( 178 ) .
) .
A person in the frequent - risk category should have a serum sample tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 2 years ( 183 ) .
State or local health departments or CDC can provide the names and addresses of laboratories performing appropriate rabies virus neutralizing serologic testing .
Management and Reporting of Adverse Reactions to Rabies Biologics
Once initiated , rabies prophylaxis should not be interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse reactions to rabies vaccine .
Usually , such reactions can be successfully managed with anti-inflammatory , antihistaminic , and antipyretic agents .
When a person with a history of hypersensitivity to rabies vaccine must be revaccinated , empiric intervention such as pretreatment with antihistamines might be considered .
Epinephrine should be readily available to counteract anaphylactic reactions , and the person should be observed carefully immediately after vaccination ( 184 ) .
Although serious systemic , anaphylactic , or neuroparalytic reactions are rare during and after the administration of rabies vaccines , such reactions pose a serious dilemma for the patient and the attending physician ( 14 ) .
A patient 's risk for acquiring rabies must be carefully considered before deciding to discontinue vaccination .
Advice and assistance on the management of serious adverse reactions for persons receiving rabies vaccines can be sought from the state or local health department or CDC .
All clinically significant adverse events occurring following administration of rabies vaccine should be reported to VAERS , even if causal relation to vaccination is not certain .
Although VAERS is subject to limitations common to passive surveillance systems , including underreporting and reporting bias , it is a valuable tool for characterizing the safety profile of vaccines and identifying risk factors for rare serious adverse reactions to vaccines ( 94 ) .
VAERS reporting forms and information are available at http://www.vaers.hhs.gov or by telephone ( 800-822-7967 ) .
Web - based reporting is available and health - care providers are encouraged to report electronically at https://secure.vaers.org/VaersDataEntryintro.htm.
Clinically significant adverse events following HRIG administration should be reported to the Food and Drug Administration 's MedWatch .
Reports can be submitted electronically to http://www.fda.gov/MedWatch.
Precautions and Contraindications
Immunosuppression
Corticosteroids , other immunosuppressive agents , antimalarials , and immunosuppressive illnesses can interfere with the development of active immunity after vaccination ( 185,186 ) .
For persons with immunosuppression , pre-exposure prophylaxis should be administered with the awareness that the immune response might be inadequate .
Patients who are immunosuppressed by disease or medications should postpone pre-exposure vaccinations and consider avoiding activities for which rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated .
When this course is not possible , immunosuppressed persons who are at risk for rabies should have their virus neutralizing antibody titers checked after completing the pre-exposure series .
A patient who fails to seroconvert after the third dose should be managed in consultation with their physician and appropriate public health officials .
No cases of rabies postexposure prophylaxis failure have been documented among persons immunosuppressed because of human immunodeficiency virus infection .
Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during postexposure prophylaxis unless essential for the treatment of other conditions .
When postexposure prophylaxis is administered to an immunosuppressed person , one or more serum samples should be tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has developed .
If no acceptable antibody response is detected , the patient should be managed in consultation with their physician and appropriate public health officials .
Pregnancy
Because of the potential consequences of inadequately managed rabies exposure , pregnancy is not considered a contraindication to postexposure prophylaxis .
Certain studies have indicated no increased incidence of abortion , premature births , or fetal abnormalities associated with rabies vaccination ( 187--189 ) .
If the risk for exposure to rabies is substantial , pre-exposure prophylaxis also might be indicated during pregnancy .
Rabies exposure or the diagnosis of rabies in the mother should not be regarded as reasons to terminate the pregnancy ( 157 ) .
Allergies
Persons who have a history of serious hypersensitivity to components of rabies vaccine or to other vaccines with components that are also present in rabies vaccine should be revaccinated with caution ( 184 ) .
Indigent Patient Programs
Both rabies vaccine manufacturers have patient assistant programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients .
Sanofi pasteur 's Indigent Patient Program ( providing Imogam ® Rabies - HT and Imovax ® Rabies ) is administered through the National Organization for Rare Disorders .
Information is available by telephone ( 877-798-8716 ) or e-mail ( nnadiq@rarediseases.org ) .
Information on Novartis Pharmaceuticals Patient Assistance Program for RabAvert® is available at http://www.corporatecitizenship.novartis.com/patients/drug-pricing/assistance-programs.shtml.
Treatment of Human Rabies
Rabies is associated with the highest case fatality rate of any infectious disease .
No proven effective medical treatment is recognized after the development of clinical signs .
Combined with intensive care , experimental measures have included administration of vidarabine , multisite ID vaccination with cell - culture vaccines , human leukocyte interferon , RIG by the intravenous and intrathecal routes , antithymocyte globulin , inosine pranobex , ribavirin , ketamine , and high doses of steroids ( 190 -- 197 ) .
Initiation of rabies vaccination after onset of clinical symptoms in patients with confirmed rabies diagnoses is not recommended and might be detrimental .
Survival has been well documented for only six patients .
In five of these cases , the persons had received rabies vaccination before the onset of disease ( 198--202 ) .
Only one patient has recovered from rabies without the institution of rabies vaccination ( 9,203 ) .
Despite these successes , rabies is not considered curable .
Treatment of clinical rabies remains an extreme challenge .
Rapid antemortem diagnosis is a priority .
When a definitive diagnosis is obtained , primary health considerations should focus , at a minimum , on comfort care and adequate sedation of the patient in an appropriate medical facility .
Sedation is often necessary because patients might become extremely agitated , especially in the presence of stimuli such as loud noises , air currents , and the sight or sound of running water , particularly during the acute neurologic phase of the disease ( 25 ) .
Beyond the overt clinical situation associated with progressive encephalitis , during fluctuating periods of lucidity , patient stress might be compounded by the psychological trauma resulting from a sense of personal isolation and hopelessness from the prognosis .
As new potential treatments become available , medical staff at specialized tertiary care hospitals might consider institution of an aggressive approach to experimental therapies , especially in confirmed cases in young healthy persons at an early stage of clinical disease , after in depth discussions and informed consent by the patient , family or legal representatives ( http://www.mcw.edu/display/router.asp?DocID=11655).
Parties authorized to give permission for such treatment also should be aware of the high probability for treatment failure , the anticipated expenses , and that in the rare instances of patient survival , the recovery might be associated with a variety of neurologic deficits requiring a lengthy period of rehabilitation ( 204 ) .
Continued efforts focusing on the elimination of exposure to sources of virus and the institution of appropriate and timely prophylaxis after exposure occurs remain the most effective public health measures to prevent human rabies .
Precautions for Safe Clinical Management of Human Rabies Patients
Human rabies patients do not pose any greater infection risk to health - care personnel than do patients with more common bacterial and viral infections ( 25 ) .
Medical staff should adhere to standard precautions as outlined by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee ( 126 ) .
Staff should wear gowns , goggles , masks , and gloves , particularly during intubation and suctioning ( 25 ) .
Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated only when the patient has bitten another person or when the patient 's saliva or other potentially infectious material such as neural tissue has contaminated an open wound or mucous membrane .

It is like something out of a horror movie : baby spiders devour their own mother , then climb aboard her web , and make it throb in a series of pulsating vibrations .
But that is exactly what black - lace weaver spiderlings do , a biologist in South Korea has discovered .
After cannibalizing their mother , up to 160 spiderlings gather and contract their bodies in synchrony , collectively pulling at the web to make it vibrate .
The behaviour may deter predators .
Details are published in the journal Insects Sociaux .
Ultimate sacrifice
Most spiders are solitary animals .
But some are social animals , living in communal webs throughout their lives , cooperating in nest construction , brood caring and prey hunting .
Other species are subsocial , where individual spiders come together and cooperate at certain stages of their lives .
Black - lace weaver spiders ( Amaurobius ferox ) can be found under stones and logs in the woodlands and gardens of Europe and North America .
They belong to the subsocial spiders , with the young baby spiders displaying a range of intriguing behaviours .
For example , female A. ferox spiders produce a single clutch of 60 - 130 spiderlings , which she feeds by laying eggs for her offspring to eat .
But then she makes the ultimate sacrifice : she encourages her spiderlings onto her body , and allows them to devour her alive ( see video below ) .
After she has died , the spiderlings then form a social group for 3 - 4 weeks until they disperse from the social nest .
During this time , the spiderlings are known to cooperate by going hunting together .
By cooperating on a hunt , the spiderlings are capable of attacking and subduing prey up to 20 times bigger than themselves .
Web shake
But Dr Kil Won Kim of the University of Incheon of the Republic of Korea , who has researched this cooperative hunting behaviour , has discovered that the spiderlings gang together in another bizarre , and previously unknown way .
" After matriphagy [ the eating of the mother ] , A. ferox spiderlings show synchronous movement , contracting their bodies simultaneously , " Dr Kim told the BBC .
This behaviour emerged the day after the death of the mother , and was triggered by intruding insects , mites or worms approaching the web .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
An individual spiderling contracted its body , pulling at the web as it did so .
Almost immediately , other spiderlings joined in , also contracting their bodies .
That created a bigger effect , which was to make the whole web throb in a series of rhythmic vibrations .
At its peak , up to 60 per cent of the spiderlings engaged in this behaviour at any one time .
The denser the group of spiderlings , the stronger the vibrations of the web , and the presence of other spiderlings nearby encouraged others to also contract their bodies .
The spiderlings also performed contractions at the highest frequency four days after eating their mother , with the behaviour declining as they aged .
It also occured during the period before the baby spiderlings were old enough to go hunting .
Scary tactic
It is unclear why the baby spiders make their web throb in this way .
" Contractions may function as antipredatory behaviour , " says Dr Kim .
A few lines of evidence point to this .
The baby spiders do not do it in the presence of the mother , which likely protects them before sacrificing herself .
They also vibrate only when a large intruder is nearby , suggesting it is a defence mechanism , as the vibrations would be transmitted to any intruder touching the web .
The visible movements of the web may also give an intruder the impression that there is a much larger organism nearby , again deterring them from approaching the vulnerable baby spiders .
Few other collective defence responses have been recorded in spiders .
One other example is in the territorial social spider Cyrtophora moluccencis .
When a bee or wasp flies over a female 's cocoon , she will shake it vigorously , an action that prompts other females nearby to also shake their cocoons , perhaps to deter the invader .
Arguably the Jigga of porn ( complete with vast media empire and gradual fall - off ) , Jenna branded her dazzling looks ( pre-surgery ) into a one - woman industry complete with a billboard in Times Square .
In Hov 's parlance , she clearly knows how to ride nice dick and her head is priceless .
In her absolute prime , she 'd probably be way higher on this list , but all those Botox and lip injections have blurred her glory days .
For shame .

The nuns were reportedly unhappy police had entered convent grounds
Uganda police are investigating after a marijuana plantation was uncovered in the garden of a convent .
A regional police chief told the BBC that plants covering one acre had been found and uprooted in the southern Masaka district .
Two nuns and two porters have been questioned .
One of the nuns has been quoted by local media as saying the marijuana was used to treat farm animals , such as pigs .
Southern regional commander Emmanuel Muhuirwe told the BBC News website that only the porters had been arrested - not the nuns .
He said the nuns had been questioned because the garden was part of the convent .
But he said no - one had been charged yet and the porters have been released on bail .
Commander Muhuirwe also dismissed reports in Uganda 's New Vision newspaper that the nuns had been angry that the police had entered the convent without permission , pointing out that the garden was separate from the convent building .
Call me a hard - hearted bastard , but I 'm finding it difficult to summon up the sympathy demanded by the institutional investors now threatening to sue BP .
They claim that the company inflated its share price by misrepresenting its safety record .
I do n't know whether this is true , but I do know that the investors did all they could not to find out .
They have just been presented with the bill for the years they spent shouting down anyone who questioned the company .
They might not have been warned by BP , but they were warned repeatedly by environmental groups and ethical investment funds .
Every year , at BP 's annual general meetings , they were invited to ask the firm to provide more information about the environmental and social risks it was taking .
Every year they voted instead for BP to keep them in the dark .
While relying on this company for a disproportionate share of their income ( BP pays 12 % of all UK firms ' dividends ) , they refused to hold it to account .
It 's not as if the warning signs were hard to spot .
One of them is splashed across the front page of BP 's 2009 annual review : the title is " Operating at the energy frontiers " .
Like all multinational oil companies , BP has been shut out of the easy fields by the decline of its old reserves and the rising power of state - owned companies .
So , to keep the money flowing , BP takes risks that other companies wo n't contemplate .
" Risk , " the review states , " remains a key issue for every business , but at BP it is fundamental to what we do .
We operate at the frontiers of the energy industry , in an environment where attitude to risk is key …
We continue to show our ability to take on and manage risk , doing the difficult things that others either can't do or choose not to do . "
Among the risky situations that BP claimed to have mastered in the 2009 review was deepwater drilling : " We are exceptionally well - placed to sustain our success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico over the long term . "
But the risk here was scarcely greater than on the other frontiers .
It is now producing oil from the Rumaila field in Iraq , as a result of a contract agreed in controversial circumstances .
It has recently started shipping liquefied natural gas out of the Tangguh project in West Papua .
The licence was provided by the Indonesian government , which brutally annexed the country to which the gas belongs , and committed genocide there .
If West Papua achieves independence , BP will have a lot of explaining to do .
It is pouring money into deepwater oil off the coast of Brazil , and ultra - deepwater drilling off the coast of Angola .
Having previously refused to invest in Canadian tar sands on the grounds of ecological risk , in 2007 it reversed this position , plunging into the world 's biggest environmental battleground .
Its pipeline across Alaska keeps leaking oil into sensitive habitats .
Its pipeline between Azerbaijan and Turkey was built with the help of land seizures and a contract that effectively grants BP executive power over the Turkish government .
For how long will that be allowed to stand ?
According to a response it sent to a group of ethical shareholders earlier this year , BP appears to have based its expectations of future earnings on unconstrained energy demand .
The figures for world energy growth it cited come from the International Energy Agency 's reference scenario , which the agency defines as " a baseline picture of how global energy markets would evolve if governments make no changes to their existing policies and measures " .
The IEA predicts that this unconstrained demand would lead to 6C of global warming .
If governments do decide to take climate change seriously ( and the Deepwater Horizon spill gives Barack Obama leverage on this issue that he did n't possess before ) , BP 's expectations become as realistic as Gordon Brown 's prediction of uninterrupted economic growth .
The question was not whether one of these risks would materialise , but which , and when .
The question is unchanged .
The next disaster will happen sooner or later – but whether it will take place in Angola or Alaska , or somewhere in between , is anyone 's guess .
What BP presents as brave and visionary looks to its victims like a brazen disregard of life and livelihoods .
Its expectations of future profit were based on the assumption – which , until now , has proved relatively safe – that other people would pick up the bill .
In 2002 , after one of its analysts conducted his own research into the safety risks BP was taking in Alaska , Henderson Global Investors dropped BP from its socially responsible investment funds ( this raises the question of what it was doing there in the first place , but never mind ) .
Henderson published its decision , and the result was a stampede out of BP stocks by … nobody .
The other investment companies chose to ignore Henderson 's warning and rely instead on the oil firm 's assurances .
Far from viewing BP and the other oil companies as risky options , institutional investors have treated them as foundation stocks : boring , dependable investments .
As James Marriott of the pressure group Platform points out , part of the reason is that they expected governments to step up and defend any oil company that got itself into trouble : even , if necessary , to go to war on its behalf .
They were seldom disappointed – until now .
So whenever greens or ethical investors warned them about BP 's cavalier behaviour , instead of thanking them , the big fund managers reacted with hostility .
On 15 April , five days before the Deepwater Horizon failure , a group of investors led by Co-operative Asset Management tabled a resolution at BP 's AGM requesting more disclosure of the risks it was running in its tar sands operations .
It was one of the most successful ethical resolutions ever , but all that means is that funds holding 15 % of the shares either supported it or abstained .
The other 85 % supported the company 's right to keep bamboozling them .
As a report last year by FairPensions warned , pension funds typically delegate the responsibility for assessing environmental and social risk to fund managers .
The fund managers are either unwilling or unable to discharge it , explaining that the pension funds do n't press them .
FairPensions surveyed the UK's 30 leading occupational schemes , with dire results .
Only five funds published their voting records ; just six had signed up to the UN's Principles of Responsible Investment .
Even funds representing workers at companies that trumpet their ethical credentials – Aviva , Marks & Spencer and the Co-operative Group – performed dismally .
The universities ' and BT pension funds did well .
The coal pensions scheme and the IBM , Unilever , BAE and Lloyds TSB funds each scored nought out of 20 for responsible investment .
So it 's not BP , or not BP alone , which has damaged the pensions of the millions of people whose retirement funds are invested in the company ; it 's the fund holders now attacking it for deploying the dangerous strategies they endorsed .
They have chosen the wrong target : they should be suing themselves .
Genachowski says the ' third way ' approach would give the FCC the authority it needs to protect consumers .
FCC moves toward Internet regulation
The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to begin the process of developing a new regulatory framework to govern Internet services — despite vocal protests from some members of Congress .
With a 3 - 2 vote , the agency decided to move forward in gathering information about Chairman Julius Genachowski ’s proposed “ third way ” approach , which he describes as a “ light touch ” policy that would apply to broadband networks some , but not all , of the rules that govern traditional phone lines .

While the Republican members of the FCC voted against proceeding , the commission is likely to apply some new rules to broadband services to ensure it has clear - cut authority over Internet connections .
Doing so would allow Genachowski to move forward on Net neutrality regulations , which would require Internet service providers to treat all traffic equally on their networks .
Genachowski said the “ third way ” approach would give the FCC the authority it needs to protect consumers without applying burdensome regulations to networks that have long been untouched by government rules .
However , Republican Commissioners Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker said Genachowski’s effort to reclassify broadband services is unnecessary and would need formal legislation in order to hold up in court .
“ We are not Congress , ” McDowell said .
Michael Copps , the senior Democrat on the panel , said the FCC needs to “ reclaim our authority ” over an industry that consumers increasingly rely on for every aspect of daily life .
“ Anyone who thinks Congress envisioned deploying the new communications technologies and services of the digital age without the safeguards that generations of consumers and consumer advocates fought for and won has missed the meaning of the law and the intent of our elected representatives , ” he said .
But just as the commission voted to begin exploring a new framework , lawmakers continued to trade barbs over the FCC ’s way forward — signaling the fight that could await the agency as it seeks an update to the 1996 Communications
Act that governs it .
Thirty - two House members , led by Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - Wash . ) , praised Genachowski’s “ third way ” in a letter to the commission Thursday .
Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) soon followed suit in their own joint statement after the vote , promising to explore the issue further in Congress .
That show of support followed a separate , equally supportive missive sent Wednesday by Reps.
Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) , Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) , Mike Doyle ( D - Pa. ) and Doris Matsui ( D - Calif . ) — all members of the House Subcommittee on Communications , Technology and the Internet .
But that subcommittee ’s former chairman , Rep. Fred Upton ( R - Mich . ) , held nothing back in his own Wednesday letter that thrashed the FCC leader .
" Despite overwhelming opposition within a Congress that possesses the actual authority that the FCC covets , the commission now inexplicably appears poised on Thursday to take another misguided leap towards its investment - suffocating attempt to regulate broadband providers as common carriers , ” he wrote .
Upton ’s warnings arrived a month or so after about half the entire House penned letters to air doubts about the FCC ’s plans to reclassify broadband using its own rule - making procedures .
Many have since asked the agency to stand down and await lawmakers ’ legislative fix .
Responding to those concerns , Genachowski told reporters after the Thursday vote : " There 's no question the Communications Act gives us authority , and there 's no question the act could be improved . ”
He later pledged to work with congressional leaders to revamp the sweeping law .
Thursday ’s vote also drew immediate disapproval from Verizon , which has long attacked the FCC ’s plans to reclassify as a threat to innovation .
“ Reclassifying high - speed broadband Internet service as a telecom service is a terrible idea .
The negative consequences for online users and the Internet ecosystem would be severe and have ramifications for decades , ” Tom Tauke , Verizon ’s executive vice president for public affairs , said in a statement .
“ It is difficult to understand why the FCC continues to consider this option , ” he continued , while also pledging to work with Congress and the FCC in the coming months .
But supporters quickly heralded the agency ’s vote Thursday , stressing it could pave the way for the consumer protection and Net neutrality rules that have long been staple agenda items for the FCC .
“ The commission ’s simple , uncomplicated action today makes certain that the expert agency in telecommunications has the authority to carry out its mission , ” said Gigi Sohn , president and co-founder of Public Knowledge .
“ FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski , Commissioners Michael Copps and Mignon Clyburn today demonstrated they are dedicated to following through on their grand goals and conservative policies , which will ultimately lead to a more vibrant economy , ” she added .
“ They deserve our thanks and our support . ”
The domestication of animals and plants is the most important technological innovation during human history .
This genetic transformation of wild species has occurred as humans have used individuals carrying favorable gene variants for breeding purposes .
In the current issue of Nature , an international team led by researchers at Uppsala University , and including researchers from Virginia Tech , has revealed some of the secrets underlying the remarkable development of the domestic chicken .
The domestic chicken has in recent years become the most important and cost - effective source of animal protein world - wide .
In the beginning of the 20th century specialized layer ( egg- producing ) and broiler ( meat - producing ) chickens were developed .
The approach has been remarkably successful and has led to huge improvements in productivity .
" The strategy to study four different populations of layer chickens as well as four broiler populations allowed us to reveal genetic changes of crucial importance for chicken domestication in general as well as changes that were essential for the development of layers or broilers , " says Leif Andersson who coordinated the study .
In 2004 , a draft genome sequence of the chicken was established by sequencing a single female red junglefowl , the wild ancestor of chickens .
The task required a major economic investment ( millions of US dollars ) and a large international team of scientists .
In the current study the researchers have used new sequencing technologies and a modest budget to analyze pools of individuals representing eight different populations of the domestic chicken and a red junglefowl population .
" This is the first study ever where the genetic diversity within and between populations are examined across the whole genome , " says Michael Zody , who did his PhD partially on this project and is now a researcher at the Broad Institute .
" The new sequencing technologies allow us to address important biological questions that were impossible to study just a few years ago . "
A selective sweep takes place when a favorable mutation becomes fixed in a population .
This happens in all species during the course of evolution and it happens in domestic animals as a consequence of human - driven selection for favored traits .
One of the most interesting findings in this study was a striking selective sweep at the TSHR gene that codes for the thyroid - stimulating hormone receptor .
In vertebrates , this protein has a key role in metabolic regulation but also in determining the timing of reproduction as a response to changes in day length , a trait that is strictly controlled in most wild animals but which is drastically altered in domestic chickens that can reproduce all year around .
" Our discovery that every domestic chicken that we have studied representing populations from Sweden to China carry a mutant form of the TSHR protein strongly suggests that this genetic change was an important step in the evolution of the domestic chicken , " says Leif Andersson .
Another very convincing selective sweep was observed in broiler chickens and involved the TBC1D1 gene , a gene that has previously been associated with obesity in humans and the TBC1D1 protein is involved in the regulation of glucose uptake in muscle cells .
" Our study shows that billions of broiler chickens worldwide carry a mutant form of the TBC1D1 gene and we are now very eager to identify the causative mutation at this locus and to reveal the molecular mechanism by which it impacts growth , " says Carl - Johan Rubin who was responsible for the bioinformatic analysis of selective sweeps .
" Our study has direct implications for animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research since we can so effectively reveal genes associated with changes in phenotypic traits , " concludes Leif Andersson .
The research team identified a gene found in all of Virginia Tech 's high - growth chickens but few of the low - growth ones that appears to regulate appetite – a finding that could have ramifications for both animal and human health studies involving weight .
Previous research has shown that appetite , in addition to metabolism , plays a significant role in weight gain or loss in poultry .
The team is also investigating a gene that encodes the thyroid - stimulating hormone receptor protein to determine whether domestication altered the genetic makeup of chickens thousands of years ago .
If true , this would be the first time that scientists have identified a mutation in animals caused by domestication .
New research pours scorn on the comforting but erroneous belief that Windows surfers who avoid smut and wares on the web are likely to avoid exposure to malware .
A study by free anti-virus firm Avast found 99 infected legitimate domains for every infected adult web site .
In the UK , Avast found that more infected domains contained the word " London " ( such as the blog section of http://kensington-london-hotels.co.uk) than the word " sex " .
Among the domains labelled as infected by Avast was the smart phones section of the Vodafone UK website .
The mobile phone operator 's site contained a malicious JavaScript redirect script that attempted to take advantage of an unpatched Windows Help and Support Centre flaw ( CVE - 2010 - 1885 ) to infect the machines of visiting surfers .
HTML files from sub-domain blackberry.vodafone.co.uk still contain malicious code at the time of writing but point to a site containing the attack payload site that has been pulled offline .
" Users browsing Vodafone domain should be safe - until new hack / updated hack will be performed , " Avast researcher Miloslav Korenko told The Reg .
" This may happen in the same way as the first hack .
" Of course , the Blackberry section of Vodafone .
co.uk website needs to be cleaned as well - to prevent future attack similar to this one . "
We have passed on details of the problem to Vodafone and will update this story as and when we get a response .
The type of attack against Vodafone is typical of one in five of the website infections identified by Avast .
The anti-virus firm 's results were culled from anonymous security incident logs submitted by users of its security software since the middle of last year .
Data submitted includes information on the malware type and visited website , from which Avast draws its conclusions that infection of regular legitimate websites is a far more common cause of problems than visits to smut sites .
Infected sites recorded by the study include Brazilian software download site Baixaki and a variety of small business websites in Germany .
Avast said a declining rate of the infections on ‘ adult ’ websites during its study emerged as a clear trend .
" We are not recommending people to start searching for erotic content but the statistics are clear - for every infected adult domain we identify there are 99 others with perfectly legitimate content that are also infected , " commented Avast CTO Ondrej Vlcek . ®
Here 's a short story that ought to give pause to anyone who thinks that Microsoft 's ownership of the enterprise is a permanent and unyielding fact .
Granted , it 's told by the CEO of Red Hat , an open - source competitor , but it still portrays a reality that will increasingly put pressure on Microsoft 's software - licensing model .
Jon Brodkin , ComputerWorld :
As chief executive of Red Hat , Jim Whitehurst spends much of his time traveling the world and talking to CIOs , and he constantly hears one thing : that they are " under siege " by user expectations .
People 's richest IT experiences these days happen at home , with Google , Facebook , Twitter , iTunes and the like , Whitehurst said in his keynote address Wednesday at the Red Hat Summit in Boston .
In the workplace , IT budgets are rising but actual services are improving incrementally at best , he said .
" I talked to one CIO who said , ' look , my biggest competitor is Google , ' " Whitehurst said .
The unnamed CIO works for what Whitehurst described as a " big industrial logistics company . "
A few months ago the CIO was asked by the chief marketing officer to provide a way for marketing employees around the world to share and build documents together , and perform other collaborative tasks .
The CIO discussed the project with his application development group , then went back to the CMO and said " we can do this , in nine months at a cost of $ 14 million , " according to Whitehurst .
" The CMO says ' what are you talking about ?
I was describing my daughter 's high school science project . '
And they were on Google Documents , sharing information , jointly editing documents , and they 're doing it for free .
This is a true story .
I may have been slightly off on the numbers , but a true story . "
Microsoft bulls who once assumed the company 's dominance of the Internet was just a matter of time are now equally confident that the company will never lose its hold on the enterprise .
Stories like the one above , as well as the simple usage habits of the tens of thousands of individual people who make up enterprises , suggest otherwise .
Now , if Microsoft can transition its products to the cloud , which it has begun doing , it 's possible that they will eventually see the same wholesale user - driven adoption that has boosted the early fortunes of Google Apps , Apple 's iPhone / iPad , and so on .
And it's also possible that Microsoft may be able to continue to transition to a services model , a la IBM , and thus avoid having its business destroyed .
But it 's unlikely that such a new model will be as profitable as the old one , and the transition wo n't likely be smooth .

Mérida , June 21st 2010 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) assigned $ 56.3 billion of its budget to social development between 2001 and 2009 , according to the state owned company ’s president , Rafael Ramirez , speaking on Televen yesterday .
The money went to health , education , food , and other programs .
Ramirez specified that $ 28 billion went to the National Development Fund ( Fonden , which in turn has spent the money on public projects such as transport and energy infrastructure , technology , housing , and medicine ) , $ 1.8 billion went to communities , $ 2.06 billion went to the basic literacy program Mission Ribas , and $ 5.7 billion went to the health mission Barrio Adentro .
Also , PDVSA assigned $ 3.6 billion to agricultural projects , $ 2.8 billion to infrastructure projects , and $ 2.8 million to housing , said Ramirez .
According to the Central Bank of Venezuela ( BCV ) PDVSA directed a total $ 13.3 billion ( or 7.3 % of the GDP ) to social projects in 2006 .
Such social spending is in addition to the high social spending the Venezuelan government has been including in its budgets .
Almost 46 % of the government ’s 2010 budget is allocated to social spending such as public education , social development , health care , and the social missions .
In roughly a similar period , from 2002 to 2009 , PDVSA earned an extra $ 85.7 billion as a result of the Plan of Full Petroleum Sovereignty which involved adjusted taxes and royalties , Ramirez explained .
In 2005 , Venezuela increased oil royalties from 1 % to 16.66 % and in 2008 the government implanted a new tax on extraordinary oil profits .
However , the Venezuelan daily El Universal , using figures from the oil company ’s annual reports , states that PDVSA ’s spending on the social programs called “ missions ” decreased by 82 % from 2007 to 2009 .
The statistics , which pertain only to the social missions and not to other spending on community projects , agricultural credits , infrastructure and other development projects , show that in 2007 PDVSA designated $ 5.3 billion to the missions , $ 1.9 billion in 2008 and 942 million in 2009 , when oil prices plunged .
Ramirez PDVSA had become stronger despite the fact that “ in 2008 the price of oil per barrel was $ 140 dollars , and in 2009 it fell to $ 57 . ”
Venezuela has 212 billion barrels of petroleum in certified reserves , Ramirez said .
It has produced just over 3 million barrels per day since 2004 .
Recently , CNET reported on a study that was done by security - firm SMobile Systems involving Android apps , purporting that a full 20 % of Android apps have access to personal information .
According to the article , “ … dozens of apps were found to have the same type of access to sensitive information as known spyware does , including access to the content of e-mails and text messages , phone call information , and device location , said Dan Hoffman , chief technology officer at SMobile Systems . ”
Now before we start going into full - on panic mode , let ’s think about this .
The way that security - firm SMobile Systems went about their study was by looking at the permissions that the apps in question used .
There ’s a definite problem with this method .
As an example , let ’s take one of the apps in the app store and look at its permissions .
For our purposes , we ’re going to use Google ’s own Voice app .
Google Voice is a phone / SMS app that uses Google ’s own services to make and receive calls and text messages , as well as giving access to visual voicemail that offers several caveats ( such as voice - to - text transcriptions ) that other visual voicemail setups do n’t .
Google Voice has access to the following information :
Your personal information Services that cost you money Your messages Network communication Your accounts P hone calls Hardware controls and finally System tools .
According to the criteria that SMobile Systems used , Google Voice would be considered malware .
Now let ’s take a quick look at why that information is needed :
Your personal information - Google Voice has the ability to read and write contact data .
Well … yeah .
It needs that functionality in order to properly function as a phone replacement app .
There ’s no sense in having to go to a completely separate app in order to add , edit , or remove contacts .

There ’s no sense in having to go to a completely separate app in order to add , edit , or remove contacts .
Services that cost you money , your messages , phone calls - Google Voice has the ability to directly call phone numbers and send SMS messages .
Is n’t that sort of the point ?
I do n’t think I need to address this one .

Network communication - Google Voice has full Internet access .

Your accounts - Google Voice has access to your Google Voice account , can manage the accounts list , and use authentication credentials of said account .
It would be rather difficult for the Google Voice app to function without access to your Google Voice account , no ?

Hardware controls - Change your audio settings .
There are loud people that you definitely do n’t want yelling in your ear .
For this purpose , there ’s the volume buttons .
Change your audio settings .

For this purpose , there ’s the volume buttons .
System tools - Prevents phone from sleeping .
Depending on how your phone is setup ( especially if you ’re using wifi ) , the phone going into sleep would completely interrupt your internet connection , thus terminating the call with your rich uncle that was offering you a boatload of money .
On a completely unrelated note , can you introduce me to your uncle ?
So , as we can see , yes , Google Voice has the “ type of access to sensitive information as known spyware does ” but it uses this information to function properly .
I do n’t think that we could really classify it as “ spyware , ” could we ?
Now are there some spyware application in the Market .
Absolutely , as with any other app store , no matter how close walled .
The best thing to do is to report these apps if they ’re encountered , instead of just uninstalling them and saying nothing .
The Android Market is a diverse shop that allows the user the choice to supplement or replace their existing stock applications with something that may work better for them .
True flexibility .
For this , the slight chance of running into a malicious or buggy program could be considered worth it for many people .

Abstract
The D-lab Honduras team designed and constructed a wind - powered water pump in rural Honduras during IAP 2007 .
Currently , the system does not work under its own power and water must be pumped by hand .
This thesis seeks to explore a variety of mechanism and aerodynamic changes to allow the system to function as designed .
The novel modifications to the Savonius rotor that were made do not seem to improve its performance .
Within the constraints of the installed components , the current rotor should perform well pending other changes .
The most promising improvements to the system are weight reducing and friction reducing measures , and in combination with understanding the wind conditions in the immediate vicinity of the rotor , changes will be made this summer so that unassisted wind pumping will be possible .
Note that I am a geologist , not an engineer .
The diagrams are intended to be cartoons to illustrate simple concepts .
There has been much debate about pressure in relation to the Macondo blow out and I thought it might be helpful to explain the origins of sub - surface pressure differentials in as simple terms as possible .
( a) Basic concepts
Pressure increases with depth in the sub - surface proportinal to the density of material .
The lowest density material encountered is normally gas which has the shalowest pressure gradient , followed by oil , water and then rock .
Normally pressured water is called the hydrostatic pressure gradient .
But in the sub - surface , the presence of regional rock seals may produce over pressure in water caused by rock pressing on water ( see example d ) .
The rock pressure gradient is referred to as the lithostatic pressure gradient .
( b) Common configuration in reservoir
In an oil / gas reservoir the oil essentially floats on water and the gas floats on oil .
The top seal prevents the oil and gas escaping giving rise to the pressure configuration as shown .
The " pressure kick " at the top seal ( 1 ) is contained when drilling by the drilling mud .
( c) Common configuration in production tubing
If oil ( ± gas ) are allowed to enter production tubing then a column of oil ± gas may exist all the way to the surface .
This long column of low density material creates large positive pressure differentials that need to be contained by the production infrastructure .
Note how the pressure difference grows up the well .
Pressure difference on the sea bed ( 2 ) is lower than on the sea surface ( 3 ) .
In the case of Macondo , the 5000 ft column of water exerts some useful pressure , limiting the flow of oil from the well .
(d) Over pressure
Deep reservoirs such as Macondo are often over pressured .
That means that regional rock seals prevent subsurface water escaping .
The rocks above can then exert some pressure on the water .
Note how over pressure can create a much larger pressure differential at the top seal .
These are the large pressure kicks that are of great concern to drillers in this type of environment .
Note how over pressure gets transmitted to surface through oil and gas in production tubing .
Our last NAAM inhalation was the fiery 7 - minute “ Icy Row . ”
As mentioned , the sludgy psych trio ’s 10 - song collection , put to tape on a 100 - acre dairy farm in the Catskills , included any number of epics like the 17 - minute opener “ Kingdom ” and almost 8 - minute , darkly atmospheric ( and , really , pummeling ) closer “ Black Ice . ”
With “ Skyling Slip ” we get a taste of the guys moving into less extended , but still epic territory .
The video , directed by Rachelle Rahme , was shot on location in Brooklyn and includes all sorts of stoned mysticism with a fair share of bearded skateboarding ( it ’s like watching Fenriz ollie ) , beer -y carousing , open - mouth kissing , bad acting , and near - seppuku .
A more realistic ending would ’ve found the guys passed out on the floor of Duff ’s at 4AM , but it ’s more triumphant this way .

ScreenwriterWilliam Goldman once famously declared that the most important fact of life in Hollywood is that “ nobody knows anything . ”
It was his way of describing a reality that continues to haunt the movie business : Studio executives have no idea which pictures will make money .
Unless , of course , those pictures are made by Pixar Animation Studios .
Since 1995 , when the first Toy Story was released , Pixar has made nine films , and every one has been a smashing success .
Pixar ’s secret ?
Its unusual creative process .
Most of the time , a studio assembles a cast of freelance professionals to work on a single project and cuts them loose when the picture is done .
At Pixar , a staff of writers , directors , animators , and technicians move from project to project .
As a result , the studio has built a team of moviemakers who know and trust one another in ways unimaginable on most sets .
Which explains how they can handle the constant critiques that are at the heart of Pixar ’s relentless process .
Animation days at the studio all begin the same way :
The animators and director gather in a small screening room filled with comfy couches .
They eat Cap ’n Crunch and drink coffee .
Then the team begins analyzing the few seconds of film animated the day before , as they ruthlessly “ shred ” each frame .
Even the most junior staffers are encouraged to join in .
The upper echelons also subject themselves to megadoses of healthy criticism .
Every few months , the director of each Pixar film meets with the brain trust , a group of senior creative staff .
The purpose of the meeting is to offer comments on the work in progress , and that can lead to some major revisions .
“ It ’s important that nobody gets mad at you for screwing up , ” says Lee Unkrich , director of Toy Story 3 .
“ We know screwups are an essential part of making something good .
That ’s why our goal is to screw up as fast as possible . ”
The proof is in the product .
The average international gross per Pixar film is more than $ 550 million , and the cartoons are critical darlings — the studio has collected 24 Academy Awards .
Nobody in Hollywood knows anything .
Pixar seems to know everything .

Lee Unkrich , director of Toy Story 3 , used to make live - action movies .
But the Pixar emphasis on revision has changed his approach to filmmaking .
“ If I went back to live - action , I ’d have to do it the Pixar way , ” he says .
“ If I did n’t , I ’d feel like I was walking a tightrope without a net . ”
Darla Anderson has produced four Pixar films : A Bug ’s Life , Monsters , Inc. , Cars , and now Toy Story 3 .
“ I ’m the pushy mom of producers .
I always drive it to the bitter edge , ” she says .
“ I always want it to be better , even if it means throwing something out that we ’ve spent months working on . ”
Bobby Podesta , supervising animator of Toy Story 3 , has been with Pixar since 1997 and , like most animators , considers himself an actor .
“ My job is to convince you that the stack of polygons on the screen is actually alive , ” he says .
Guido Quaroni is the supervising technical director on Toy Story 3 .
According to him , TS3 was the first film in which the technical team was able to fulfill every animation request from the creative staff .
“ We never said no to the director , ” he says .

The first challenge : coming up with a great story .
For inspiration , the creative team leaves the Pixar campus and heads to the Poet ’s Loft , a cabin 50 miles north of San Francisco .
They thought they already had a great start on the plot for Toy Story 3 , but after 20 minutes , the whole thing is scrapped .
By day two , a new idea emerges — how would the toys feel if Andy , their owner , left for college ?

Working from a series of plot points , screenwriter Michael Arndt begins drafting the script .
At the same time , director Lee Unkrich and the story artists start sketching storyboards for each scene .
There is no animation yet , just drawn poses like in a comic book .
But the storyboards allow the filmmakers to begin imagining the look and feel of each scene .
Presentation
36
So far , the characters exist only as digital illustrations .
Character design has begun .
Some are sculpted in clay and scanned .
Others are drawn by hand .
Later , visual textures — fur , fabric , hair — will be added to the form , a step known as simulation .
“ It ’s a constant negotiation with the technical side , ” says supervising animator Bobby Podesta .
“ Not everything we want is possible . ”
123
The storyboards are turned into what ’s called a story reel — a series of images that can be projected for an in - house audience like an elaborate flip book .
The lines are prerecorded by Pixar employees .
“ This is a crucial moment for the film , ” says Pixar president and cofounder Ed Catmull .
“ Watching along with an audience allows us to see what works and what does n’t . ”
Characterization
380
Actors start coming in to voice the script .
Tom Hanks takes his turn at the Pixar recording studio to lay down his vocal tracks .
Hanks reads every line dozens of times , varying his interpretations and emphasis .
The sessions are also filmed , so animators can watch the actor ’s expressions and use those as reference when they start animating the characters ’ faces .

The shaders are responsible for adding color and texture to characters ’ bodies and other surfaces .
One issue is the fact that Woody and Buzz are made of plastic :
Some plastics are slightly translucent , and they absorb light .
So the shaders used a subsurface scattering algorithm to simulate this effect and make the toys look more believable .
Animation
533
The pictures are moving .
Each character is defined by up to 1,000 avars — points of possible movement — that the animators can manipulate like strings on a puppet .
Each morning , the team gathers to review the second or two of film from the day before .
The frames are ripped apart as the team searches for ways to make the sequences more expressive .
806
The technical challenges start to pile up .
( Simulating a wet bear is especially complex . )
Good thing Steve Jobs insisted that the building ’s essential facilities be centrally located .
“ Walking to the bathroom or getting a cup of coffee is often the most productive part of my day , ” says producer Darla Anderson .
“ You bump into somebody by accident and then have a conversation that leads to a fix . ”
898
The animators are working flat out .
They stay late into the night in their highly personalized offices , which have been decorated in a variety of themes , from Polynesian tiki to ’ 70s - era love lounge .
( “ We let them do whatever they want , ” Catmull says . )
The animators even have their own working bars , complete with beer on tap and a collection of single - malt whiskeys .
907
Rendering — using computer algorithms to generate a final frame — is well under way .
The average frame ( a movie has 24 frames per second ) takes about seven hours to render , although some can take nearly 39 hours of computing time .
The Pixar building houses two massive render farms , each of which contains hundreds of servers running 24 hours a day .
Resolution
1,070
The movie is mostly done .
The team has completed 25 of the film ’s sequences and is just finishing an action scene that involves a runaway model train , smoke , dust clouds , force fields , lasers , mountainous terrain , and a massive bridge explosion .
It has taken 27 technical artists four months to perfect the scene .
1,084
With only weeks to go before the film is released , the audio mixers at Skywalker Sound combine dialog , music , and sound effects .
Every nuance is adjusted and re-adjusted .
After a four - year production process , it can be hard to let go of Woody , Lotso , Buzz , and the rest of the characters .
“ We do n’t ever finish a film , ” Unkrich says .
“ I could keep on making it better .
We ’re just forced to release it . ”
Building a Single Frame
From simple sketch to polished render .
1 / SKETCHES
There are 49,516 of these sketches in the movie ’s story reel , which is used as a kind of rough draft of the film .
This frame captures the initial excitement of the toys as they arrive at Sunnyside Daycare , their new home .
2 / COLOR SCRIPTS
It took art director Daisuke “ Dice ” Tsutsumi one week to create this impressionistic digital version of the scene .
The goal is to begin to define the style and lighting scheme of the frame .
Concept art from past movies is on display in the Pixar art gallery .
3 / PROPS
Toys are positioned in the 3 - D “ dressed set . ”
The TS3 team wanted the nursery to be alive with movement , so hundreds of characters are placed on the shelves .
Now the director can fine - tune the camera ’s movement to best capture the action .
4 / LAST DETAILS
The amount of labor spent on each character depends on its prominence in the final shot .
Background toys are given simple textures and basic movements , while Lotso and Woody — the stars of the scene — are lavished with attention .
5 / FINALE Surfaces — walls , clothing , faces — are fed through rendering software that simulates light and shadow .
It also adds texture to Lotso ’s fur , Barbie ’s leggings , and the carpet .
An average frame takes more than seven hours of computing time to render .
A more complex frame like this one required eleven hours .

Summary
Teaser
" Medical log , stardate 47229.1 .
Chief O'Brien and I have been working overtime to prepare for the arrival of a new cartographer .
Ensign Melora Pazlar is the first Elaysian to join Starfleet , and as such , requires special accommodations . "
Doctor Bashir and Lieutenant Dax are in the infirmary , testing out a wheelchair designed for Ensign Pazlar .
Dax expresses amazement that the specifications are even in the replicator 's database , saying she has n't seen a wheelchair in over three hundred years .
Bashir reveals that they were n't .
It was , in fact , Pazlar herself who had sent him the design and specifications , due to the fact that her normal anti-grav unit wo n't work on Deep Space 9 , a situation that Bashir likens to the troubles they had with integrating Starfleet cargo lifts .
Before they can discuss it further , Major Kira chimes in over the comm system , informing Bashir that the USS Yellowstone has just docked at airlock 14 .
The doctor responds , telling her they 're on their way , before taking the wheelchair and heading out with Dax .
On the Promenade , Bashir tells Dax how Ensign Pazlar must have had a hard time even getting to the station , since she grew up on a planet with such a low surface gravity .
Before Dax can reply , Chief O'Brien interrupts them , explaining that he has done the best he can with installing ramps but that the Cardassian design has made it difficult .
Bashir explains he has also been making some modifications to her chair , but O'Brien points out there are still a lot of places where she wo n't be able to get to .
Dax suggests they can help her by using the transporter but , as Bashir explains , Melora Pazlar wo n't have it .
She insists on getting about , herself , once her basic needs are met , a stipulation that Bashir greatly admires .
He goes on to say that he has examined all of her medical files , in preparation , then checks with the chief that her quarters are all ready .
" I even have the bumps on the head to prove it , " the chief jokes , commenting on the low - gravity system he has installed .
In the airlock , Melora is experiencing some difficulty walking .
Using a walking stick , she makes it to the entrance - way before Dax and Bashir appear round the corner .
" Ensign Melora Pazlar reporting for duty , " she greets .
Dax introduces herself and Bashir , though Melora already recognizes him from their subspace communications .
She notices her wheelchair , or " trolley car " as she calls it , and begins walking towards it .
Dax offers her some assistance but Melora abruptly refuses it .
Taking a seat in the chair , she notices that it is different from the one she has practiced on .
Bashir clarifies , saying he wanted to give her as much mobility as possible , but offers to change it back if that would help .
" No , I 'll adapt , " she adamantly replies , before driving it down the hall .
As they walk over one of the ramps O'Brien installed earlier , Dax explains she will be accompanying Melora on her upcoming survey mission in the Gamma Quadrant at the request of Commander Sisko .
Melora objects , taking it as a sign the Commander thinks she needs extra help to get the job done , but Dax points out the Commander would n't let any ensign take a runabout into the Gamma Quadrant the day after they arrive .
As the group approaches Melora 's quarters , she rather apathetically asks Bashir if he has made any modifications to her quarters , as well .
He courteously replies that everything is as she requested it .
With that , Melora says it was nice to meet them and heads over the ramp and into her room .
Dax and Bashir exchange a confounded look before heading off , themselves .
Act One
In Quark's , a Yridian man named Ashrock is admiring one of the Rings of Paltriss .
He says there are only eighty of them and Quark just happens to have forty two in his possession , but wants one hundred and ninety nine bars of gold - pressed latinum for them .
Quark proposes they " seal the deal " over a drink and so goes behind his bar to grab a bottle .
As he approaches the doorway to his bar , a shady figure enters .
Quark immediately recognizes him and is visibly unnerved by his presence .
Fallit
Kot is his name , and in a typical Quark way , he begins to flatter him with compliments though he is n't buying it .
Leaning in closer , he tells Quark that he has business with him , that he has come to kill him .
Meanwhile , in Sisko's office , Bashir and Dax are discussing Melora 's situation with the commander when she arrives in Ops .
She wheels her way over to Sisko , who welcomes her to the station .
Seeing Bashir and Dax , she asks if she is late , if the meeting has already begun but Sisko says he was just being informed about her request to pilot the runabout alone , something she expresses a wish to have been involved in .
The commander states he regularly has briefings from his senior staff regarding personnel issues and this one is no different than any other .
As they enter Sisko's office , she apologizes for sounding overly sensitive and explains that she is used to being shut out of the " Melora problem " , though she believes there is no Melora problem until people create one .
She further objects to Doctor Bashir being present , saying she does n't want to be treated like someone who is ill , though Commander Sisko does n't see anyone doing that .
" Try sitting in the chair , commander , " she argues .
" No one can understand until they sit in the chair . "
Calming down slightly , she illustrates the struggle she has been through since leaving her homeworld , that she has always spent her time in one chair or another since .
She shows her cane to Sisko and explains it is made from the wood of a garlanic tree and that her family gave it to her when she left .
She reveals how only a handful of Elaysians have ever left her planet , but she knew she wanted to be one of them , how she dreamed of exploring the stars when she was a child and that no chair or Cardassian station is going to stop her from attaining that dream .
Sisko admires her but reiterates his concerns about sending her into the Gamma Quadrant alone .
Melora says she can focus on the job better but Sisko denies her request ; Lieutenant Dax is going with her .
They are due to leave tomorrow at 0730 .
A little while later , Bashir visits Melora 's quarters and asks her how she is finding the low gravity environment they have created for her .
She describes the experience as " like slipping into a hot tub at the end of the day . "
Bashir jokes that he is a shower man himself before examining a photo on the desk , showing her and another man .
He asks if it's her husband or boyfriend but she does n't answer him .
Instead , she apologizes for her choice of words in the commander 's office .
She says she did n't mean to attack Bashir directly .
He knows that she did n't mean any personal offense by it but nonetheless points out that she does a lot of " attacking " , an attribute that she demonstrates when scorning Bashir 's offer of friendship by telling her to call him Julian instead of Doctor .
He makes her realize how others perceive her , how she is always on the defensive , and then surprisingly , asks her out to dinner at the new Klingon restaurant on the Promenade .
She accepts , much to his delight .
Act Two
In his bar , Quark is hard at work trying to appease his latest " customer " with a delicious home - cooked meal , starting with Vak clover soup .
Quark's " former associate " picks up the dish and pours the soup onto the floor and drops the dish , right in front of Quark .
Still thinking he can change his mind , Quark offers up some Jumbo Vulcan mollusks sautéed in Rhombolian butter .
Kot takes a bite as Quark explains the game of dabo and how his two " excellent tutors " ( dabo girls ) can show him how to play .
In an attempt to change his mind , Quark makes it clear that he wants
Kot 's stay on the station to be as pleasurable as possible and , to that end , proposes a toast to " old friends " .
" To old debts , " replies Kot .
At the Klingon restaurant , Bashir orders some racht , a double order of gladst without the sauce and a side order of zilm ' kach .
He hands a plate to Melora but she is immediately offended by it .
Bashir , thinking her reaction is due to how the food looks , reassures her it tastes good , but that 's not what she means .
Speaking in fluent Klingon , she barks at the chef to provide racht where she can see the blood running through the veins .
The Klingon laughs , noting , " I like a customer who knows what she wants , " and snatches the plate from Bashir , flinging it and the food behind him .
After a few seconds spent behind his kiosk , he returns with some live racht , as ordered .
" There 's nothing worse than half - dead racht , " Melora jokes .
As Bashir finishes off the last of the racht , he recounts a story to Melora .
He tells her of how , when he was ten , he and his father were trapped on Invernia II during an ionic storm , and while they were waiting it out , he found a sick Invernian girl .
When the storm passed , his father went to get help but it was too late and the girl died in front of his eyes .
It was only later he found out that a simple herb , which grew all around them , could have saved her life .
Melora asks if that was the reason he decided to study medicine , but Bashir jokes he first decided to study tennis though he later found out he was better at medicine .
She laughs at him and there is a moment of silence as they gaze into each other 's eyes .
Melora suddenly breaks the silence and decides it 's time to go .
She has an early mission in the morning and wants to get some rest .
The next day , Dax is walking down the corridor on her way to meet with Melora .
She presses her door chime but there is no response .
She enters her quarters but she is n't there either and is n't replying to her communication attempts .
The computer tells Dax that Melora is on docking level 22 , section 14 .
When she arrives , she finds Melora on the floor ; her supports have malfunctioned .
She explains how she had come to the storage bay as she wanted to get an extra astrometric array for her upcoming mission , but was n't paying attention and fell .
In the infirmary , Bashir is tending to Melora 's minor injuries .
He tells her they are n't serious , though she 'll have to postpone her mission to the Gamma Quadrant until tomorrow .
She is upset with herself , saying that , if she had just paid attention , she would have been fine .
Bashir explains to her that , in space , no one is completely independent ; they all must depend on each other to some degree .
When she is fit to leave , Bashir escorts Melora to her quarters .
As they are walking down the corridor , he comments on some work Nathaniel Teros did thirty years ago , regarding low - gravity species .
Melora recognizes his work , but discounts it as not having any practical success though Bashir thinks the principle was sound and , with modern advances , she may be able to walk in " normal " gravity in the future .
As they arrive at her quarters , Melora asks him if he would like to come in .
Initially hesitant , Bashir declines to allow her some time in low - gravity , but Melora invites him in anyway .
Disengaging the gravity , she flies out of her chair , doing a backwards somersault in the air while Bashir looks on in amazement .
She asks him to join her and the two float into the air together where he thanks her for allowing him to experience it with her .
As they hang in mid-air , Melora tells Bashir that the man in the photo is her brother , before they lean in and kiss each other .
Act Three
The USS Orinoco arrives in the Gamma Quadrant with Dax and Melora onboard .
As they lay in their course , Melora asks the computer if there are any Vulcan etudes on file then asks it to play something by Delvok .
Dax confesses she does n't see Delvok as a Vulcan , as there 's too much emotion in his music , but Melora likes it .
" It 's pretty , " she says .
Turning to Dax , she asks if there is room for romance in Starfleet .
Dax believes she has fallen for Doctor Bashir 's " charming bedside manner " .
Melora laughs but , on a serious note , thinks their two species are completely different .
Dax tells her , however , that she once knew a hydrogen - breathing Lothra who fell hopelessly in love with an Oxygene who were together for fifty - seven years , despite the fact they could only spend forty minutes a day in the same room as each other .
Melora tells
Dax of two Academy friends who got engaged , even though they were being assigned to different ships .
They agree that " love across light years " through subspace is hard but , as Dax puts it , " Look at the alternative . "
Back on the station , Quark has gone to see Odo about Kot , but he is surprised to hear the security chief is already aware of him .
Odo explains how Kot has recently been released from a labor camp after the attempted hijacking of a shipment of Romulan ale , and Quark 's name appears right next to his on the indictment .
Quark maintains he had nothing to do with the hijacking itself and was only the " middle - man " , though Odo believes he sold out Kot to avoid himself going to the labor camp .
Quark tells Odo of Kot 's plan to kill him , to which Odo can only smile at the prospect .
He begs Odo to do something about it .
" I 'll do my job , Quark , " he tells the Ferengi , who nods and leaves the security office .
" … Unfortunately , " mutters Odo .
In the infirmary , Bashir is working away when Melora enters .
He explains to her that he has been going over Nathaniel Teros ' neuromuscular adaptation theory and that he believes he can make it work for her .
Melora is extremely excited with the prospect , so much so that she begins to laugh in elation .
If it works , she may be able to walk without her servo controls and without the chair .
Act Four
A security deputy has brought
Kot to the security office , where Odo is waiting for him .
Kot asks if he has done something wrong .
Odo replies that they both have something in common ; they do n't like Quark .
However , he is n't prepared to let Kot kill him .
He insists that he is not planning to kill Quark and their history is just that – history .
Odo says , " You can tell a man 's intentions by the way he walks , " and , according to Odo , Kot walks like someone who 's carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders .
" It must be the memory of those Romulan bricks I carried for eight years , " he replies .
Odo knows he is up to something but he has no reason to keep him and so allows
Kot to leave , keeping a close eye on him as he does so .
On the Promenade , Quark approaches Odo and asks what his opinion is of Kot .
Odo admits he believes he is a man with nothing to lose and gives Quark a comm badge so he can stay in contact with him at all times .
He jokingly tells Quark that , if Kot does kill him , he would like to purchase a piece of his body , as per Ferengi tradition .
Back in the infirmary , Melora is laid down on a biobed while Bashir runs some tests on her .
She describes a warm sensation down her back , the result of the neuromuscular therapy .
The Doctor decides that she has had enough of the treatment for today .
He asks her how she feels and if she can use any of her muscles in the " normal " gravity .
At first , there is nothing , but as Bashir checks over his calculations , Melora begins to move her toes and then one of her legs .
He ascertains her neural pathways are beginning to adapt and she may be able to begin walking within the hour .
In Ops , Sisko asks O'Brien for an update on an upgrade he 's installing on the station .
He reports he has been able to get it up to 70 % of a standard EPS but is then interrupted mid-sentence by the sight of Melora standing by herself on the turbolift , standing beside Bashir .
She approaches the commander with her first day 's mission report .
Sisko is noticeably happy for her but , as O'Brien jokes about Bashir getting his name in the medical journals , Melora begins to look unsettled and stumbles into Bashir .
The doctor adjusts her servo controls to compensate as it is just the first day 's treatment wearing off .
Helping her back to the turbolift , the two of them head to the habitat ring .
In her quarters , Bashir explains that , with each progressive treatment , her muscles will get stronger , but unfortunately she wo n't be able to use the room 's low gravity field or she could risk confusing her body 's motor cortex .
She begins to thank Bashir for all he 's done , but he stops her .
She let him fly for the first time , so he is repaying that by allowing her to walk .
After giving her a kiss , he leaves , saying he 'll see her in the morning .
Meanwhile , Quark has also gone to his own quarters .
He enters with a drink in his hand and tells the computer to put on the lights , though nothing happens .
At first , he thinks nothing of it , but soon realizes Kot may be in the room .
Carefully placing his glass on a table , he makes his way back to the door .
He tries to call Odo with the combadge he gave him but Kot grabs him by the neck .
Quark pleads for his life , offering
Kot one hundred and ninety nine bars of latinum , the profit he would get from the sale of the rings .
" It 's a start , " Kot growls , releasing him .
Act Five
Bashir and Melora are in the infirmary .
Melora complains at how every one of her muscles ached the night before but Bashir says the effect will improve over time , and her next treatment should last for several hours .
She seems happy but she misses experiencing low gravity and asks Bashir if she would be allowed to do it occasionally .
Unfortunately , he is worried that if she did , she would experience a loss of fine motor control , meaning her ability to perform complex tasks would be affected .
He reassures her that if she does change her mind , the effect is reversible for the next few days and all she has to do is say so .
Later on , she and Dax are on the Orinoco , resuming their cartography mission in the Gamma Quadrant .
As she heads for the forward controls , she stumbles slightly , indicating her treatment is starting to wear off again .
As she takes her seat , she explains to Dax how she is in two minds about the treatment .
On the one hand , it would give her more freedom than she ever dreamed , but on the other , she would n't be able to go back to her homeworld for anything more than a short visit .
Dax compares her situation to The Little Mermaid , an old Earth fable by Hans Christian Andersen .
Melora asks if she lived happily ever after but Dax remains silent .
On the station , Quark and Kot are meeting with Ashrock in an airlock .
After the necessary introductions , Ashrock hands his bag of latinum to Kot while Quark hands over the rings .
However , once
Kot has finished checking the payment is there , he pulls out a weapon and shoots Ashrock in the chest .
He quickly forces Quark to grab both the latinum and the rings and makes an escape down the corridor .
In the security office , Odo has been alerted to the weapons fire and orders a security team to that section , but when they arrive , they are fired on by Kot who heads down another corridor , where Dax and Melora are just disembarking from their runabout .
He forces them back inside and orders them to depart the station .
In Ops , Sisko , Kira and O'Brien are tracking the runabout as it leaves the pad .
The commander orders a tractor beam to be locked onto the ship as he opens a channel to Kot .
He instructs him to return to the station immediately but there is no reply .
The tractor beam is engaged and the runabout comes to a halt .
Kot orders
Dax to open a channel to the station and demands that Sisko release them or he will kill a hostage .
Sisko offers to negotiate but Kot stops him , mid-sentence .
He turns to Quark but then changes his mind and shoots Melora .
A charge is sent tearing through her body as the servos overload .
Bashir , who has just arrived in Ops , looks on helplessly as she falls to the deck .
Kot orders him to release the tractor beam before closing the channel .
Sisko then orders Kira to beam himself , O'Brien and Bashir onto the Rio Grande and wait ten seconds before releasing the tractor beam .
Back on the Orinoco , Kot commands Dax to take the runabout through the wormhole and into the Gamma Quadrant , with the Rio Grande in close pursuit .
As Kot instructs Dax to go to warp , Melora quietly regains consciousness in the background .
Kot asks if the phasers are online but Dax refuses to fire on the Rio Grande and , if he kills her , he wo n't be able to fly the ship himself .
As she confronts him , Dax notices Melora crawling towards the transporter pad and buys her enough time to deactivate the gravity on the runabout .
Kot floats into the air while Melora pushes off and slams him into the bulkhead .
On the Rio Grande , O'Brien is monitoring what is happening , reporting that the ship has dropped to impulse and the artificial gravity is offline .
Sisko and Bashir immediately transport over after gravity has been restored to find that the situation has been contained and Kot apprehended .
Back on the station , Bashir and Melora are at the Klingon restaurant , talking .
Bashir seems enthusiastic that her treatments will work but Melora has decided not to go ahead with them .
Though she wants to be independent , she fears that if she continued with the treatments , she would n't be an Elaysian anymore .
She thanks Bashir for getting her to realize she can depend on people .
The Klingon chef then appears and begins to entertain everyone with a Klingon folk song .
The couple sit and hold hands together as the chef weaves in and out of the tables .
" I want to remember all of this , " Melora smiles .

I 'm no longer your doctor . "
" I see !
You 've decided I need a friend . "
" Ooh , was that an attack ?
You see , you do it so well , with such charm that it 's hard to tell . "
" I really do n't mean to … "
" Sure you do . "
" I beg your pardon ! ? "
" Of course you mean to .
All of these broad shots you fire , it 's just your way of keeping the rest of the universe on the defensive .
Has to be .
You 're too good at it . "
" Well , it always seemed to work pretty well .
Until now . "
" Well , that 's the nicest thing you 've said to me .

" You people sell pieces of yourself after you die , do n't you ? "
" Yes . "
" I 'll buy one . "

Background information
Story and script
The final script described Melora as " a cool , professional young woman in her mid- to late - 20s [....]
Although her face is a mask , the extraordinary pressure from gravity is apparent in every move she makes .
" Additionally , of the last scene , where the Klingon chef serenades his customers ; " … it 's Sigmund Romburgesque … the sort of thing Nelson Eddy would have sung to Jeanette McDonald if they were Klingons … " [ 1 ]
" Additionally , of the last scene , where the Klingon chef serenades his customers ; " " Also according to the script , Melora 's conversation with the Klingon chef translates as follows [ 2 ]
" You call this live ? "
" What 's your problem , lady ? "
" This slop you call food is the problem . "
" If you do n't like it , do n't eat it . "
" I want to see the blood running through the veins ! "
" I like a customer who knows what she wants ! "
Production and effects
Set Decorator Laura Richarz purchased the chair , which was revamped by Property Master Joe Longo .
Longo remembers how the production crew decided to keep the wheelchair as simple as possible , recalling that he , " … added a control panel and some wheel covers to block out the spokes in the wheels , and changed the joystick .
Basically we tried to keep it as simple as possible , because of our experience on ' Too Short a Season ' .
We had made a big albatross of a moving chair for that , and it was bad .
But this one worked great ; the actress drove it everywhere .
" ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , p. 93 )
" ( , p. 93 ) Director Winrich Kolbe recounts the difficulties of filming Melora 's wheelchair on set ; " Obviously there are a lot of thresholds on the station that had to be removed .
We put ramps in the set , and it was a pain in the neck , because it 's not easy to maneuver a wheelchair even under prime conditions .
But going up ramps and making left turns and right turns in these corridors , well …[ sighs ] " ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , p. 94 )
Series producer David Livingston recalls the difficulties in doing the low gravity scene ; " We had a lot of discussions about it .
We did a lot less flying than we wanted to because we knew we could n't pull it off on a television schedule .
We used a digital wire - removal process that takes away the wires , and it was very successful , but it 's also expensive and time consuming .
It 's hard enough when people are standing on the ground to shoot them , so when you have them flying around in the air and kissing and hugging , it 's tough .
But [ director Winrich ]
Kolbe is very technically grounded , and the optical effects people were always there with him to make sure it came out .
" ( Captains ' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages , p. 64 )
" ( , p. 64 ) Director Winrich Kolbe further explains the low gravity scene ; " I think it turned out to be rather good , considering the technical difficulties we had .
If I like to shoot at three hundred and sixty degrees , I also like to have everybody fly like real birds .
The problem is that in episodic television you just do n't have enough time to do that .
The state of the art right now is kind of difficult to do because it's a very time consuming affair .
We did it with wires , no mirrors .
The unfortunate thing is that I only had two rods to support the wires , so I had to decide , ' Which way do I want her to fly ? '
Basically straight or it would have required a totally different rig .
The rigs that we had were used in Wayne 's World 2 .
It was basically a situation where you could fly one way and then the opposite way , and that was about it .
It was difficult to figure out what we could do so that it did n't just look like somebody going up and down .
The image of Peter Pan going across the stage with one leg cocked and the other leg straight always went through my mind , and I said , ' Oh , God , we ca n't do that . '
We had the stunt coordinator there , and the actress , Daphne Ashbrook , did quite well .
She was terrific .
She was a good sport and did n't chicken out .
One of the most enthusiastic actresses I 've ever seen and a damn good actress in addition to that .
" ( Captains ' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages , p. 64 )
Wayne 's World 2 " ( , p. 64 ) Practical Special Effects Supervisor Gary Monak and Stunt Coordinator Dennis Madalone created their own mechanical rig for the scene .
Monak believed it was " physically easier to get the action the director wanted " than by using one of the many available electrical flying rigs .
He further commented that , in the past , flying rigs had required a wire that was " just fine enough for the camera not to see , but strong enough to hold an actor . "
However , with the technology available to remove wires in post - production , this simplified things for them .
The rig ended up remaining in place until the beginning of Season 5 , just in case the writers decided to bring back Melora .
It had to be taken down when the USS Defiant engineering set was deemed to be taking up too much space in the swing - set area and so took the place of the rig .
( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , pp. 94-95 )
engineering set was deemed to be taking up too much space in the swing - set area and so took the place of the rig .
( , pp. 94-95 )
The job of removing the wires fell to Glenn Neufeld and David Takemura at Video Image .
Takemura recalls the problems involved ; " We had to paint out the wires , frame by frame .
It wound up being fairly complex , because sometimes the wires got pretty close to the actor 's faces .
" ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , p. 95 )
" ( , p. 95 ) Actor Siddig El Fadil ( Doctor Bashir ) labeled the low - gravity scene " great fun , " although the harness he had to wear was " like a steel bathing suit . "
He further commented , " It has to be incredibly tight because when you 're upside down , you tend to slip out .
So they actually put their foot up on your spine and pull the strings tight , literally like an old - fashioned corset . "
Of the kissing scene , he said , " It was hard to be romantic , kissing somebody longingly , like in some old movie , while you 're spinning slightly and you do n't know where you 're going and you bump into each other 's head . "
( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , p. 94 )
For the photo of Melora with her brother , Dan Curry took a photo of the two actors and then one of Santa Susanna mountains at the west end of the San Fernando Valley , and composited the two shots using a Photoshop program .
After all the effort he put in , the photo was only visible on screen for two or three seconds , though Curry did n't mind , commenting , " Some of our shots may easily represent thousands of man-hours .
But the audience recognizes the attention to detail .
We always feel like ' good enough ' does n't cut it . " ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Companion , p. 95 )
" ( , p. 95 ) Because she was to be involved in a romantic relationship that had to be believable for Bashir , the producers wanted Melora to have a strange - looking forehead but wanted no extensive makeup below her eyes .
Therefore , the makeup department designed an enhanced forehead device that ran from the ridge of her nose and stopped there .
They also used a blond wig with a receded hairline to allow for the forehead appliance .
( Star Trek : Aliens & Artifacts , p. 152 )
, p. 152 ) The makeup department created Kot 's mouth ridge using durable rubber that looked and moved like a piece of flesh .
It is considered by them to be one of the more unique designs seen in Deep Space Nine .

As disenchanted as we liberals can get over the Obama presidency and their apparent obliviousness to progressive priorities , we should all breathe a huge collective sigh of relief that we are not facing a future with President John McCain and Vice President Palin ( if she managed to ride out this far into her term ) .
Nevermind how much more poorly their response would necessarily be to be BP spill ... can you imagine a third front ( or actually , fourth , if you count the undeclared one in Pakistan ) in the War on Terror™ in Iran ?
Well , that 's what we would have with President McCain .
This week , he continued his ongoing campaign to attack Iran in the pursuit of a regime change with a speech at the National Endowment for Democracy :
My friends : I believe that when we consider the many threats and crimes of Iran ’s government , we are led to one inescapable conclusion :
It is the character of this Iranian regime – not just its behavior – that is the deeper threat to peace and freedom in our world , and in Iran .
Furthermore , I believe that it will only be a change in the Iranian regime itself – a peaceful change , chosen by and led by the people of Iran – that could finally produce the changes we seek in Iran ’s policies .
The only problem , as Fareed Zakaria points out , is that McCain does n't understand the reality of Iran , just the neocon lies about the country .
And his undermining of Obama 's diplomatic efforts with such bellicose rhetoric is the exact opposite of helpful .
I imagine Senator McCain , like many others , sees the situation in Iran as analogous to Eastern Europe in 1989 .
Back then , we saw bad regimes crumble with what often looked like very little effort .
But I do n't think the analogy holds .
Those dissenters 20 years ago had three things on their side in Eastern Europe -- nationalism , because communism was imposed by the Soviet Union ; democracy ; and religion , because communism forbade religion .
I would argue that the Green Revolution only has one of those three clearly on its side - democracy .
The regime can use religion and nationalism just as easily as the protesters can .
McCain simply does not seem to understand the regime he wants to overthrow . [..]
Look , the Iranian regime is very repressive at home and up to no good abroad .
I do not like this regime at all .
The U.S. State Department has called Iran the world 's most active state sponsor of terrorism , and that is an accurate description of the regime 's activities in the region .
But I think much of Senator McCain 's rhetoric plays into what is a kind of recurring American fantasy , that all good things always go together and all bad things go together , that men like Ahmadinejad are evil , also have no legitimacy , are also unpopular , and preside over a fragile regime about to collapse .
By the way , if we do want to try and help the Green Movement and we want to try and undermine this government , the most important policy choice we could make would be to not listen to Senator McCain 's many suggestions that we should bomb the country .
Full transcripts below the fold
ZAKARIA : And now for our " What in the World " segment , what got my attention this week was a speech and an article by Senator John McCain .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAKARIA ( voice - over ) :
In case you were wondering how a McCain foreign policy would be different from President Obama 's , here it is .
John McCain would have helped overthrow the government of Iran last year .
MCCAIN : If the president were to unleash America 's full moral power to support the Iranian people , if he were to make their quest for democracy the civil rights struggle of our time , it could bolster their will to endure in their struggle , and the result could be historic .
ZAKARIA : This has become a mantra among neoconservatives these days .
If only Barack Obama had given a few more speeches that supported the Green Movement , the regime in Tehran would have collapsed .
But this is foreign policy as fantasy .
I see no evidence that the Iranian regime could have been toppled a year ago , nor have I seen any to suggest it can be toppled today or anytime soon .
The regime has many opponents , but also many , many supporters in the country .
President Ahmadinejad had the support of millions of people before the election .
A 2009 telephone poll of Iranians by two American think tanks found Ahmadinejad leading Mousavi by more than 2 to 1 .
Now , any polling in Iran is suspect , but these results are confirmed by many shrewd observers of Iran .
Once you get out of the cities , into rural areas , among the poor , the devout , Ahmadinejad continues to have a following , and he plays to the religious and nationalistic feelings of many Iranians .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Khomeini , is also widely respected .
Maziar Bahari , the " Newsweek " reporter who was jailed by the Iranian government for four months on trumped - up charges , says that Khomeini is certainly the most popular political figure in Iran .
I imagine Senator McCain , like many others , sees the situation in Iran as analogous to Eastern Europe in 1989 .

ZAKARIA : Back then , we saw bad regimes crumble with what often looked like very little effort .

The regime can use religion and nationalism just as easily as the protesters can .
McCain simply does not seem to understand the regime he wants to overthrow .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
MCCAIN : Is it any wonder that this is the same regime that spends its people 's precious resources not on roads or schools or hospitals or jobs that benefit all Iranians but on funding violent groups of foreign extremists who murder the innocent ?
ZAKARIA ( voice - over ) :
In fact , the Iranian government spends vast amounts of money on subsidies for the poor and lower middle classes , their base of support .
Iran has high literacy , decent health care , and many social programs .
The economy is a mess , but its defense budget is not staggering .
It 's about $ 8 billion .
America's , by the way , is about $ 660 billion .
Look , the Iranian regime is very repressive at home and up to no good abroad .
I do not like this regime at all .
The U.S. State Department has called Iran the world 's most active state sponsor of terrorism , and that is an accurate description of the regime 's activities in the region .

( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : That old Beach Boys song , " Bomb Iran " , you know , bomb , bomb , bomb - anyway -
( END VIDEO CLIP )
ZAKARIA : Now , John McCain was joking when he said that , but he has on many occasions seriously suggested that bombing Iran might be the only way to stop its nuclear program .
Now , if you want to find a sure way to have the country rally around the - the regime , if you want to destroy the Green Movement , if you want to give Ahmadinejad lots of international sympathy and support , what we should do is bomb Iran .

That is one really long wall .
The UC San Diego student reportedly responsible for hanging a noose last week in a campus library issued a public , but anonymous , apology Monday and said she had no racist motivation .
The noose ’s discovery set off protests at a school that is already tense from recent racially charged episodes and triggered condemnations from UC leaders and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
In a letter published Monday on the front page of the UC San Diego student newspaper , the Guardian , the student wrote that the incident was “ a mindless act and stupid mistake ” and was not meant to recall the lynching of blacks .
“ As a minority student who sympathizes with the students that have been affected by the recent issues on campus , I am distraught to know that I have unintentionally added to their pain , ” the student wrote .
She was suspended Friday and remains under investigation for a possible hate crime .
Advertisement
The letter is signed “ Anonymous UCSD Student ” and offers no clues about her identity or ethnicity .
Sari Thayer , the Guardian ’s Web editor , said in an interview that the woman had asked the paper to publish the letter and that “ a reliable source ” confirmed its authenticity .
The woman wrote that she and friends had been playing with the rope early last week , making a lasso and then a noose .
She said that she took it to the library Tuesday , strung it above a desk and forgot about it .
Its discovery Thursday night caused a firestorm on campus , where tensions were high after a Feb. 15 off - campus party that mocked Black History Month .

A campus official declined to comment on the letter and said that university police continue to investigate the incident .

We 've seen our fair share of Samsung Galaxy S phones in the past few weeks , but the Sprint Epic 4G version ( or the Galaxy S Pro , as we 'd previously suspected it would be known ) looks like it could take the cake .
The phone has all the same specs as the others family members -- including a 1GHz Samsung Hummingbird processor , 5 megapixel cam , a 4 - inch Super AMOLED screen , and Android 2.1 -- but it also boasts a front facing camera and a physical keyboard .
So , is the new slider as epically amazing as we 've been imagining ?
We got to spend some time with a unit this afternoon , so hit the break for some early impressions and a quick video .
301 Redirects Made Easy In Java
Published Tue , 8 Jun 2010 • 4 comments
I 've just released a new version of visural - common - 0.3.2 .
This version includes a new Servlet Filter , which makes 301 - redirects in Java a breeze .
You 'd recall that 301 redirects are useful for SEO ( and just general good practice ) for when you move content to another place , or to create a " canonical " version of a piece of content .
Matt Cutt's has done a few posts about 301 vs. 302 redirects and when you should use each , but this post pretty much summarizes the use - case for this filter .
Using the filter is easy , just create a class that extends from PermanentRedirectFilter :
public class MyRedirect extends PermanentRedirectFilter { public void configureRoutes ( ) { // ... your config goes in here ... // e.g. fromHost ( " mydomain.com " ) .to( " www.mydomain.com " ) ; // urls work too fromURL ( " http://www.mydomain.com/index.jsp " ) .to ( " http://www.mydomain.com/ " ) ; fromURL ( " http://www.mydomain.com/blog/post.jsp?p=123 " ) .to ( " http://www.mydomain.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-do-301-redirects-in-java " ) ; // you could also use this to move your domain to another place altogether .
//
The same page url and parameters will be used after the host .
fromHost ( " www.myolddomain.com " ) .to ( " www.other.com " ) ; } }
Pretty easy and efficient syntax .
You 'll then want to add this to your web.xml in the usual way for configuring a filter , e.g. :
< filter > < filter-name>MyRedirectFilter</filter-name > < filter-class>com.mycom.MyRedirectFilter</filter-class > </ filter > < filter - mapping > < filter-name>MyRedirectFilter</filter-name > < url - pattern>/*</url-pattern> </ filter-mapping >
Done and done - that 's all there is to it .

In his column in the NY Times today , Frank Rich makes note about David Blankenhorn , a so - called marriage expert , called to the stand by Prop 8 supporters in the federal case in California .
Blankenhorn is president of the Institute for American Values , a wingnut organization " devoted to contributing intellectually to the renewal of marriage . "
Writes Rich :
Blankenhorn holds no degree in such seemingly relevant fields as psychology , psychiatry or sociology .
But his pretrial research did include reading a specious treatise by George Rekers , the antigay evangelist now notorious for his recent 10 - day European trip with a young male companion procured from Rentboy.com .
And Blankenhorn ’s testimony relies on the same sweeping generalization as Rekers — that children raised by two biological parents are so advantaged that all alternatives should be shunned .
What was the unqualified Blankenhorn doing at the Prop 8 trial ?
Like Rekers , who had a lucrative history of testifying for pay in legal cases attacking gay civil rights , he also profits from his propaganda .
Public documents , including tax returns , reveal that Blankenhorn ’s institute , financed by such right - wing stalwarts as the Bradley and Scaife foundations , paid him $ 247,500 in base salary in 2008 , the most recent year for which data is available , and another $ 70,000 to his wife .
Not a bad payday for a self - professed arbiter of American marital values who under oath described his sole peer - reviewed academic paper ( from the University of Warwick ) as “ a study of two cabinetmakers ’ unions in 19th - century Britain . ”
That the Prop 8 proponents employed him as their star witness suggests that no actual experts could be found ( or rented ) to match his disparagement of gay parents .
Dmitriy T.M. and Andrew L. sent a link to a collection of post - World War I men ’s magazine covers .
They are a window into a time when being a man was clearly a very distinct achievement , but much less related to consumption than it is today .
Today ’s men ’s magazines emphasize control over oneself and the conquest of women , as do these vintage magazines , but instead of tests of strength , cunning , and fighting ability , they emphasize conquest through consumption .
The message is to consume the right exercise , the right products ( usually hygiene or tech - related ) , the right advice on picking up women and , well , the right women .
In contrast , these old magazines pit man against nature or other men ; consumption has not yet colonized the idea of masculinity .

From the Oval Office the other night , President Obama called the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico “ the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . ”
Senior people in the government have echoed that language .
The motive seems clear .
The words signal sympathy for the people of the Gulf Coast , an acknowledgment of the magnitude of their struggle .
And if this is really the worst environmental disaster , the wording seems to suggest , maybe people need to cut the government some slack for failing to get it under control right away .
But is the description accurate ?
Scholars of environmental history , while expressing sympathy for the people of the gulf , say the assertion is debatable .
They offer an intimidating list of disasters to consider : floods caused by human negligence , the destruction of forests across the entire continent and the near - extermination of the American bison .
“ The White House is ignoring all the shades and complexities here to make a dramatic point , ” said Donald E. Worster , an environmental historian at the University of Kansas and a visiting scholar at Yale .
A commercial promoting pork says :
“ PUT SOME PORK ON YOUR FORK ” The MAYOR REFUSES TO REMOVE PORK FROM SCHOOL CAFETERIA MENU AND EXPLAINS WHY :
Muslim parents demanded the abolition of pork in all the school canteens of a Montreal suburb .
The mayor of the Montreal suburb of Dorval has refused , and the town clerk sent a note to all parents to explain why .
“ Muslims must understand that they have to adapt to Canada and Quebec , its customs , its traditions , and its way of life , because that ’s where they chose to immigrate .
“ Muslims must understand that they have to integrate and learn to live in Quebec .
“ They must understand that it is for them to change their lifestyle , not the Canadians who , so generously , welcomed them .
“ Muslims must understand that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic .
Canada accepted many immigrants before Muslims showed up ( whereas the reverse is not true , in that Muslim states do not accept non-Muslim immigrants ) . ”
“ Just like other nations , Canadians are not willing to give up their identity or their culture .
“ And , if Canada is a land of welcome , it ’s not the Mayor of Dorval who welcomes foreigners , but the Canadian - Quebecois people as a whole .
“ Finally , they must understand that in Canada ( Quebec ) with its Judeo - Christian roots , Christmas trees , churches and religious festivals , religion must remain in the private domain . ”
The municipality of Dorval was right to refuse any concessions to Islam and Sharia .
“ For Muslims who disagree with secularism and do not feel comfortable in Canada , there are 57 beautiful Muslim countries in the world , most of them under - populated and ready to receive them with open halal arms in accordance with Sharia .
“ If you left your country for Canada , and not for other Muslim countries , it is because you have considered that life is better in Canada than
elsewhere .
We will not let you drag Canada down to the level of those 57 countries .
“ Ask yourself this question – just once : “ Why is it better here in Canada than where you came from ? ”
“ A canteen with pork on the menu is part of the answer . ”
If you came to Canada with the idea that you will displace us with your prolific propagation and eventually take over the country , you should pack up and go back to the country you came from .
We have no room here for you and your ideology .

Hugo has an older brother , Simon , and a younger sister , Anna , who both also live and work in Australia .
During his early childhood , the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria , Great Britain , and Australia .
This was due to the cross-country demands of his father 's job in the computer industry .
Later , during his teens ,
Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth 's Hospital School in Bristol .
There , he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history , achieving an A in his O - level examination .
He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School , Sydney .
He graduated from NIDA ( National Institute of Dramatic Art ) , a college well - known for other alumni such as Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush , in 1981 .

He garnered the Best Acting prize for Das Interview ( 1998 ) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and , that same year , won the Australian Star of the Year .
More recently , roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile .
His famous and irreplaceable role in The Matrix movies have made him one of the greatest sci-fi villains of the Twenty - first Century .
With each new film , television , or theatrical role , Hugo continues to surpass his audience 's expectations and remains one of the most versatile performers working today .
He resides in Australia and has two children with partner Katrina Greenwood .
Though Hugo and Katrina have never married , they 've been a committed couple for over 25 years ; while Hugo was quoted as saying marriage " petrified " him in the 1990s , by middle of the following decade he said he no longer felt that way , and that he and Katrina have toyed with the idea of marrying " when we 're really old " .

Personal Quotes ( 7 )
[ on filming Matrix Reloaded ( 2003 ) ]
I was on top of Keanu Reeves , he was on his back and I was on my trunk , and I was breathing down his neck for hours and hours .
It was ... very erotic .
I do love working in Australia .
Generally , the budgets are smaller , the crews are smaller and generally you work at a fast pace .
That gives you energy .
At the end of the day , you 've worked a lot but you do n't feel tired .
On the big ones , you sit around a lot .
That really saps your energy .
I think I said something like Das Interview ( 1998 ) was the most fulfilling experience from an acting point of view .
And it definitely was .
That was a combination of working with a director who was very open and very prepared , and ... working with [ co - star ]
Tony Martin - just sitting opposite him every day , which is pretty much what we did because the film is essentially a dialog between two men .
You 're certainly pushed into selling yourself as a commodity in order to sell the product .
I will engage in the selling of the film .
But I will try not to engage in the selling of the image , because I find that it 's easier to go on and make another film , because the next character is actually obstructed if your image is bigger than it .
So the longer you keep the mask on , metaphorically and physically , the better .
I 'm ' of the world ' .
There was a time when I thought , " Oh , I must go back to England .
I feel English . "
Then I went and the longer I was away , the more Australian I felt .
Now , I 've come back here and I do n't feel entirely Australian .
But I certainly feel like this is my country .
This is where I live and this is where I want to work .
One of the first things that made me want to be an actor was listening to Prokofiev 's " Romeo and Juliet " .
I was intensely moved by it .
I think I was about nine - I went to see the ballet .
That 's what made me interested in Shakespeare .
Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Attacks across Afghanistan on Monday killed 10 allied troops , including seven Americans , in the deadliest day for coalition forces this year , officials said .

They were the first Australian service personnel killed in Afghanistan in nearly a year .
The exact locations of the remaining fatalities were not immediately released , though NATO 's International Security Assistance Force confirmed that seven of them were Americans .
The nationality of one of the troops also was not known .
In addition , the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said an American citizen and another person died in an attack on a police training center in Kandahar .
" Our sympathies go out to those who lost loved ones in this callous attack .
The United States will continue to stand with our Afghan partners to fight terrorism and help the Afghan government provide security , safety and prosperity to its people , " the embassy said in a statement .
The Afghan Interior Ministry said the three suicide attackers who assaulted the center were killed .
One driving a Toyota Corolla struck the police training center tower and two suicide attackers who attempted to enter the center detonated themselves at the facility 's gate .
In eastern Afghanistan , an improvised explosive device killed five NATO troops , according to ISAF .
In a separate operation , a service member was killed by small arms fire in eastern Afghanistan , and another was killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan .

Sheriff Joe Arpaio has sent letters to current and former attorneys in the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office warning them to watch their words if they speak to investigators looking into possible unethical conduct by former County Attorney Andrew Thomas .
The letter threatens the attorneys with criminal charges if they reveal " confidential " information about the sheriff 's inquiries into county Supervisors Don Stapley and Mary Rose Wilcox and Superior Court Judge Gary Donahoe .
Interim County Attorney Rick Romley responded with a letter of his own warning Arpaio that he was overstepping the authority of his office .
In late March , Arizona Chief Justice Rebecca White Berch appointed a Colorado attorney to conduct the investigation .
John Gleason , who handles such inquests for the Colorado Supreme Court , has been in Phoenix in recent weeks to work on the case .
Gleason could not comment because of his own ethical obligations .
On May 3 , Arpaio mailed letters to current and former county attorney staffers , saying , " This letter is intended to advise you that I do not consent to you revealing any information provided to you by my office , regardless of any personal incentive to breach the attorney - client privilege . "
At the end of the letter , he wrote , " Be advised that should you disclose any information that could harm any pending criminal investigations , I will consider charging you with violations of applicable statutes . "
Phil MacDonnell , Thomas ' former chief deputy , received one of the letters .
" It gave me pause , " MacDonnell said .
However , Romley fired off a letter to Arpaio citing case law and informing him that the relationship between the two offices is not attorney and client but law enforcement and prosecutor .
Citing case law , Romley said that the County Attorney 's Office " does not render legal services to the investigators . "
As for the threat to file criminal charges against anyone who testifies to the Bar , Romley wrote , " This threat is not only inappropriate but is a clear abuse of your authority as sheriff of Maricopa County .
Thereby , I shall be forwarding your letter " to the U.S. District Attorney 's Office .

My own inspiration for trying out a garden this spring , or at least some random assemblage of plants , is simple : I just bought a house , I love food , and I want to keep up with the Joneses .
Growing and gardening can take place anywhere , though , and for many reasons .
You could launch a small project from an urban apartment window , or scatter seeds across a field with the hopes of eating cheaper and fresher .
Trent at the Get Rich Slowly blog tracked his costs , time , and other data from he and his wife 's year - long gardening project , and found the intake very much worth the output .
Read on for some starter ideas that apply to any level of expertise .

If you 're just starting out growing anything in or around your home , you probably have questions about what can grow , under what conditions , and for how long .
You know who has the answer ?
Plenty of people .
Cooperative extensions across the country offer free pamphlets , guides , walk - in advice , and they can easily be found at this nationwide map , or with just a " [ Name of your area ] cooperative extension " Google search .
A D.C. - based fact checker for the Atlantic and her NPR reporter husband , both of whom had killed windowsill herbs before , found a wealth of information from their local Virginia Cooperative Extension when they started working in a community garden — which is , in itself , another good training tool to look and Google for .
In my own neck of the woods , I was amazed to find that I could bring two scoops of dirt in Tupperware to the local Cornell Cooperative Extension , where I 'd learn just what kind of strengths and problems my patio held before I 'd even considered buying Plant One.

WindowFarms.org is an initiative that wants to help anyone with a window that gets a decent amount of sun grow food in it .
The group has 4,000 registered users , and has a host of how - to manuals for both small starter setups and full - window farms .
The gist is that you create a cycling water system using larger bottled water bottles , clay pellets , a big roll of plastic tubing , and some cheap fish tank pumps to spare you the trouble of ever having to remember to water your plants , or worry that you 've watered them too much , deal with spill - overs , and the like .
You wo n't be able to stop shopping at the grocery store , but you can achieve memorable results — as with this first window farm salad .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A murder in the neighborhood can significantly knock down a child ’s score on an IQ test , even if the child did not directly witness the killing or know the victim , U.S. researchers reported on Monday .
The findings have implications both for crime control efforts and for the heavy reliance on standardized tests , said New York University sociology professor Patrick Sharkey , who conducted the study .
They can also explain about half the achievement gap between blacks and whites on such tests , he reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ It means being more aware of the potential for violence to have a reach that extends beyond just those victimized and those who witness a violent event , to reach across a community and affect all children in a community , ” Sharkey said in a telephone interview .
Sharkey compared data on crimes broken down to within a few blocks in a neighborhood with school test scores .
He collected details of more than 6,000 murders in the Chicago area and the results of two surveys of children and families in Chicago neighborhoods .
The surveys included scores from tests that are used to determine a child ’s IQ .
If a murder occurred in a child ’s neighborhood -- an area of roughly six to 10 square blocks as denoted by the U.S. Census -- the children ’s test scores fell by an average of half a standard deviation , Sharkey reported .
On an IQ test using 100 as the average or norm , one standard deviation is 15 points .
So if a child took the test within a week of a local murder , his or her score was 7 - 8 points lower on average than the score of a similar child in a similar neighborhood where there was no murder .
This fits in with what is known about the effects of post traumatic stress , Sharkey said .
“ The results suggest that children may carry the burden of violence with them as they take part in daily life within the neighborhood or school settings , ” he said .
PASSING EFFECT
The effects wear off after a week to nine days , Sharkey found .
But in areas with a lot of crime , this does not provide much relief .
“ When one takes into account the prevalence of homicide in the most violent neighborhoods in cities like Chicago , these results mean that some children spend about one week out of every month functioning at a low level as they navigate the home or school environment , ” he said in a statement .
In general , black U.S. children score about one standard deviation lower on standardized tests than white children .
This finding accounts for half that difference , Sharkey said .
He was unable to find enough murders in predominately white neighborhoods to see if white children were affected .
Curiously , there were enough murders in Hispanic neighborhoods but Latino children seemed unaffected .
“ I just did n’t find the same effect , ” Sharkey said .
It could be the Hispanic children did not identify with the violence , Sharkey added .
“ Most of the victims , even in the Hispanic neighborhoods , were black . ”
It is well documented that blacks are far more likely to be murdered than members of any other U.S. ethnic group -- murder is the most common cause of death for young black men .
Sharkey said the findings also have implications for IQ tests , which are supposed to be neutral assessments of ability .
“ These tests are not purely capturing some underlying intelligence , ” he said .
Wireless companies say they ’ve been told their signals may be jammed during the G8 and G20 summits , but are n’t being given any more information about how thousands of cellphone users could be affected .
While the G8 summit is in Ontario cottage country , the G20 is in the heart of downtown Toronto , and widespread shutdown of cellphone networks could wreak havoc on businesses already preparing to take a hit from security precautions in place for the meetings .
But the technology is expected to be used only to create a moving bubble of electronic silence around motorcades .
“ No one will be informed of locations and times for security reasons , ” said one wireless industry source .
The Integrated Security Unit responsible for the summits would n’t comment on security plans .
“ We use a lot of different techniques in ensuring security to deal with possible threats and we never share those techniques , we do n’t make them public , ” said Sgt. Leo Monbourquette , a spokesman for the ISU .
In order to jam the signals , the RCMP must apply for an exemption from the Radiocommunications
Act , which generally forbids interfering with the airwaves .
It ’s unknown whether they ’ve applied for one for the summits , as approvals are only published after the fact .
But the first RCMP exemption was for the 2002 G8 Summit in Kananaskis , Alta .
Often , the wireless industry itself receives no advance notice at all , said Marc Choma , director of communications for the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association .
But what interference there may be rarely lasts long , he said .
“ The thing with jamming technologies , because a lot of law enforcement themselves , their communications , are wireless as well , you ’d have to try and specify what kind of frequencies that you were trying to jam , ” he said .
“ The jamming is not precise , you ca n’t say I only want it to go one metre and three centimetres , so it could be going farther than you think .
There is possibility it would interfere with other types of communications . ”
With cellphones and remote controls often tools of choice for setting off bombs , jammers have become a regular security tool at major national and international events .
A search of orders - in - council shows the RCMP most recently received an exemption from the act for the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the end of May .
They were also granted an OK for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler , B.C .
A spokesperson for the RCMP - led Integrated Security Unit which oversaw the Games would n’t say whether the technology was actually used for the Olympics .
An exemption is often applied for just in case the power is needed , said Dawn Roberts .

But even if it had been deployed , cellphone users may never have noticed , she said .
“ It may appear as a dropped call , ” she said .

Walking past a high rise building could have the same the effect .
It ’s not as if a big bubble goes out and we have a cone or dome that ’s widespread . ”
Sen .
Tom Udall : ‘ I have spoken to a number of Republicans who are not happy with the rules ’
Sen .
Tom Udall is a member of the Rules Committee whose loud exasperation with the filibuster led , in part , to today 's hearing on the issue .
Udall favors what he calls " the Constitutional option " -- and what others call " the nuclear option " -- to reform the practice :
At the beginning of a new Congress , a simple majority of senators can vote new rules into place .
Udall would like to see them reform the filibuster .
We spoke briefly this afternoon , and an edited transcript follows .
The first witness at this morning 's hearing was former - Vice President Walter Mondale .
He was , as I understand it , one of the senators who contributed to the 1975 reform of the filibuster that brought the number of votes necessary to break a filibuster down from 67 to 60 .
What can be learned from that ?
Vice President Mondale was a key witness , and he made some very good points about the way we need to proceed .
His most important point is that a majority vote at the beginning of a Congress can change the rules .
That is allowed .
He used it when he pursued reform back in the 1970s .
He was a senator then and he teamed up with Sen. James Pearson , a Republican from Kansas , to push for reform of the filibuster rule .
He offered a motion at the beginning of that Congress to change the rules .
That 's the constitutional option .
It 's how they put a cloture rule in in 1917 .
It 's how we made modifications in 1975 .
I had n't known that Mondale had a Republican co-sponsor on his bill .
That 's exactly the spirit that I 'm trying to bring in reform .
I think reform of the rules can bring us back to bipartisanship .
If we all analyze where we are and what 's happening and why the system is broken , we 're stepping out of the day - to - day fights of the Senate and trying to make the institution work better .
I think a lot of people , however , believe that your proposed route will end up in a partisan vote where 55 Democrats vote the filibuster out of existence and 45 Republicans vote to preserve it .
Would you support the effort if that was the outcome ?
I support the idea whether I 'm in the minority or majority .
A majority of senators should be able to adopt rules at the beginning of each Congress .
Hopefully it 'll be bipartisan .
Have any Republicans at all come forward to say they agree with you and they would also like to see the filibuster reformed , if only so that they can govern when they retake the majority ?
I have spoken to a number of Republicans who are not happy with the rules .
Whether they 'll take the next step and vote to change them is the big question .
The Senate as an institution is broken .
We 're not doing the work of the American people and the rules are being abused .
The only way to get us back to the traditions where the Senate is doing the work of the American people is to change the rules .
I dug up an old paper that is relevant to the point Rhys Southan of Let Them Eat Meat brought up in a recent post which I quoted on June 9 :
But I recognize that my consumer choices are almost totally insignificant in this regard ; like veganism , this is a symbolic gesture .
The paper is Expected Utility , Contributory Causation , and Vegetarianism by Gaverick Matheny ( Journal of Applied Philosophy , Vol. 19 , No. 3 , 2002 . p.293-7 . ) .
In it , Matheny argues that act-utilitarians cannot know what the actual consequences of an action will be in many cases , and therefore they must base their actions on the probability of expected consequences .
Matheny goes on to explain that by not eating meat for a year , you take a chance that you will be the person who causes a reduction of meat past a threshold which is felt to the farmers and causes them to raise less animals :
For example , take the case of The 200 Million Consumers .
There are 200 million consumers , each of whom eats 50 farm animals each year .
In this market there are only ten possible annual outputs of animals for farmers : one billion animals , two billion , and so on , up to ten billion .
The difference between each of these annual outputs , one billion , is the smallest unit of demand perceivable to the farmer and is thus the threshold unit .
Since there are 20 million customers per threshold unit , and only one of these customers will actually complete the unit of which his or her purchase is a part , the probability of my completing a unit is one in 20 million .
That means by buying meat I have a one - in - 20 million chance of affecting the production and slaughter of one billion animals .
The expected disutility is then one - 20 - millionth times one billion , which equals 50 – that is , the disutility associated with raising and slaughtering 50 animals per year .
Matheny explains why this matters using the example of The 100 Bandits in which 100 bandits go into a village and each steals one bean from each of 100 villagers , each of whom has 100 beans .
After this is done , the villagers have no beans left .
However , the loss of only one bean cannot cause any perceptible difference to a villager .
Since no bandit could have caused actual ( perceptible ) harm by stealing only one bean , none is responsible for the villagers going hungry , right ?
No .
One of the bandits stole the nth bean that reached the threshold of perceptible harm to a villager , and the probability of any given bandit being the one who steals the nth bean to reach that threshold is the same whether each bandit steals 100 beans from the same villager or 1 bean from 100 different villagers .
In other words , when divided into equal contribution units , any contribution of a unit towards reaching the threshold of a perceptible difference is as morally important as the unit that actually reaches that threshold .
Liverpool are planning a shock move for Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp to replace Rafa Benitez , Sky Sports sources understand .
Spurs boss emerges as shock contender for Anfield hotseat
Reputation
Liverpool are planning a shock move for Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp , sources understand .
The Anfield outfit are searching for a new man at the helm after Rafa Benitez 's six - year reign was brought to an end by mutual consent on Thursday .
And Spurs boss Redknapp has emerged as a leading contender for the Reds hierarchy as they aim to bring stability back to Merseyside .
Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish and managing director Christian Purslow have been charged with the task of identifying and selecting a replacement .
Dalglish knows Redknapp well having brought his son Jamie to Anfield in January 1991 when he was at the helm of the five - time European champions and the two families have been close ever since .
Redknapp 's reputation as a transfer market wheeler - dealer has made him an attractive option for Liverpool , who are heavily in debt and could have only £ 5 million to invest in new players if they do not trim their squad this summer .
The former Bournemouth , West Ham , Southampton and Portsmouth manager has transformed the fortunes of the White Hart Lane club since replacing Juande Ramos in October 2008 .
Redknapp his since guided the club into the top four of the Premier League - ironically at the expense of Liverpool - and they have the prospect of UEFA Champions League football to look forward to next season .
Spurs would be loath to lose the services of Redknapp , who has been granted an impressive transfer budget during his time in North London , and are sure to fight hard to keep the 63 - year - old .
Redknapp has only one year remaining on his current contract at White Hart Lane and talks over a new deal are yet to take place .
A new report on the capacity in the UK for offshore wind , wave and tidal power should be used to put pressure on ministers
Whenever you suggest that renewables could one day supply a large proportion of our electricity , scores of people jump up to denounce it as a pipedream , a fantasy , a dangerous delusion .
They insist that the energy resources do n't exist ; that the technologies are inefficient ; that they can't be accommodated on the grid ; that the variability of supply will cause constant blackouts .
I suspect that no amount of evidence will sway some of these people .
There 's a large contingent which seems to hate renewables come what may .
However often you point them to papers showing how a European supergrid , which could one day stretch from Iceland to North Africa , allows us to balance renewable resources against each other , ensuring constant supplies ; however often you explain the potential of smart appliances , a smart grid and new energy storage technologies , they just clamp their fingers in their ears and shout : " No , no , no ! "
I do n't know how to explain this unreasoning antagonism , but it casts an interesting light on the oft - repeated myth that it is environmentalists who are hostile to new technologies .
But even the defeatists might be swayed by some of the findings of the Offshore Valuation report , just published by the Public Interest Research Centre ( Pirc ) .
It 's the first time anyone has tried to work out how much electricity could be produced by offshore renewables in the UK , and the results are fascinating .
It examines only existing technologies – wind turbines with both fixed and floating foundations , wave machines , tidal range and tidal stream devices – and the contribution they can make by 2050 .
It accepts the usual constraints on offshore renewables : maximum water depths , the need to avoid dense shipping lanes and other obstacles , the various technical limits .
Having applied these constraints , it finds that the practical resource for offshore renewables in the UK is 2,130 terawatt hours per year .
This is six times our current electricity demand .
Were we to use only 29 % of the total resource , the UK would become a net electricity exporter .
We would be generating energy equivalent to 1bn barrels of oil a year , which roughly corresponds to the average amount of North Sea oil and gas the UK has been producing over the past four decades .
The report estimates that this industry would directly employ 145,000 people and produce annual revenues of £ 62bn .
The construction effort would be roughly similar to building the North Sea oil and gas infrastructure : eminently plausible , in other words , if propelled by strong government policy .
Were we to make use of 76 % of the resource , the UK would become a net exporter of total energy .
This is a tougher call , but not necessarily impossible : we'd be producing the equivalent of 150 % of the energy output from UK 's peak production year for oil and gas ( 1999 ) .
It would mean building an average of 1,800 7.5 megawatt wind turbines every year .
This is likely to stretch available manpower and construction capacity to the maximum , possibly beyond .
But if enough investment is sunk into training , manufacturing and transport , the potential for creating both employment and income is enormous .
The national grid , the report estimates , could accommodate about 50 % variable renewables ( power sources whose output depends on the weather ) by 2050 , as long as it had 34 gigawatts of backup capacity , energy storage and interconnectors linking it with the continent .
This is both plausible and affordable .
( Backup , to address another persistent myth , does not mean that the necessary thermal power plants are kept running all the time , just that they are available if needed . )
There are some interesting implications .
The UK could close its looming energy gap without using new sources of fossil fuels .
It could do this without encountering the public hostility which often scuppers onshore windfarms .
The best wind resources are mostly way out of the sight of land : the further out to sea you go , the stronger the wind becomes .
A recent study shows that offshore windfarms can greatly increase the abundance of fish and crabs .
( My hope is that the foundations could be connected by a web of steel cables , so the windfarms could function as marine reserves which never needed to be policed , as trawling through them would be impossible . )
It also raises some important questions .
If the offshore resource is so abundant and its deployment likely to cause hardly any political fuss , should we give up fighting for onshore windfarms ?
I do n't know , but I would appreciate your views .
The report also makes me wonder whether , in the light of the damage they will do and of the far greater resources in the open sea , a Severn barrage and other tidal range devices are worth developing .
The report suggests that the total practical resource for offshore wind is 1,939 terawatt hours per year , while the total tidal range resource is just 36 – and more expensive to deploy .
Given the aggro tidal barrages will cause and the habitats they will destroy , are they worth developing ?
If any of this is to happen , the big decisions will need to be taken in the next year or so .
So if ever you meet ministers or officials , ask them these questions .
Have they read the report ?
What do they intend to do about it ?

The " Future Doctor " thing from ' Flesh and Stone ' DOES happen , and has been confirmed by people who have seen the scripts .
The Pandorica has a rather useful feature , in that it keeps you alive ... forever .
( Which is good , considering what just happened to Amy . )
Amy has a very special brain because she grew up next to the crack for so long .
Auton - Rory is responsible for releasing the Doctor , and Amy gets locked inside the Pandorica while the Doctor goes off to find the right " fuel " to bring her back to life , leaving Rory to guard the box .
Stuff happens and Rory is left waiting a LONG TIME , hence the " love that lasts a thousand years . "
He becomes " The Lone Centurion " and is spotted throughout time guarding the box .
( and as some fans have pointed out , this actually makes him chronologically older than the Doctor now ! )
Rory does n't stay an Auton though , and he supposedly ends up human by the end .
The TARDIS does explode , but it 's not how you think .
There is a wedding at the end , and one person who has seen the episode says that the ending is cheesily reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz .

Finally , there are some pretty strong indications that Omega shows up at the end .
( possibly played by Jason Isaacs , aka Lucius Malfoy from the Harry Potter films )
He may not be a traditional big bad though , and it 's possible that his appearance is just a teaser for bigger events to occur in Series 6 .
The main evidence in favor of the evil Time Lord 's return come from two independent posters on Gallifrey Base ; one who claims to have seen some concept art , and another who says that he was shown a suit of black " armor " with big gauntlets labled as " Omega . "
As for Jason Isaacs taking over the role , he was seen entering a closed door meeting with Steven Moffat , Mark Gatiss , and John Simm a few months back ( after this episode was filmed , though ) .
This led to much speculation that he could be taking over the role of the Master next year ( or possibly just appearing in a future season of ' Sherlock ' , which Moffat and Gatiss also produce ) , but considering that another informant has teased that " a Harry Potter actor has a surprise role in the finale , " some of that speculation has shifted towards him possibly being Omega instead .
​ Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer visited a medical marijuana dispensary in Missoula on Thursday .
No , the Governor was n’t picking up an eighth of Trainwreck ; he said he was there to learn what needs to be done to address “ problems ” with the state ’s medicinal cannabis system .
Toke of the Town has been able to determine , the first Governor in the United States to visit a medical marijuana dispensary .
“ Tell me what it is that you would recommend that we change in Montana ’s medical marijuana law that would improve the business and maybe give it a little bit better air of legitimacy , ” Schweitzer said while at Montana Pain Management , reports Irina Cates of KPAX Schweitzer , a Democrat , is , as far ashas been able to determine , the first Governor in the United States to visit a medical marijuana dispensary .
​ The Governor sat down with Rick Rosio , who manages the dispensary , to discuss the medical marijuana business , which , Schweitzer said , was simply a concept when voters approved it in 2004 .
“ We did n’t put the boundaries in at that time and now the business has gotten out ahead of the regulatory environment , and we need to build some boundaries , ” Schweitzer said .
He added that one solution might be limiting the number of marijuana grow operations and the number of providers .
Such a move , the Governor suggested , could make it more manageable for the state to keep track of the business .
“ We need to inspect these operations to make sure they are growing only what they need to their patients and they supply marijuana only to their patients , ” Schweitzer said .
Having the Governor at his place of business was a good opportunity to show him how a medical marijuana dispensary can work , according to Rosio .
“ The Governor had some wonderful , kind words and was really assuring that he ’s going to take a very practical stance on this and try to fix where the problems are , ” Rosio said .
Alan Grayson storms back to the stage by asking just why is Tim Geithner , who has the biggest conflict of interest when it comes to Fed matters , even be allowed to have an opinion on Fed transparency issues .
In today 's ABC Top Line , Alan noted , “ when Tim Geithner says that he does n't want to see the Fed audited , what he 's really saying is he does n't want to see Tim Geithner audited , ” Grayson said .
“ He was the head of the New York Fed for years and years .
This audit would apply to him .
And the actions he took -- which he can now take in secret and , when this bill passes , will no longer be secret -- we 'll be able to see and understand the decisions that he made that among other things put huge amounts of bailout money into the hands of private interests . ”
Grayson added : “ It 's one of the biggest conflicts of interest I 've ever seen . ”
Keep in mind that this is the same
Fed that when it took over Bear via ML1 said it would have no losses on the collateral it assumed , only to see its Red Roof Inn holdings be foreclosed upon last week as Zero Hedge first discussed .
How the Fed 's opacity is still a topic of discussion simply does not compute .
And that Obama is doing all he can to prevent the Fed transparency initiatives by Paul and Grayson from passing at this point certainly means that should the Fed 's dirty laundry be made public that the administration would certainly collapse in a smoldering heap of 0 % approval .
Some more painful common sense from Grayson :
“ The Fed does n't want to be audited .
Who does ?
Do you want to be audited ?
I do n't want to be audited , but sometimes it 's necessary , ” he said .
“ When you 're handing out a trillion dollars at a time -- a trillion dollars at a time , which works out to $ 3,000 for every man woman and child in this country -- do n't we have a right to know what happened to it ? ”
Grayson added : “ It 's central to the bill .
We 've had secret bailouts from the Fed to private interests now for the past two years without any exposure whatsoever . …
We need to know what happened to our money , because when the Fed hands out our money , every dollar in your pocket , every dollar in your checking account , every dollar in your 401 ( k ) becomes that much cheaper and less in value . ”
In retrospect it is really much simpler : the Fed will only retain its secrecy as long as it can keep pushing the market higher , and as long as it can force the middle class to empty out their money markets and throw their money into bankrupt retailers trading at one million P/E .
Once the market tumbles , it is game over .
The Fed knows it , the president knows it , and Geithner certainly knows it .
Which is why we expect massive resistance by the Fed and all the " liquidty providers " and " market makers " to allowing the Ponzi formerly known as the market , to reach its true fair value ( absent from endless fiscal stimuli and ZIRP insanity ) ... somewhere in the 400 - 500 S&P range .
Savage Love Cock in a Box
My friend is a gay - identified FTM .
He 's hot , he 's cute , and above the waist , you would never guess what he 's got down below .
We love to kiss and cuddle , and from my end , his blowjobs are great .
The problem is that I have no idea how to reciprocate .
He is n't into anal ( why would he be , without a prostate ? ) , there 's no cock for me to suck , and what he does have down below does n't interest either of us .
Do you have any ideas on how I could turn him on and get him off ?
It 's starting to frustrate me .
Getting bottom work done is a long way off with the current finances .

" Your FTM partner has to become comfortable with his own body before you can attempt to satisfy him sexually , " says Buck Angel , transsexual FTM porn star , aka " the man with a pussy . "
" Your partner will need to share with you what his needs are , " says Buck .
" Nobody should be expected to guess at what his partner wants .
Communication is important , regardless of gender or sexuality . "
I agree 100 percent with Buck — what he said , as they say — but rereading your letter , SFTSLAFI , I 'm thinking there 's a chance your FTM partner is comfortable with his body but he 's painfully aware that you are not .
Up to a certain point , that 's understandable :
You 're a gay guy , not a bi guy , pussy is n't your thing , etc .
But there 's a point at which your aversion to pussy — his pussy — becomes unacceptable .
And you know what ?
If you 're accepting regular blowjobs from this guy , SFTSLAFI , then you 're well past that point .
Maybe it would help if you did n't think of his pussy as pussy .
All fetuses start out as girls — you were a girl once , SFTSLAFI — until the process of sex differentiation kicks in and " masculinizing hormones , " if they 're present , turn little girl fetuses into little boy fetuses , and little fetal pussies into little fetal cocks .
So you know what your FTM boyfriend has down there ?
Pretty much all the same stuff you do .
His clit is analogous to the head of your cock , and his clit has a shaft just like your cock does .
He has ovaries for balls and a clitoral hood for a foreskin , and he's got a piss slit down there somewhere , too .
Think of his pussy as a cock that 's still in the box it came in .
It 's like a cock you got at Ikea — there 's some assembly required , SFTSLAFI , but you can assemble it only in your imagination .
Back to Buck : " Maybe you two should start playing with that part of his body together , " says Buck .
" Perhaps you can try out some fun sex toys .
Or maybe he can masturbate for you , and you will find that hot and want to jump in . "
What 's really important , though , is convincing your FTM boyfriend that you 're not going to freak out when you see him or touch him .
" That fear is why so many FTM guys have a problem dealing with their genitals , " says Buck .
" They are afraid of what other people will think or how they 'll react .
Once you make him feel safe , then I would almost bet that your sex life will explode .
" Also , just because he does n't have a prostate , that is n't the reason he does n't like anal , " continues Buck .
" I know lots of FTM guys and women who love anal sex .
In fact , many FTMs are into anal and do n't even want vaginal sex . "
You can check out Buck — you can check out all of Buck — at www.buckangel.com, where you can also order his porn , which you might find helpful , SFTSLAFI .
" These guys should watch a Buck Angel film while having sex , " says Buck .
" It 'll show him the way some FTMs like to get off and might make him see how hot having sex with an FTM is ! "
I 'm a straight girl who hates all the slang terms for vagina .
Cunt , twat , pussy — first 's too vulgar , second 's too awful , third 's too cute .
And vajayjay ?
Too stupid .
All the best sex - organ slang is reserved for men .
It makes me sad .

Let 's just call 'em all cock then , shall we ?
Your pussy , SFTSLAFI 's boyfriend 's pussy , Buck 's pussy — they 're all cocks in the boxes they came in .
I 'm a 26 - year - old FTM who is interested in seeing what sex with gay men is like .
Although I have identified as heterosexual in the past , I do find something appealing in the idea of being appreciated sexually as a man by men who like men .
I 'm attractive , fit , over average height for a man , and passable — although I am quite slim and look like I 'm about 17 .
I know that gay men find me attractive .
I 'm often cruised , and men have told me that I am good - looking and have expressed interest in me .
In these situations , I 'm usually not out as a tranny .
I have a few hesitations , however .
I 've never had sex with a man .
I do n't know what would be expected of me with the anatomy I 've got .
I 'm worried that those interested in me would see me as a bottom , which simply is n't the case .
Another worry is appearing so young .
I take myself seriously intellectually — presently , I am thriving in medical school — and would like others to do the same .
And all these worries presuppose that there are decent men out there who'd even be interested in my body in a respectful way .
Can you , as a gay man , tell me anything about the gay male community ?
I 'd be grateful .
Curious About Gay Encounters , Yep
The gay male community in a nutshell :
There are some good guys out there , some okay guys , and lots and lots of assholes — pretty much the same as any other community — and there are definitely gay guys out there willing to go there with a cute FTM .
( See the first letter in today 's column ; also , see all the guys who 've banged Buck in his movies . )
To separate the good gays from the bad gays , CAGEY , you 'll have to use your best judgment , the same common sense and bullshit detectors you use with anyone else ; to separate the gay guys who would be up for sleeping with a trans man , all you have to do is be up - front about who you are and what you 're after with the men who cruise you .
As for your youthful appearance :
There will be some " good " guys who'll cruise you and feel terrible about it — meaning , they 'll find you attractive and think , " No , no , no .
He 's way too young . "
These guys will be hugely relieved when they learn you 're actually a 26 - year - old med student .
Finally , CAGEY , do n't concern yourself with expectations .
Just be open and honest about what you 've got , equipment - wise , and what you 're interested in exploring , gay - wise .
Not a bottom ?
Just say so .
It 'll scare off the guys who want to top you , of course , but you do n't want to sleep with them anyway .
I promise you that some of the gay guys who cruise you will be psyched to bottom for you —
I'm assuming that you , a hetero - identified man up to now , already own at least one strap - on , right ? — because it 'll be easier for them to deal with what you 've got down there if you 're strapping on something they 're used to .
My current boyfriend lets me blow him but refuses to go down on me .
I miss oral sex !

After that experience I have difficulty understanding anyone who equates Israel with apartheid South Africa .
What I saw in the Hadassah Mt Scopus hospital was inconceivable in the South Africa where I spent most of my life , growing up and then working as a journalist who specialised in exposing apartheid .
It did n't happen and it could n't happen .
Blacks and whites were strictly separated and blacks got the least and the worst .
And this is only one slice of life .
Buses , post offices , park benches , cinemas , everything , were segregated by law .
No equation is possible .
That is what came to my mind as I read the Guardian 's two - part report this week about Israel and apartheid .
The writer , Chris McGreal , is an outstanding reporter .
I admire his dispatches from Israel / Palestine .
Day by day he honestly and correctly portrays the conflict .
But these articles are disappointing .
He has lost his way in thickets of information .
He has been unable to untangle the confusion and complexities of group relations here .
He is muddled in distinguishing between the situations of Israeli Arabs and West Bank Arabs and Jerusalem Arabs .
It is not that he is wholly wrong .
Arabs suffer severe discrimination .
Israel is in occupation of the West Bank and is responsible for oppressive and ugly actions .
But he fails to explain the why and the wherefore .
He had a choice in deciding how to decipher the situation .
He could have adopted the approach of Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley , well - known Canadian academics specialising in South Africa and the Middle East .
In their book , Seeking Mandela , published last year , they say : " Although Israel and apartheid South Africa are often equated as ' colonial settler societies ' , we argue that the differences outweigh the similarities . "
They warn that the " simplistic assumption that the South African model readily lends itself to export may actually retard necessary new solutions by clinging to visions or processes of negotiation that may not work in another context " .
That assessment is surely far more relevant than quoting the debased views about South Africa and Israel of the late Hendrik Verwoerd , a father of apartheid , as McGreal has strangely done .
McGreal had to decide whether the glass is half - full or half - empty .
His approach could have been that here is a tiny country which came into being , in the shadow of the Holocaust , less than 58 years ago .
It has been under continual attack since the start and is still beset by enemies sworn to its destruction , whether Islamic Jihad and Hamas through suicide bombings , the Arab states through their refusal to recognise its existence , the recent " wipe - out " call by Iran 's president , or the actions and declarations of a mixed bag of malevolent forces , anti-semites and semi-Jews .
That induces a siege mentality among Israel 's Jews .
They fight to live and do not always do it pleasantly .
They make horrible mistakes and inflict suffering on others .
It is not secret .
I do not know why Chris McGreal says the Israeli public is unaware of what is happening : newspapers publish the details in profusion , provoking discussion and action .
Yes , racism does exist in Israel - directed against Arabs , and also among Jews .
Amir Peretz , new leader of the Labour party , is said to be having problems with western - born Ashkenazi voters because he is Moroccan - born and Sephardic .
An explanation offered for the police violence in clearing the Amona outpost last week was the antagonism between the protesting young people , who were mainly religious Ashkenazi , and the police , who were a mixture of Moroccan and Russian immigrant stock , Bedouin and Druze .
Is Israel so different from other countries that struggle to come to terms with their minority groups ?
Why depict this country as a chamber of horrors like no other in the world ?
The glass is indeed half - full .
In South Africa , change for the better was simply not possible : the apartheid system had to be eradicated .
In contrast , change is possible in Israel .
An accusation by a member of the Knesset , Ahmed Tibi , who is Arab , that the central Bank of Israel had a discriminatory employment policy with no Arabs among its 800 staffers , drew the assurance from the bank's then governor that tenders would be advertised in the Arab - language press .
He added : " Bank of Israel hires according to criteria of merit , and ignores differences in religion , sex , race or nationality . "
Tibi also complained that the state monopoly Israel Electric did not employ Arabs ; a start has since been made with the hiring of six Arabs .
There is continual progress : the evidence is there if you want to see it .
The first Arab was appointed to the high court of justice two years ago .
Last year , for the first time , an Arab was appointed director - general of a government ministry .
McGreal notes that inside Israel , 93 % of the land is reserved for Jews while South Africa 's whites kept 87 % of the land for themselves .
Thus Israel and apartheid South Africa are the same .
But the QED is not as straightforward as his citing of these figures would have us believe .
In law , land in Israel is open to everyone but , yes , in practice , through legal stratagems , 93 % of the land has been only for Jews .
This , however , has been breached by the Arab Ka'adan family : in a 10 - year legal struggle , they have established their right to buy land and build a home in the " Jewish " community settlement of Katzir in northern Israel .
The high court of justice has given a precedent - setting decision that the state cannot discriminate on the basis of religion or nationality when allocating state land to Israeli citizens .
The case has dragged on but final success is in sight .
Other court actions are underway .
Land exemplifies both the negative and positive aspects of the lives of Israel 's Arabs : it conveys the discrimination - and the movement towards change ; slow , slow , but underway .
On education , McGreal states that separate and unequal education systems were a central part of the apartheid regime 's strategy to limit black children to manual and service jobs - something I observed firsthand and fought against in South Africa .
But I have to question his reference to what he says is the current belief among Arab parents that their children 's schools are deliberately starved of state resources so that Arabs will be doomed to lesser jobs .
Every government school , whether Jewish or Arab , gets identical funding ; differences , and hence resources , arise through what parents pay and what local authorities pay ( most local authorities in Israel are in poor financial shape ; Arab local authorities are even worse off with problems in collecting local property taxes ) .
The Jewish schools are Jewish day schools .
The Arab schools are Muslim and use Arabic , which is an official language in Israel .
There is no bar to Arabs attending Jewish schools , and some do .
I am also puzzled by the health ministry figures that McGreal has chosen to use about state spending on development of health facilities in Arab areas ( the clear implication being that Arabs are starved of health care ) .
Contrary to the picture painted , health is a visible indicator of the differences between apartheid South Africa and Israel .
In South Africa , the infant mortality rate ( IMR ) in 1985 was 78 per 1,000 live births .
Among colour groups : whites 12 , Asians 20 , coloureds 60 , blacks 94 to 150 .
In Israel , in the 1950s , the IMR among Muslims was 60.6 and among Jews 38.8 .
Major improvements occurred in health care during the 1990s and by 2001 the IMR among Arabs was 7.6 ( Muslims 8.2 , Christians 2.6 , Druze 4.7 ) .
Among Jews , 4.1 .
According to the health ministry , the higher Muslim figure was due mainly to genetic defects as a result of marriages between close relatives ; poverty is also a factor .
Other countries in 2000 : Switzerland , 8.2 , and 12.3 for Turks living there ; United States , whites 8.5 , blacks 21.3 .
He is also mistaken in saying that Arabs have been singled out for discrimination in getting reduced child allowances .
They are the same as Jewish ultra-Orthodox families .
These two groups have the largest number of children and have suffered equally from cutbacks in allowances , especially for the fifth child and beyond .
Here in Jerusalem on Monday , I watched the BBC's Auschwitz on television .
The episode dealt with French collaboration in delivering Jews to the Nazis for destruction , and how British policemen on Guernsey handed over three Jewish women .
It was a reminder , if any be needed , of why Israel exists : to fulfil the centuries - old dream of a homeland for Jews and as a sanctuary for Jews .
It 's not a perfect society .
It struggles to find itself as a Jewish state ( with no consensus about what that means ) , and it struggles to evolve as a democratic society with full rights for minorities .
It deserves criticism for its flaws and mistakes .
It also merits sympathy and support in facing unfounded attack .
